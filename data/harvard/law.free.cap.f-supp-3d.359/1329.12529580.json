Legal Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In antidumping proceedings involving non-market economies, Commerce generally calculates normal value using the factors of production used to produce the subject merchandise and other costs and expenses. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1). Commerce will value respondents' factors of production using the \"best available information regarding the values of such factors in a market economy country or countries considered to be appropriate by [Commerce].\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1)(B). As the term \"best available information\" is not statutorily defined, Commerce has\n   broad discretion in deciding what constitutes the best available information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    QVD Food Co. v.

That statement conflates subsections 1677e(a) and (b) and obfuscates the findings Commerce had to, and did, make to impose a CVD.

The statute does not authorize Commerce to impose CVDs because a party fails to cooperate.

Therefore, Commerce cannot now say that it did not make a finding of an export subsidy, because (i) it had to have made a finding of specificity to satisfy the statute, (ii) it is reasonably discernible that it found that the export buyer's credit program was contingent upon exports,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CVD Investigation Final Decision Memo at 30, and (iii) it only invoked an adverse inference to find that the respondents used, i.e., benefited from, the program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201677\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201677\">\n    90-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant's argument that Commerce changed its practice with respect to offsetting CVDs calculated on the basis of AFA also relies upon its conflation of subsections 1677e(a) and (b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp.

Again, Defendant starts with the premise that Commerce may impose CVDs simply as an adverse inference. However, Commerce does not impose a CVD as a result of an adverse inference.

Commerce clearly explains that the issue on verification during the CVD investigation was whether respondents used the export buyer's credit program.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    CVD Investigation Final Decision Memo at 91-94. There is no indication that Commerce could not verify whether the export buyer's credit program was, in law or in fact, continent upon export during the CVD investigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Finally, even if Commerce used an adverse inference to determine that the export buyer's credit program was an export subsidy and the term could be construed as ambiguous, Commerce failed to explain why its current practice is a reasonable interpretation of the statute. Where goods are subject to both antidumping duties and countervailing duties, the statute requires Commerce to increase the export or constructed export price by \"the amount of any countervailing duty imposed on the subject merchandise under part I of this subtitle to offset an export subsidy[.]\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(C). The statutory language focuses on the purpose of the CVD, i.e., whether it was imposed to offset an export subsidy. If Commerce determines that a program is an export subsidy after resorting to AFA, it would not change the fact that it was imposed for the purpose of offsetting the export subsidy. It is not apparent to the court why a practice of not offsetting a CVD imposed on an export subsidy after a determination based on AFA would be reasonable and Commerce has not explained why it would be reasonable. Defendant contends that Commerce explained the change in its practice in prior determinations and that Trina was on notice of the change starting approximately a year prior to the issuance of the\n    <em>\n     Final Results\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Resp. Br. at 24-27 (citing Decision Mem. for the Prelim. Determination in the [ADD] Investigation of Stainless Steel Sheet &amp; Strip from the [PRC] at 13, A-570-042, (Sept. 9, 2016),\n    <em>\n     available at\n    </em>\n    http://ia.ita.doc.gov/frn/summary/prc/2016-22397-1.pdf (last visited Jan. 18, 2019); Circular Welded Carbon-Quality Steel Pipe from Pakistan: Affirmative Prelim.

The determinations Commerce cites in support of its change in practice do not provide an explanation for why the change in practice is reasonable. Each of these determinations simply asserts that a change in practice has occurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Trina also argues that the risk of introducing error by including the reported zero-quantities outweighs the possibility that the zero-quantities can be explained by rounding. This argument is not supported by record evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Trina also contends that the final determinations Commerce cites in support of its practice are incomparable because they address debt restructuring as a financial expense for purposes of calculating the cost of production, and not as part of indirect selling expenses.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Trina Pls.' Br. at 12-17; Trina's Reply Br. at 15. It is reasonably discernable that Commerce, to avoid distortions by either overcounting or undercounting, requires parties to demonstrate that the debt restructuring income claimed is tied to a specific POR or POI, notwithstanding what the income offsets.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Trina contends that Commerce's determination is unsupported by substantial evidence because record evidence does not demonstrate that the debt restructuring income was not tied to the relevant POR. Trina Pls.' Br. at 13. Trina's argument misplaces the burden for production of relevant information on Commerce and wrongly presumes that just because debt restructuring income can offset indirect selling expenses it automatically qualifies as an offset. As Commerce explains, although TUS's debt restructuring income \"could be considered an offset to indirect selling expenses,\" Commerce's practice is to require the party seeking the adjustment to substantiate its request by demonstrating that the income is tied to the relevant POR or POI to avoid distortion. Final Decision Memo at 27. The court cannot say that Commerce's practice is unreasonable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
