Specifically, Mr. Ramachandran cites the October 12 notice, which states: \"Discrimination due to ethnic origin, bias, unequal treatment, retaliation, harassment, conspiracy and collusion to contravene the Code and/or apply or enforce it unequally, misconduct, abuse of office, all resulting in damage to my property and its value, my enjoyment of my property, physical &amp; emotional &amp; mental distress, other damages.\" Dkt. No. 61, Ex. B at 3. This is indeed a very general description of Mr. Ramachandran's claims-so general, in fact, that it fails to provide sufficient notice of bases for his emotional distress claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    As defendants correctly observe, Mr. Ramachandran's notices do not describe any of the conduct on which he appears to base his claim, except for a discussion of how the Jacobses' project violates the city's building code. Although the notices mention \"emotional and mental distress\" such that Los Altos arguably was on notice that Mr. Ramachandran might contend it\n    was responsible for that harm, the notices contain no information that would have permitted the city to investigate the bases for Mr. Ramachandran's claim for emotional distress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Mr. Ramachandran contends that defendants waived any defense regarding the sufficiency of his notices to Los Altos. Specifically, Mr. Ramachandran relies on\n    <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20911\">\n     Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7 911\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , which provides that a public entity waives any defense as to the sufficiency of a claim based upon a defect or omission in the claim as presented if the entity fails to give the complainant notice of insufficiency as to that defect or omission. Section 911 concerns defects or omissions as provided in section 910.8, including a failure to comply with section 910's requirement that a complainant provide their name and address; address where notices should be sent; the date, place and other circumstances of the occurrence giving rise to the claim; a general description of the injury or loss; the name(s) of the employee(s) causing the injury or loss; and the amount claimed if less than $ 10,000. Mr. Ramachandran's argument, however, misses the point. Because his GTCA claim notices failed to include the facts on which he now relies in support of his emotional distress claim, it is difficult to imagine how Los Altos could have given him notice of the need to include those facts, such that its failure to do so now amounts to a waiver of the notice requirement.\n    <em>\n     Progressive Solutions\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%208294287\">\n     2017 WL 8294287\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *9 (\"[Plaintiff]'s pre-litigation communications with the City simply did not include the facts relevant to its misappropriation of trade secrets cause of action.

In\n     <em>\n      O'Donnell\n     </em>\n     , the Supreme Court faced two separate claims for relief, general negligence and violation of the Safety Appliance Act-not multiple theories supporting a single claim for relief.\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3941993\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/384/\">\n      338 U.S. at 393\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3941993\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/338/384/\">\n      70 S.Ct. 200\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (\"[W]e think it almost indispensable to an intelligible charge to the jury that a clear separation of the two kinds of actions be observed and impressed. The trial court in this case submitted the whole indiscriminately as a negligence case.\"). The Court denies defendants' motion to dismiss claim 2 on this ground.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"5\">\n    <p id=\"p-107\">\n     At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, Mr. Ramachandran advised the Court that he has identified additional facts and legal theories in support of claims 1 and 2. He did not include any of these new facts or theories in his opposition to defendants' motion. The Court strongly disapproves of such tactics.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-108\">\n     Defendants refer to this statute in their briefs as the \"California Government Claims Act.\"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-109\">\n     To the extent Mr. Ramachandran asserts claim 4 against defendants in their official capacities as employees of Los Altos, the city would be liable for their acts or omissions.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20815.2\">\n      Cal.

Defendants filed their evidentiary objections separately instead of including them in their reply brief as Civil Local Rule 7-3(c) requires.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
