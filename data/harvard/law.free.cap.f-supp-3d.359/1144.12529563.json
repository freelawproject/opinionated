BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   TriNet Group, Inc. (\"TriNet\" or \"Plaintiff\") is a professional employer organization (\"PEO\"). (Dkt. 28 at \u00b6 1) In 2009, TriNet acquired Gevity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2) TriNet brings this action as a successor-in-interest to Gevity, regarding Gevity's federal income tax returns from 2004 through 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4) During these years, Gevity was a publicly traded company operating as a PEO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5) Gevity was headquartered in and licensed by the state of Florida as an employee leasing company under Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 468.520 -.535. (Dkt. 31 at \u00b6 2) As a PEO, Gevity provided services to small and medium sized businesses, including payroll processing, employment tax services, access to health and welfare benefits, workers' compensation coverage, and human resource services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3) With each client company, Gevity entered into a standardized professional services agreement (\"PSA\"), in which it agreed to perform those human resource and payroll services in exchange for a professional services fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6) Pursuant to the PSAs, the client companies remained responsible for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 \"Compensating employees for their work, providing benefits, and determining paid time-off policies;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 \"Hiring and termination decisions;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 \"Managing and supervising the day-to-day work of employees; providing training and development opportunities; and providing performance appraisals and appropriate salary adjustments;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 \"Delivering rewards and incentives;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 \"Informing employees of their benefit options;\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 \"Running [the] business and making business decisions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8) Gevity was required under the PSAs to provide its clients with invoices for the amounts due each pay period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11) Gevity's invoices were payable immediately\n   upon receipt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12) The amounts due included the gross wages of the clients' employees (\"worksite employees\"), including employment taxes, Gevity's service fee, employer contributions to any benefit plans, and fees for any other services not covered by Gevity's service fee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9) The PSAs specified that payment to Gevity must be made through \"wire transfer, Automated Clearing House (\"ACH\") transfer, or other method acceptable to Gevity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10) Gevity's obligation to process and issue paychecks in accordance with its clients' instructions was typically provided in a separate schedule attached to the PSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13) Some of the PSAs included form language in which Gevity agreed to pay the wages of the worksite employees without regard to payment from the client. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With respect to employment taxes, Gevity agreed to comply with all laws and regulations and be responsible for and pay all costs related to \"the reporting, collection and payment of federal and state [employment] taxes on wages paid\" to worksite employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Gevity's Payroll Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The worksite employees earned wages at least one week prior to the date that Gevity paid the wages (the \"pay date\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18) Gevity required a representative of the client company to report to Gevity the number of hours each worksite employee worked, whether any new hires or terminations occurred, any changes in the rate of pay for each worksite employee, and any tips received by any worksite employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19) Generally the representative reported this information the next business day following the closure of a pay period, which was two or three days before the pay date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The client company either entered this information into Gevity's electronic payroll system or Gevity entered it with the client's approval, if the client provided the information via fax or telephone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20) Once the payroll information was entered into Gevity's payroll system, Gevity calculated the payroll, including employment taxes, and generated an invoice and payroll register. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Clients paid Gevity's invoices in one of four ways: ACH debit, wire transfer, certified check, or company check. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25) Approximately seventy-five percent of Gevity's client companies paid Gevity through ACH debit, which made it the most common method of payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26) An inherent lag existed in Gevity's payroll process with respect to ACH debit payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17) In ACH transactions, Gevity initiated a debit from the client company's account for the full payroll amount, including all wages, taxes, and fees two days prior to the pay date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27) Within one day of the ACH debit, Gevity received a \"provisional credit\" in its account that could be reversed at any time within a five business day period if the client company did not have sufficient funds to satisfy the debit or for certain other reasons, such as if the client company put a \"stop payment\" on the ACH debit or the client company's account was frozen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28) Gevity did not receive notice when the ACH debits cleared. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29) If an ACH debit did not clear, however, Gevity would learn that the debit did not clear within three to five business days through a report that it requested from its bank that showed deposits that were returned for insufficient funds and for other reasons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, Gevity would not know whether the ACH debit had cleared until at least one day after making the wage payments to the worksite employees. If the ACH debit did not clear, Gevity would then send the report to its client service team for collection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For payment by wire transfer, the client company initiated the wire transfer to Gevity's bank account upon receipt of the invoice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30) The wired funds were immediately available without a delay for the wire to clear. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Clients that paid Gevity with certified checks or company checks provided those checks directly to a Gevity branch location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31) Funds paid by certified check were immediately available upon deposit without any delay for the check to clear. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32) Funds paid by company check, however, were not immediately available and, similar to ACH debits, took three to five business days to clear. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Gevity paid wages to the worksite employees from its own bank accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15) The client companies did not have access to or authority over any of Gevity's bank accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16) Specifically, on the pay date, Gevity paid the net amount of each worksite employee's paycheck for each payroll period through either direct deposit via debit against Gevity's own bank accounts or a paper check drawn on Gevity's bank accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22) To complete its payroll process, Gevity deposited with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") federal employment taxes with respect to wages paid to the worksite employees in accordance with applicable federal laws and regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23) As required by the IRS's next-day deposit rules, Gevity remitted payroll taxes on an accelerated basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Gevity's Forms 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Returns\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Gevity filed IRS Forms 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Returns for the tax quarters ending March 31, 2004 through June 30, 2009, (\"Forms 941\"), using its own name, address, and Employer Identification Number (\"EIN\"). (Dkt. 31 at \u00b6 34) Therein, Gevity reported: (1) the number of employees, including worksite employees (Gevity's clients' employees) and non-worksite employees (Gevity's corporate employees), that received wages, tips, and other compensation for the tax period from Gevity; (2) the amount of wages, tips, and other compensation Gevity paid to the employees; (3) the federal income tax withheld from those wages, tips, and other compensation; (4) social security and Medicare taxes due on the reported wages, tips, and other compensation; and (5) the total tax due for the corresponding tax quarter. (Dkt. 28 at \u00b6 10; Dkt. 31 at \u00b6 35) Gevity was not required to and did not report that it operated as a PEO on the Forms 941. (Dkt. 28 at \u00b6 12) During the years at issue, the IRS did not have any published procedures unique to PEOs for the processing of federal tax deposits or Forms 941. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25) The IRS processed Gevity's Forms 941 without making a determination as to the accuracy of the information reported therein or making a determination of whether Gevity was a common law employer or statutory employer. (Dkt. 31 at \u00b6 36; Dkt. 28 at \u00b6 32)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Gevity made federal tax deposits of the payroll taxes reported on the Forms 941 during the years at issue using its own name and EIN. (Dkt. 31 at \u00b6 41) A taxpayer such as Gevity with accumulated federal employment tax above a threshold amount of $ 100,000 or more a day during a deposit period, was required to make next-day deposits, as opposed to monthly or semi-weekly deposits. (Dkt. 28 at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17) During the quarterly tax periods at issue, the IRS accepted tax deposits from Gevity, including the next-day deposits, submitted through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (\"EFTPS\") or deposited with a financial institution authorized to accept federal tax deposits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18) Gevity made the EFTPS tax deposits from its own bank accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. FICA Tip Credit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Gevity also filed Forms 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Returns, for the 2004 through 2009 tax years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45) To claim the employer social security tax credit provided in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 45B (the \"FICA tip credit\"), Gevity attached Forms 3800, General Business Credit and Forms 8846, Credit for Employer Social Security and Medicare Taxes Paid on Certain Employee Tips. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46) During the tax years at issue, Gevity claimed for itself, not as a pass through to its clients, the FICA tip credit with respect to worksite employees who received tip income at 274 to 477 client companies per year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47) In total, Gevity claimed the FICA tip credit in connection with the payroll taxes that it paid for over 1,170 individual client companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The IRS processed these forms without challenging their accuracy or making any determination as to whether Gevity was a common law employer or a statutory employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 48-50) Gevity rebated some of the FICA tip credit it received back to the client companies for which it provided payroll services to during the years at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 29 at 7; Dkt. 35 at 5 n.4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Eventually, the IRS examined Gevity's tax filings and disallowed the FICA tip credits claimed by Gevity during the years at issue based on its determination that Gevity was not the common law employer or statutory employer of the worksite employees for FICA tax purposes. (Dkt. 31 at \u00b6 53) Thus, the IRS issued notices of deficiency to Gevity for the tax years at issue with respect to the FICA tip credits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-55) Gevity promptly paid these amounts by check to avoid the IRS's collection actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57) Gevity then filed IRS Forms 1120-X, Amended U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return seeking refunds of the amounts paid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58) The IRS disallowed Gevity's claims for refunds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 28, 2016, within two years of the IRS' disallowing the refund claims at issue, Gevity brought this action seeking a refund of an alleged overpayment of federal income tax in the amount of $ 10,567,468, plus interest. (Dkts. 1, 31 at \u00b6 61) On February 27, 2018, the Parties filed cross motions for summary judgment to determine the issue of whether Gevity was a statutory employer for purposes of claiming the FICA tip credit. (Dkts. 29, 30) For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that Gevity was the statutory employer of the worksite employees during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

More specifically it argues that Gevity does not fit the definition of a \u00a7 3401(d)(1) employer because the client companies, and not Gevity, controlled the payment of the worksite employees' wages during the years at issue. (Dkt. 29 at 15-16) The Government argues that Gevity, as a PEO, was merely a conduit for the wage and employment tax payments of its client companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16) In support, the Government points out that, according to the PSAs, the client companies, or the common law employers, were responsible for,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , \"compensating employees for their work\" and providing Gevity with funds to pay the worksite employees and associated taxes prior to or on the date that the wages were paid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16) The Government argues that Gevity's policy was not to complete the delivery process of payrolls to clients until funding was first received; therefore, the client companies had control over the wage payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16) Although these arguments were addressed in\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   , the Government provides four reasons to support\n   its contention that this Court should not follow the\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, the Government argues that\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   broadens \u00a7 3401(d)(1) beyond its intended scope by allowing it to extend beyond \"special or unusual circumstances\" to \"common, routine business practices, such as the use of a PEO to issue paychecks and remit employment taxes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18) The Government cites to the Code of Federal Regulations \u00a7 31.3401(d)-1, and the example provided therein, to support this argument. Section 31.3401(d)-1(f) states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   If the person for whom the services are or were performed does not have legal control of the payment of the wages for such services, the term\n   <em>\n    employer\n   </em>\n   means (except for the purpose of the definition of\n   <em>\n    wages\n   </em>\n   ) the person having such control. For example, where wages, such as certain types of pensions or retired pay, are paid by a trust and the person for whom the services were performed has no legal control over the payment of such wages, the trust is the\n   <em>\n    employer.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2031.3401\">\n    26 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.3401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)-1(f) (emphasis in original). Section 31.3401(d)-1(h) of the regulations also states that \"[t]he special definitions of the term\n   <em>\n    employer\n   </em>\n   in ... this section are designed solely to meet special and unusual situations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2031.3401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 31.3401(d)-1(h) (emphasis in original). Thus, the Government contends that \u00a7 3401(d)(1) applies only in the special or unusual situation in which a common law employer does not have legal control of the funds because it \"relinquishes complete control over the funds used to pay wages to a third party.\" (Dkt. 29 at 18) Notably, the example from the regulation does not define \"legal control.\" Further, as pointed out by Plaintiff, the Government does not cite any authority that prohibits a PEO making wage payments for worksite employees of a client company from its bank accounts, over which the client company has no control, from being a special and unusual circumstance as contemplated by the regulation. (Dkt. 33 at 12-13) Plaintiff also notes that retirement and pension trusts, like PEOs, are not uncommon and are generally required to be prefunded by employers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the Government's \"special and unusual circumstances\" argument does not persuade the Court that\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, the Government contends that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   erroneously disregarded the timing of the plaintiffs' receipt of funds from their clients when it limited the inquiry solely to whether the plaintiffs controlled the bank account from which wages are paid. (Dkt. 29 at 19) As argued by the Government, control over the bank account is merely a relevant factor when determining whether a taxpayer is a \u00a7 3401(d)(1) employer, and not dispositive of the employer inquiry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rather, the Government argues that Gevity is the statutory employer \"only if it paid wages prior to and without regard to payment from its clients.\" (Dkt. 29 at 21) The Government points to\n   <em>\n    Garami\n   </em>\n   and In re Professional Security Services in support of the proposition that \"when a third party receives payment from the common law employer prior to or contemporaneously with the payment of wages, courts have held that third party is not the \u00a7 3401(d)(1) employer.\" (Dkt. 29 at 20) However, as explained in\n   <em>\n    Total Employment\n   </em>\n   , this argument misstates the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Garami\n   </em>\n   and In re Professional Security Services, which found only that the common law employer remains liable when it contracts with a third party to pay employment taxes. Those cases did not find that a third party was not also liable if it were deemed to be the \u00a7 3401(d)(1) employer. The timing argument was not disregarded by\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   ; rather, it was squarely considered and rejected by the court as discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202692843\">\n    2017 WL 2692843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. The Court follows\n   <em>\n    Paychex's\n   </em>\n   well-reasoned analysis on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Government also cites\n   <em>\n    Winstead v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834222\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/989/\">\n    109 F.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1997), to support its timing argument. (Dkt. 29 at 19-20)\n   <em>\n    Winstead\n   </em>\n   involved sharecropping agreements whereby a landowner paid the wages of his tenant farmers' day laborers from his account directly and subsequently deducted those wages from the tenant farmers' share of the profits once the crop was sold.\n   <em>\n    Winstead\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834222\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/989/\">\n    109 F.3d at 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In determining whether the landowner was the \u00a7 3401(d)(1) employer, however, the Fourth Circuit did not appear to consider the fact that wage payments were made prior to the landowner's receipt of funds from the tenant farmers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834222\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rather, the court reasoned that \"[s]ince Winstead paid the day laborers directly from his checking account and the sharecroppers had no authority over this account, he would appear to fit squarely within the 3401(d)(1) exception.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834222\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834222\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/989/\">\n    at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Government's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Winstead\n   </em>\n   is misplaced, and this case actually supports Plaintiff's argument that an entity that has control over the accounts from which wages are paid can be deemed a statutory employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Even if the Court were to accept the Government's argument that timing of the wage payments relative to payment by the clients is a factor in the Court's determination, the Court finds that under the facts of this case, Plaintiff would still qualify as the statutory employer. Although Gevity's policy was clearly and admittedly to try to obtain payment from its client companies prior to or as close as possible to payment of wages to employees, (Dkt. 33 at 5), it is undisputed that, like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   , Gevity's ACH transactions resulted in an \"inherent lag\" in which Gevity was vulnerable to non-payment in over seventy-five percent of its transactions. (Dkt. 31 at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 26-29) Specifically, in ACH debit transactions, which made up approximately seventy-five percent of transactions, Gevity debited the client companies' accounts two days prior to the pay date, and it did not learn whether the ACH debits had cleared until three to five days later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-29) Thus, Gevity paid the worksite employees' wages at a minimum of one day prior to confirming that payment had cleared. If payment did not clear, Gevity proceeded to collect from the client companies, with no guarantee of success. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29) Thus, in practice, Gevity frequently paid the worksite employees in advance of cleared payment by the client companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Third, the Government argues that\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   ignores the economic reality that the client companies controlled the payment of wages because they were the source of the funds from which the wages were paid. (Dkt. 29 at 22-23) Since the client companies provided Gevity with the funding prior to the pay date, the Government argues that Gevity was merely a conduit for the employer's wage payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This \"mere conduit\" argument was addressed and rejected by\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   , which relied on the analyses of\n   <em>\n    Total Employment\n   </em>\n   , as well as a Second Circuit decision,\n   <em>\n    Educational Fund of the Electrical Industry v.

Without any authority to support the Government's position that the source of the funding is relevant to the Court's inquiry on this matter, the Court declines to adopt it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Government also rehashes its \"exclusive control\" argument, addressed by the court in\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, the Government contends that if the common law employer and a third party share control over the payment of wages, there can be no \u00a7 3401(d)(1) employer. (Dkt. 32 at 11-13) In support, the Government relies on\n   <em>\n    Century Indem. Co. v. Riddell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165135\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/317/681/\">\n    317 F.2d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir 1963), but again this reliance is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit found that a third-party surety was not a statutory employer for tax purposes when the surety made job payments from a joint account to which a contractor, which was the common law employer, also had access.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165135\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/317/681/\">\n    317 F.2d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit reasoned that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [j]oint control of a trust account into which all contract payments are required to be deposited, even from the inception of a contract job as in this case, which still leaves the common law employer in control of all the incidents of employment except the requirement of the concurrence of its bonding surety on checks for withdrawals from such account, does not have the dual effect ... of establishing (1) that the contractor 'does not have control of the payment of the wages', and (2) that the surety, whose concurrence is required, does have such 'control of the payment of such wages.' Here, neither has sole control, but neither is the subcontractor without any such control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165135\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/317/681/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since both the common law employer and the third-party surety had joint access to and control over the accounts from which payments were made, the surety was not the statutory employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165135\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/317/681/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   merely held that a common law employer could not absolve itself from its general tax responsibilities by its voluntary action of giving a third party joint control over an account into which job payments are to be made.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"165135\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/317/681/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   did not foreclose the possibility that in a situation where the third party had exclusive control over the account from which the wages were paid, both a common law employer and a statutory employer could be the \"employer\" for federal tax purposes. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Riddell\n   </em>\n   is in line with the holding in\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, the Government argues that\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   should be disregarded because it relies on\n   <em>\n    Total Employment\n   </em>\n   , which, according to the Government, \"erroneously\n   relied on state law to conclude that an employee leasing company was a statutory employer\" and \"erroneously endorsed the 'co-employment' model.\" (Dkt. 29 at 23-24) This argument lacks merit.\n   <em>\n    Total Employment\n   </em>\n   did address an argument raised by the defendant based on the language of Florida Statute \u00a7 468.525 and did discuss the obligations of Florida-licensed employee leasing companies to contractually assume responsibility for the payment of wages and payroll for their clients.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278405\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/305/333/\">\n    305 B.R. at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, its ultimate finding that an employee leasing company was the statutory employer was also based on a thorough analysis of federal case law interpreting \u00a7 3401(d)(1).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278405\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/305/333/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278405\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/305/333/\">\n    at 337-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Among others,\n   <em>\n    Total Employment\n   </em>\n   relied on a case from the United States Court of Federal Claims,\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Flooring Services v.

Again, the Court follows the well-reasoned analysis of\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Total Employment\n   </em>\n   , and the relevant cases cited therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Thus, for the reasons discussed, the Court follows the well-reasoned analysis of\n   <em>\n    Paychex\n   </em>\n   and holds that Gevity was the statutory employer under \u00a7 3401(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Certified Professional Employer Organization Statutes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In its reply in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment, the Government raises an additional argument to support its position that Gevity is not a \u00a7 3401(d)(1) statutory employer based on the 2014 enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 3511 and 7705 of the IRC, which create the certified professional employer organization (\"CPEO\"). (Dkt. 34 at 8-10) Under this statutory and regulatory framework, a CPEO is an organization certified by the IRS as meeting certain requirements and is permitted to hold itself out as such.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7705. Although CPEOs are recognized as employers for federal tax purposes, they are not entitled to many of the tax credits that are available to common law employers, including the FICA tip credit.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (\"such credit with respect to a work site employee performing services for the customer applies to the customer, not the [CPEO.]\"). From this, the Government apparently infers that Congress was evincing an intent to preclude all PEOs from receiving the FICA tip credit. This argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   First, the statute is silent regarding whether non-certified PEOs or other entities that otherwise meet the definition of a statutory employer under \u00a7 3401(d)(1) are precluded from claiming the FICA tip credit. Instead, the statute speaks volumes of Congress's ability to preclude an entity from benefitting from the tip credit: when that is Congress's intent, it simply says so in its statutes and rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Government next argues that the CPEO framework will be undermined if the Court finds that a PEO that controls the account from which wages are paid is the \u00a7 3401(d)(1) employer. (Dkt. 34 at 8-10) Specifically, the Government contends that if the Court holds that Gevity was a statutory employer for purposes of collecting the FICA tip credit, this will result in both non-certified PEOs and CPEOs being recognized as \"employers\" for federal tax purposes, with PEOs being able to claim tax credits that CPEOs are not able to claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the Government argues that PEOs will have little incentive to seek CPEO status. The Court rejects this argument as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Preliminarily, the Court notes that the CPEO statutes are new pronouncements of law that became effective on December 19, 2014, significantly post-dating the relevant time period in the instant case, 2004 to 2009.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203511\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7705. Nowhere within the statutory framework does it state that these provisions apply retroactively. Ordinarily there is a presumption \"against retroactive legislation, under which courts read laws as prospective in application unless Congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity.\"\n   <em>\n    Vartelas v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188982\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/257/#p266\">\n    566 U.S. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188982\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/257/#p266\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188982\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/257/#p266\">\n    182 L.Ed.2d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (citing\n   <em>\n    Landgraf v. USI Film Products\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147362\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/244/#p263\">\n    511 U.S. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 263,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147362\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/244/#p263\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147362\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/244/#p263\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) ). The Government seemingly recognizes this and offers no argument on this point. Thus, even if the statutes do apply to PEOs directly or indirectly, which they do not, because they post-date the relevant time period in this case and it does not appear that Congress intended them to apply retroactively, they are of no concern to resolution of this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivers v. Roadway Exp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147463\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/298/#p313\">\n    511 U.S. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147463\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/298/#p313\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147463\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/298/#p313\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) (\"Even when Congress intends to supersede a rule of law embodied in one of our decisions with what it views as a better rule established in earlier decisions, its intent to reach conduct preceding the \"corrective\" amendment must clearly appear.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, the fact that Congress expressly delineated that CPEOs are not entitled to the FICA tip credit suggests that absent such a proscription they would, by their characteristics, be entitled to receive the credit. Absent such a statutory limitation on PEOs, courts are left to examine whether such entities have control of the payment of the wages under \u00a7 3401(d)(1) in order to determine whether an entity is an \"employer\" entitled to claim the FICA tip credit. If an entity does exhibit the requisites and is not otherwise prohibited from receiving the FICA tip credit, it is entitled to receive it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 45B ; (Dkt. 29 at 13-14; Dkt. 30 at 14). Plainly, the CPEO statutes post-date the relevant time period in this case, have no retroactive preclusive application, and do not apply to a non-CPEO such as Gevity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

(Dkt. 35 at 5 n.4) The Government acknowledges that Gevity refunded the FICA tip credits claimed to some of its larger clients as a marketing strategy to close sales and retain relationships. (Dkt. 29 at 7)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Government appealed the\n    <em>\n     Paychex\n    </em>\n    decision and subsequently voluntarily dismissed that appeal without explanation. (Dkt. 40-1) The Government informed the Court that its dismissal of the appeal in\n    <em>\n     Paychex\n    </em>\n    has \"no impact on its position in this matter,\" and it maintains that\n    <em>\n     Paychex\n    </em>\n    was wrongly decided. (Dkt. 41)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Plaintiff also contends that Gevity was legally required to pay wages to the worksite employees without regard to whether it would be reimbursed by the client companies under Florida Statute \u00a7 468.525. (Dkt. 30 at 5) Florida Statute \u00a7 468.525(4)(b)-(c) provides as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    The employee leasing company's contractual arrangements with its client companies shall satisfy the following conditions, whereby the leasing company:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    (b) Assumes responsibility for the payment of wages to the leased employees without regard to payments by the client to the leasing company.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    (c) Assumes full responsibility for the payment of payroll taxes and collection of taxes from payroll on leased employees.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20468.525\">\n     Fla. Stat. \u00a7 468.525\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (4)(b)-(c). While it is undisputed that Gevity was licensed under this statute, the Government disputes that Gevity PSAs actually included these obligations. It points out that only some of Gevity's PSAs contained language requiring Gevity to pay wages regardless of payment from the client, and the PSAs that did contain this language were internally inconsistent because they also provided that Gevity could remove a worksite employee from its payroll if a client company informed Gevity that it was unable to pay. (Dkt. 32 at 3-4) The Court finds that whether Gevity was statutorily or contractually obligated to pay the wages without regard to the client companies prior payment is immaterial because the Court has already found that this was, in fact, Gevity's practice due to the payroll lag which occurred by default in most of Gevity's transactions as discussed. Moreover, whether Gevity paid the worksite employees' wages prior to and without regard to payment by its client companies is not the standard for determining whether Gevity had \"control of the payment of such wages\" under \u00a7 3401(d)(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    It appears that this argument was not raised by the Government in\n    <em>\n     Paychex\n    </em>\n    , as the CPEO statutes are mentioned for the first time by the\n    <em>\n     Paychex\n    </em>\n    court in a footnote in its order denying the Government's motion for reconsideration.\n    <em>\n     Paychex Bus.
