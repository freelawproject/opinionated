Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. FairWay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in 2006, the parties discussed plans for creating \"a series of affiliated domestic and foreign companies\" referred to by Plaintiff as \"The FairWay Group\" (\"FairWay\"), to monetize intellectual property (the \"FairWay IP\") developed by Plaintiff \"for pricing offerings of securities and other assets.\" (Dkt. Nos. 1-1 at \u00b6 6; 29 at \u00b6 6; 99-1 at \u00b6 3.) The entities involved include, \"Urso Ltd (a Belize company) (\"Urso\"), FairWay IP Holdings, Ltd (a Cayman Island company) (\"FairWay IP Holdings\"), FairWay Financial U.S., Inc. (a Delaware company), FairWay Pricing Technologies, LLC (a Delaware company) [ (\"FairWay Pricing\") ], and FairWay International Kft\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (a Hungarian company).\" (Dkt. No. 99-1 at \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In May 2008, Plaintiff \"assigned to Urso as corporate assets all personal patents, trademarks, and business plans related to FairWay inventions or businesses.\" (Dkt. No. 99-4, Ex. 44 at 7.) In December 2011, Plaintiff transferred ownership of the FairWay IP from Urso to FairWay IP Holdings. (Dkt. No. 99-4, Ex. 55 at 165.) Prior to August 2016, Plaintiff held a 100% ownership interest in Urso; Plaintiff currently owns 25% of the company and remains its president.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 99-8, Ex. C at 59:11-22, 60:19-21.) Urso owns 100% of FairWay IP Holdings, which owns 100% of the FairWay IP. (Dkt. No. 99-8, Ex. C at 64:2-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Loans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between April 2006 and October 2011, Defendant made 33 loans to Plaintiff-in the form of promissory notes-to fund FairWay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 99-1 at \u00b6 5.) The notes list Defendant as the \"Purchaser\" or \"Lender.\" (Dkt. Nos. 99-1 at \u00b6 5; 99-2, Ex. 1-33.) Thirty-one of the notes list Plaintiff as the \"Borrower,\" and the other two list FairWay Pricing Technologies, LLC and FairWay\n   International Kft, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 99-2, Ex. 1-33.) All but one of the notes contain Plaintiff's signature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The notes were secured by the general assets of Plaintiff and the FairWay IP held by Urso, with the principal and interest payable by Plaintiff upon demand. (Dkt. Nos. 1-1 at \u00b6 10; 29 at \u00b6 10; 99-4, Ex. 44 at 7, Ex. 51 at 56, Ex. 53 at 114.) Two of the notes are governed by Delaware state law, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-2, Exs. 1-2); the parties do not dispute that all other notes are governed by California state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The total outstanding principal of the notes is approximately $ 551,433.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The annual interest rate on the FairWay Pricing Technologies, LLC note is 8%; the FairWay International Kft note does not provide for interest. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-2, Ex. 1 at 9; Ex. 25 at 98.) All other notes provide for an annual interest rate of 10%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. \"Loan Managers\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between June 2007 and February 2016, Plaintiff sent Defendant 19 emails attaching spreadsheets from a file entitled \"Barry Forman Loan Manager\"; the spreadsheets include a summary page entitled \"Personal Loans - Forman to Avery,\" listing \"Accumulated Loans with interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-3, Ex. 34-43, 45-53.) The Loan Managers list the dates of the notes, beginning with the August 2006 note,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the principal loan amount, and the principal plus accrued interest. Beginning with the March 2008 Loan Manager, Plaintiff includes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   All principle and interest is due and payable on demand by Nathaniel Caleb Avery\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   To the extent any collateral is held by Urso Limited [also owned by Avery], that collateral is pledged as well [to the extent necessary to fully repay both principle and interest]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Signed by Nathaniel Caleb Avery both individually\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   and as Chairman and CEO of Urso Limited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   on behalf of Urso, Ltd.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Marina Towers, Suite 302,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Newtown Barracks,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Belize City, Belize\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   N.

No. 99-3, Ex. 40 at 67 (bracketed language in original).) On February 29, 2016, Plaintiff sent Defendant the last Loan Manager; it references all 33 of the\n   notes at issue. (Dkt. No. 99-4, Ex. 53 at 113-159.) The February 2016 Loan Manager removes the language above regarding collateral held by Urso, and states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   All principle and interest is due and payable on demand by Nathaniel Caleb Avery\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Signed by Nathaniel Caleb Avery both individually\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   and as Chairman and CEO of Urso Limited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   on behalf of Urso, Ltd.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   35 New Road\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Belize City, Belize\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   **Also includes $ 100K Convertible Debt Note with FairWay Pricing Technologies which Nathaniel Caleb Avery and Urso Ltd will take personal and corporate responsibility to the extent that Note is not repaid by FairWay Pricing Technologies according to its terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Memorandum of Understanding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In December 7, 2011, Plaintiff emailed Defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" (\"MOU\") reflecting a discussion between the parties to reconfigure the \"payout plan\" for the notes at issue so that Plaintiff could obtain $ 6 million in funding for FairWay through the sale of notes secured by the FairWay IP. (Dkt. No. 99-4, Ex. 51 at 39-56.) In the cover email, Plaintiff states, in pertinent part: \"As you, [Defendant], and I, discussed, as part of the paperwork Urso Ltd. is assigning the FairWay IP portfolio to an IP Holding company, FairWay IP Holdings Ltd. to securitize the $ 6M in Notes being offered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) The attached MOU states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Some of the individual Notes in the series have pledged my general and entire asset base [including patents assigned to Urso Ltd.] as collateral.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     As we discussed, as part of our current fundraising, the FairWay Intellectual Property (patents, trademarks, etc.) is being assigned from Urso Ltd. to FairWay IP Holdings Ltd. [Cayman Islands]. To complete that assignment, I would ask you to accept and confirm your understanding that Urso Ltd. would not have direct control over these Intellectual Property assets but continue to have indirect rights to them through its 100% sole ownership of FairWay IP Holdings.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Specifically, while Urso would no longer have direct title to these assets, it would have rights to the cash flow from the licensing of those assets [net of FairWay IP Holdings obligations to maintain them (legal costs, filing fees, annuities, etc.) ], such cash to be received as expense reimbursements or dividends from FairWay IP Holding to Urso.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In summary, your lien interest [per the Notes] would continue on my general assets including: 1) my 100% ownership of Urso Ltd.; 2) by proxy, Urso Ltd.'s majority ownership of FairWay International; 3) my shares in FairWay Financial U.S., Inc.; and 4) general assets. But it would specifically no longer include\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     direct lien on FairWay Intellectual Property, but rather depend on Urso's sole ownership of FairWay IP Holdings for repayment of the Notes.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The Notes (2006-2011), as a series, are amended to that understanding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56 (bracketed language in original) (emphasis added).) Defendant attests that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Plaintiff] told me that in order to consummate the transaction [for the $ 6 million in new funding], he needed a \"carve out\" of my direct security interest in the FairWay IP. In return, my loans would be repaid by the end of 2012, and I would retain my security interest in all of his other general assets, including, but not limited to, his 100% ownership in Urso.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Dkt. No. 99-1 at \u00b6 64.) Indeed, Plaintiff's cover email states, in pertinent part: \"For clarity sake, I am attaching the current Loan Manager summarizing all personal Notes outstanding from me to you and a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the carve out of the IP in the general liens on my property to now accommodate the indirect control of the IP.\" (Dkt. No. 99-4, Ex. 51 at 39.) Plaintiff's cover email also states that pursuant to \"[t]he payout plan,\" Plaintiff would pay Defendant his balance within six months, \"with a small balance by year-end 2012.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant signed and returned the MOU to Plaintiff on December 12, 2011. (Dkt. No. 99-4, Ex. 55 at 164-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Demand Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On May 17, 2017, Defendant sent Plaintiff a demand letter, calling for the immediate payment of principal and interest on all outstanding loans; \"specifically, those loans listed in [Plaintiff's] document entitled \"Loan Manager - Barry Forman - 31 Dec 2016\"...as well as any and all other loans or advances from [Defendant] to [Plaintiff] or to any of [Plaintiff's] affiliate companies.\" (Dkt. No. 99-2, Ex. B at 5.) The letter demanded payment by May 31, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff did not respond to Defendant's demand, and on June 12, 2017, Defendant sent Plaintiff written notice via email and certified mail that \"Plaintiff failed to make any payment of principal and interest as demanded by [Defendant's]\" May 2017 letter. (Dkt. No. 99-2, Ex. C at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The \"Partnership\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Preliminary Collaboration Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On January 25, 2010, Defendant proposed terms for a potential partnership to Plaintiff by sending Plaintiff a \"[f]irst draft of a partnership term sheet.\" (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. K. at 176.) The term sheet includes several questions related to tax issues. (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. K at 177-78.) On March 9, 2010, Plaintiff responded to Defendant's proposal by emailing Defendant a \"[f]irst draft\" of a document entitled \"Preliminary Collaboration Agreement.\" (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. E at 146.) Plaintiff's cover email noted that the draft \"needs a bit of work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The attached document states, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   This Preliminary Collaboration Agreement is intended to set forth the basic terms of agreement by which Barry Forman (\"Forman\") is partnering with Caleb Avery t'Bear (\"t'Bear\") in implementing the FairWay business model, as described in the Executive Summary for FairWay Financial U.S. and including the establishment of FairWay International and its operating companies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147.) The draft \"acknowledge[s] the preliminary nature of the agreement,\" and states that \"as soon as practicable,\" the parties would \"engage legal counsel experienced in the preparation and counseling regarding business partnership agreements to prepare a complete agreement\n   covering, among other things, the terms and conditions set forth [t]herein.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Preliminary Collaboration Agreement includes the heading \"Rough Draft for Caleb's Review,\" a bracketed question regarding \"repurchase rights upon [Defendant's] death,\" brackets indicating forthcoming \"[t]ext\" regarding compensation, and a blank space regarding the percentage of equity participation in FairWay operating companies that Defendant would receive \"[a]s consideration for [the] performance of his duties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147-49.) The draft is not signed by either party and does not include a date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition to the Preliminary Collaboration Agreement, on March 9, 2010 Plaintiff forwarded to Defendant an email to Plaintiff from his then-attorney, Tim Covington.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 146.) Upon reviewing Defendant's partnership term sheet, Mr. Covington wrote, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"Partnership\" conveys possibly unknown rights and liabilities, as there is an entire body of partner law. Also you do not want to give Barry all of the rights you currently hold as Fairway's founder. My recommendation is to call this a collaboration agreement and then to make clear that Barry is, to an extent, an at will employee and doesn't have rights to control the formation of the various FairWay affiliates (he talks about ownership structure of UMS, etc. as if he would have some say in control of UMS, which I don't think is your intent).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Indeed, the Preliminary Collaboration Agreement designates Defendant's \"Executive Role\" as \"CEO of FairWay Financial US and other FairWay operating companies,\" and states that Defendant \"will be employed at will and may be terminated at any time upon notice with or without cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The next day, Plaintiff sent Defendant an email with the subject line \"Merged draft agreements,\" with \"[d]raft 3\" of the Preliminary Collaboration Agreement attached. (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. M at 186.) The email states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   I merged both drafts. We still need to compare against [Defendant's] draft term sheet and also need a section as to the formula(s) applied to calculate the initial founder's calculation of each [operating company]. I will also go back and look at [Defendant's] draft to see if we have missed anything else.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   But this is a good initial start.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The third draft includes the heading \"Rough Draft for Caleb's Review,\" and contains the same bracketed question regarding repurchase rights, bracket denoting forthcoming text regarding compensation, and blank space regarding equity participation as the initial version. The draft also inserts a new non-compete clause stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [Defendant] agrees not to compete with t'Bear, Urso or FairWay in any manner central to their business plans for a period of 5 years after leaving the employment of FairWay Financial US, FairWay International and/or other Fairway operating companies, as the case may be[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 188.) The draft includes another new clause stating, pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Complete Agreement\n   </em>\n   . Forman and t'Bear agree to cooperate to ensure that this Agreement is superseded by a complete form of agreement (\"Complete Agreement\") covering its subject matter within six (6) months of the effective date set forth below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189.) The draft also includes a clause regarding liability under the agreement, stating, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE, UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND AS A RESULT OF OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT AND WHETHER [sic] OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 190.) As with the initial version, the third draft is not signed by either party and does not include a date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On March 27, 2010, Plaintiff sent Defendant an email with the subject line \"updated partner draft.\" (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. O at 203.) The \"Compensation\" section of the attached draft includes for the first time a formula for determining the parties' \"share equity set forth in each major operating company set aside for founders at the time the company is established.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 205.) The section includes bracketed questions regarding the formula, including one stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   How would the [partnership pool] be split up as a practical matter? Not equally, as per [Defendant's] draft term sheet, I think; since, different \"Partners\" would be bringing different things to the table and awarded shares in differing amounts accordingly. We need to discuss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 206.) The version again includes the heading \"Rough Draft for Caleb's Review\" and contains the same bracketed question regarding repurchase rights found in the previous drafts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 204, 207.) Also like the previous versions, the March 27 draft is not signed by either party and does not include a date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On June 5, 2011, Plaintiff emailed Defendant stating that Plaintiff was \"looking for the most current draft of the partnership proposal.\" (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. P at 217.) Minutes later, Plaintiff sent Defendant an email with the subject line \"Partner Agmt\" that included the \"last draft [Plaintiff] had from Tim [Covington].\" (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. Q at 221.) Plaintiff's email notes that the draft \"seems incomplete to sign and the partnership formula is not really spelled out as we have in excel spreadsheets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, the email states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Can you work with Tim and I to get this in better form and then we can give the legal/tax advisors something better to work with[?] Just to document our most recent discussion/agreement about the formula (and the attached draft), we are making the following structural change (with your approval) [to the repurchase period and the \"FairWay Group compensation pool set-aside].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The attached Preliminary Collaboration Agreement does not contain the \"partnership formula\" contained in the March 27 draft's \"Compensation\" section but does include the heading \"Rough Draft for Caleb's\n   Review\" and the previous versions' bracketed question regarding repurchase rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222, 224.) Once again, the draft is not signed by either party and it does not include a date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendant's Exit from FairWay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On September 21, 2015, Defendant sent an email to Plaintiff with the subject line \"Transition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) The email states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Last March, you asked that I level with you regarding\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     our partnership in FairWay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   ...Consequently, Caleb,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I am no longer able to proceed as your partner\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .

In January 2016, Plaintiff and Mr. Covington collaborated on a draft letter to \"memorialize [Defendant's] withdrawal from the FairWay Group.\" (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. C at 115.) The letter states, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   It is with both sadness and understanding that I read the letter by which you stepped down as Chairman of the FairWay Group.

The parties continued to negotiate regarding Defendant's exit and the repayment of his loans, and at some point in February or March 2016, Defendant informed Plaintiff \"that if [Defendant] were not repaid by the end of 2016, [Defendant would need to have [his] original security interest in the FairWay IP restored.\" (Dkt. No. 99-1 at \u00b6 72.) Negotiations broke down, as reflected in an email from Plaintiff to Defendant on March 7, 2016, wherein Plaintiff states that Defendant \"bargained hard\" for a \"full partnership,\" and \"with those rewards come obligations, particularly to lead the charge for funding so all the pieces could be put in place and creditors (including the Forman loans) could be paid.\" (Dkt.

Negotiations between the parties continued, with Defendant seeking restoration of his security interest in the FairWay IP. On August 7, 2016, Mr. Covington emailed Plaintiff, suggesting that the \"4 Urso shareholder scenario at 25%...could be a key to thwarting [Defendant's] attachment of the assets.\" (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. Y at 270.) On or about that date, Plaintiff sold or transferred 75% of his ownership interest in Urso to unnamed parties. (Dkt. No. 99-8, Ex. C at 59:11-22.) Plaintiff did not notify Defendant of this transfer. The parties continued discussions regarding a forbearance agreement throughout 2016 and up until January 2017, when Defendant was served with Plaintiff's state court complaint. (Dkt.

Defendant removed the action to this Court on February 17, 2017, based on diversity jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 1.) Thereafter, Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, (Dkt.

Under Rule 201(b)(2), a judicially noticed adjudicative fact must be one \"that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it...can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201. Here, Defendant seeks \"judicial notice of the fact that the Federal Reserve Discount Rate on April 28, 2006, was 5.75%.\" (Dkt. No. 100 at 2.) In support of this fact, Defendant submits two printouts from the \"website of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   demonstrating that the discount rate was set at 5.75% on April 10, 2006. (Dkt. No. 100 at 2.) Plaintiff has not opposed judicial notice of these documents or otherwise disputed their authenticity. Accordingly, the Court grants judicial notice of the fact that the Federal Reserve discount rate was 5.75% on April 28, 2006 because it is an undisputed \"matter of public record.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Defendant insists that summary judgment on Plaintiff's cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty is warranted because a partnership agreement was never \"reached, finalized, formalized, dated or executed,\" and therefore, Defendant owed no fiduciary duty to Plaintiff. (Dkt. No. 103 at 19-24.) Further, Defendant insists that even if a partnership existed, there is no evidence that Defendant breached a fiduciary duty or that such a breach caused damages to Plaintiff.

No. 103-2, Ex. M at 186). There is a dispute, however, as to the effect of the March 10th draft of the Preliminary Collaboration Agreement. Plaintiff testified that the parties \"agreed on March 10th...that we were partners,\" based on the terms of the March 10th draft. (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. A at 27.) Plaintiff further testified that the parties then \"proceeded through a course of conduct as partners.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The draft partnership agreement, together with Plaintiff's testimony and the parties' course of conduct gives rise to a genuine dispute of fact regarding the formation of a partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   On January 12, 2012, Defendant forwarded to Plaintiff an email from a potential investor in FairWay, asking: \"What's your take, partner?\" (Dkt.

Finally, in December 2015, Defendant sent Plaintiff an email discussing compensation and stating: \"I, too, would have devoted less time had I known in advance that the economics of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     our partnership\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   would never materialize.\" (Dkt. No. 115-2 at 8 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Based on the parties' repeated references to their \"partnership\" in the correspondence above, as well as Plaintiff's testimony that the parties agreed to the terms set forth in the draft March 10 partnership agreement, the record reflects a genuine dispute as to whether the parties indeed carried on as partners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Plaintiff's complaint alleges that Defendant \"breached his fiduciary duty [under the partnership] to act with good faith, due care and loyalty to Plaintiff.\" (Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6 17.) Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted because even if a partnership existed, Plaintiff has produced no evidence showing that Defendant breached any fiduciary duty, or produced evidence giving rise to a genuine dispute of material fact on that score. Construing the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Duty of Loyalty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The duty of loyalty requires a partner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   (1) To account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use by the partner of partnership property or information, including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   (2) To refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   (3) To refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business before the dissolution of the partnership.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016404\">\n    Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 16404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)-(3). Plaintiff's complaint alleges that Defendant \"attempt[ed] to take assets of the jointly owned business and [usurped/compromised] business opportunities held by the partnership.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 at \u00b6 17.) Plaintiff's opposition further clarifies that Defendant breached the duty of loyalty by\n   <em>\n    asking\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff to reinstate Defendant's \"direct security interest in [Plaintiff's intellectual property].\" (Dkt. No. 119 at 23 (emphasis added).) Defendant insists that summary judgment is warranted because Plaintiff presents no evidence of any actual breach of loyalty, and instead, Defendant's request in 2016 to reinstate his direct security in Plaintiff's intellectual property as part of negotiations for a loan forbearance agreement was proper under California law. The Court agrees that Plaintiff presents no evidence giving rise to a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Defendant's mere request to reinstate his security interest in Plaintiff's intellectual property breached the duty of loyalty. Further, any such request is permitted under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \"A partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the partnership agreement merely because the partner's conduct furthers the partner's own interest.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016404\">\n    Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 16404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Further:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   A partner may lend money to and transact other business with the partnership, and as to each loan or transaction, the rights and obligations of the partner regarding performance or enforcement are the same as those of a person who is not a partner, subject to other applicable law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016404\">\n    Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 16404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). Thus, even if Plaintiff had agreed to Defendant's request, Defendant would not have breached the duty of loyalty by reinstating the security interest he previously held in Plaintiff's intellectual property as forbearance for repayment of the promissory notes. It follows that Defendant's mere request to do so as part of a loan forbearance negotiation does not constitute a breach of loyalty under California law. Because Plaintiff's conclusory allegations are insufficient to defeat summary judgment, and the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that Defendant breached the duty of loyalty, Plaintiff's duty of loyalty theory fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Duty of Care\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   A partner's duty of care \"is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of the law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016404\">\n    Cal.

Plaintiff insists that Defendant breached his duty of care by failing to \"use diligent efforts to recruit executives and solicit investments in FairWay operating companies.\" (Dkt. No. 119-1 at \u00b6 19.) Defendant argues that summary judgment is warranted because Plaintiff fails to put forth any evidence that Defendant engaged in proscribed conduct giving rise to a breach of the duty of care. The Court agrees. Defendant has met his initial burden of showing that Plaintiff \"does not have enough evidence of an essential element [of his breach of fiduciary claim] to carry [his] ultimate burden of persuasion at trial,\" and Plaintiff has failed to produce \"evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact\" on that score.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nissan Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

(Dkt. No. 119-1 at \u00b6 19.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-4, Ex. 52 at 111, Ex. 53 at 114.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8050578\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/301/313/#p316\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff is wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   To give rise to a genuine dispute of material fact, Plaintiff must provide\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   -not unsupported assertions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 250,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]hen a properly supported motion for summary judgment is made, the adverse party 'must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.' \") (quoting Fed.

Here, not only does Plaintiff fail to provide any evidence in support of his \"intent\" argument, that argument is directly contradicted by the record. The Loan Managers show that Plaintiff contemporaneously characterized the notes at issue as \"Personal Loans - Forman to Avery\" and represented that he was individually responsible for payment of the notes upon Defendant's demand. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the Loan Managers is that they acknowledged Plaintiff's debt to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   At oral argument Plaintiff insisted that the Loan Managers did not acknowledge Plaintiff's debt because the December 2011 MOU relinquished Plaintiff's obligation to pay the notes, or at least required Defendant to first seek payment from Urso before making demand upon Plaintiff. Putting aside that this argument is not really about the statute of limitations, it nonetheless fails because the MOU cannot reasonably be read to support Plaintiff's interpretation. And Plaintiff points to no other evidence in the record to support his argument: no testimony as to conversations with Defendant, no emails or other correspondence, and no other documentary evidence that even hints that Defendant had agreed to give up his right to repayment from Plaintiff. Instead, the record includes Loan Managers issued by Plaintiff subsequent to the MOU that expressly acknowledge his debt and make no mention of the debt being relinquished. Simply put, no reasonable trier of fact could find the facts as urged by Plaintiff in this respect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Loans Intertwined with Partnership\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Plaintiff further argues that summary judgment is inappropriate because there is \"a factual dispute over the [existence] of the partnership that is intertwined with any status of the Demand Notes of 2006-2011.\" (Dkt. No. 118 at 18.) Again, however, Plaintiff points to no evidence in support of that assertion, and his argument is belied by the terms of the notes themselves-none of which mention a partnership-and the Loan Managers, which clearly show that Plaintiff understood that the notes at issue were personal loans\n   from Defendant to Plaintiff. Plaintiff's argument is also undercut by the timeframe of the loans-31 of the 33 notes at issue were executed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Defendant proposed terms of a partnership to Plaintiff in January 2010 and\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff responded to those proposed terms with the draft Preliminary Collaboration Agreement in March 2010. The two loans that came after, in May 2011 and October 2011, contain identical terms and formatting (though different loan amounts) to the notes that preceded them in September 2006, November 2006, December 2006 (2), January 2007 (2), February 2007, March 2007 (3), April 2007, May 2007, June 2007, July 2007 (2), August 2007, September 2007, October 2007 (2), November 2007 (2), December 2007 (2), January 2008, February 2008, April 2008, and May 2008. Again, none of the 33 notes at issue reference a partnership or any other type of business relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The December 2011 MOU from Plaintiff to Defendant detailing a restructured \"payout plan to [Defendant] that would retire the series of Promissory Notes dated from 2006-2011\" likewise does not contain any reference to the purported partnership. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-4, Ex. 55 at 165.) Further, to the extent that the Court recognizes a genuine dispute of fact as to the existence of a partnership, that dispute is not material to the breach of contract counterclaim based on the record before the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 248,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Failure to register under the California Financing Law and violation of California Financial Code \u00a7 22750\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Plaintiff moves for summary judgment and opposes Defendant's motion on the grounds that the notes at issue are void because Defendant failed to register as a financial lender as required under the California Financing Law (\"CFL\"), California Financial Code \u00a7 22000 et seq. Plaintiff contends that by failing to register, Defendant violated California Financial Code \u00a7\u00a7 22750 and 22752(a) and thus Defendant is prohibited from collecting on the loans, or at least collecting any interest on the loans. Defendant counters that this argument fails because the notes at issue are \"commercial loans,\" and Sections 22750 and 22752(a) of the CFL apply only to \"consumer loans.\" He further argues that Plaintiff has not shown that the CFL otherwise applies to all of the loans at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Whether the Loans Qualify as Consumer Loans\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   As defined by the CFL, a \"consumer loan\" is a loan \"intended by the borrower for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022203\">\n    Cal.

Conversely, a \" '[c]ommercial loan' means a loan of a principal amount of five thousand dollars ($ 5,000) or more ...the proceeds of which are intended by the borrower for use primarily for other than personal, family, or household purposes.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022502\">\n    Cal. Fin. Code \u00a7 22502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the notes at issue on Defendant's motion for summary judgment all have a principal amount of $ 5,000 or more. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-2, Exs. 1-33.) Thus, to defeat Defendant's motion, Plaintiff-who has the ultimate burden of proof on the CFL affirmative defense-must identify evidence sufficient to support a genuine dispute that the loans were not intended to be used primarily for\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   personal, family or household purposes, that is, a finding that the loans were intended primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint alleges that the loans were commercial in nature: \"Defendant, as part of his agreed upon support for the partnership/joint venture, provided funding for the partnership/joint venture which funds were characterized as Promissory Notes.\" (Dkt. No. 1-1 at \u00b6 9.) This allegation is consistent with the terms of the first two promissory notes which themselves recite that the primary, or even exclusive, purpose of the loans was to fund FairWay. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-2, Ex. 1 at 12 (\"Proceeds of Note (a) Use the proceeds of the Note for working capital, legal fees, and other [short-term] general corporate purposes.\"); Ex. 2 at 28 (\"Proceeds of Note (a) Use the proceeds of the Note exclusively for patent-related expenses (e.g., legal fees and the related general costs) related to a contemplated international business.\"). The parties subsequently used a \"Secured Promissory Note\" form for the loans at issue on Defendant's motion (except the loan to FairWay International Kft) that does not specify what the proceeds of the loans could be used for. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-2, Exs. 3-24; 26-33.) However, based on the parties' past conduct, which shows that Defendant made the loans to further a commercial purpose-the development of FairWay-that omission does not give rise to a reasonable inference that the loans at issue were consumer loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-2, Exs. 3-24; 26-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Plaintiff's cross motion for summary judgment and his opposition to Defendant's motion fail to identify any evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could find that Plaintiff intended to use the loans \"primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022203\">\n    Cal.

Instead, Plaintiff's briefs ignored the consumer/commercial distinction. (Dkt. Nos. 101-13 at 7-8; 118 at 23-25.) Plaintiff's reply in support of his motion for summary judgment argues-for the first time-that the notes are not commercial loans but are instead consumer loans \"because proceeds from each and every Demand Note were used for personal, family, or household purposes.\" (Dkt. No. 120 at 8.) Plaintiff's declaration in support of his reply, (Dkt.

Accordingly, Defendant may file a supplemental brief, not to exceed five pages, on whether, drawing all inferences in Plaintiff's favor, a reasonable trier of fact could find any of the loans at issue on Defendant's motion for summary judgment were made primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.

Plaintiff also does not dispute that the notes governed by California law bear interest at the legal limit of 10% per year. Plaintiff attests, however, that the loans exceed the statutory maximum interest rate because the parties agreed to \"Equity Override Agreements\" in September 2006, February 2011, and June 2011 that provided Defendant additional compensation in the form of the right to purchase as much as 2% equity in FairWay operating companies. (Dkt. No. 101-12 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) Plaintiff argues that these equity rights were tied to Defendant's loans and thus constitute an impermissible \"bonus\" on top of the legal limit of 10% interest on the face of the notes. As to the element of intent, Plaintiff provides no argument in his motion, (see Dkt. No. 101-13 at 5-6), and asserts in his reply that \"[t]he only time intent is relevant is if the transaction does not appear on its face to be usurious,\" which \"is not needed here because the face of the note[s]\" indicate they are usurious, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

(Dkt. No. 117 at 10, 17.) The Court finds Defendant's first and second arguments dispositive and agrees that the record is insufficient to grant summary judgment in Plaintiff's favor on his usury defense because Plaintiff fails to (1) provide sufficient evidence that the equity rights had demonstrable value at the time the loans were made and (2) demonstrate the requisite intent.

In response to questioning regarding the February 2011 letter, Defendant testified: \"I don't know that I formally agreed [to its terms].\" (Dkt. No. 101-6, Ex. C at 6:23.)

No. 116-5, Ex. O at 93 (emphasis added).) Further, the January 2016 draft\n   letter memorializing Defendant's exit from FairWay includes terms stating that Defendant would \"continue in a more limited advisory role and\n   <em>\n    receive compensation for past advisory services and\n    <strong>\n     loans\n    </strong>\n    to the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FairWay Group\n   </em>\n   .\" (Dkt. No. 103-2, Ex. R at 233 (emphasis added).) Thus, the record supports an inference that Plaintiff's offers of equity rights in FairWay companies were related to Defendant's loans. The record fails to support a finding, however, that such offers constitute a \"bonus\" sufficient to render the loans usurious because there is no evidence that the equity rights had demonstrable value at the time the loans were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   In opposition to Plaintiff's cross motion for summary judgment and his usury defense, Defendant submits the September 2006 letter as evidence that the equity rights were valueless. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 117-3, Ex. B at 2-3.) Defendant asserts that the September 2006 letter \"merely offers [Defendant] the right to purchase, for a small price, a percentage of shares in non-existent FairWay entities that might never be formed.\" (Dkt. No. 117 at 12.) Defendant also submits the declaration of Greg Regan, \"an experienced valuation expert,\" who reviewed \"the materials [Plaintiff] submitted to the Court\" and \"concluded that [Plaintiff] has not provided any information upon which one could determine the value of rights offered to [Defendant] in the September 10, 2006 letter.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 117-6 at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6.) Further, Mr. Regan opines: \"The information cited by [Plaintiff] does not provide a basis under acceptable and widely-used valuation methods to determine the value of the rights offered in the February 4, 2011 and June 5, 2011 letters, as of those dates (or any dates).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Plaintiff offers no evidence to rebut Mr. Regan's declaration, and instead merely argues that Mr. Regan's declaration and methodology is faulty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 120 at 12-13.) Such assertions do not give rise to a genuine dispute of material fact; Plaintiff must instead identify evidence to rebut Defendant's evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777833\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/477/652/#p658\">\n    477 F.3d at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Bald assertions that genuine issues of material fact exist are insufficient.\").

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 120 at 13-14.) Defendant's perceived value is not enough, however, given that any additional bonus or compensation for the loans must have\n   <em>\n    demonstrable value at the time the loans are made\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2308339\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-2d/212/920/#p934\">\n    212 Cal.

Thus, to raise a genuine dispute of material fact, Plaintiff must identify evidence that would support a reasonable inference that the equity rights had some value at the time of the loans. Plaintiff fails to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   In the absence of any evidence that the equity rights had demonstrable value at the time of the loans, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment fails because he has not proved the second element of usury-that the interest on the loans in question exceeded the statutory maximum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Darden Rests., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11512171\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/474/#p480\">\n    213 F.3d at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When the party moving for summary judgment would bear the burden of proof at trial, it must come forward with evidence which would entitled it to a directed verdict if the evidence went uncontroverted at trial.\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff's lack of evidence means his usury affirmative defense\n   to Defendant's motion for summary judgment also fails.

Declaratory Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Defendant's motion also seeks declaratory relief; specifically, rescission of the December 2011 MOU for failure of consideration. Defendant argues that rescission is warranted because Plaintiff's promised consideration has failed in two ways: (1) Plaintiff failed to repay Defendant's loans by the end of 2012; and (2) Plaintiff no longer holds a 100% ownership interest in Urso, which he pledged in the MOU as the \"main collateral\" for the notes at issue. (Dkt. No. 99 at 23-25.) Defendant further insists that rescission is necessary to restore his security interest in the FairWay IP because Plaintiff is otherwise \"judgment proof\" and cannot satisfy any monetary award ordered by this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Defendant's declaratory relief claim is in effect a claim that Plaintiff breached the MOU. Thus, to prevail, Defendant must establish that drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, every reasonable factfinder would have to find that Plaintiff breached the MOU. Then, based on that breach, Defendant seeks a declaration that the MOU is rescinded and thus his loans are again secured directly by the Fairway IP. As previously noted, a court's decision whether to grant declaratory relief is \"a matter of discretion,\" and \"the court may, after a full consideration on the merits, exercise its discretion to refuse to grant declaratory relief because the state of the record is inadequate to support the extent of the relief sought.\"\n   <em>\n    State of Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388335\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/759/1353/#p1356\">\n    759 F.2d at 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   The Court is not comfortable ordering the relief sought based on the record before it for two reasons. First, Defendant's motion relies heavily on Plaintiff's failure answer the declaratory relief counterclaim. (Dkt. No. 99 at 23.) However, Plaintiff did answer the counterclaim, just not in a timely manner. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 112.) Defendant offers no legal authority for the proposition that an untimely answer, filed before the defendant is held in default, admits the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint. Second, Defendant has not addressed why Urso-the purported 100% owner of the Fairway IP-does not need to be made a party to these proceedings if what Defendant seeks is a declaration that Defendant has a priority lien to the Fairway IP-an asset held by Urso.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The Court in its discretion therefore denies Defendant's motion for summary judgment on its declaratory judgment claim without prejudice to renewal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Defendant's Motion for Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Defendant moves for sanctions against Plaintiff pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 37(b) and 41(b) because: (1) Plaintiff \"violated the Court's May 17 and June 6 Orders by failing to complete his document production by June 21\"; (2) Plaintiff \"violated the Court's July 18 Order concerning production of assertedly privileged documents\"; (3) Plaintiff \"walked out of his Court-ordered deposition before questioning was completed\"; (4) Plaintiff \"has ignored the Court's August 6 Order to pay monetary sanctions to [Defendant]\"; and (5) Plaintiff \"improperly interfered with document production and testimony from Timothy Covington.\" (Dkt. No. 111 at 2.) Defendant requests that the Court grant his motion and dismiss Plaintiff's complaint with prejudice, \"impose a sanction prohibiting [Plaintiff] from opposing [Defendant's] second counterclaim [seeking rescission of the December 2011 MOU].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise responded to Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   The Court has granted Defendant's motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff's complaint; thus, terminating sanctions are not necessary. It is always preferable to decide a case on its merits. While Defendant also seeks an order that Plaintiff cannot oppose Defendant's claim for declaratory relief, most of the misconduct is not tethered to that counterclaim, which was not even added to this lawsuit until July 2018. Defendant does contend that Plaintiff testified at his deposition in July 2018 that he is withholding documents created after October 2016, including documents relevant to the ownership of Urso. Defendant, however, never moved to compel such testimony or documents. He cites no legal authority that would allow what is in effect a default judgment for failing to produce evidence absent a court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   On August 6, 2018, the Court did order Plaintiff to pay $ 3360 in sanctions for discovery violations as of May 2018. (Dkt. No. 86.) According to Defendant, Plaintiff has yet to pay those sanctions despite four separate inquiries from Defendant's counsel. (Dkt. No. 111 at 14.) Plaintiff shall pay the monetary sanction, as previously ordered, on or before February 21, 2019 and shall file a written submission with the Court by the same date confirming that he has complied with the Court's order and paid the sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   On October 15, 2018, after submitting his motion for summary judgment on Defendant's counterclaims, Plaintiff filed an answer to Defendant's second amended counterclaim asserting 16 affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   On January 7, 2019, Plaintiff purportedly moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36 to \"allow motion for leave to amend filing of amended affirmative defenses by Plaintiff.\" (Dkt. No. 134.) Specifically, Plaintiff states that he \"move[s] under Rules [sic] 36, to amend its responses to the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment to Defendant's Counterclaims filed October 4, 2018.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Plaintiff asserts that \"[t]he Motion is ready to file,\" and \"[t]he Court has only to allow.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff clarified at oral argument that he is seeking leave to amend based on \"additional claims\" brought by Defendant in his motion for summary judgment on his counterclaims. Notwithstanding that Plaintiff's motion fails to\n   comply with the requirements of Civil Local Rule 7-2, the motion is moot. As the Court explained to Plaintiff at oral argument, it is only adjudicating the counterclaims asserted in Defendant's July 19, 2018 second amended counterclaim, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 84). Plaintiff indicated that he understood. And, in any event, his motion is untimely. The time for Plaintiff to raise any issues in opposition to Defendant's motions for summary judgment was in his opposition briefing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 113, 114.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   The Court grants summary judgment in favor of Defendant on Plaintiff's claims for breach of fiduciary duty, declaratory relief, and an accounting, that is, on Plaintiff's entire complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The Court denies Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on Defendant's counterclaims and denies without prejudice Defendant's motion for summary judgment on his declaratory judgment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   The Court defers ruling on Defendant's motion for partial summary judgment on his breach of contract counterclaim pending his submission of a supplemental brief regarding the loans not qualifying as consumer loans as a matter of law.
