In this case, the defendant confronts a sentence of no more than 5 years in prison, so if the \"10 years or more\" limitation applies, his detention would not be mandatory.

There the statute involved a list of three categories where, like here, the third category contained a limiting phrase whose applicability to an earlier category was in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court held that the limiting phrase modified only \"the antecedent immediately preceding it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602432\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/958/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602432\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/958/\">\n    at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under that \"rule,\" the limiting phrase ordinarily modifies only the phrase immediately preceding it. The rule is not absolute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 963, 965, but it is pertinent. In an earlier case,\n   <em>\n    Paroline v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706995\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/434/#p447\">\n    572 U.S. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706995,12579853\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1710/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706995,12579853\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1710/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), the Court noted a competing \"series-qualifier\" canon, where the limiting phrase should apply to the entire list; the defendant argues that I should apply that canon here. But\n   <em>\n    Paroline\n   </em>\n   said that canon was suitable to apply when the items in the list \"are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words [here, categories] as to the last.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706995,12579853\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1710/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the limitation phrase cannot be applicable to the second category in the list, section 1591 violations, because all the offenses in that category have penalties of over 10 years (unlike the other two categories). Therefore, the rationale for the\n   <em>\n    Paroline\n   </em>\n   series-qualifier canon does not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   I conclude that under\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   the \"10 years or more\" limitation does not apply to the first category, a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   , the context of this provision also \"fortifies the meaning [the last antecedent] principle commands.\"\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602432\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/958/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, it makes no sense to apply the limiting phrase to all three categories in the list here, because it has no bearing on the second category (\"a violation of section 1591\"), a provision where all possible penalties exceed 10 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Second, the enactment history and context show that the \"10 years or more\" limitation does not apply to crimes of violence. Until December 2004, only crimes of violence were referred to in this subsection, and there was no prison time limitation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)(A) (2003) (amended 2004). Nothing in later amendments shows that in enlarging the mandatory detention list Congress was trying to narrow the crimes of violence category. In the \"Pretrial Detention of Terrorists Act of 2004\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" under the heading \"Presumption for Pretrial Detention in Cases Involving Terrorism,\" Congress simply inserted the language: \"or an offense listed in section 2332b(g)(5)(B) [acts of terrorism] for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed.\" Pub. L. No. 108-458, \u00a7 6952(2),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20Stat.%203638\">\n    118 Stat. 3638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). That insertion suggests that Congress was adding a self-contained new category, not changing the scope of the existing category, crimes of violence. Then in 2008, Congress added the third category, section 1591 (sex trafficking crimes), where prison terms always exceed 10 years. If the existing two categories were limited as a list by the 10-year prison requirement following 2332b(g)(5)(B), the logical place to add the new category would have been at the end,\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   the limitation clause. But instead, in Subtitle C of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Congress inserted it between the two existing categories, Pub. L. No. 110-457, \u00a7 224(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20Stat.%205044\">\n    122 Stat. 5044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), further evidence that the entire list was not limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   and the enactment history of this statute lead me to the conclusion that the limitation at the end of the list does not apply to the first category in the list, a crime of violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   I realize that in reaching this conclusion I disagree with a handful of other district courts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Wis. 2008). But these cases simply announced their assertion that the limitation applies to crimes of violence and did not explain how they reached that conclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Crime of Violence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, I conclude that this defendant has pleaded guilty to a crime of violence. The Bail Reform Act has its own definition for crime of violence. It states (in the portion relevant to the dispute here):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The term \"crime of violence\" means-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (A) an offense that has as an element of the offense the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (B) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203156\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). This is a definition used in several places throughout the federal criminal code. The first portion is commonly called the \"force clause\" and the second is called the \"residual clause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties ask me to determine whether this defendant's crime is a crime of violence under the force clause, not the residual clause,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and they rely upon cases that arise in other contexts such as sentencing\n   and deportation. They agree that in my assessment, I should look not at the facts of the case, but only at the elements of the crime as the statute lists them. Gov't. Mem. at 3-4 (ECF No. 77); Def. Mem. at 7 (ECF No. 76). This is called the categorical approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the First Circuit said in\n   <em>\n    United States v.
