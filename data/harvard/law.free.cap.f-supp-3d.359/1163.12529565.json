D.E. 13. The Court has reviewed the Motion, the pertinent portions of the record and is otherwise fully advised in the premises. For the following reasons the motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are taken from the well-pleaded allegations in Plaintiff's amended complaint. D.E. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Broward County, Florida, whose primary business is e-commerce retail, selling products to consumers through online marketplaces. D.E. 11 \u00b6 1. Defendant is a Wisconsin corporation, with its principal place of business in Wisconsin that manufactures furniture to be sold to retailers like Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Early Relationship\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In mid-2013, Plaintiff and Defendant commenced a business relationship wherein Plaintiff would sell Defendant's products directly to consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Specifically, Plaintiff would receive orders from its customers, submit the orders to Defendant, Defendant would ship the orders directly to Plaintiff's customers, and Plaintiff would pay Defendant for these products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To memorialize this agreement, the parties entered into an Electronic Commerce Agreement that established a process by which Plaintiff could submit electronic orders to Ashley for fulfillment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8; D.E. 7-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Investments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 19, 2017, Defendant called Plaintiff to discuss Plaintiff's marketing of Defendant's products. D.E. 11 \u00b6 10. At this meeting, Defendant allegedly asked Plaintiff to invest in their relationship by augmenting Plaintiff's catalogue of Defendant's goods by adding images, content and other marketing investments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Defendant allegedly assured Plaintiff that if it undertook these investments, Defendant would commit more merchandise, support, and personnel to Plaintiff to ensure a successful long-term relationship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 31, 2017, Defendant allegedly requested that Plaintiff enter into a shipping relationship with a third party shipping company,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which Defendant allegedly knew would require Plaintiff to \"invest in expensive custom information technology\n   development.\" D.E. 11 at 3. To induce Plaintiff to enter into this agreement, Defendant allegedly asserted that it would grant Plaintiff access to more of its product line through the end of 2018 and that Defendant would provide Plaintiff with sufficient merchandise, discounts and incentives such that the investment would pay for itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. On September 28, 2017, Defendant contacted Plaintiff to follow up on the expansion of Plaintiff's shipping capabilities and also asked Plaintiff to run various marketing promotions for the 2018 calendar year. D.E. 11 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. Defendant reiterated that if Plaintiff ran these marketing promotions, Plaintiff would have the opportunity to sell Defendant's products throughout the entirety of 2018 and would earn back all of the money invested through discounts and incentives offered by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In mid-November 2017, Defendant asked Plaintiff to integrate its inventory system with Defendant, which Defendant allegedly knew would require Plaintiff to invest in expensive custom technology. D.E. 11 \u00b6 17. Defendant asserted that after making this investment, Plaintiff would have \"live\" access to Defendant's inventory throughout 2018 and be able to list Defendant's products immediately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Plaintiff also requested that Defendant update its product catalogue with Defendants new 2018 products, which Defendant allegedly knew would involve great cost.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Defendant also reiterated that Plaintiff would earn back all of the money invested through discounts and incentives offered by Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally on December 7, 2017, Defendant re-asserted all of the promotions and investments Defendant wanted Plaintiff to invest in and run until the end of 2018. D.E. 11 \u00b6 20. Defendant allegedly promised Plaintiff that in return for its efforts, Defendant would:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (i) support OJC through 2018 with personnel and promotions sufficient to regain its investments and profit; (ii) work together to ensure OJC could replicate the success of the 2017 holiday season throughout the entire 2018 calendar year; and (iii) promised that the year of 2018 would be the best year of its business relationship with OJC D.E. 11 \u00b6 23.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In reliance on these promises, Plaintiff spent significant resources preparing its 2018 offering of Defendant's products, including hiring data analysts, graphic designers, and expanding its shipping and programming systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Termination of Relationship\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 13, 2018, Defendant terminated its relationship with Plaintiff. D.E. 11 \u00b6 31. Defendant's stated rationale for the termination was that Defendant was changing its distribution strategy; the decision to terminate the relationship was not a result of any acts or omissions on the part of Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. Plaintiff alleges that as a result of its reasonable reliance on Defendant's representations and abrupt termination of its business, it has suffered damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Written Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While not attached by Plaintiff, Defendant's motion to dismiss attaches the parties' written E-Commerce Agreement, entered into on May 14, 2013. (the \"Agreement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   D.E. 13-1. The Agreement\n   sets out the framework in which the parties are to share information, advertising materials and order information to facilitate purchase and sale transactions. The Agreement is governed by Wisconsin law. D.E. 13-1 \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 25, 2018, Defendant removed the instant action to this Court. D.E. 1. On June 1, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss, D.E. 7, which was subsequently mooted by Plaintiff's amended complaint. D.E. 11. Plaintiff's amended complaint contains five counts under Florida law: breach of the oral contract, or in the alternative, promissory estoppel; fraudulent misrepresentation; negligent misrepresentation; and unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant then re-filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on July 2, 2018. The Motion is fully briefed and ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In order to state a claim, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" While a court, at this stage of the litigation, must consider the allegations contained in the plaintiff's complaint as true, this rule \"is inapplicable to legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

D.E. 11. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claims must be dismissed with prejudice because: (1) Plaintiff's claims are barred by the terms of the Agreement and Plaintiff should not be allowed to circumvent the terms of the Agreement; (2) Plaintiff's claims are barred by the Statute of Frauds; and (3) Plaintiff's complaint contains fatal pleading deficiencies. D.E. 13.

In support, Defendant argues that the Agreement states that \"All Transactions contemplated by this Agreement\n   <em>\n    subsequent to the execution of this Agreement\n   </em>\n   shall be controlled and governed by Ashley's Standard Terms and Conditions of Sale ....\" D.E. 13-1 at 4 \u00b6 8C (emphasis added). \"Transactions\" are defined as \"purchase and sale transactions.\" D.E. 13-1 at 2. Defendant also points to the Standard Terms and Conditions of Sale, which further state that \"[t]hese Standard Terms and Conditions of Sale ... shall govern and control all Transactions between [Plaintiff] and [Defendant].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 \u00b6 2. Defendant notes that pursuant to the Agreement and the Standard terms and Conditions of Sale, it has no obligation with respect to any purchase order unless Defendant has accepted and sent Plaintiff an \"Acceptance Document:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Acceptance:\n   </strong>\n   Acceptance by [Defendant] of all Purchase Orders is required and any such Purchase Order that has been properly received by Ashley shall not give rise to any obligation until [Defendant] has properly received in return an Acceptance Document (as specified in the Appendix) from [Defendant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   D.E. 13-1 at 4 \u00b6 C (emphasis in original).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant also points to the anti-waiver and merger clause in the Agreement which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Complete Agreement, Modifications.\n   </strong>\n   Each party acknowledges that it has read this Agreement in its entirety (including the Appendix and the Exhibit A Standard Terms and Conditions), understands it, and agrees to be bound by its terms.

No oral modification or waiver of any of the provisions of the Agreement shall be binding on either party and this Agreement may not be modified or altered except by written instrument duly executed by both parties.

These provisions are fatal to each of OJ's claims, all premised on the notion that Ashley orally agreed to continue the parties' business relationship through the end of the 2018 calendar year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   D.E. 13 at 8-9.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff responds that the Agreement is illusory because it only obligates Defendant to perform when Defendant unilaterally decides to perform and provides no remedies for breach. D.E. 18 at 5-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Plaintiff cites to Florida law to argue that the Agreement is illusory, the Agreement is governed by Wisconsin law.

Plaintiff concludes that as Defendant could have offered massive discounts and free merchandise, it was at least theoretically possible that these contracts could be fully performed, i.e. that Plaintiff could fully recoup its investment, within one year of entering into the relevant contract, thereby taking the claims out of the statute of frauds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This argument is unavailing.

For this same reason, Plaintiff's argument that it fully performed the agreement is unavailing as each agreement contemplates that\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   perform throughout 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brodie v.

Although the elements of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation are not exactly the same, the Court considers them together because, as Defendant points out, D.E. 13 at 14 n.9, Florida law holds that an action for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation\n   is barred by the statute of frauds if it is actually an attempt to indirectly recover damages for breach of an oral agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   While it is contended by plaintiffs that they are suing for damages for fraud and deceit, such an action under the circumstances of this case is simply an attempt in an indirect manner to obtain damages for breach of the contract. Since the provision in the statute prohibiting any action to be brought on an oral contract within the statute\n   <em>\n    includes actions based indirectly on the contract, an action for damages cannot be maintained on the ground of fraud in refusing to perform the contract\n   </em>\n   , even though the defendant at the time of the making of the oral contract may have had no intention of performing it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Canell v.

App. 1977) (citations omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Here, Counts Three and Four of Plaintiff's complaint can only be characterized as an attempt to indirectly obtain damages for breach of contract, and the Court thus holds they are barred by the statute of frauds. Indeed, the very first lines of Counts Three and Four indicate that they are merely an indirect breach of contract claim: \"[i]n the event this Court finds no contract exists, [Plaintiff] pleads in the alternative for fraudulent misrepresentation ....\" D.E. 11 \u00b6 46; D.E. 11 \u00b6 54 (\"[i]n the event this Court finds no contract exists, [Plaintiff] pleads in the alternative for negligent misrepresentation ....\"). Counts Three and Four further allege that the Defendant misrepresented that it would perform the contract: \"[Defendant made intentional false statements ... that it would continue its business relationship with [Plaintiff] throughout the 2018 calendar year.\" D.E. 11 \u00b6 47; D.E. 11 \u00b6 55 (\"[Defendant] made false statements of material fact to [Plaintifff] ... that it would continue its business relationship with [Plainttiff] throughout the 2018 calendar year ....\"). And that Defendant \"knew this representation to be false, as [Defendant] did not intend to maintain its business relationship with Plaintiff throughout the 2018 calendar year....\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49, and/or that Defendant's representatives \"were negligent in making this statement ... because they should have known that the statement was false and that [Defendant] did not intend to maintain its business relationship with Plaintiff throughout the 2018 calendar year....\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. Stated differently, Plaintiff's claim is that Defendant represented that it would perform the terms of the oral agreement(s), and knew these representations to be false or should have known they were false because Defendant did not intend to perform the agreement(s).

D.E. 18 at 20 (\"[Defendant] indicated it wanted to make this deal with [Plaintiff] because historically, [Plaintiff] had given them the most return on investment of any other vendor) (citing D.E. 11 \u00b6 24). Further Plaintiff alleged that Defendant's clients \"have not forgotten\" the benefit of the marketing. Lastly Plaintiff asserts that it alleged that the circumstances are such that it would inequitable for Defendant to retain the benefit without paying the value because it alleged that Defendant \"benefited from [Plaintiff's] marketing and promoting its products without payment.\" D.E. 18 at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant that this claim must be dismissed for failure to plausibly plead that \"the circumstances are such that it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying the value thereof to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Porsche Cars N.

As to retention of the benefit, Plaintiff asserted \"Consumers didn't magically forget those marketing efforts when [Defendant] terminated its relationship with [Plaintiff].\" D.E. 18 at 22. This does not plausibly allege that Defendant retained the benefit of the alleged marketing. As Defendant rightly notes, there is no allegation that Defendant is receiving increased sales from the marketing, nor does Plaintiff allege that it \"continues to market [Defendant's] products or, even if it did, why this would be beneficial to [Defendant] since [Plaintiff] is no longer authorized to sell its products.\" D.E. 19 at 10. Similarly, even if Plaintiff had plausibly alleged that Defendant had retained the benefit of the marketing, Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant did so \"without paying the value thereof to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Porsche Cars N.

Despite Plaintiff's claims to the contrary, Plaintiff's complaint does not assert\n   that Defendant failed to pay Plaintiff or otherwise provide consideration for the marketing and promotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.E. 11. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for unjust enrichment. The Court further finds that Plaintiff cannot amend the unjust enrichment claim because, as a matter of law, Plaintiff cannot allege any tangible benefits wrongfully retained by Defendant. If non-payment of accepted orders had occurred, Plaintiff could have, and presumably would have made, that clear in its Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   For the reasons set out above Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, D.E. 13, is GRANTED.

Plaintiff does not explain who \"Watkins Shepherd\" is, but the Court assumes for the purposes of this order that Watkins Shepherd is a shipping company. Presumably this alleged request was to facilitate the shipment of a larger number of Defendant's goods.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    In ruling upon a motion to dismiss, the district court may consider an extrinsic document if it is (1) central to the plaintiff's claim, and (2) its authenticity is not challenged.\n    <em>\n     SFM Holdings, Ltd. v.

The Agreement is plainly central to Plaintiff's claim and Plaintiff's response does not challenge its authenticity. Therefore the Court will consider the Agreement attached to Defendant's motion to dismiss. D.E. 7.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Plaintiff also argues that the terms of the Agreement itself do not bar its claims, but as the Agreement is illusory, the Court does not address this contention.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Defendant also argues that the Agreement is illusory because it provides no remedy for breach. D.E. 18 at 8. Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the only potential damages it could suffer are \"lost profits\" and because the Agreement prohibits Plaintiff from recovering \"lost profits,\" it provides no remedy for breach. The Court is unpersuaded; the Agreement provides that Plaintiff is entitled to creditor or replacement for defective parts, and the Agreement only limits damages for claims arising out of defects or inability to make use of Defendant's goods.

Under Florida law, the Court must apply the \"significant relationships test\" as set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 145 -148 (1971) to determine which state's substantive law will apply to tort claims.\n    <em>\n     Bishop v.

Under this test the Court must determine which State has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties by considering six distinct factors. Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 148 (1971). These factors also lead the Court to conclude that Florida law applies: Plaintiff acted on reliance on Defendant's representations in Florida, Plaintiff received the representations in Florida via telephone and via meetings at its facilities with Defendant's representatives; Defendant made some of the representations in Wisconsin, but also physically visited Plaintiff in Florida multiple times, Plaintiff has its headquarters in Florida and Defendant has its headquarters in Wisconsin, the oral contract and the place of performance were centered around the state of Florida as that is where Plaintiff's headquarters is and presumably where it invested in the infrastructure Defendant allegedly requested. Accordingly, the Court finds that Florida's statute of frauds also applies to Plaintiff's tort claims. Moreover, as with Plaintiff's contract claims, the parties apply Florida's statute of frauds in dispute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    \"Generally, the statute of frauds is an affirmative defense that cannot be raised in a motion to dismiss unless the complaint affirmatively shows the conclusive applicability of such defense to bar the action.\"\n    <em>\n     Conner, I, Inc. v.

As discussed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , the allegations in the complaint plainly show the applicability of the statute of frauds to bar the action and thus the Court finds that Defendant properly raised the statute of frauds in its motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Plaintiff alleges that this agreement was formed in Las Vegas, Nevada. D.E. 11 \u00b6 12. According to Florida's choice of law rules, Nevada law and thus Nevada's statute of frauds would apply to any breach of contract claim relating to this agreement.
