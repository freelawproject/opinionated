Specifically, there is record evidence that the subject merchandise is ready to be used \"as is,\" was sold [ [ ] ], given VAT-free treatment, and sold to customers who received shipment at facilities near ports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Maverick's] Case Br. at 9-13, CD 433, bar code 3301963-01 (Sept. 1, 2015) (\"Maverick's Agency Case Br.\") (citing [Maverick's] Comments on [ ] HYSCO's Suppl.

Commerce did not do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Further, Commerce could have, but did not, request copies of letters of credit that may have provided details on the challenged sales. Commerce explains that although it has reviewed letters of credit in past proceedings, such letters are not required under Korean law for a local sale to qualify for a VAT exemption and concluded that here such letters would likely not have been in HYSCO's control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 48. Yet, Maverick points to record evidence that at least some of the letters would have been in HYSCO's control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maverick's Br. at 33-34 (citing HYSCO's Verification Report at 8). In light of such evidence, it is not clear to the court how Commerce could reasonably reach the conclusion it did without at least inquiring about the letters of credit. On remand, Commerce may want to reopen the record to solicit relevant letters of credit or information related to such letters or further explain its determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

Defendant argues that Commerce's decision was in accordance with law and reasonable because Maverick's supplemental case brief raised issues that could and\n   should have been addressed in its primary case brief to the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Br. at 29-33. Defendant also argues that even if the arguments in Maverick's supplemental case brief were timely raised, Commerce's determination regarding what HYSCO knew or should have known about certain local sales included in its home market database is supported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-35.

Commerce requested that HYSCO revise its home market and U.S. sales databases using information already on the record and submit the revised databases by August 31, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Letter from Commerce to HYSCO Requesting Certain Revisions] at 1, Attach., PD 367, bar code 3300336-01 (Aug. 24, 2015) (\"Commerce's Letter Requesting Revisions\") (explaining that the requested revisions are based on corrections previously presented to Commerce on July 15, 2015, July 29, 2015, and August 5, 2015). Interested parties' case briefs were due on September 1, 2015. Petitioners' request for supplemental and rebuttal briefing states that HYSCO's revisions to the databases would affect \"a rather extensive number of sales transactions\" and that parties should be allowed to address \"issues related to changes made[.]\" [Petitioners'] Req. Suppl. Briefing Schedule at 1-2, PD 373, bar code 3301164-01 (Aug. 31, 2015) (\"Petitioners' Req.\"). Commerce granted the request, allowing interested parties to address the \"specific revisions made to the respondents' sales databases\" and for subsequent rebuttal briefing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Revision to Briefing Schedule, PD 374, bar code 3301243-01 (Aug. 31, 2015) (\"Revised Briefing Schedule\"). Accordingly, Commerce allowed parties to address the effects of HYSCO incorporating into the databases information that was already on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The language of the revised briefing schedule must be read in light of petitioners' request for supplemental and rebuttal briefing. The revised briefing schedule was established to accommodate petitioners' request to address issues arising out of the revisions HYSCO made to an \"extensive\" number of sales in its sales databases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Revised Briefing Schedule; Petitioners' Req. By revising the briefing schedule, Commerce implicitly recognized that HYSCO's revisions may affect the sales databases as a whole and that interested parties may not be able to meaningfully address any such effects in their initial case briefs. Commerce also granted an opportunity for rebuttal, which presupposes supplemental briefing offering analysis more meaningful than merely cross-referencing the revisions made and reporting any clerical errors. It does not make\n   sense for Commerce to provide rebuttal to identification of clerical errors. If Commerce wanted parties to review the revised databases for clerical errors, it should have been more specific in setting out the scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Commerce contends that Maverick's supplemental brief frequently commented on and cited to evidence that was on the record prior to HYSCO's submission of its revised databases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Commerce's Rejection of Maverick's Suppl. Case Br.] at 1, n.1, PD 407, bar code 3303866-01 (Sept. 9, 2015). However, in explaining what commentary would have been acceptable, Commerce includes \"quantitative analysis commentary based on the specific database revisions[.]\" [Commerce's Resp. to Maverick's Req. to Reconsider] at 2, PD 412, bar code 3304271-01 (Sept. 10, 2015). It is reasonable to expect that a revision to one field of a database can have implications for other entries/fields. To meaningfully address the revisions HYSCO made, interested parties must have been able to address how HYSCO's revisions affected the sales reported. Commerce cannot now claim that Maverick exceeded its scope for supplemental briefing by providing analysis on the effect HYSCO's revisions had on the databases. On remand, Commerce must review and place on the record those portions of Maverick's supplemental case brief that address the effect HYSCO's revisions had on the sales databases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant argues that, even if timely raised, the arguments in Maverick's supplemental case brief do not detract from the reasonableness of Commerce's determination to include certain local sales in HYSCO's home market sales database.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Br. at 33-35. As explained above, to determine whether a respondent properly classified a sale as a home market sale Commerce must diligently inquire into what the respondent knew or should have known regarding the ultimate disposition of that sale and address any record evidence that would detract from its determination. Here, Maverick's supplemental case brief advances arguments regarding what HYSCO knew or should have known about the ultimate disposition of the challenged sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Maverick's Br. at 39-43. To the extent that these arguments arise as a result of the revisions HYSCO made to its sales databases and are relevant to what HYSCO knew or should have known about the challenged sales, Commerce must address them in its remand redetermination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's decision to reject portions of SeAH's case brief is sustained; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's application of the differential pricing analysis is sustained; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's calculation of credit expenses on SeAH's back-to-back sales is sustained; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's decision not to collapse two grade codes for the purposes of model matching is sustained; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's decision to include certain local sales in HYSCO's home market sales database is remanded for further explanation or reconsideration consistent with this opinion; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce shall review and determine which portions of Maverick's supplemental case brief should be retained, consistent with this opinion, and place those portions on the administrative record; and it is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce shall file its remand redetermination with the court within 90 days of this date; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the parties shall have 30 days thereafter to file comments on the remand redetermination; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the parties shall have 30 days to file their replies to comments on the remand redetermination.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    On April 28, 2016, the following actions, Stupp Corp. v.
