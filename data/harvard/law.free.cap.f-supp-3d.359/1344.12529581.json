Like the Export Buyer's Credit Program, the purpose of the Export Seller's Credit Program is \"to [provide] support [for] the export of [Chinese] products and improve their competitiveness in the international market.\" Investigation Final IDM at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Countervailing Duty Investigation of Chlorinated Isocyanurates\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The countervailability of the export buyer's and seller's credit programs arose in the original investigation of chlorinated isocyanurates from China, the only prior segment of this proceeding. During the investigation, the Department found that the Export Buyer's Credit Program was not used by the relevant customers of either of the mandatory respondents in the investigation, Hebei Jiheng Chemical Co. Ltd. (\"Jiheng\") and Juancheng Kangtai Chemical Co. Ltd. This finding was based on declarations of non-use in which the respondents' customers \"certified that they did not receive any financing from China ExIm.\" Investigation Final IDM at 15. Commerce found that it was able to partially verify these statements. Thus, the Department did not countervail the Export Buyer's Credit Program during the original investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As to the Export Seller's Credit Program, however, Commerce determined that the program was countervailable. The record showed that mandatory respondent\n   \"Jiheng reported that it had outstanding financing under the export seller's program during the [period of investigation].\" Investigation Final IDM at 14. Moreover, the Department observed that, in a separate proceeding,\n   <em>\n    Citric Acid and Certain Citrate Salts From the People's Republic of China\n   </em>\n   , it had countervailed the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Investigation Final IDM at 14 (citing\n   <em>\n    Citric Acid and Certain Citrate Salts From the People's Rep. of China\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C836\">\n    74 Fed.

Further, it asserted that none of its relevant customers used the Export Buyer's Credit Program during the POR, and filed three customer declarations certifying their non-use of the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heze's Sec. III Quest. Resp. (May 16, 2016), C.R. 17-22 at 10-11.

Quest. Resp. (Feb. 15, 2017), C.R. 83, Ex.

Resp. (May 16, 2016), P.R. 30 at 7. Echoing Heze's claims regarding its customers' non-use of buyer's credits, the GOC stated that \"[n]one of the [mandatory] respondent's customers used Export Buyer's Credits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   GOC's Third\n   Suppl.

In response to the Department's request for the 2013 internal guidelines, the GOC declined to provide them, stating that China ExIm's \"2013 guidelines are internal to the bank, non-public, and not available for release.\" GOC Third Suppl. Quest. Resp., Ex. S3-1 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Based on the responses of Heze and the GOC, the Department made a preliminary finding that Heze did not use the Export Seller's Credit Program during the POR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. Dec. Mem. at 16. With respect to the Export Buyer's Credit Program, however, Commerce continued to seek more information from the GOC about the operation of the program, and how it may have changed because of the 2013 amendments, and stated that it would publish its findings on the use of this program in a post-preliminary results memorandum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. Dec. Mem. at 17. For Commerce, understanding the 2013 amendments was necessary \"to fully analyze whether the current program is run in the same manner\" as it was in the past. Post-Prelim. Results Dec. Mem. (May 31, 2017), P.R. 112 (\"Post-Prelim. Mem.\") at 4 (stating China ExIm is \"the primary entity that possesses the supporting information and documentation that are necessary for the Department to fully understand the operation of the program which is prerequisite to the Department's ability\n   <em>\n    to verify the accuracy of the respondents' claimed non-use of the Export Buyers Credit program.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Commerce then issued additional supplemental questionnaires in which it first asked the GOC to provide \"a list of all partner/correspondent banks involved in disbursement of funds under the Export Buyer's Credit program.\" Post-Prelim. Mem. at 4. Instead of providing this information, however, the GOC stated that it was \"unable to provide the information requested because China Ex-Im [had] determined that none of the respondent companies' customers received Export Buyer's Credits or otherwise used this program during the POR.\" Post-Prelim. Mem. at 4-5. Thereafter, the Department told the GOC that it was not requesting a list of partner/corresponding banks involved in disbursement of funds under the Export Buyer's Credit Program\n   <em>\n    to the specific respondent companies\n   </em>\n   , \"but rather [it was] requesting a list of the partner/corresponding banks involved in disbursement of funds under the Export Buyers Credit program\n   <em>\n    to all companies that participated in this program.\n   </em>\n   \" Post-Prelim. Mem. at 5. In response, the GOC again stated that \"none of the respondents' U.S. customers used this program,\" and did not provide the requested list. Post-Prelim. Mem. at 5. At no point, including in the Post-Preliminary Memorandum, did Commerce say why it needed this information or connect its request with respondents, respondents' products, or their customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, Commerce asked the GOC for information on \"the interest rates established during the POR for [the Export Buyer's Credit Program] for all types of financing provided by China Ex-Im, all loan terms and all denominations.\" Post-Prelim. Mem. at 5. The GOC failed to provide this information, too. According to Commerce:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Instead of providing the requested information, the GOC stated the question was \"Not applicable\" because none of the respondents' U.S. customers used this program. We again requested this information from the GOC, clarifying that the Department was not requesting that the GOC provide respondent-specific information, but was requesting information\n   on the interest rates established during the POR for every type of financing that all companies received under this program. Instead of providing the information requested, the GOC again noted no respondents['] U.S. customers used this program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Post-Prelim. Mem. at 5. As with its initial questions, while Commerce made more specific what information it sought, it at no point in the proceedings said why it wanted this information or tied its request to the respondents, their products, or their customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, Commerce asked the GOC for \"original and translated copies of any laws, regulations or other governing documents\" cited by the GOC in its questionnaire responses that were pertinent to the elimination, in 2013, of a minimum contract amount of $ 2 million. Commerce stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [R]ecord information indicates that for a business contract to be supported by the Export Buyers Credit, the contract amount must be more than two million U.S. dollars. Information on the record indicates that the GOC revised this program in 2013 to eliminate this minimum requirement. We requested that the GOC provide original and translated copies of any laws, regulations or other governing documents cited by the GOC in response to our question on this program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Post-Prelim. Mem. at 5. In response, the GOC stated that the $ 2 million threshold requirement appeared for the first time in the 2000 Rules Governing Export Buyers' Credit, and that China ExIm \"confirmed to the GOC that, although the Export-Import Bank adopted in 2013 certain internal guidelines, those internal guidelines do not formally repeal or replace the provisions of [the 2000 rules] ... which remain in effect.\" GOC Third Suppl. Quest. Resp., Ex. S3-1 at 3. In other words, for the GOC, the $ 2 million requirement was not changed by the 2013 amendments. Although for Commerce the information on 2013 program revisions (including the internal guidelines) was \"necessary for the Department to analyze how the program functions,\" it at no point said why, or explained how, this information was pertinent to the respondents, their products, or their customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Prelim.

Commerce's Facts Otherwise Available and Adverse Inference Determinations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the Post-Preliminary Memorandum, Commerce found that the GOC withheld information that Commerce requested and significantly impeded the proceeding. This conclusion was based on Commerce's claim that, without the requested information, Heze's claims that its customers did not use the Export Buyer's Credit Program were not verifiable. Therefore, Commerce determined that to fill the gaps in the record the use of facts otherwise available was warranted pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a) (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Prelim.

Therefore, applying adverse facts available, Commerce determined that Heze \"used and benefited from [the Export Buyer's Credit] program, despite [its] claims of non-use and certifications of non-use from [its] customers.\" Final DM at 6. In other words, even though there was record evidence indicating that Heze had not used or benefitted from the Export Buyer's Credit Program, and no\n   record evidence that indicated that it had used or benefitted from the program, Commerce, employing adverse facts available, determined that Heze had used and benefitted from the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Prelim.

Commerce's Use of Adverse Facts Available Is Neither Supported by Substantial Evidence Nor in Accordance with Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the pertinent decision memoranda, Commerce stated that the use of facts available was warranted because the GOC withheld necessary information,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , information \"that would permit [Commerce] to make a determination as to whether [the Export Buyer's Credit Program] constitutes a financial contribution and whether this program is specific.\" Post-Prelim. Mem. at 6; Final DM at 6. For Commerce, this information included (1) whether China\n   ExIm uses third-party banks to disburse/settle export buyer's credits, (2) the interest rates it used during the POR, and (3) whether China ExIm limits the provision of export buyer's credits to business contracts exceeding $ 2 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Prelim. Mem. at 6; Final DM at 6. For Commerce, the GOC was \"the primary entity that possesses the supporting information and documentation that are necessary for the Department to fully understand the operation of the program\" and determine if it was run in the same manner as it was prior to the suspected 2013 amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Prelim. Mem. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   According to Commerce, the information it requested would have provided it with a complete understanding of how the Export Buyer's Credit Program operated, which was necessary, in its view, to verify claims that neither Heze nor its customers\n   <em>\n    used\n   </em>\n   the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final DM at 13 (finding that the requested information was \"necessary for the Department to fully understand the operation of the program which is prerequisite to the Department's ability to verify the accuracy of the respondents' claimed non-use of the program.\"). Moreover, the Department found that without the requested information, such claims of non-use were unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final DM at 13 (\"Absent the requested information, the GOC's claims that the respondent companies did not use this program are not reliable,\" and \"without a full and complete understanding of the involvement of third-party banks, the respondent companies' (and their customers') claims are also not reliable.\"). Beyond this rather broad statement, though, the Department does not tie its inquiries to Heze, its products, or its customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In addition, Commerce applied an adverse inference, finding that the GOC failed to act to the best of its ability to provide the information that Commerce asked for about the Export Credit Buyer's Program and its operation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final DM at 6. Although the record evidence of non-use indicated otherwise, Commerce nevertheless drew the adverse inference that Heze \"used and benefitted from this program, despite the claims of non-use and certifications of non-use from [Heze's] customers.\" Post-Prelim. Mem. at 6; Final DM at 6. Thus, as adverse facts available, Commerce determined that the Export Buyer's Credit Program constituted a financial contribution to Heze and met the specificity requirements of the statute, and that Heze benefitted from the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Prelim. Mem. at 6; Final DM at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Heze argues that Commerce's decision to use adverse facts available was unreasonable. First, for Heze, resort to facts available was unlawful because the record contained sufficient information for the Department to analyze the operation of the Export Buyer's Credit Program-in particular, statements by the GOC that the 2013 amendments to the program did not repeal or replace the then-existing rules that governed that program. With respect to the internal guidelines of China ExIm that were revised in 2013, Heze acknowledges that the GOC refused to release these guidelines but claims that, since record evidence showed that none of its buyers used the program, the information was unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heze's Reply Br. 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Thus, Heze insists that based on its questionnaire responses, especially the\n   certifications of its customers, \"[t]he record evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that [Heze] did not use or benefit from [the Export Buyer's Credit Program].\" Heze's Br. 5. In other words, Heze placed on the record a total of forty-four customer declarations\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   each of which certified the customer \"has not financed any purchases from Heze ... through the use of the Import-Export Bank of China's export buyer's credit program\"; and \"has never used the Import Export Bank of China's financing (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 'Buyer's Credit program') in any way\"-statements that the GOC echoed in its questionnaire responses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heze's Sec. III Quest. Resp., Ex. 9; Heze's Third Suppl. Quest. Resp., Ex. SQ3-1, SQ3-2; GOC's Third Suppl. Quest. Resp. at 2 (\"None of the [mandatory] respondent's customers used Export Buyer's Credits.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Heze also maintains that the responses provided by the GOC indicate that Heze and its customers \"must be aware of whether they used and benefitted from the program.\" Heze's Br. 5. Specifically, Heze points to the GOC's statements that China ExIm conducts post-loan verification activities that require \"consistent and active\" engagement by the exporter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heze's Br. 6 (\"It is inconceivable that [Heze] would not be aware that it was a beneficiary of the Ex-Im Bank's Buyer's Credit Program under these circumstances.\"). In other words, because of the way the program operates in practice, Heze and its customers would have direct knowledge that they used or benefitted from the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Further, Heze argues that pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e),\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"the Department must use the record information necessary to the determination even when it does not meet all of the Department's requirements.\" Heze's Br. 7 (citing \u00a7 1677m(e)(1)-(5) ). Accordingly, for Heze, \"the record evidence simply does not support the Department's assessment that respondents used or benefitted from the China Ex-Im Export Buyer's Credit Program,\" and Commerce could have conducted verification to prove it. Heze's Br. 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court finds that Commerce's use of adverse facts available is neither supported by substantial evidence nor in accordance with law. Under the plain language of the statute, Commerce must resort to facts available only when \"\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   information is not available on the record,\" or an interested party withholds information or significantly impedes a proceeding. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(1)-(2)(A), (C) (emphasis added). Here, Heze and the GOC provided a good deal of evidence that Heze's U.S. and non-U.S. customers did not use the Export Buyer's Credit Program-evidence that, in accordance with the Department's past practice, was sufficient to demonstrate non-use. Nonetheless, Commerce claims that it was lawful to\n   employ adverse facts available because the GOC failed to provide information in its possession with respect to \"(1) whether it uses third-party banks to disburse/settle Export Buyer's Credits, (2) the interest rates it used during the POR, and (3) whether ... China ExIm limits the provision of export buyer's credits to business contracts exceeding USD 2 million.\" Post-Prelim. Mem. at 6. Defendant maintains that the Department could use adverse facts available because \"the lack of information impeded Commerce's ability to analyze [the Export Buyer's Credit Program] and verify respondents' claims of non-use.\" Def.'s Br. 15. The problem with this argument, however, is that Commerce failed to adequately answer the question why-why was the requested information necessary for Commerce to make its determination under these facts?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This Court has looked at similar requests by Commerce on three occasions. In the first case,\n   <em>\n    Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co. v.

Commerce, however, did not explain why the GOC's failure to explain this program was necessary to assess claims of non-use and why other information accessible to respondents was insufficient to fill whatever gap was left by the GOC's refusal to provide internal [China ExIm] bank records. Further, Commerce did not explain how an adverse inference regarding the operation of the [Export Buyer's Credit Program] logically leads to a finding that respondents used the program. The use of facts available allows Commerce to render ... detailed reasoning for why documentation from the GOC was necessary. Here, Commerce provided reasoning as to why the GOC's failure to respond adequately made it impossible for it to understand fully the operation of the [program], but it failed to show\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   a full understanding of the [program's] operation was necessary to verify non-use certifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   42 CIT ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528903\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/352/1316/#p1328\">\n    352 F.Supp.3d 1316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1326,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206271651\">\n    2018 WL 6271651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Slip Op. 18-166 at 10 (Nov. 30, 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Changzhou II\n   </em>\n   \") (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Changzhou I\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on its facts from this case, and\n   <em>\n    Guizhou\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Changzhou II\n   </em>\n   are instructive as to the correct result here.\n   <em>\n    Changzhou I\n   </em>\n   is different because there, (1) Commerce actually went to China to verify the questionnaire responses but was denied access to China ExIm's records, and (2) Commerce provided at least a plausible reason for needing the information it requested. In particular, the Court found reasonable Commerce's explanation as to why the denial of access to China ExIm's records made it impossible to verify whether any of Changzhou's purchasers participated in the program. That is, without an understanding of an exporter's role in its customer's application for a loan under the Export Buyer's Credit Program, conducting a verification of that exporter's books and records would be useless because Commerce would not know what it was looking for, or what might be missing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Changzhou I\n   </em>\n   , 40 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175457\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/195/1334/\">\n    195 F.Supp.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Guizhou\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Changzhou II\n   </em>\n   , on the other hand, the record contained evidence of non-use that was similar to the declarations of non-use placed on the record in this case-evidence that Commerce itself had found sufficient in the past. Also, in neither case did Commerce explain why it needed the missing information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   It is important to keep in mind that a determination concerning the presence or absence of a subsidy revolves around whether \"the manufacture, production, or export\" of particular \"merchandise\" has been subsidized.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201671\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Thus, a determination as to whether the use of facts available or adverse facts available is lawful depends on whether the information missing from the record relates to the \"manufacture, production, or export\" of that \"merchandise.\" If it does not, the information is not \"necessary\" and so the application of neither facts available nor adverse facts available is lawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(1) (authorizing the use of facts available if \"necessary information is not available on the record\"), (b) (authorizing use of adverse inferences).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Here, in its explanation of its decision to use adverse facts available, Commerce has failed to say how the information it sought relating to: (1) whether China ExIm uses third-party banks to disburse/settle export buyer's credits; (2) the interest rates the bank used during the POR; (3) whether\n   the bank limits the provision of export buyer's credits to business contracts exceeding $ 2 million; and (4) suspected amendments to the internal procedures for the Export Buyer's Credit Program, is necessary to make a determination of whether the manufacture, production, or export of Heze's merchandise has been subsidized. While Commerce is, no doubt, curious as to all of the inner workings of many Chinese programs, mere curiosity is not enough. Commerce must either provide an adequate answer as to why the information it seeks \"to fully understand the operation of the program\" is necessary to fill a gap as to Heze's products and their sale, or rely on the information it has on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As to Commerce's claim that it needed the information to verify Heze's questionnaire responses, here, too, the Department has failed to say why. The questions Commerce asked do not seem designed to elicit information that would tend to prove or disprove the record evidence establishing that Heze's purchasers did not use the program. That is, Heze's questionnaire responses and the forty-four declarations of non-use by its U.S. and non-U.S. customers stated that Heze did not directly or indirectly use or benefit from the Export Buyer's Credit Program. Additionally, the GOC's statements support Heze's claims of non-use. As in\n   <em>\n    Changzhou II\n   </em>\n   , here \"Commerce provided reasoning as to why the GOC's failure to respond adequately made it impossible for it to understand fully the operation of the [program], but it failed to show why a full understanding of the [program's] operation was necessary to verify non-use certifications.\"\n   <em>\n    Changzhou II\n   </em>\n   , 42 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528903\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/352/1316/#p1328\">\n    352 F.Supp.3d at 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Slip Op. 18-166 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Therefore, Commerce's use of facts available cannot be sustained because the Department has failed to show that the information it seeks is necessary to its determination. Thus, Commerce, by failing to tie its facts available determination (and therefore its adverse facts available determination) to Heze, its products, or its customers, did not comply with the statute. Nor did Commerce support with substantial evidence its necessary conclusion that there were gaps in the record evidence that could only be filled with the GOC's responses to its questionnaires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Commerce's Use of the 0.87 Percent Rate as Adverse Facts Available for the Export Buyer's Credit Program Is Supported by Substantial Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In the Final Results, Commerce selected the 0.87 percent subsidy rate as the adverse facts available rate for the Export Buyer's Credit Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final DM at 14. In making this selection, Commerce applied its judicially-approved adverse facts available hierarchy method used in reviews:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   To select an [adverse facts available] subsidy rate, Commerce first attempts to apply the highest, above\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   subsidy rate calculated for the identical program from any segment of the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Absent a calculated above de minimis subsidy rate from an identical program, the Department then seeks a subsidy rate calculated for a similar program.\n   </em>\n   Absent such a rate, the Department then resorts to the third step in its hierarchy, an above\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   calculated subsidy rate for any program from any [countervailing duty] proceeding involving the country in which the subject merchandise is produced, so long as the producer of the subject merchandise or the industry to which it belongs could have used the program for which the rates were calculated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    Essar Steel Ltd. v.

Cir. 2014) (citations omitted; emphasis added). Applying the second step of this method, Commerce found that the Export Seller's Credit Program qualified as a \"similar\" program within any segment of the same proceeding,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the investigation segment, and that the highest non-\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   rate calculated for a cooperating respondent for the Export Seller's Credit Program was 0.87 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Clearon does not challenge Commerce's method as inconsistent with the statute. Rather, it questions Commerce's selection of the 0.87 percent rate on substantial evidence grounds. First, noting that Commerce preliminarily selected the rate of 10.54 percent, it argues that, in comparison, the 0.87 percent rate selected in the Final Results is not sufficiently adverse to incent the GOC to cooperate in future proceedings (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to deter non-cooperation).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clearon's Br. 15. For Clearon, \"Commerce precedent establishes that the 0.87 percent rate applied here is not a deterrent. In fact, the [GOC] has routinely failed to provide information requested by the Department regarding the Export Buyer's Credit program,\n   <em>\n    even in cases in which Commerce assigned 10.54 percent as the [adverse facts available] rate.\n   </em>\n   \" Clearon's Br. 15. Therefore, Clearon maintains that \"the application of a lower rate [than 10.54 percent] will not provide any meaningful incentive to the [GOC] ....\" Clearon's Br. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, Clearon contends that Commerce has failed to explain adequately its conclusion that the Export Seller's Credit Program and the Export Buyer's Credit Program are, in fact, similar. Clearon argues that \"[t]he only similarity between these programs ... is that both programs are export credits. Fundamentally, credits paid to the seller are different from credits paid to buyers, which here not only include direct purchasers but may also include other 'importers' and even lending institutions.\" Clearon's Br. 18-19. Also, Clearon maintains that since the GOC failed to provide information about both the Export Seller's Credit Program and the Export Buyer's Credit Program, Commerce had no evidentiary basis to conclude that the two programs were similar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clearon's Br. 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   If, on remand, Commerce continues to find that Heze used and benefitted from the Export Buyer's Credit Program, and the court sustains that determination, the Department may continue to use the 0.87 percent rate. Notwithstanding Clearon's arguments against the 0.87 percent rate, Commerce's selection of this rate is supported by substantial evidence, for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   First, Clearon has not shown that the 0.87 percent rate here is unreasonably low to deter future non-cooperation. Clearon cites this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    RZBC Group Shareholding Co. v. United States\n   </em>\n   , upholding 10.54 percent as the adverse facts available rate for the Export Buyer's Credit Program. 41 CIT ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271096\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1196/\">\n    222 F.Supp.3d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). There, the Court sustained Commerce's corroboration of the 10.54 percent rate, which was based on secondary information,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the rate that Commerce had assigned to a comparable lending program in a separate proceeding:\n   <em>\n    Coated Paper From the People's Republic of China.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether or not a rate was\n   corroborated, however, has little to do with its deterrent effect. Moreover, whether a rate is sufficient to encourage cooperation in the future is based on Commerce's consideration of the facts. For example, even if the 0.87 percent rate might appear low in comparison to the 10.54 percent rate, its inclusion in the calculation of Heze's rate increased its rate by approximately 100 percent to 1.91 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Moreover, the record supports Commerce's finding that the Export Buyer's Credit Program and the Export Seller's Credit Program are \"similar,\" for purposes of its adverse facts available hierarchy method. While not of ideal clarity, Commerce's reasoning is discernable from the Final DM:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Regarding the rate to be applied to [the Export Buyer's Credit Program], upon consideration of post-preliminary comments, we agree with the GOC and Heze that the rate for the Export Seller's Credit Program from the investigation qualifies as a similar program within any segment of the same proceeding according to step two of the [adverse facts available] hierarchy for reviews. On this basis, we have adjusted the [adverse facts available] rate to 0.87 percent\n   <em>\n    ad valorem\n   </em>\n   , the rate calculated for Jiheng for the Export Seller's Credit Program in the investigation, for these final results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Final DM at 14. Among the arguments in the post-preliminary comments was that the Export Seller's Credit Program \"is the counterpart of the Export Buyer's Credit program,\" in that \"[b]oth are administered by the China Ex-Im Bank with the same goal of supporting the export of Chinese products and improving their competitiveness in international markets, and the Department analyzes the loans together.\" Heze's Comments on Post-Prelim. Results (June 2, 2017), P.R. 114 at 10-11 (citing Final DM at 14, Heading 3 titled \"Export Seller's and Buyer's Credits from Export-Import Bank of China.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SolarWorld Americas, Inc. v.

It is worth noting that while Clearon maintains that the credits paid to export sellers are \"different\" than credits paid to export buyers, it does not put forth any evidence showing that the programs are entirely dissimilar. Nor does it argue that the programs have aims other than supporting the export of Chinese goods and services or that subsidies of similar amounts could be deemed to achieve each program's goals. Rather, Clearon contends that \"[t]he only similarity\" between the Export Seller's Credit Program and the Export Buyer's Credit Program \"is that both programs are export credits.\" Clearon's Br. 18. Even if that were the case, on this record, it was not unreasonable for Commerce to conclude that this similarity was enough to justify finding that the two programs were similar for purposes of applying its adverse facts available rate selection method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION and ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Based on the foregoing, it is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Final Results are sustained in part and remanded; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that, on remand, Commerce issue a redetermination that complies in all respects with this Opinion and Order, is based on determinations that are supported by substantial record evidence, and is in all respects in accordance with law; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that, on remand, Commerce shall explain how the information it sought as to (1) whether China ExIm uses third-party banks to disburse/settle export buyer's credits; (2) the interest rates the bank used during the POR; (3) whether the bank limits the provision of export buyer's credits to business contracts exceeding $ 2 million; and (4) suspected amendments to the internal procedures for the Export Buyer's Credit Program, is necessary to make a determination of whether the \"manufacture, production, or export\" of Heze's merchandise has been subsidized, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201671\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).
