Varlan, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This civil action is before the Court on defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [Doc. 109]. Defendant filed this motion on April 3, 2018, and plaintiff responded on April 25, 2018 [Doc. 111]. Defendant replied on May 1, 2018 [Doc. 113]. For the reasons set forth below, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Summary of Allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This civil action arises out of the construction of Legacy Pointe Apartments (\"the Project\"), an apartment complex in Knox County, Tennessee [Doc. 86 p. 2]. Defendant is a Tennessee limited liability company formed to construct the Project [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff was one of four partners who undertook this business venture and served as general contractor on the Project, while defendant held title to the Project's real property and entered into financing covenants with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") and HUD lenders [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. The Project was financed through a loan offered and insured by HUD and underwritten by Wells Fargo (\"Lender\") pursuant to the HUD \u00a7 221(d)(4) program authorized by the National Housing Act [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 5]. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715l(d)(3) and (d)(4) (2011). Under section 221(d)(4), defendant and each investor in defendant were bound to certain financing requirements, one of which provided that defendant and its investors could not enter into private secondary financing for the Project or receive any distributions during the term of the construction financing [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Construction Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 13, 2007, the parties entered into a cost-plus construction contract for the Project (\"the Construction Contract\"), which provided that plaintiff would be paid the actual cost of the Project's construction and would additionally receive an equity interest in the Project in lieu of a monetary fee [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Specifically, plaintiff received a ten-percent ownership interest in defendant, which is referred to in the contract as \"BSPRA,\" a HUD acronym for Builder's and Sponsor's Profit and Risk Allowance [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Construction Contract required plaintiff to furnish defendant with payment and performance bonds (\"Payment and Performance Bonds\") issued by the Great American Insurance Company (\"GAIC\") to assure completion of the work as specified in the Drawing and Specifications of the\n   Project [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Any changes to the Drawing and Specifications had to be approved in writing by Lender and the HUD Commissioner, and defendant had a duty to initiate and approve change orders in good faith for all work it requested of plaintiff outside of the scope of the Drawings and Specifications [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7]. On September 4, 2007, the parties, GAIC, and others entered into an Indemnity Agreement related to the Payment and Performance Bonds and on September 13, 2007, the same day that the parties entered into the Construction Contract, plaintiff obtained the Payment and Performance Bonds from GAIC in the amount of $18,047,049 [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Also on September 13, 2007, the HUD loan closed, and construction on the Project commenced [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6]. Defendant executed a Mortgagor's Certificate, which provided \"upon completion of the Project there will not be outstanding any unpaid obligations contracted in connection with the purchase of the property, construction of the Project or the mortgage transaction except that such obligations may be approved by [HUD] as to term, form, and amount\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, during the course of construction, defendant unilaterally modified the Drawings and Specifications for the Project in violation of the parties' previous agreement and that these changes created significant extra work for plaintiff that was outside the scope of the Construction Contract [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7]. Plaintiff also alleges that defendant did not submit these changes for approval to HUD and Lender and did not submit change orders [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff alleges that, because of these changes, it performed work in excess of the contract amount by approximately $2,120,537.85 and that this amount remained outstanding to subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers (the \"Claims for Extra Work\") [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under the Construction Contract defendant was obligated to pay plaintiff for all amounts incurred in connection with the Project, and plaintiff in turn was to pay subcontractors for any work performed [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8]. Prior to the closing of permanent financing for the project, on January 11, 2009, an outside certified public accountant reviewed financial statements in connection with defendant's final cost certification to HUD [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. The auditor advised defendant that the extra amounts expended by defendant above and beyond the Construction Contract \"are reconciled to the balance sheet and could represent a distribution and will have to wait for surplus cash later\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff alleges that defendant did not inform plaintiff of the auditor's red flag and was in fact told by defendant that it should not discuss cost certification with the auditor [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Later that month, plaintiff alleges, defendant promised to pay the outstanding Claims for Extra Work, totaling $2,120,537.85, to the respective subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers directly if plaintiff waived its right to receive payment for all amounts owed under the Construction Contract. Plaintiff was told that defendant intended to borrow funds from defendant's manager and majority member, Harold Moore, to pay the Claims for Extra Work directly, and thereby discharge plaintiff's liability for payment both to the subcontractors and on the Project's Payment and Performance Bonds [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff alleges that it relied on this representation and waived its right to receive the payment (\"the 2009 Agreement\"). This agreement was allegedly memorialized in February 2009, when defendant promised plaintiff and represented to HUD and the Lender in writing that the funds defendant borrowed from its manager and majority member would be used to pay the Claims\n   for Extra Work and defendant would repay this loan with its surplus cash [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that at this time, unbeknown to plaintiff, defendant took the funds it borrowed from its managing member and fraudulently transferred them to a shill entity, State Insulation, LLC (\"Defendant Affiliate\") for no consideration [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2]. Defendant Affiliate then took assignment of the subcontractor claims but did not discharge those claims as promised to plaintiff [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Instead, plaintiff alleges that defendant and Defendant Affiliate colluded in asserting the subcontractor claims Defendant Affiliate had obtained by assignment against the Payment Bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Permanent Financing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 31, 2009, the Project auditor submitted a development cost audit for the Project to defendant. The audit represented that defendant owed plaintiff $3,585,516 as \"Construction Payable,\" which represented the BSPRA and the Claims for Extra Work [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9]. Plaintiff states that it did not demand this payment because the BSPRA amount had been contributed as \"sweat equity\" in order to receive a 10 percent membership interest in defendant, and plaintiff was relying on the 2009 Agreement for defendant to directly pay the subcontractors the Claims for Extra Work and thereby discharge plaintiff's liability [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2010, defendant secured a thirty-year loan offered and insured by HUD pursuant to HUD's \u00a7 221(d)(4) program [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3]. To secure this loan, defendant had to make certain representations to HUD and Lender, including that all claims resulting from the construction of the Project had been paid [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Defendant did so, making representations that all claims had been paid, excepting approximately $500,000, which defendant represented would be paid through escrow within forty-five days, and that there were no outstanding debts to subcontractors, vendors, and suppliers [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7]. Plaintiff alleges that defendant made this statement knowing that it was false, that those debts had in fact been improperly assigned to Defendant Affiliate, and that Defendant Affiliate was preparing to make a fraudulent claim against the Payment Bond on behalf of those amounts [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff protested defendant's representation to HUD and the Lender and refused to join defendant's statement [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Suit Against GAIC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 23, 2009, Defendant Affiliate filed a complaint against GAIC, the insurer of the Payment Bond, in the Chancery Court for Knox County, Tennessee, making a claim against the Payment Bond plaintiff had provided for the Project [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Defendant Affiliate asserted that plaintiff had failed to pay the Claims for Extra Work and asked for $2,120,537.85 in addition to costs, prejudgment interest, and attorneys' fees (the \"Bond Claim Action\") [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11]. Plaintiff alleges that defendant knew of this suit but did not disclose its existence to HUD or the Lender [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. On September 30, 2011, GAIC filed an interpleader complaint (\"Interpleader Action\") in the Chancery Court for Knox County, Tennessee pursuant to a settlement agreement it reached with Defendant Affiliate and defendant, and sought to deposit to the court $750,000 of funds it held as security for the Payment Bond [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. On December 20, 2011, defendant and Defendant Affiliate filed an answer to GAIC's complaint and asserted a counterclaim against GAIC and a cross-claim against plaintiff, among others, in the Interpleader Action, arguing that Defendant Affiliate was entitled to the deposit, plus interest [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. On June 6, 2012, Defendant Affiliate and GAIC dismissed the Bond Claim Action without prejudice. Plaintiff notes that on November 23, 2013, defendant's managing member represented in a declaration filed\n   in an action pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, that the claims of the subcontractors in the Project, in the amount of approximately $2.1 million, had been paid. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Refinancing of the Thirty-Year Loan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2012, defendant refinanced its thirty-year loan under HUD's \u00a7 221 program with a new HUD lender, Greystone Financial (the \"New Lender\") [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. As part of this refinancing, defendant executed a Regulatory Agreement, certifying again that defendant had no unpaid obligations with respect to the mortgaged property and that all contractual obligations of defendant or on behalf of the defendant were fully disclosed to HUD [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At or around the time of the closing of this refinancing, defendant executed a Surplus Cash Note to its member manager Harold Moore in the amount of $2,474,322 (the \"Surplus Cash Note\") [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that defendant obtained HUD's required consent for this Surplus Cash Note by falsely representing to HUD that the managing member had lent $2,120,537.85 to defendant to pay for the Claims for Extra Work, and would be repaid out of surplus cash from defendant [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13]. Plaintiff alleges that in reality the funds had been transferred to Defendant Affiliate for no consideration in order for Defendant Affiliate to purchase the Claims for Extra Work and pursue a claim against the Payment Bond [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff alleges that this scheme would allow for an illegal triple recovery of the Claims for Extra Work: first from the proceeds of a false claim against the Payment Bond, second from the proceeds from the of repayment of the Surplus Cash Note, and third by failing to pay defendant's original obligation to plaintiff for the Claims of Extra Work [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the close of the 2012 refinancing, defendant again needed to, and did, make representations to HUD under penalty of perjury in a Certificate that no unpaid obligations from the Project remained outstanding [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff alleges that defendant made these representations again knowing them to be false and further without disclosing Defendant Affiliate's recently dismissed litigation against GAIC, the Interpleader Action which alleged the existence of outstanding unpaid obligations, the outstanding construction payable to plaintiff, and defendant's Surplus Cash Note [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff states that it refused to provide its consent to this refinancing, believing it to be obtained under false pretenses and tainted by fraud, and advised defendant that seeking HUD refinancing under false pretenses was wrongful [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Retaliation Against Plaintiff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that defendant retaliated against it because it maintained that the refinancing was wrongful and stated that, as a ten-percent member of defendant, its consent should have been required [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15]. First, on or about April 2014, plaintiff alleges that defendant took actions to repudiate and eliminate plaintiff's ten-percent membership in defendant [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Second, plaintiff alleges that defendant filed a state-court action in Tennessee Circuit Court to divest plaintiff of its membership interest in defendant and to divest plaintiff of its economic rights to the BSPRA [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Third, plaintiff alleges that on January 17, 2014, defendant and Defendant Affiliate filed an amended counterclaim and crossclaim in the Interpleader Action asserting therein a new claim of $2.1 million for damages against plaintiff for the Claim for Extra Work [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16]. In the amended claims, defendant and Defendant Affiliate\n   alleged that plaintiff had failed to pay the Claims for Extra Work to Defendant Affiliate, which had been assigned these claims from the subcontractors. Plaintiff states that these Claims for Extra Work are the same Claims that defendant agreed in February of 2009 to pay directly to the subcontractors [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that defendant and Defendant Affiliate's amended counterclaim and crossclaim revived plaintiff's right to original payment by defendant for Claims for Extra Work. Plaintiff asserts that any statute-of-limitations defenses are waived by defendant or are equitably estopped due to plaintiff's justified reliance on the 2009 Agreement, and due to defendant's ongoing concealment and misrepresentations to HUD, the Lender, and the New Lender (\"the Lenders\") that defendant had or would be paying the subcontractor claims directly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff states that defendant continues to maintain the Interpleader Action against plaintiff and continues to assert that plaintiff owes Defendant Affiliate $2.1 million for the Claims for Extra Work. Plaintiff asserts that defendant owes plaintiff $3,585,516, which accounts for the value of the BSPRA and approximately $2,120,537.85 for the extra costs plaintiff expended related to the Claims for Extra Work done outside of the Drawings and Specification plans [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 10, 2015, plaintiff filed a Complaint against defendant alleging violations of the False Claims Act (\"FCA\"), the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), and several state law claims [Doc. 1]. Plaintiff updated its complaint in a Second Amended Complaint filed on June 28, 2017 [Doc. 86]. On July 12, 2017, defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim [Doc. 89]. On March 14, 2018, the Court denied with leave to refile defendant's Motion to Dismiss, stating that defendant should file an answer to plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint before refiling its motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, raise the same arguments in a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment [Doc. 105]. Defendant answered plaintiff's complaint on March 28, 2018 [Doc. 107], and on April 3, 2018, defendant filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [Doc. 109].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, defendant presents several arguments. First, with respect to the FCA claim, defendant states that plaintiff's retaliation claim should be dismissed because the Act is not intended to cover plaintiff or the retaliatory acts that plaintiff is alleging [Doc. 109-1 at 5]. Alternatively, defendant argues that plaintiff's retaliation claim is time-barred by the applicable three-year state of limitations [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. Second, with respect to the RICO claim, defendant states that the claim is invalid because plaintiff does not and cannot allege a pattern of racketeering activity, a necessary element of the claim [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13]. Alternatively, defendant states that plaintiff's claim is time-barred by the applicable four-year statute of limitations [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16]. Finally, defendant argues that, should the Court dismiss the two federal claims, it should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17]. However, defendant states that even if the Court chooses to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, the state claims are time-barred by the applicable statutes of limitation [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff filed a response in opposition to this motion [Doc. 111] and defendant replied [Doc. 113]. Accordingly, this matter is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff's complaint\n   must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Though the statement need not contain detailed factual allegations, it must contain \"factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

The first two are related: defendant argues that plaintiff is not a cognizable entity under the FCA because plaintiff is not an \"employee, contractor, or agent\" as contemplated in the Act and, accordingly, also was not \"discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed, or in any other manner discriminated against\n   <em>\n    in the terms and conditions of employment.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) (2006) (emphasis added). Defendant also argues that plaintiff's retaliation claim is time-barred [Docs. 109-1, 111]. For the reasons that follow, defendant's positions are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As an initial matter, the FCA applies to plaintiff. Plaintiff has pled facts sufficient to demonstrate that it is a contractor as contemplated in the Act. The plain language of the statute makes clear that section 3730(h) remedies are available to employees, contractors, and agents. Giving the term \"contractor\" its plain meaning, plaintiff has clearly alleged facts sufficient to show that it was one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Potts v.

Plaintiff was the general contractor for the Project, as memorialized in the parties' Construction Contract [Doc. 86-1]. Plaintiff contracted with defendant to oversee construction of the Project in exchange for monetary and proprietary compensation. Therefore, plaintiff is considered a contractor and has alleged facts sufficient to show a contractual relationship with defendant as contemplated in section 3730(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Further, case law supports the holding that section 3730(h) means what is says: that relief is available to those who retain an employment, contractual, or agency relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Plaintiff contracted with defendant to serve as general contractor for the Project. Plaintiff therefore contracted to provide services and do work for defendant in exchange for compensation. These provisions-in a contract between plaintiff, a general contractor, and defendant-fall within the phrase \"terms and conditions of employment\" as understood in the FCA. The structure and history of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) require this conclusion. The statute provides a remedy for \"employees, contractors, or agents\" who are discriminated against \"in the terms and conditions of employment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) (2006). These terms appear to contradict one another: contractors and agents normally do not have \"terms of employment,\" as those terms are used in legal parlance. One of the terms therefore must yield.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   But the parties disagree about which term that should be. Defendant interprets the language \"terms and conditions of employment\" as requiring parties to maintain a conventional 'employment-like relationship,' in order to seek relief under section 3730(h) [Doc. 109-1 p. 6]. Defendant thus seems to understand this term as extending only to conventional employer-employee relationships, and reads the Act as amended to cover contractors and agents who, although called such, nevertheless operate under a traditional, common law-type employment relationship. Defendant asserts that there was no employment relationship of this kind between plaintiff and defendant, and so no discrimination with respect to any terms and conditions of their contract is applicable to the claim [Doc. 113 p. 5]. Plaintiff argues to the contrary, stating that the Act's scope was expanded more substantially to cover contractors and agents more generally, and that the terms and conditions of its employment by defendant are laid out in the Construction Contract and 2009 Agreement. Plaintiff further asserts that these terms were violated when defendant retaliatorily withheld plaintiff's compensation and equity when plaintiff refused to condone or cooperate in defendant's alleged fraudulent misrepresentations to HUD [Doc. 111 p. 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff has the better of the argument. First, relevant rules of statutory construction dictate that later-in-time amendments of statutory provisions govern.\n   <em>\n    Detroit Receiving Hosp. and Univ. Health Ctr. v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4035057\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/609/#p615\">\n    575 F.3d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615 (6th Cir. 2009). The terms \"contractor\" and \"agent\" were added to the FCA in 2009, expanding the scope of cognizable plaintiffs beyond the original \"employee.\" Therefore, the focus must be on the relevant agreement which houses the terms and conditions of a cognizable party's-be it an employee, contractor, or agent-employment. If the phrase \"in the terms and conditions of employment\" means what defendant says-that the FCA, despite clearly applying to contractors and agents, also requires a common law understanding of an employment-like relationship, the Act would be limited in ways that fail to comport with the plain\n   meaning of its terms and would need to be construed contrary to relevant rules of statutory construction. It is difficult to see why Congress would have written the Amendments to provide such a nonsensical result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Other courts have also found that employment-like relationships now cover agent and contractor work arrangements more generally. For example, the Fifth Circuit, has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The 2009 amendment requires that courts must expand the class of defendants beyond just employers but not interpret that expansion as a license to sue anyone.... One of the district courts recognized there still must be an employer-type relationship, an articulation we can accept if the meaning is confined to the three types of relationships listed in the statute. Defendants, then, must be those by whom plaintiffs are employed, with whom they contract, or for whom they are agents. In addition, the retaliatory action must be related to terms and conditions of employment, or the contract, or agency relationship.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

However, the Court disagrees with defendant's reading of\n   <em>\n    Vander Boegh\n   </em>\n   and finds, as discussed above, that the statute's 2009 amendments widened coverage for FCA retaliation beyond what defendant submits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Vander Boegh\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit discussed in dicta the court system's evolving understanding of the term \"employee\" as used in the FCA.

Defendant states that under the Construction Contract any money owed to plaintiff would necessarily have been due and payable in 2009 when the Project closed [Doc. 86-1]. Defendant argues that because plaintiff failed to commence this suit by 2012 this claim must fail. Defendant also states that any claims for alleged retaliation occurring after 2012 are not cognizable under section 3730(h) because they do not arise from acts of discrimination 'in the terms and conditions of employment' [Doc. 109-1 p. 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Court disagrees with defendant, and instead holds that section 3730(h) applies to retaliatory actions defendant allegedly took against plaintiff after its role as general contractor ended that involve \"the terms and conditions of [its] employment.\" Section 3730(h) of the FCA states \"a civil action under this subsection may not be brought more than 3 years after the date when the retaliation occurred.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(3) (2006). Courts vary in opinion on whether, for a claim to be cognizable, that retaliation must occur before an employment, contractual, or agency relationship has ended, or whether any exceptions should exist to an otherwise bright line rule. The Court notes as an initial matter that the plain language of section 3730 does not contain any temporal restrictions on when alleged retaliation must occur to be cognizable.

In contrast, plaintiff in this case alleges that defendant seeks to divest plaintiff of its ownership interest in defendant and that defendant refuses to pay agreed upon fees relating to plaintiff's services as the general contractor [Doc. 86 p. 18]. The retaliatory actions alleged by plaintiff then, relate directly to the terms and conditions of compensation owed to plaintiff under the Construction Contract. Although these alleged actions took place between 2013 and 2015, well after the 2009 completion of the Project construction, they do involve the terms and conditions of employment and therefore are cognizable under section 3730(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This ruling also comports with the holding in\n   <em>\n    Fitzsimmons v.

Plaintiff alleged that defendant engaged in discriminatory actions cognizable under section 3730(h) when it improperly withheld payments due to plaintiff under the termination provision of his employment agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. This alleged retaliation occurred after plaintiff left defendant's employ, and plaintiff sought to allege FCA protection for post-termination retaliation. Although the court acknowledged that the majority of courts have found that section 3730(h) does not provide a remedy for post-termination retaliation, it noted that no court had been confronted with the issue of improper reimbursement for money owed, post-termination, under terms and conditions of an employment contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court held that plaintiff alleged facts sufficient to survive a motion for judgment on the pleadings, stating \"the Employment Agreement makes plain that this compensation would not occur while [plaintiff] was an employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court found that any temporal limitation to the alleged retaliatory acts did not defeat claims made for payment as outlined in the terms and conditions of an employment agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Like\n   <em>\n    Fitzsimmons\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff here is bringing a claim for retaliatory action under section 3730(h) for discriminatory acts which occurred after the relevant employment relationship ended, but which relate to post-termination compensation as laid out in the Construction Contract. The Construction Contract states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The balance due the [plaintiff] hereunder shall be payable upon the expiration of 30 days after the work hereunder is fully completed ... With its final application for payment by [defendant], [plaintiff] shall disclose, on a form prescribed by the Commissioner, all unpaid obligations contracted in connection with the work performed under this Contract. [Plaintiff] agrees that within 15 days following receipt of final payment, it will pay such obligations in cash and furnish satisfactory evidence of such payment to [defendant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [Doc. 86-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Construction Contract therefore envisions that final payment will occur after work under the Contract has been completed. Plaintiff alleges that this Contract was amended in February 2009 when defendant promised plaintiff that it would pay the outstanding Claims of Extra Work directly, as opposed to giving the money to plaintiff to distribute accordingly [Doc. 86 \u00b6 21]. Plaintiff states that it relied on this representation, which was memorialized in representations defendant made to HUD and Lender in writing that same month [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Fitzsimmons\n   </em>\n   , the Court will not, at this early stage of pleading, find that section 3730(h)'s protections categorically cannot extend to claims for post-termination payments that are set forth in the terms and conditions of plaintiff's employment contract or any document that memorializes amendments to the contract. Plaintiff's 3730(h) retaliation claim alleges discriminatory actions relating to the terms and conditions of its employment as general contractor. Plaintiff alleges that the Construction Contract was updated to reflect payment for services performed which would take place after the Project ended. Plaintiff further alleges that defendant reneged on its obligations under this updated Contract and moreover discriminated against plaintiff based on the terms and conditions set forth and agreed upon by the parties when plaintiff refused to\n   condone or cooperate with defendant's allegedly fraudulent statements to HUD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to plausibly meet each element of a \u00a7 3730(h) claim. In order to state a claim for relief from retaliatory discharge under section 3730(h) a plaintiff must show: (1) it was engaged in a protected activity; (2) its employer knew that it was engaged in the protected activity; and (3) the employer discharged or otherwise discriminated against it as a result of the protected activity.\n   <em>\n    Yuhasz v. Brush Wellman, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9099630\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/341/559/#p566\">\n    341 F.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 566 (6th Cir. 2003) (citing\n   <em>\n    McKenzie v.

Plaintiff adequately alleged it engaged in protected activity when it refused to cooperate or provide consent to the 2012 refinancing of the Project based on defendant's alleged false statements to HUD. Plaintiff has also adequately pled that defendant knew of plaintiff's protected activities by alleging that it advised defendant's agents and attorneys that it would not provide consent to the 2012 refinancing because it believed the financing was being obtained under false pretenses that were fraudulent and wrongful [Doc. 86 \u00b6 41]. Finally, plaintiff sufficiently alleges discrimination as a result of its protected activities. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that as a result of its protected activities defendant sought to divest plaintiff of its ownership interest in defendant and improperly reimbursed plaintiff for money owed under the Construction Contract [Doc. 86 p. 18]. Accordingly, the Court will not currently dismiss plaintiff's Count One and determines that summary judgment would be a more suitable stage to determine the extent that the FCA contemplates recovery for plaintiff's post-termination retaliation.

Pattern\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant argues in its Motion to Dismiss that plaintiff's allegations of racketeering activity do not constitute a \"pattern\" as required by the RICO statute. Specifically, defendant argues that plaintiff has failed to plead a continuous pattern of criminal activity and has only plead a single scheme with a single victim. [Doc. 109-1 p. 14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   RICO provides that a 'pattern of racketeering activity' \"requires at least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after [October 15, 1970] and the last of which occurred within ten years (excluding any period of imprisonment) after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) (2010).

Plaintiff's complaint alleges several victims, including itself, HUD, both Lenders, the title insurer, the bond surety, and various indemnitors on the bond. Further, it does not matter for purposes of victim identification that these other entities are not party to this suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edmondson &amp; Gallagher v.

Additionally, the alleged predicate acts have the same purpose, which was to allow defendant to falsify the status of the Claims for Extra Work. Finally, the alleged predicate acts have the same result, which was to divert payment of funds that rightfully belonged to others to defendant and Defendant Affiliate.

The parties disagree, however, about when that breach occurred: according to defendant, any breach would have occurred in August 2009, per the terms for final payment in the Construction Contract, however plaintiff maintains that the breach occurred in January 2014, when defendant repudiated its representations and promises to pay the Claims for Extra Work as outlined in the 2009 Agreement [Doc. 109-1 p. 18; Doc. 111 p. 19].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   This fact dispute precludes dismissal at this stage of the litigation.

However, the Court reaffirms its reasoning to find that, at this point in the litigation, plaintiff can plead express and implied contract claims as alternatives. Defendant's Motion as to Claims Three and Four is therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Defendant argues that this claim should be dismissed because T.C.A. \u00a7 66-11-106's statute-of-limitation period has run. This argument is baseless. Plaintiff has not pled under T.C.A. \u00a7 66-11-101, and therefore any statute-of limitations-arguments based on that statute are inapposite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, plaintiff's claim is not subject to dismissal for its not being brought under T.C.A. \u00a7 66-11-101 ; defendant cites no case law requiring plaintiff to bring its claim under that statute, and the Court has likewise found none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   What plaintiffs do request is a constructive trust to protect its interest in any converted funds fraudulently withheld by defendant.

Defendant argues that under either theory a claim must fail if plaintiffs do not establish that the racketeering activity is ongoing or could occur in the future. However, the Court concludes that defendant misinterprets the word \"continued\" so as to render close-ended continuity redundant at best or oxymoronic at worst. As the court explained in\n    <em>\n     H.J.\n    </em>\n    , the concept of continuity as used in the phrase \"continued criminal activity\" can refer to \"either a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213827\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/229/#p239\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213827\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/229/#p239\">\n     at 241\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213827\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/229/#p239\">\n     109 S.Ct. 2893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Therefore, a plaintiff must show that the predicate acts continued for a substantial period of time (close-ended continuity), or, if not enough time has passed, that the acts continue to occur or there is a threat of future illegal activity (open-ended continuity).\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     H.J.

Often a RICO action will be brought before continuity can be established in [a close-ended] way. In such cases, liability depends on whether the threat of continuity is demonstrated.\"). In essence, the difference between these terms is timing, dependent on whether predicate acts have continued for a sufficient period of time so as to bring a close-ended claim or whether the predicate acts do not fully demonstrate a RICO violation and so continuing or future acts must be plead to fully develop the claim. Therefore, the Court finds that plaintiff can successfully bring a RICO complaint without showing that the criminal activity is currently underway or will continue in the future.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Even if the Court were to consider defendant's argument under T.C.A. \u00a7 66-11-102, as noted earlier in this opinion, it would be better suited for a Rule 56 motion because \"[a] plaintiff generally need not plead the lack of affirmative defenses to state a valid claim.\"\n    <em>\n     Paulin v.
