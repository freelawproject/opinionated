Brinkema, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Richard Roe (\"Roe\") and Victor Voe (\"Voe\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   are members of the United States Air Force who have been diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus (\"HIV\") and who face imminent separation from service. Roe and Voe-together with plaintiff OutServe-SLDN, Inc. (\"OutServe\"), an organization representing the interests of veterans, active-duty servicemembers, and civilian employees of the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\") who are LGBTQ+ or HIV positive-bring this action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the DoD. Plaintiffs' complaint contains five counts. Count I, asserted against all defendants, alleges that defendants' policies with respect to the deployment and separation of HIV-positive servicemembers, on their face and as applied to Roe and Voe, violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Counts II and III, which are asserted only against the Secretary of the Air Force,\n   allege that the decisions to separate Roe and Voe were arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). Finally, Counts IV and V allege that several of defendants' policies \"are based on outdated thinking that does not comport with the current state of HIV medical science\" and that defendants' failure to update those policies amounts to an independent violation of the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs have moved for a preliminary injunction preventing Roe and Voe, along with similarly situated servicemembers, from being discharged\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because of deployment restrictions due to their HIV status. Plaintiffs argue that injunctive relief is necessary to preserve the status quo pending final disposition of their constitutional and administrative law claims. Defendants oppose plaintiffs' motion and have moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that plaintiffs' claims are premature and nonjusticiable; that plaintiffs are not entitled to injunctive relief; and that the scope of any relief granted must be limited to Roe and Voe.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties have fully briefed and argued their motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, defendants' motion to dismiss will be denied, and plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

Compl. for Declaratory &amp; Injunctive Relief [Dkt. No. 1] (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 57. He enjoyed early signs of success, including being promoted to Senior Airman ahead of schedule and successfully testing for Staff Sergeant, a noncommissioned officer rank, on his first try.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Roe hoped to make the Air Force his lifelong career and one day commission as an officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Roe's upward trajectory was halted in October 2017, when he was diagnosed with HIV while on active duty. Compl. \u00b6 59. He began antiretroviral treatment immediately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That treatment requires him to take one pill per day; the pills are stored in an\n   ordinary pill bottle, and his prescription is refilled every 90 days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ever since he began treatment, Roe's \"viral load\"-the number of copies of the HIV virus per milliliter of his blood-has registered as \"undetectable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 59. He alleges that because of his successful treatment, he remains physically and mentally capable of continuing to serve in the Air Force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because Roe had tested positive for HIV, Air Force regulations required that he \"undergo [a] medical evaluation for the purpose of determining [his] status for continued military service.\" Air Force Instruction (\"AFI\") 44-178, \u00a7 2.4, at A298-99.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In late November 2017, he received a Duty Limiting Condition Report restricting his deployability pending a Medical Evaluation Board's (\"MEB\") determination of his fitness for duty. A568. The MEB was convened in January 2018. A554. Roe's commanding officer submitted an impact statement to the MEB affirming that despite Roe's diagnosis, he could \"perform all duties without work-arounds, restrictions or limitations.\" A556. The commanding officer's recommendation was unambiguous: \"[Roe] is a valued team member. Recommend retention.\" A557. The commanding officer made clear that his recommendation would not change even if Roe were to be put on an assignment limitation code that could restrict his deployability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Several other servicemembers likewise submitted letters on Roe's behalf. A562-66. Also before the MEB was a physician assistant's report prepared in January 2018 after a physical examination of Roe. The physician assistant wrote that although Roe would require ongoing antiretroviral treatment, he was asymptomatic and complication-free. A586-88. In response to a question asking whether \"any of [Roe's] HIV-related illnesses or complications affect his ... ability to work,\" the physician assistant selected \"No.\" A588. An earlier report by an Air Force physician, also part of the record before the MEB, recommended that Roe be returned to active duty. A574.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The MEB did not order Roe retained and returned to duty. Instead, it opted to refer Roe's case to an Informal Physical Evaluation Board (\"IPEB\"). A554. The IPEB issued its findings and recommendation on February 22, 2018. A549. Although the IPEB's report \"acknowledge[d] the commander's recommendation for retention and statement that [Roe] is able to perform his daily in-garrison duties,\" it also asserted that Roe's condition \"is subject to sudden and unpredictable progression\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and would \"result in deployment restrictions that prevent him from being fully worldwide qualified.\" A550. As a result, the IPEB concluded that Roe's HIV status was \"unfitting\" and \"[in]compatible with the fundamental expectations of military service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The IPEB recommended that Roe be discharged from the Air Force. A549.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Roe appealed the IPEB's decision to the Formal Physical Evaluation Board (\"FPEB\"). Compl. \u00b6 65. As part of the formal record of his appeal, Roe submitted a letter from the director of the HIV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   medical evaluation unit and infectious disease service at a military medical center. In the letter, the director opined that Roe \"has no physical limitation that would prevent him from conducting his duties\" and recommended that he be returned to active duty. A484. Roe also submitted letters from fellow servicemembers in support of his retention, a recent fitness report reflecting good scores, and commendations he had received during his time in service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A482-548. A formal hearing was held before the FPEB in early April 2018. A481. The hearing lasted less than 30 minutes, and the FPEB affirmed the IPEB's decision roughly three hours later. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. The FPEB, like the IPEB before it, recognized that Roe was successfully being treated and was asymptomatic. A481. It also acknowledged the commanding officer's recommendation that Roe be retained as well as Roe's \"record of performance during his five years of military service and the numerous letters of support for his retention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nonetheless, the FPEB stated that under military regulations, Roe's HIV status was \"disqualifying for deployment\" to the Central Command (\"CENTCOM\") area of responsibility,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   which \"would have [a] significant effect on his career progression and place [an] increased burden on others within his career field.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the FPEB concluded that Roe's condition \"is\n   <em>\n    unfitting\n   </em>\n   for continued military service\" and reaffirmed that he should be discharged. A480-81 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Roe appealed the FPEB's findings and recommendation to the Secretary of the Air Force, arguing that his condition \"is simple to manage and does not place an undue burden on the Air Force.\" A471. He also argued that the FPEB's analysis was inconsistent with applicable Air Force regulations, which provide that \"HIV seropositivity alone is not grounds for medical separation\" and that HIV-positive servicemembers \"who are able to perform the duties of their office, grade, rank and/or rating ... may not be separated solely on the basis of laboratory evidence of HIV infection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, he challenged the assertion that his condition rendered him nondeployable, asserting that under the applicable regulations, HIV renders a servicemember nondeployable only \"with the presence of progressive clinical illness or immunological deficiency\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   -both of which he claimed were absent in his case. A471-72. Counsel was also appointed to represent Roe before the Secretary. Roe's counsel argued that the IPEB and the FPEB were \"feign[ing] fealty to the DoD (and by extension Air Force) policy on retaining HIV [-] infected members, but us[ing] the bludgeon of world-wide qualification to effectively bash the policy aside.\" A465.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The deputy director of the Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council (\"SAFPC\"), acting on authority delegated by the Secretary of the Air Force, rejected Roe's appeal on November 7, 2018. The decision, which refers to Roe as \"the member,\" states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Roe's] case was considered by the Air Force Personnel Board (AFPB), which made a recommendation regarding its disposition. The following rationale is provided for the final decision in this\n   case. The Board considered the member's contention that he is fit and should be returned to duty. The Board noted the member has been compliant with all treatment, is currently asymptomatic, and has an undetectable [HIV] viral load. Additionally, he is able to perform all in[-]garrison duties, has passed his most recent fitness assessment without any component exemptions, and his commander strongly supports his retention. However, the Board noted the member's condition precludes him from being able to deploy world-wide without a waiver and renders him ineligible for deployment to the [CENTCOM] Area..., where the majority of Air Force members are expected to deploy. Deployability is a key factor in determining fitness for duty and the Board recognized the member belongs to a career field with a comparatively high deployment rate/tempo. Therefore, based on his inability to deploy and considering his current career point, the Board determined he is unfit for continued military service and shall be discharged with severance pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A460. Roe was advised that he had the \"right to pursue further appeal\" by applying to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (\"AFBCMR\"). A462. He has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Roe is scheduled to be discharged from the Air Force on March 28, 2019. Pls.' Memo. Ex. A [Dkt. No. 44] \u00b6 7. His term of service had been set to expire in mid-2018 but was twice extended as he underwent the medical evaluation and administrative appeals process. Compl. \u00b6 74. But for his impending discharge date, Roe's term of service (considering the extensions he received) would have expired on June 25, 2019. Pls.' Memo. Ex. A [Dkt. No. 44] \u00b6 6. He alleges that he intended to reenlist for an additional term of service but was prevented from doing so because of the separation process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Victor Voe\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Voe enlisted in the Air Force in 2011. Compl. \u00b6 77. He has served in several countries overseas and in 2014 was deployed to the Middle East.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. Like Roe, Voe is dedicated to service in the Air Force. Indeed, after his first period of service in the Middle East, Voe voluntarily cut short the \"dwell time\" between deployments so that he could return for a second tour ahead of schedule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Voe was diagnosed with HIV in March 2017. Compl. \u00b6 79. He immediately began antiretroviral treatment, and since August 2017 his viral load has remained undetectable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Voe takes two pills, at the same time, per day; those pills are stored in ordinary pill bottles and are refilled every 90 days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80. Voe claims that because of the treatment, he is asymptomatic and wishes to continue serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After his diagnosis, Voe's case proceeded in lockstep with Roe's. Voe's deployability was restricted, and his case was referred to an MEB for initial evaluation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A768. Voe's commanding officer prepared an impact statement for the MEB in which she stated that Voe was \"fully capable of performing any activity/function\" necessary for his career field. A763. The commanding officer endorsed Voe unreservedly: \"Member superiorly performs all primary duties and has also volunteered with enthusiasm for several on/off base organizations/ function[s]. He is overall a valuable [Air Force] asset. Retain.\" A764. The commanding officer indicated that her recommendation would not change even if Voe were to be placed on an assignment limitation code that could limit his deployability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The MEB found that Voe's HIV status made his \"qualifications ... for worldwide duty questionable\" and referred his case to\n   an IPEB. A761. The IPEB acknowledged the recommendation of Voe's commanding officer but found that Voe's\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   medical condition prevents him from reasonably performing the duties of his office, grade, rank or rating; represents a medical risk to the health of [Voe] or the health/safety of others with continued service; is subject to progression; requires frequent follow-up with a medical specialist; and limits [Voe's] ability to meet mobility requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A758.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the IPEB concluded that Voe's condition was \"unfitting\" and \"incompatible with the rigors of military service\" and recommended that he be discharged. A757-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Voe appealed to an FPEB. His formal hearing before the FPEB lasted only twenty minutes. Compl. \u00b6 84. Less than an hour after the hearing had concluded, the FPEB affirmed the IPEB's recommendation that Voe be discharged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The FPEB acknowledged that Voe's \"condition is welled [sic] controlled\" and that he was asymptomatic. A756. But the FPEB found that because Voe would need \"frequent follow-up[s] with a specialist\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and had been classified as nondeployable, his HIV condition made him \"\n   <em>\n    unfitting\n   </em>\n   for continued military service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Voe appealed to the SAFPC, which (acting on authority delegated by the Secretary of the Air Force) rejected the appeal on November 7, 2018-the same day Roe's appeal was rejected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   A748. The reasons given for denying Voe's appeal were identical to those provided in Roe's case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [Voe's] case was considered by the Air Force Personnel Board (AFPB), which made a recommendation regarding its disposition. The following rationale is provided for the final decision in this case. The Board considered the member's contention that he is fit and should be returned to duty.

But for Voe's impending discharge, his term of service (taking into account the extensions he received) would extend until June 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   HIV epidemiology has undergone drastic changes since the disease first came to the public's attention in the 1980s. Compl. \u00b6 49. The first sea change involved the means of treatment. Beginning in the mid-1990s, antiretroviral medications were developed that, if taken consistently, can effectively reduce a patient's viral load to zero.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. Those medications have negligible side effects and can prevent the type of immunological deficiencies and opportunistic infections typically associated with HIV and the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (\"AIDS\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-52. HIV remains incurable but is no longer a death sentence. When diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately, it \"is a chronic, manageable condition\" that does not substantially reduce a person's life expectancy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Another major development in the science and study of HIV relates to methods of transmission. HIV is not as easily transmitted as many people believe. For example, the highest-risk sexual activity-engaging in an act of receptive anal sex with an untreated HIV-positive person without using a condom or other means of prophylaxis-carries a risk of transmission of only 1.38%. Compl. \u00b6 54. Other sexual activities pose transmission risks ranging from 0% to 0.08%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Apart from sexual activities, only sharing needles, blood transfusions, and perinatal exposure pose a noneligible risk of transmission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\"), HIV transmission through other means such as biting or accidental contact with bodily fluids \"is technically possible but unlikely and not well documented.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, when an individual's viral load has been effectively suppressed by antiretroviral treatment, the risk of transmission is essentially reduced to zero.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Regulatory and Administrative Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   An intricate web of regulations, policies, and procedures govern the Armed Forces's treatment of servicemembers diagnosed with HIV.

The Air Force's main policy is set out in AFI 44-178, which implements DoDI 6485.01 with respect to the \"identification, surveillance, and administration\" of Air Force members diagnosed with HIV. A294. HIV-positive individuals may not enlist in the Air Force. AFI 44-178, \u00a7 2.2.1, at A298.

For years, \"nearly all cases of asymptomatic HIV resulted in a return to duty.\" A416. That changed in 2017, when the Air Force issued a memorandum stating that any asymptomatic HIV-positive servicemember would be medically evaluated and possibly referred to the DES. A341. The memorandum reiterates AFI 44-178's policy that \"[a]symptomatic HIV alone is not unfitting for continued service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Air Force reaffirmed that policy in a memorandum issued in June 2018, A338, and provided that all HIV-positive members would be evaluated for continued service in the same manner \"as any Airman with a chronic and/or progressive disease,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Under the terms of the 2018 memorandum, no servicemember may be referred into the DES unless specific criteria are met.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Those criteria are set out in DoDI 1332.18:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   [M]edical authorities will refer eligible Service members into the DES who:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (1) Have one or more medical conditions that may, individually or collectively, prevent the Service member from reasonably performing the duties of their office, grade, rank, or rating ...;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (2) Have a medical condition that represents an obvious medical risk to the health of the member or the health or safety of other members; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (3) Have a medical condition that imposes unreasonable requirements on the military to maintain or protect the Service member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   DoDI 1332.18, enclosure 3, app. 1, \u00a7 2(a), at A26.

In both cases, the lawsuit posed a genuine risk of preempting the agency's deliberative processes and wasting crucial resources, and accordingly the policy concerns underlying the exhaustion doctrine were at their apex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Those concerns are diminished to the vanishing point in this case. Roe and Voe did not seek judicial review without having given the Air Force a meaningful opportunity to examine its policies and decisions. To the contrary, they presented their claims to a complex, tiered administrative review process-one that involved medical evaluations, written submissions, and formal hearings-culminating in an extensive administrative record and final written decisions by the SAFPC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A460 (\"The following rationale is provided for the final decision in this case.\"); A747 (same);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AFI 36-3212, \u00a7\u00a7 5.1-.9 (setting out procedures for the SAFPC's \"final review and disposition\" of a servicemember's appeal (capitalization altered) ). Indeed, an official whose affidavit defendants submitted characterized the SAFPC \"as the decision authority for a wide array of personnel decisions made by the Air Force\" and \"as, effectively, the final appeal authority for Airmen evaluated by the DES prior to their separation from Active Duty.\" A420. Thus, Roe and Voe substantially exhausted the administrative review mechanisms available to them, a fact which undercuts defendants' argument that this lawsuit is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Although Roe and Voe stopped short of applying to the AFBCMR, plaintiffs have persuasively demonstrated that requiring appeals to the AFBCMR as a prerequisite to pursuing this lawsuit would be inappropriate. First, the AFBCMR's ambit is relatively limited; it serves to interpret \"the content and effect of military regulations\" and decide \"whether [a] military tribunal's decision was in error or unjust.\"\n   <em>\n    Navas v.

That an appeal to the AFBCMR could not address the heart of plaintiffs' claims changes the exhaustion calculus. Defendants respond that there is no categorical rule in this circuit exempting constitutional or facial claims from exhaustion requirements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nationsbank Corp. v.

They recognized that Roe and Voe were being successfully treated, were asymptomatic, and had the support of their commanding officers; nonetheless, they concluded that Roe and Voe could not be deployed to CENTCOM and thus were unfit for continued military service. Because of that consistent and unyielding line of reasoning, Roe and Voe face imminent discharge from the Air Force. Defendants have steadfastly defended that reasoning in this litigation. Nothing suggests that the AFBCMR would depart from the conclusions of multiple Air Force decisionmakers and conclude that Roe's and Voe's discharge determinations contained an \"error\" to \"correct\" or an \"injustice\" to \"remove.\" Exhaustion need not be required where it would constitute an empty formality-particularly where, as here, the plaintiffs face imminent separation from the branch of the armed forces in which they have served honorably and in which they want to continue serving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Further, under Air Force regulations, the AFBCMR may only issue nonbinding recommendations, AFI 36-2603, \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 4.10, and it is the Secretary of the Air Force (or her designee) who must decide whether to act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20476156\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1.1, 5.

Those courts that have questioned\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   have done so for good reason: Its four-factor test, which weighs the plaintiff's case and injuries against military independence and expertise, speaks more to the merits and the appropriate scope of equitable relief than the threshold matter of justiciability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Nonetheless, even assuming the\n   <em>\n    Mindes\n   </em>\n   test remains good law and applies to this dispute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   it does not require dismissal\n   here. To be sure, whether a servicemember is fit for continued military service is a question that implicates military discretion, and one in which courts have little expertise. Yet other factors weigh heavily in favor of finding this dispute to be justiciable. For one, plaintiffs' claims are not weak. At this preliminary stage, they have made a strong showing that defendants' policies are irrational, based on a flawed understanding of HIV epidemiology, and inconsistently applied. Although Roe and Voe advance as-applied claims limited to the application of the military's polices in their cases, they (along with OutServe) also seek relief on behalf of a broader class of HIV-positive servicemembers, all of whom are now confronted with the polices that plaintiffs claim are unlawful. The far-reaching nature of these claims surely counsels in favor of judicial review. For the reasons explained below, plaintiffs have also made a strong demonstration that they face imminent, serious cognizable injuries because of defendants' policies. This is not one servicemember's protest of a technical glitch in the military's decisionmaking process; it is a challenge claiming that HIV-positive servicemembers, who wish to serve their country on equal terms with others, are being irrationally and arbitrarily swept from the ranks. Finally, the gravamen of plaintiffs' complaint is that they have not been evaluated in the personalized, case-by-case manner guaranteed by the applicable regulations, but rather face discharge because of an untailored determination that they are not deployable beyond the continental United States. By requesting only that military decisionmakers evaluate whether they are fit for service with more careful attention to their individual characteristics, plaintiffs give significant breathing space to \"the exercise of military expertise [and] discretion,\"\n   <em>\n    Guerra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521739\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/270/#p272\">\n    942 F.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

It states that a servicemember is not subject to deployment restrictions so long as his medical condition is stable, not subject to sudden worsening, not reliant on medication with special handling or storage requirements, and not dependent on routine evacuation for ongoing treatment or evaluation. DoDI 6490.07, \u00a7 4(b), at A89. Roe and Voe appear to satisfy all of section 4(b)'s requirements. Defendants do not contest, and no evidence in the record contradicts, plaintiffs' assertions that Roe and Voe are asymptomatic and that their viral loads are suppressed, meaning that their conditions are stable and not subject to sudden worsening so long as they maintain their course of treatment. Although they require daily medication, there is no evidence in the record contradicting plaintiffs' description of that medication as requiring \"no special handling, storage, or other requirements\" and causing no \"significant side effects,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4(b)(3).

Indeed, that active-duty servicemembers with a high risk of HIV exposure are administered pre-exposure prophylaxis (\"PrEP\") treatment-which, according to one of plaintiffs' medical experts, Dr. W.

DoDI 6490.07, \u00a7 4(c), at A89. Although HIV is listed, the instruction provides the caveat that a waiver is required for HIV only \"with the presence of progressive\n   clinical illness or immunological deficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   enclosure 3, \u00a7 e(2), at A97. As the record shows, neither Roe nor Voe falls within the terms of that provision. Because of their successful antiretroviral treatment, their conditions are not \"increasing in scope or severity,\"\n   <em>\n    see Progressive\n   </em>\n   , Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary (26th ed. 1981), and their immune systems are not compromised in the way associated with untreated or advanced-stage HIV or AIDS. At least under DoDI 6490.07, it appears Roe and Voe should not have been classified as nondeployable at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court recognizes that an altogether different standard governs deployment to CENTCOM, the \"theater-level Unified Combatant Command with responsibility for military operations across North Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East.\" A423. Under Modification Thirteen to USCENTCOM Individual Protection and Individual-Unit Deployment Policy (\"MOD 13\"), \"[c]onfirmed HIV infection is disqualifying for deployment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A425. Kevin Cron (\"Cron\"), CENTCOM's primary waiver action officer, submitted a declaration in support of defendants stating that servicemembers who deploy to CENTCOM \"must be medically, dentally and psychologically fit\" and cannot have medical conditions \"requiring highly specialized medical personnel, treatments, or medications.\" A424-25. Otherwise disqualified servicemembers may deploy to CENTCOM if they secure a waiver; however, Cron has \"n[ever] granted a deployment waiver for a[n] HIV-positive Service member,\" having concluded in every case \"that the risks of deploying a[n] HIV-positive Service member were too great to justify waiver approval.\" A426-27 (\"It is highly unlikely that either ... Roe or Voe would be granted a waiver to deploy to the CENTCOM [area].\"). In essence, then, the rule that prohibits HIV-positive servicemembers from deploying to CENTCOM is a categorical one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A460 (the SAFPC stating that being HIV positive \"precludes [a servicemember] from being able to deploy world-wide without a waiver and renders him\n   <em>\n    ineligible\n   </em>\n   for deployment to [CENTCOM]\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   This rule fails to pass muster under even the most deferential form of scrutiny. Because of advances in medicine and science, HIV is no longer a progressive, terminal illness. A study published in 2015 in a peer-reviewed journal under the auspices of the DoD recognized as much, finding that HIV \"has gone from an untreatable disease marked by inexorable clinical progression through extreme debility to death to a treatable disease\"-one \"that is compatible with active service throughout a full career in the U.S. military.\" Pls.' Memo. 14 (quoting John F. Brundage et al.,\n   <em>\n    Durations of Military Service After Diagnoses of HIV-1 Infections Among Active Component Members of the U.S. Armed Forces, 1990-2013\n   </em>\n   , 22 Med. Surveillance Monthly Rep. 9, 12 (2015) ). It is thus unsurprising that until very recently, \"nearly all cases of asymptomatic HIV resulted in a return to duty.\" A416. Roe and Voe are cases in point: Their commanding officers have unreservedly supported their retention, stating that despite being HIV positive they are physically and mentally capable of performing all duties required of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   To be sure, HIV remains incurable, and Roe and Voe must take daily medication to ensure that their viral loads remain suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   But that fact does not justify the categorical prohibition at issue here. Although HIV-positive individuals who suddenly stop antiretroviral treatment are vulnerable to \"viral rebound,\" A444, appreciable physical effects are not immediate. According to Dr. Hardy, it \"often takes weeks\" for an individual's viral load to return to clinically significant levels, and even then, the virus \"enters a period of clinical latency that can last years,\" often with no \"symptoms or negative health outcomes.\" Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14. What is more, plaintiffs have identified several serious medical conditions treated with daily medication that do not subject servicemembers to the same categorical denial of deployability to CENTCOM. These include dyslipidemia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   which (unlike HIV) does not preclude an individual from enlisting or deploying provided the condition is under \"medical management\" with \"no medication side effects,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DoDI 6130.03, \u00a7 5.24(n); hypertension, which is listed as a disqualifying condition only where it is \"not controlled with medication\" or \"requires frequent monitoring,\" DoDI 6490.07, enclosure 3, \u00a7 g(l), at A98; and asthma, which does not preclude deployment unless it persists \"despite appropriate therapy,\" requires frequent hospitalization, or requires \"daily systemic (not inhalational) steroids,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 d, at A97. Servicemembers who require daily antimalarial medicine likewise are not barred from deploying to CENTCOM; they are simply instructed to \"deploy with either enough medication for their entire deployment or with enough to cover approximately half of the deployment with plans to receive the remainder of their medication in theater.\" A349-50. More generally, MOD 13 allows \"personnel who require medication and who are deploying to the CENTCOM\" area to deploy \"with no less than a 180[-]day supply (or appropriate amount for shorter deployments),\" with provisions made to obtain refill prescriptions through the Armed Forces's Deployment Prescription Program. A349. Thus, although defendants emphasize that deployability determinations must account for \"reasonably anticipated contingencies, such as loss, theft, or destruction of medication,\" Defs.' Memo. &amp; Opp'n 24, there appears to be no reason why asymptomatic HIV is singled out for treatment so different from that given to other chronic conditions, all of which are subject to worsening upon disruption of daily medication.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Defendants also suggest that their policy is justified by the fact that HIV-positive individuals may require checkups every few months. But as plaintiffs' expert Dr. Craig W. Hendrix explains, those checkups do not require \"highly specialized medical personnel,\" A425, and are consistent with deployment in a forward area; all that is needed is a blood sample, which may be shipped to a laboratory if none is available on site.

Defendants do not dispute that antiretroviral treatment is highly \"effective[ ] in preventing HIV transmission.\" A374. Uncontroverted evidence from another of plaintiffs' experts, Dr. Carlos del Rio, demonstrates that when an individual's viral load is suppressed, he cannot transmit the virus to another. Pls.' Memo. Ex. D [Dkt.

Defendants have not identified a single recorded case of accidental transmission of HIV on the battlefield, which is unsurprising given the uncontroverted evidence that even without effective treatment, the risk of transmission through nonintimate contact such as blood splash is negligible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n    at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A375 (describing the Navy's policy allowing HIV-positive servicemembers to deploy on certain vessels in part because there is \"no demonstrated risk of transmission of infection in normal daily activities\"). And in the extraordinarily unlikely event of accidental or battlefield exposure, advances in PrEP treatment have made it possible to prevent that exposure from leading to infection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants respond by pointing to another potential risk: that of transmitting HIV through a \"battlefield blood transfusion.\" Defs.' Memo. &amp; Opp'n 25. But defendants' argument compares apples to oranges. The risk they identify is that a servicemember\n   <em>\n    unaware\n   </em>\n   he is HIV positive might donate blood.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A429 (explaining that this possibility was one of the main impetuses for the military's decision to start screening servicemembers for HIV in the 1980s). That concern fades from view after a servicemember has been diagnosed with HIV and thus knows that he cannot give blood, especially if he has been subject to disruptions in his antiretroviral treatment. Defendants have not argued that every deployed servicemember must be able to donate blood. Nor could they: Many servicemembers cannot give blood for various reasons, including blood type and allergies, but are not barred from\n   deploying to CENTCOM or elsewhere. Instead, they are simply issued medical alert tags. Pls.' Memo. 17-18; Pls.' Opp'n &amp; Reply 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Defendants have not offered any cogent response to plaintiffs' experienced medical experts, all of whom persuasively explain why the effectively categorical rule declaring all HIV-positive servicemembers ineligible for deployment to CENTCOM is inconsistent with the state of science and medicine and with the way the military treats other chronic but manageable conditions. Indeed, rather than attempting to respond to plaintiffs' experts, defendants rely only on conclusory assertions about their \"professional military and medical judgment,\" Defs.' Memo. &amp; Opp'n 27, and on circular restatements of their policies. For example, defendants argue that \"[a]s explained in DoD's 2014 Report to Congress, HIV infection has the potential to undermine a Service member's medical fitness and the readiness of the force.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   21 (citing A376). But the portion of the report defendants cite simply does not support their argument. In fact, it amounts to nothing more than a description of the Armed Forces's DES as it relates to HIV-positive servicemembers; it contains no evidence, whether anecdotal or otherwise, of the effect of HIV on a servicemember's medical fitness or the military's readiness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A376. The same is true for defendants' assertion that the \"need for regular treatment and monitoring could impair the ability of an HIV-positive Service member to serve worldwide,\" Defs.' Memo. &amp; Opp'n 27 (citing A384). The page defendants cite contains no scientific data, evidence, or real-life accounts, but rather is a mere recitation of defendants' policies. In sum, while plaintiffs have presented considerable evidence in support of their arguments, defendants rely on little more than\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   . Based on this record, plaintiffs have made a strong preliminary showing that the deployment policy applied to asymptomatic HIV-positive servicemembers cannot withstand rational basis review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    The Discharge Decisions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In addition to arguing that the deployment policy is irrational, plaintiffs also argue that the decisions to discharge Roe were arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on this argument as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   First, that Roe and Voe were even referred for a separation determination in the first place is arguably inconsistent with defendants' own policies. DoDI 1332.45 establishes that servicemembers classified as \"nondeployable\" for more than 12 consecutive months-or whose nondeployability would not change within the 12-month period-would be evaluated for retention, referred into the DES, or processed for separation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DoDI 1332.45, \u00a7 1.2(b), at A62;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.4(b)(3), at A64. But servicemembers with conditions identified in DoDI 6490.07, including HIV (at least with the presence of progressive clinical illness or immunological deficiencies, as discussed above), are classified as \"deployable with limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.3, at A66. As DoD made clear in a 2018 report to Congress, \"nondeployable\" and \"deployable with limitations\" were intended to be meaningfully distinct categories, with \"the retention determination process applying to the former but not the latter.\" A386. As such, DoDI 1332.45 clearly suggests that servicemembers with HIV-even those whose health conditions are much graver than Roe's or Voe's-would not be subject to review for separation. In this respect, plaintiffs are correct that the Air Force's actions with respect to Roe, Voe, and the other HIV-positive servicemembers identified by OutServe seem \"not in alignment with DoDI 1332.45.\" Pls.'

Instead, they claim to have followed DoDI 6485.01, which states that active-duty servicemembers diagnosed with HIV must be \"referred for ... a medical evaluation for fitness for continued service in the same manner as a Service member with other chronic or progressive illnesses.\" DoDI 6485.01, enclosure 3, \u00a7 2(c), at A85. They claim that under this \"case by case\" medical evaluation process, A339, Roe and Voe were fairly found to be unfit for duty and therefore must be discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The process to which Roe and Voe were subjected does not comport with even the minimal requirements of the APA. Applicable Air Force regulations make clear that \"HIV seropositivity alone is not grounds for medical separation.\" AFI 44-178, \u00a7 2.4.1, at A299;\n   <em>\n    accord\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p24\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 A9.1.1, at A329;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A341 (\"Asymptomatic HIV alone is not unfitting for continued service.\").

For the reasons discussed in detail above, the evidence in this record clearly establishes that HIV seropositivity alone is not inconsistent with ongoing military service, does not seriously jeopardize the health or safety of the servicemember or his companions in service, and does not impose unreasonable burdens on the military when compared to similar chronic conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, both named plaintiffs' commanding officers recommended retention, opining that Roe's and Voe's HIV status did not interfere with their ability to perform their duties. The SAFPC recognized as much.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A460 (\"[H]e is able to perform all in[-]garrison duties, has passed his most recent fitness assessment without any component exemptions, and his commander strongly supports his retention.\"); A747 (same).

Defendants' reliance on that policy renders the decisions to discharge Roe and Voe contrary to the APA for two reasons. First, although the SAFPC purported to engage in an individualized determination as to Roe's and Voe's fitness for duty, in fact its decisions were completely dependent on the across-the-board deployability policy. The failure to consider the issues with that policy or to analyze whether Roe and Voe could in fact be deployable to CENTCOM-let alone to any other location beyond the continental United States-despite their condition renders the decisions to discharge them arbitrary and capricious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, because the categorical deployment limitation is not rationally related to any legitimate interest, that limitation applies to Roe and Voe solely because they have been diagnosed with HIV. By attempting to discharge them because of that limitation, the SAFPC violated agency policy mandating that HIV status alone is not a permissible ground for separation. A decision in direct conflict with the agency's own standards, and one based on a failure to consider key aspects of the problem, cannot stand under the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Irreparable Harm\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   A party seeking a preliminary injunction must make a clear showing of \"actual and imminent\" irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    Direx Isr., Ltd. v.

Although the impact of defendants' policies on servicemembers like Roe and Voe is potentially immense, defendants can scarcely be said to face any serious consequences stemming from the issuance of appropriately tailored injunctive\n   relief, given that HIV-positive individuals make up such a miniscule percentage of active-duty servicemembers-0.027%, by one calculation. Pls.' Memo. 29. Defendants do not attempt to argue that retaining HIV-positive servicemembers would be prohibitively expensive or burdensome. Instead, they focus on a different sort of institutional harm: that granting relief here will encourage a deluge of cases challenging discharge determinations and undermine the principle of military independence. Defendants' concerns are overstated. Plaintiffs' claims are not of the sort that worried the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Guerra\n   </em>\n   -namely, individualized or procedural challenges with little or no general applicability. Nor is the relief sought by plaintiffs likely to entangle the Court in \"complex, subtle, and professional decisions\" in a way that would cause symbolic or actual harm to the Armed Forces. Plaintiffs ask only that defendants adhere to their stated policies and make nonarbitrary, personalized determinations about each individual's fitness for service. That sort of request does not do violence to the notion of military independence, but rather enforces it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The public interest also decisively favors granting injunctive relief. The military is a branch of the federal government and ultimately bears a responsibility to the American public at large. The public undoubtedly has an interest in seeing its governmental institutions follow the law and treat their employees in reasonable, nonarbitrary ways. More concretely, the public benefits from the security provided by military departments populated with individuals dedicated to the notion of service. Roe and Voe, along with similarly situated HIV-positive members of the Air Force, have been serving-and want to continue serving-their country. They have carried out their responsibilities in a creditable manner, earning trust on the part of their commanding officers and fellow servicemembers. It is in the public interest to prevent their discharge for apparently arbitrary and indefensible reasons, at least until the Court can definitively decide the merits of plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Scope of Injunctive Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are entitled to injunctive relief.

That requirement respects the separation of powers and keeps courts from entangling themselves in delicate policy matters. Here, the apparent inadequacy giving rise to imminent, irreparable injury is that servicemembers like Roe and Voe face separation based on the arbitrary policy that they are categorically ineligible for deployment to CENTCOM. The solution, then, is the mirror image of that defect: defendants will be prohibited from making or enforcing discharge determinations based on that policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Next, defendants have argued that if injunctive relief of any kind is to be granted, it must be limited to Roe and Voe. Such a limitation would be inappropriate for several reasons. For one, plaintiff OutServe has the right to assert associational standing and seek relief on behalf of its members who face imminent and irreparable injury due to defendants' policies. There are at least four active-duty Air Force members who are members of OutServe and who are identically situated to Roe and Voe. Because of the longstanding stigma and discrimination facing those living with HIV, it may be difficult to identify potential plaintiffs in a case of this nature. Granting relief to all similarly situated servicemembers is thus the only way to ensure uniform, fair, rational treatment of individuals who belong to a vulnerable, and often invisible, class. Moreover, plaintiffs' entitlement to injunctive relief in this civil action is not so much dependent on characteristics peculiar to Roe and Voe; rather, it flows from defendants' reliance on an arbitrary, across-the-board determination that HIV-positive servicemembers must be deemed ineligible to deploy to CENTCOM, regardless of each servicemember's actual physical condition. That determination is flawed, and its uncritical application will be equally flawed no matter whether the servicemember is named Roe or Doe or whether he hails from Portland, Oregon or Portland, Maine. This case deals with national institutions, national policies, and national interests; it is thus unsurprising that the appropriate scope of relief should be national as well. Servicemembers who enlist in the Air Force do so with the expectation that they will fly under one flag and answer to one Department. They serve the country at large, and there are no relevant regional or localized facts that would counsel in favor of limiting the scope of the injunction to the named plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Although plaintiffs have at times suggested that they seek relief on behalf of all members of the Armed Forces, the relief granted will be limited to active-duty members of the Air Force. The record reveals that there are meaningful differences in the way each military department has approached the issue of HIV-positive servicemembers, and the Court does not discount the possibility that another department's policies could be supported by a rational basis and applied in a manner consistent with the APA. Similarly uncertain is whether the foregoing analysis would apply to HIV-positive servicemembers who are on restricted duty of one kind or another. Without a firmer basis in evidence, any broader relief would be inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The military is an institution like no other in our system of government. It has unique institutional interests and experience. The decisions it makes are thus entitled to deference from the coordinate branches, and particularly from the judicial branch, whose officers are largely shielded from the exigencies of military life. Nonetheless, the military remains a branch of government and so is bound to follow the Constitution and laws of the United States. And the judiciary's responsibility remains to enforce those laws and protect the rights of individuals vulnerable to arbitrary exercises of governmental authority.
