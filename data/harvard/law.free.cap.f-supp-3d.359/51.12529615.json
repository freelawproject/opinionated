MOSS, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff, a former employee of Saint Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., seeks documents relating to findings contained in a portion of a report issued by the D.C. Office of the Auditor (\"Auditor\"), which was prepared with the assistance of the Council for Court Excellence (\"CCE\"). Dkt. 20. Those findings and the investigation on which they were premised arguably bear on Plaintiff's claims that she was not selected to serve as the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of Saint Elizabeths and, after having served as the interim CEO, was not reinstated to her prior position as Chief Clinical Officer because of her race and sex and because she had engaged in protected equal employment opportunity activity. Dkt. 1 at 2-3 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). The Auditor and CCE (\"movants\") have filed a joint motion to quash Plaintiff's subpoenas on three grounds. They first, and most extensively, argue that the subpoenas seek documents protected by the District's Speech or Debate Statute, D.C. Code. \u00a7 1-301.42, which is modeled on the Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution, art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. 1. Dkt. 20 at 10-21. Second, they invoke the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Third, they contend that the subpoenas are unduly burdensome and that, at a minimum, Plaintiff should be required to exhaust the ordinary discovery process before burdening non-parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As explained below, the Court is unconvinced that the specific documents at issue are protected by the Speech or Debate Statute. At the same time, much of what Plaintiffs seeks\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   be protected by the deliberative process privilege, and it is also\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   that the subpoenas are, at least in part, unduly burdensome or repetitive of discovery that Plaintiff may be able to obtain in the ordinary course. On the present record, however, movants have not carried their burden of demonstrating that any specific documents are privileged or that the subpoenas are unduly burdensome. The Court will, accordingly, deny the pending motion to quash. But, in light of the sensitivities posed by discovery seeking, among other things, notes of interviews of current and former employees expressing their candid assessment of other government employees and officials, the Court will grant movants leave to file an amended motion to quash on grounds of deliberative process privilege and undue burden supported by a more detailed showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Beth Gouse, a Caucasian woman, worked as a clinical psychologist at Saint Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C. from 1993 until 2016.

When Gouse requested to return to her previous role as Chief Clinical Officer, Saint Elizabeths informed Gouse that her employment would be terminated in March 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gouse alleges that her treatment was the result of discrimination based on race, sex, and reprisal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 (Compl. \u00b6 5).

For example, in early 2016, the Mayor and the Director of DBH replaced the interim CEO [Gouse], a forensic psychologist with 20 years of experience at the hospital who had helped see the hospital through the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) oversight, with a candidate who seriously misrepresented his credentials and was not qualified for the position.

The statute creating the Office of the District of Columbia Auditor, moreover, vests the Chairman of the Council with the authority to appoint the Auditor, subject to the approval of a majority of the Council.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-204.55\">\n    D.C.

To be sure, the Auditor at times-and, perhaps, most of the time-operates on behalf of the Council, conducting audits and preparing reports to aid the Council in the discharge of its legislative duties. But the Auditor's statutory charge extends beyond that: the Auditor is also required to \"submit h[er] audit reports to the ... the Mayor,\" to include information and comments in those reports that she deems \"necessary to keep\" the Mayor apprised about the \"operations to which the reports relate,\" and to make recommendations to the Mayor as she \"deem[s] advisable.\" D.C. Code. \u00a7 1-204.55(d). After receiving such a recommendation, moreover, the Mayor is required to \"state in writing to the Council ... what action [s]he has taken to effectuate the recommendation[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-204.55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1-204.55(f).

The relevant findings and recommendations show that she was not. The Auditor's discussion of the Mayor and DBH's decision to \"replace\" Plaintiff as CEO of Saint Elizabeths Hospital, notwithstanding her \"20 years of experience at the hospital,\" for example, contains no legislative recommendations or proposals. Dkt. 22 at 32-34. It, instead, questions the judgment of \"the current director\" of DBH in making particular decisions relating to the \"termination of and request for the resignation of several members of DBH and [Saint Elizatheths Hospital] upper management,\" and it recommends that the\n   Executive Office of the Mayor \"conduct a thorough review of the performance of the current Director of DBH.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-204.55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-204.55\">\n    at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the Report finds that DFS's \"management has failed to ... foster a healthy work environment in which staff can flourish,\" and it recommends that the Executive Office of the Mayor \"review the performance of DFS management and assess DFS management's ability to carry out effectively the Division's obligations\" and that, based on that review, the Mayor \"take appropriate action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-204.55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-204.55\">\n    at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response to this portion of the Report, moreover, DBH noted that it \"is restricted from commenting on personnel matters\" but committed to take the Report \"into account ... in its own review of an individual's or division's performance.\" Report at 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Movants contend that the lack of any legislative recommendation or proposal relating to these findings is not dispositive because the Report does include legislative recommendations that \"subsume[ ] the entirety of the report.\" Dkt. 25 at 4. They stress, in particular, that the Report makes the broad recommendations that the \"Council require DBH to produce strategic plans addressing the systemic and institutional failures mentioned in this and other reports,\" and that the \"Council require DBH to produce annual reports detailing progress in carrying out those plans.\" Dkt. 25 at 4 (quoting Report at 27). The suggestion that DBH be required to produce, and to follow, a \"strategic plan,\" however, bears no discernible relationship to the Report's findings regarding the deficient hiring decisions that interest Plaintiff. As the commentary accompanying the \"strategic plan\" recommendation explains, these recommendations are intended to address \"systemic and institutional failures pertaining to justice-involved consumers that have persisted for years, including DBH's inability to stem the flow of forensic inpatient admissions for [Saint Elizabeths Hospital] for competency evaluations and restoration, to improve forensic outpatient programs, and to provide for the timely discharge of patients within the most integrated, least-restrictive appropriate setting.\" Report at 27. A \"strategic plan\" is necessary, according to the Report, because, after years of \"judicial and [Department of Justice] oversight ... DBH has largely functioned reactively, responding to standards established by others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-204.55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, to the extent this recommendation relates to staffing at all, it adresses a need better to allocate resources and to ensure that DBH has \"sufficient qualified staff to meet the demand for forensic services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-204.55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-204.55\">\n    at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those types of \"strategic\" considerations, and a need for better planning, are distinctly forward looking; they are the antinomy of the recommendation that the Mayor review the past performance of the DBH Director to determine whether she made a series of bad hiring decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Movants also argue that the absence of any legislative proposal or response to an investigation does not take the investigation outside the legislative sphere. That assertion is undoubtedly correct-and, indeed, the Court assumes that most legislative investigations do not ultimately lead to legislation. Framed in this manner, however, movants' argument begs the question whether the investigation fell within the legislative sphere to start. In support of their argument, movants point to this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3249249\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/597/107/#p113\">\n    597 F.Supp.2d 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2009), where this Court quashed subpoenas directed at a member of the D.C.

Addiction Prevention and Recovery Administration.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3249249\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/597/107/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3249249\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/597/107/#p113\">\n    at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to movants,\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   supports their position\n   because the Court quashed the subpoenas without ever considering whether the informal investigation at issue in that case led to any \"legislative measure.\" Dkt. 25 at 3. The Court did not address that issue because, as movants posit, the ultimate results of a legislative investigation are not what matters. But what does matter, and what movants ignore, is the \"critical question ... whether the action at issue\"-that is, the investigation itself-\"was undertaken within the 'legislative sphere.' \"\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3249249\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/597/107/#p113\">\n    597 F.Supp.2d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the answer to that question was \"yes\" because the councilmember conducted a hearing, met with the plaintiff and her husband (along with two aides) \"to discuss a matter raised at the hearing and to receive information concerning alleged wrongdoing at an agency,\" and \"launch[ed] an investigation as a result of the information received.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3249249\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/597/107/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3249249\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/597/107/#p113\">\n    at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the \"critical question\" presented here is whether the relevant portions of the investigation and Report served a\n   <em>\n    legislative\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    executive\n   </em>\n   function. The answer to that question, however, differs from the answer in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In most cases, deciding which side of the line an investigation falls upon will not be difficult. In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , for example, the investigation was both initiated and conducted by a councilmember and his staff, and it was unrelated to any executive function. Here, however, the analysis is not so easy because the Auditor is charged by statute with making recommendations both to the Council and to the Mayor, and because the investigation and Report supported both legislative and executive functions.

Significantly, those findings and recommendations were distinctly executive in nature: the Report recommends that the Mayor's Office \"review ... the performance of the current Director of DBH,\" Dkt. 22 at 34, and, under D.C. law, the Director serves \"at the pleasure of the Mayor,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-1141.03\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 7-1141.03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3). The Court, as a result, lacks any basis to conclude that the relevant portions of the investigation and Report had anything to do with \"the deliberative and communicative processes by which\" members of the Council \"participate in committee and [Council] proceedings with respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters which\" the law \"places within the jurisdiction of\" the Council.\n   <em>\n    Gravel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782860\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/606/#p616\">\n    408 U.S. at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782860\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/606/#p616\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Movants attempt to counter this by noting that, \"[d]uring the pendency of the investigation,\" they \"made preliminary information available to Councilmember[s]\" Gray and Allen; that upon release of the Report, they \"transmitted it directly to Councilmembers Gray and Allen, who then held a joint oversight hearing;\" that during the hearing, \"CCE appeared and responded\n   to questions on behalf of the Auditor and there was extensive discussion of the Report's findings;\" and that \"[t]hose findings were further addressed at DBH's subsequent budgetary hearings before the Council's Committee on Health, at which CCE again reported on and answered questions regarding the Report.\" Dkt. 25 at 6-7. There is no dispute, however, that portions of the investigation and Report fall within the \"legislative sphere.\" But because the Report covered both legislative and executive ground, the Court must decide whether the portions of the investigation and Report that Plaintiff seeks fall within that sphere, and the Auditor and CCE fail to offer any evidence that they do. The \"preliminary information\" made available to members of the Council, for example, addressed \"current and past year commitments and spending by the Department of Behavioral Health,\" and offered \"to set up a briefing ... on the project on DBH underway by\" CCE. Dkt. 20-5 at 1-2. Nothing in that correspondence or otherwise in the record includes any mention of the portions of the investigation and Report at issue here. Nor do movants point to any discussion of the relevant issues at the oversight or budgetary hearings. Although movants provide timestamps in a thirteen-hour video of the joint oversight committee and a six-hour video of the budget oversight hearing, the cited portions of the hearings feature CCE staff presenting high-level findings and policy recommendations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 25 at 6-7. If other portions of the hearings addressed the aspects of the Report at issue here, movants have not identified those portions for the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, movants' efforts to distinguish this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Payne v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581801\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/125/\">\n    859 F.Supp.2d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2012), are unavailing. In that case, Payne was terminated from his position as D.C. Director of Contracts, and he sued the District alleging wrongful termination, among other claims. In support of his claims, Payne sought discovery from two members of the D.C. Council, who he alleged \"cajoled\" the D.C. Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") into withdrawing a contract that Payne had awarded and \"caused Payne's wrongful termination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581801\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581801\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/125/\">\n    at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In response, the two councilmembers sought to quash the subpoenas directed at them based on the D.C. Speech or Debate Statute. The Court agreed in part and disagreed in part. To the extent Payne sought discovery regarding the councilmembers' efforts to \"cajole\" the D.C. CFO into withdrawing the contract, their communications were protected because the Council's legislative duties include reviewing and approving multiyear contracts in excess of a million dollars.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581801\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581801\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/125/\">\n    at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, because \"[c]ajoling\" Payne's boss to \"fire\" him did not fall within the scope of the Council's duties, those portions of the councilmembers' communications were not protected.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581801\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Court explained, \"[r]etention or termination of Payne might have affected the best interests of District citizens, but that decision [was] an executive one.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581801\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to movants,\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   is inapposite for two reasons. First, \"the investigation here was undertaken primarily for the benefit of the Council in the performance of its legislative responsibilities and ... only 'part of the audit report objectives involve[ ] recommendations for the executive branch.' \" Dkt. 25 at 7 (quoting Dkt. 22 at 6 n.4). But that argument amounts to little more than ipse dixit, and, in fact, a large portion of the Report-including the portion at issue here-involved recommendations for the executive branch. Second, movants contend that the recommendations at issue here \"in no way represent an effort to 'cajole' specific agency action with respect to a particular matter, as opposed\n   to the more general 'pursu[it of] legislative business.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581801\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/125/\">\n    859 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   135 ). Although the word \"cajole\" might not apply here, the concept that\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   articulated does: As in\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   , the relevant portions of the investigation and Report raise concerns about particular executive branch employees, and the Report urges the executive branch official with authority to act to look into the asserted deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, movants contend that the recommendations at issue here might well entail legislative action. They assert, for example, that implementing the recommendations that the Executive Office of the Mayor review the performance of the current Director of DBH and the performance of DFS management would \"require Council funding and implementing legislation at the outset.\" Dkt. 25 at 8. All executive action, to be sure, requires funding. But the Report contains no suggestion that any special funding would be required to permit the Mayor to review the performance of the identified officials, and it proves too much to suggest that every executive action-or recommendation for executive action-falls within the legislative sphere merely because the action requires the executive to use generally available appropriations. Nor is the Court convinced that the recommendations are legislative in nature because the Council might decide to legislate \"in the event the executive fails to take\" the recommended \"action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581801\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/859/125/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Movants are correct that much of the legislative oversight process involves staying abreast of what is occurring in the executive branch. But, where (1) the Council did not instigate the relevant portions of the investigation; (2) the Auditor is charged by statute with making recommendations to both the Council and the Mayor; (3) the relevant portions of the investigation and Report focused on executive functions and made recommendations for executive actions; and (4) there is no indication that the Mayor had-or would-decline to follow the Auditor's recommendations, the Court cannot conclude that the investigation falls within the protected, legislative realm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Most fundamentally, the question for the Court is whether the subpoenas even remotely threaten \"the integrity of the legislative process\" or the \"independence\" of the Council to investigate and legislate as it sees fit.\n   <em>\n    Brewster\n   </em>\n   , 408 U.S. at 507,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782923\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/501/#p507\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One relevant-and, indeed, indispensable-indicia of such an intrusion is the view of the Council itself. As the Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Gravel\n   </em>\n   , although the Speech or Debate privilege is applicable to those who assist members of the legislature, the privilege belongs to the members and is \"invocable only by\" a member or an aide asserting the privilege on the member's behalf. 408 U.S. at 621-22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782860\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/606/#p616\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Council has not joined movants in seeking to quash the subpoenas, nor is there any evidence that it (or that any member of the Council) has authorized the Auditor to assert the privilege on the Council's behalf. To the contrary, Plaintiff represents that she also served a subpoena on the Council and that the Council responded without invoking legislative immunity. Dkt. 22 at 3 &amp; n.2. Although the record says little about the issue, movants do not dispute this assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court, accordingly, must reject movants' invocation of legislative immunity to quash the subpoenas in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Deliberative Process Privilege and Undue Burden\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   That conclusion, however, does not end the Court's inquiry. Movants make two additional arguments, albeit only briefly. First, they invoke the deliberative process\n   privilege as alternative grounds for quashing the subpoena. Second, they argue that-regardless of any specific privilege-the subpoena is overly burdensome. As the record currently stands, however, the Court lacks sufficient information to determine whether either objection applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The deliberative process privilege protects \"documents 'reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated.' \"\n   <em>\n    N.L.R.B. v.

Cir. 2009). These limitations pose a problem for movants, who offer little evidence-and no detail-regarding the documents at issue. Their entire factual submission is found in four paragraphs of a declaration from Kathleen Patterson, the current D.C. Auditor. She attests that she has reviewed the documents and that they consist \"primarily\" of interview notes\n   \"with current and former DBH staff and D.C. Superior Court judges\" and \"notes from a court hearing.\" Dkt. 25-1 at 2 (Patterson Decl. \u00b6 6). These documents, according to Patterson, \"reflect the thought processes of the audit team ... and contain pre-decisional deliberations regarding the content to be included in the Report.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742243,3575196\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/32/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Patterson Decl. \u00b6 7). She concludes: \"I believe that the disclosure of these responsive documents would seriously discourage government employees from communicating with the candor necessary for [the Office of the Auditor] to carry out its responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742243,3575196\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/32/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Patterson Decl. \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Based on this submission, the Court cannot determine whether all of the documents at issue reflect predecisional deliberations and whether portions of any such documents can be redacted. Do notes of a conversation with a\n   <em>\n    former\n   </em>\n   employee, for example, reflect internal, agency deliberations? Are the interview notes verbatim or do they include the deliberative impressions of the interviewer? If so, are there portions of the notes that can be produced that do not reflect those impressions? Why are notes of a court hearing deliberative? Are there any responsive documents other than \"notes\" taken by the CCE investigators? Without answers to these and similar questions, the Court cannot determine which documents, and which portions of those documents, are potentially privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The same is true with respect to movants' contention that the subpoenas are unduly burdensome. The Court can understand the argument, for example, that it would \"unduly\" burden the auditor to require compliance because \"interviews were conducted with the assurance of confidentiality,\" and releasing the \"notes to the Plaintiff, and potentially the public, will likely diminish [the Auditor's] ability to acquire information for future audits.\" Dkt. 25-1 at 2 (Patterson Decl. \u00b6 8). Movants do not indicate, however, which witnesses affirmatively requested confidentiality or whether portions of the notes could be produced with names redacted or pursuant to a suitable protective order. They do not explain whether or how this rationale extends to notes of a court hearing. And neither movants nor Plaintiff address whether the information at issue is \"unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   These considerations are particularly important when considering the potential \"unwanted burden thrust upon non-parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Watts v.
