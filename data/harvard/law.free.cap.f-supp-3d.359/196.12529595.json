Defs.' SMF \u00b6 4. Both Decker and Ettinger were members of the Syracuse Police Department's Crime Reduction Team, Dkt.

No. 53-6 at 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Acting on reports of gang activity at Pioneer Homes, the Syracuse Housing Authority had, prior to Plaintiff's arrest, \"granted the Syracuse Police Department authorization to arrest persons who were trespassing or had no lawful business at [ ] Pioneer Homes.\" Defs.' SMF \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At approximately 6:45 PM during Decker's and Ettinger's patrol, they encountered an occupied vehicle parked in a lot near \"the 100 block of Radisson Court.\" Ettinger Supp'n Hr'g Test. at 10, 25. Using the patrol car's spotlight, Decker \"illuminated\" the vehicle, and the officers \"noticed the occupants,\" two black men, \"making furtive movements[,] as if the[y] were trying to conceal items.\" Defs.' SMF \u00b6 4. According to Ettinger, those \"furtive\n   movements\" consisted of \"look[ing] at [the officers] and then immediately turn[ing] away,\" before making \"dramatic movements towards their lap[s and] towards the center of the vehicle as if they were attempting to secrete or hide something.\" Ettinger Supp'n Hr'g Test. at 11, 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finding the occupants' behavior suspicious, Decker and Ettinger parked their patrol car behind the vehicle \"at an angle,\" but without fully blocking its path. Decker Supp'n Hr'g Test. at 9, 22. The officers then got out and approached the vehicle-Decker on the driver's side and Ettinger on the passenger's side, Defs.' SMF \u00b6 5-6-and, looking through the open driver's side window, Decker noticed a digital scale near the center console covered in a \"white residue\" that he believed to be cocaine, Decker Supp'n Hr'g Test. at 10-11.

SMF \u00b6 6; Ettinger Supp'n Hr'g Test. at 13. Simultaneously, Decker asked Plaintiff to get out of the vehicle and began to search him as well. Defs.' SMF \u00b6 7. Before Decker's search could get underway, however, Plaintiff \"violently pulled away and fled on foot ... eastbound [away] from Officer Decker.\" Ettinger Supp'n Hr'g Test. at 14. Decker ran after Plaintiff, tackled him from behind, and ordered him to put his hands behind his back. Decker Supp'n Hr'g Test. at 13. But Plaintiff continued to struggle with Decker, \"and 'kept his hands under his body rather than putting them behind his back' \" while trying to \"push up off the ground and keep going.\" Defs.'

Ettinger Supp'n Hr'g Test. at 15. In Plaintiff's front left pants pocket, Decker found \"a clear knotted section of plastic containing a beige chunky substance\" that he identified as crack cocaine.
