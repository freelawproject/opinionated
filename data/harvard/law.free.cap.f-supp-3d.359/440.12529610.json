George Rice's daughters Shaquanda Rice Pippen and Angelia Rice are the co-administrators of George Rice's estate and they filed this wrongful death suit on August 10, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint [1].

The Court resolves factual controversies in the non-movant Plaintiffs' favor.\n   <em>\n    Little v.

At the time of his death, George Rice worked for Jimco Integrated Services, Inc. Jimco is an independent contractor that provides dredging and de-watering services at Tronox's plant pursuant to a Master Work Agreement. Tronox uses a series of large waste ponds to manage solid wastes generated by its production processes. Dredges are used to remove the solid waste from the waste ponds. A dredge is a floating vessel used for an excavation activity that is carried out at least partially or fully submerged under water, with the purpose of gathering up\n   bottom sediments and disposing of them or transferring them to a different location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the early morning hours of August 12, 2014, Rice was operating a dredge on a waste pond at the Tronox plant. This particular dredge is a large piece of equipment, weighing in excess of 20,000 pounds, that floats on two large parallel pontoons. Water infiltrated at least one of the pontoons on the dredge causing it to lose stability and capsize. When the dredge capsized, Rice drowned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 18, 2014, less than two months prior to Rice's death, Jimco removed the dredge from the waste pond with a crane and contracted with Allen Blasting and Coatings, Inc. to perform repairs to the dredge, including sandblasting and recoating of the pontoons. A new diesel engine was also installed in the dredge. According to Jimco employee Kenneth Conn, the dredge was listing to one side and was taken out of service for that reason. After a little over a month, the dredge was put back into service on July 26, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plaintiffs seek compensation for Rice's death and allege claims under Mississippi law for negligence and negligent misrepresentation against Tronox. Tronox now requests summary judgment in its favor on all of the Plaintiffs' claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tronox argues that it is immune from responsibility under Mississippi Code \u00a7 11-1-66, that the Plaintiffs cannot establish the elements of negligence, and that the Plaintiffs failed to bring forth any competent evidence to support their negligent misrepresentation claims.

There is no allegation that there was any issue with the waste pond or any part of the physical premises that played a role in the dredge capsizing. In short, the Court is unaware of any authority, and the Plaintiffs have failed to cite to any, that could support the imposition of liability on a contractor or premises owner for a danger or defect in a subcontractor's own equipment. Holding otherwise would result in a substantial expansion of liability for premises owners without any basis in law, common or statutory. For this reason, the Court finds that the application of premises liability principles to this case, as argued by the Plaintiffs, does not give rise to liability for Tronox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Substantial Control\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Plaintiffs also argue that Tronox maintained control over the worksite to such a large extent that Tronox had\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control over the dredging operation and therefore should be liable for Rice's death.

The dredging equipment is to be properly maintained and complete with float lines and land-based pipelines and booster pumps, if needed, for delivery to the mix tanks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on these precedents, the summary judgment record including the depositions of Jimco and Tronox employees, and specifically the Master Work Agreement and the Work Order, show unequivocally that Jimco solely had responsibility for providing, operating, and maintaining the dredge.

Without conceding that such remedial measures are admissible in this context, Tronox agrees that it did in fact implement various new safety policies and requirements related to dredging at its facility after the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   These new requirements include requiring Jimco to have a safety plan which Tronox reviewed, required an additional boat on the pond for safety and rescue, and imposed new minimum dredge safety requirements, including a requirement that Jimco increase and expand its equipment inspections, as well as various other safety related requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court finds these subsequent remedial measures very similar to those found not to be indicative of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control\n   <em>\n    in Lee II.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , 98 F.

After the accident the Defendant inspected the scaffolding, participated in and investigation into the accident, and imposed new safety requirements including (1) installing and requiring the use of retractable safety lines to provide fall protection; (2) sandblasting all scaffold structural steel to check it for cracks prior to assembly; and (3) requiring everyone who works on the scaffold to be certified.\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , 98 F. Appx. at 278.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Based on the summary judgment evidence presented, the Court finds that the subsequent remedial measures imposed by Tronox were all safety related and undertaken pursuant to its right to impose safety requirements and inspections under the Master Work Agreement. These subsequent remedial measures, taken alone or together with other evidence, do not create a genuine issue of material fact as to Tronox's\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   control over the dredging process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Occupational Safety and Health Administration Multi-Employer Doctrine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, the Plaintiffs argue that liability for Rice's death should extend to Tronox under the OSHA multi-employer doctrine. Tronox argues, and the Plaintiffs acknowledge, that the Fifth Circuit has stated that an employer may not be held liable under this doctrine when that employer's own employees are not exposed to a hazard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Melerine v.

This is clearly the situation in this case, there is no allegation that Tronox's employees were exposed to the hazard, the dredge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While the instant Motion was pending, the Fifth Circuit revisited its holding in\n   <em>\n    Melerine\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Acosta v.

In\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that \"the Secretary of Labor has the authority under section 5(a)(2) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20654\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), to issue citations to controlling employers at multi-employer worksites for violations of the Act's standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519318\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/723/\">\n    909 F.3d at 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This opinion represents a substantial change in direction. Tronox argues that the Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   is limited to the Secretary's authority under the Act and does not alter the application of the multi-employer doctrine to expand the common law duties or liabilities of employers. The Plaintiffs did not offer any argument in response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Acosta\n   </em>\n   , the employer, Hensel Phelps, argued that \"the controlling employer policy violates section 4(b)(4) of the Act.

The Plaintiffs allege that Tronox gave the appearance of maintaining control and safety standards on its worksite, and that Rice relied on this representation when in fact the worksite was not safe. In support of their argument, the Plaintiffs allege that Tronox performed some safety inspections, and gave the appearance of inspections, such that Rice relied on Tronox to inspect and ensure that the dredge was safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In response, Tronox argues that the Plaintiffs have not brought forth any facts or evidence to support their negligent misrepresentation claim, and instead rely wholly on unsupported allegations. Tronox also argues that the Plaintiffs' admission, discussed above, that Jimco and Rice knew or reasonably should have known of the danger that caused Rice's death forecloses any argument that Rice reasonably relied on an alleged misrepresentation from Tronox as to the dredge's safety because Jimco, and Rice, had actual or constructive knowledge of the danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To state a claim for negligent or intentional misrepresentation, a plaintiff must allege that a defendant made a misrepresentation of material fact and the plaintiff reasonably or justifiably relied on that misrepresentation to its detriment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heritage Properties, Inc. v.

If there was an incident, Tronox inspectors would conduct a more specific investigation after the fact. In short, the Plaintiffs have not brought forth any competent summary judgment evidence to support their allegation that Tronox gave the appearance of inspecting and ensuring the dredge's safety. Further, the Plaintiffs' admission that Jimco knew or reasonably should have known about the dangerous condition of the dredge wholly undermines their allegation that Rice relied on Tronox to inspect and ensure the dredge for safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For these reasons, the Plaintiffs have failed to point to any competent summary judgment evidence that creates a question of fact as to their negligent misrepresentation claim.

Campbell's expert report and testimony largely consist of her opinions regarding OSHA regulations and their applicability, or not, to Jimco's dredging operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Tronox's second motion [61] requests the exclusion of certain opinions contained in the supplemental report and testimony of Jimco's expert Arthur Darden.

Tronox's Motions in Limine [59, 61] are denied without prejudice as moot.

After remand the Fifth Circuit again considered the case (\n    <em>\n     Lee II\n    </em>\n    ) and affirmed the District Court's finding that the subsequent remedial measures, taken alone or together with other evidence, did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to the Defendant's\n    <em>\n     de facto\n    </em>\n    control over the process where the Plaintiff was injured.\n    <em>\n     Lee v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.\n    </em>\n    , 98 F. Appx 271, 276 (5th Cir. 2004).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    It appears from the record that some or all of the dredges in use at Tronox are now operated remotely. Although the Plaintiffs allege that Tronox \"participated\" in this decision, there is no evidence in the record that supports a finding that Tronox imposed remote operation as a requirement or played a substantial role in the decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
