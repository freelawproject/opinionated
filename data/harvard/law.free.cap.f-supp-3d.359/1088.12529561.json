Parrish, United States District Court Judge\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a qui tam action. Relators Katie Brooks and Nannette Wride alleged that Defendants Stevens-Henager College, Inc.; California College San Diego, Inc.; College America Denver, Inc.; College America Arizona, Inc.; the Center for Excellence in Higher Education (CEHE); and Carl Barney (collectively, the Colleges) submitted false claims for federal financial aid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Government filed a complaint in intervention. It intervened on some but not all of the relators' claims against two defendants: Stevens-Henager and its apparent successor in interest, CEHE. Shortly thereafter, the relators filed their second amended complaint. This complaint asserted new claims and named additional defendants. The Government elected to not intervene as to the new claims but \"respectfully refer[red]\" the court to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), which supposedly \"allows [a] relator to maintain the non-intervened portion of the action in the name of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Since then, the Government's claims against the Colleges have had two masters. The United States has pursued some claims directly through its Complaint in Intervention. The relators, on behalf of the United States, have asserted other claims against the Colleges in a separate Complaint, which the relators have publicly amended by naming additional defendants and asserting additional claims for relief. The operative pleadings in this case currently consist of an Amended Complaint in Intervention filed by the Government and a Fourth Amended Complaint filed by the relators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Colleges filed a motion to dismiss the Government's Amended Complaint, [Docket 439], and a separate motion to dismiss the relators' Fourth Amended Complaint, [Docket 438]. The Colleges have also moved this court to take judicial notice of certain documents in relation to the motions to dismiss. [Docket 440]. The court subsequently asked the parties to brief whether the False Claims Act permitted the relators to independently pursue claims against the Colleges after the Government elected to intervene in the lawsuit. Upon consideration of the briefing of the parties, the court rules as follows: the court GRANTS the motion for judicial notice, GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the motion to dismiss the Government's Amended Complaint, and GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the motion to dismiss the relators' Fourth Amended Complaint. Finally, the court concludes that the relators may not maintain their separate complaint in this action because the Government has elected to intervene. The court, therefore,\n   STRIKES the relators' post-intervention complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The relators filed their complaint in early 2013. They named as defendants Stevens-Henager, California College, College America Denver, and College America Arizona. The complaint alleged that these schools were liable under the False Claims Act because they made false statements concerning compliance with the Incentive Compensation Ban (ICB). Moreover, the complaint alleged an alternative factual basis for liability as to Stevens-Henager: the school made false statements to its accredit or regarding faculty qualifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Toward the end of 2013, the relators amended their complaint, adding CEHE and Carl Barney as defendants. The amended complaint added three factual bases for liability as to Stevens-Henager. Specifically, Stevens-Henager allegedly made false statements concerning attendance-taking requirements, academic-progress requirements, and recordkeeping requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In May 2014, the Government intervened in the action. The Government filed a complaint in intervention that named two defendants: Stevens-Henager and CEHE. The Government stated that it was intervening on some but not all of the relators' claims. Specifically, the Government alleged one factual basis for its claims against Stevens-Henager and CEHE: Stevens-Henager made false statements concerning the ICB. The Government chose not to intervene as to any of the claims against California College, College America Denver, College America Arizona, and Mr. Barney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly after the Government intervened, the relators filed their second amended complaint. Purporting to comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), the relators filed portions of the second amended complaint under seal because it \"alleged violations of the [False Claims Act] never before set forth in any prior complaint.\" The relators included allegations that the Colleges made false statements concerning the so-called 90/10 Rule-another factual basis for imposing liability on the Colleges. The relators also expanded the factual bases for liability as to California College, College America Denver, and College America Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Government declined to intervene as to the new claims alleged in the second amended complaint. But the Government \"respectfully referred the Court to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1),\" which supposedly \"allows [a] relator to maintain the non-intervened portion of the action in the name of the United States ....\" Section 3730(b)(1) actually provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-19\">\n   A person may bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United States Government. The action shall be brought in the name of the Government. The action may be dismissed only if the court and the Attorney General give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The relators subsequently moved for leave to file a third amended complaint. The stated purpose of the third amended complaint was to \"narrow and streamline the scope of the allegations and eliminate two theories of falsity from the [second amended complaint]: [the Colleges'] violations of the attendance-taking and academic-progress requirements.\" The relators explained that they \"never intended to pursue these theories\" but included them \"at the Government's request.\" But because the Government declined to intervene as to these theories, the relators\n   \"wish[ed] to eliminate them and focus on the ... more substantial theories.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Some six months later, following a change of venue to this court, the court granted the relators leave to file a third amended complaint. At the hearing on the motion to amend, the parties agreed that the relators could file a complaint that differed from the one attached to the motion to amend. But despite representing that they would eliminate factual bases for liability related to violations of attendance-taking and academic-progress requirements, the Third Amended Complaint actually expanded those factual bases for liability to California College, College America Denver, and College America Arizona. The Third Amended Complaint also added Weworski &amp; Associates, an accounting firm, as a defendant. The relators did not file the Third Amended Complaint under seal, so the Government had no opportunity to intervene while the complaint remained under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court eventually dismissed the relators' Third Amended Complaint and granted the relators and the Government leave to amend. The court granted both parties leave to amend so that they could allege facts to support a theory of liability that appeared viable in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). The Government filed an Amended Complaint in intervention, and the relators filed their Fourth Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Fourth Amended Complaint, like the relators' previous complaints, expands the scope of their claims. The relators allege that CEHE fraudulently induced the Department of Education to execute a Program Participation Agreement (PPA) in January 2013-a period that was not covered by any prior pleadings. And the relators allege that Stevens-Heanger violated the ICB by paying bonuses to online admissions consultants and enrollment advisors who worked for Independence University-an online school operated by Stevens-Henager. No prior pleading mentioned Independence University. The relators did not file the Fourth Amended Complaint under seal, so the Government had no opportunity to intervene while the complaint remained under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Colleges moved to dismiss both the relators' and the Government's complaints, claiming that neither states a claim upon which relief can be granted. After reviewing the briefing, however, the court became concerned with the way the case had been litigated. Specifically, the False Claims Act provides that if the Government intervenes in the action, the Government conducts the action and has the primary responsibility for prosecuting the action. Nothing in the False Claims Act suggests that a relator could maintain the non-intervened portion of an action, conducting, in essence, his or her separate action. And in light of how the case had proceeded, the court expressed concern as to whether the False Claims Act violates the \"take Care\" clause of Article II. Accordingly, the court asked the parties to submit supplemental briefs on these issues, which they did.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The court first addresses the Colleges' motion to dismiss the Government's Amended Complaint and the related motion to take judicial notice. The court then turns to the Colleges' motion to dismiss the relators' Forth Amended Complaint. Finally, the court addresses the issue of whether the relators may maintain a separate action after the Government chose to intervene.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    <strong>\n     I.

When a student completes 36 credits, the admissions consultant who enrolled that student receives a \"Completion Certificate.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 74.) The value assigned to a Completion Certificate depends on two factors: (1) the average number of starts (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , enrollments) that the admissions consultant achieved during the last three modules, and (2) the admissions consultant's \"Interview Conversion Rate.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 75.)

Packaged Starts refers to the average number of starts that an admissions consultant achieved per module during the last three modules.

The lowest value in the Packaged Starts column is five. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 79.) The top row of the chart lists ascending Interview Conversion Rates, or \"Intconversion%\" for short. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 76.) The lowest value in the Intconversion% row is 33 percent. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 77.)

It was written by William D. Hansen, the former Deputy Secretary of Education, and addressed to Terri Shaw, the former Chief Operating Officer for Federal Student Aid. It provides, in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    The purpose of the memorandum is to provide direction with regard to the Department's response to violations of [the ICB] ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    The [ICB] was designed to reduce the financial inventive for an institution to enroll students by misrepresenting the quality of the institution, or the ability of students to benefit from its educational programs. The Department has in the past measured the damages resulting from a violation as the total amount of student aid provided to each improperly recruited student. After further analysis, I have concluded that the preferable approach is to view a violation of the [ICB] as not resulting in monetary loss to the Department. Improper recruiting does not render a recruited student ineligible to receive student aid funds for attendance at the institution on whose behalf the recruiting is conducted. Accordingly, the Department should treat a violation of the law as a compliance matter for which remedial or punitive sanctions should be considered.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    In some instances, violations of the [ICB], either themselves or in combination with other program violations, may constitute a basis for limitation, suspension, or termination action. However, much more commonly, the appropriate sanction to consider will be the imposition of a fine.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    (footnote omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    2) The Mitchell Memo\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Mitchell Memo is dated June 2, 2015. It was written by Ted Mitchell, the former Undersecretary to the Secretary of Education, and addressed to James Runcie, the former Chief Operating Office of Federal Student Aid. It provides, in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    Until 2002, long after the enactment of the [ICB], the Department measured damages resulting from a violation of the prohibition as the total amount of student aid provided to improperly recruited students. In 2002, however, the Department's Deputy Secretary issued [the Hansen Memo] that changed the Department's approach for measuring damages in the context of establishing administrative liabilities, to view a violation of [the ICB] as not resulting in monetary loss to the Department. The [Hansen Memo] rested on the view that the Department purportedly suffers no loss when an institution receives Title IV funds by violating the promises and representations it made as a condition of participation in the Title IV programs.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    To the contrary, the Department, in fact, incurs monetary loss upon a violation of [the ICB], and the appropriate response is to recover that loss, as provided for in the Department's original policy. When acting as the Department's fiduciary, an institution may receive\n    funds only in accord with the representations it makes in order to become eligible for those funds. When an institution makes an incentive payment based upon the number of students enrolled, the institution breaches those representations. It thus violates a condition of its Title IV program eligibility and is not entitled to receive those Title IV funds. In this situation, an institution is liable to the Department for the cost of the funds it received.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Put simply, the Mitchell Memo repealed the Hansen Memo. But between October 30, 2002 and June 2, 2015, the Department of Education's position was that ICB violations do not result in monetary loss and do not render students ineligible to receive Title IV funds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    3) The Remaining Reports\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    In addition to the Hansen Memo and the Mitchell Memo, Stevens-Henager asks the court to take notice of three reports: (1) the First GAO Report, (2) the Second GAO Report, and (3) the OIG Report.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In the First GAO Report, the GAO analyzed the Department of Education's program-review and audit-report data related to the ICB for January 1998 through December 2009. The GAO found that during that period the Department of Education reported that 32 schools violated the ICB. In addition to these 32 schools, the Department of Education entered into settlement agreements with 22 other schools.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    In the Second GAO Report, the GAO provided \"additional information\" on the Department of Education's oversight of the ICB between January 1998 and December 2009. The relevant findings are as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    \u2022 Between 1998 and 2008, [the Department of Education] resolved most incentive compensation cases by requiring corrective actions or reaching settlement agreements, and did not limit, suspend, or terminate any school's access to federal student aid.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    \u2022 [The Department of Education] changed its enforcement policy in 2002, which resulted in an increased burden on [the Department of Education] to prove a violation and lessened associated financial penalties (fines and settlement payments). As a result, it became more difficult for [the Department of Education] to prove a school violated the [ICB] and schools ultimately paid smaller penalties.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    \u2022 [Department of Education] officials shared with [the GAO] internal guidance that is used to determine fines and settlement payments for incentive compensation cases. Internal guidance for imposing fines and settlement payments establishes caps on total penalty amounts, although related regulations do not have such caps. [Department of Education] officials have stated that the agency has not always used the guidance to determine fines and settlement payments.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    \u2022 [The Department of Education's] varying approaches for determining fines and settlement payments could lead to inconsistent treatment of schools without adequate justification for the differential treatment. For example, some schools were fined for [ICB] violations, while others were not. In one case, [the Department of Education] withdrew an initiated school fine of over $ 2 million dollars, and case documentation did not reveal the reason for the fine withdrawal.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    In the OIG Report, the OIG reiterated the findings from the First and Second GAO Reports, made findings as to Department of Education's enforcement of the ICB, and proposed recommendations that would facilitate enforcement of the ICB.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    4) Judicial Notice: Federal Rule of Evidence 201\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    A court may take judicial notice of a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because the fact \"can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" FED.

Indeed, Stevens-Henager asks the court to use the judicially noticed fact to conclude that the Department of Education did not attach importance to a school's promise to comply with the ICB. This the court cannot do.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <em>\n     C. The Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Stevens-Henager moves to dismiss the Government's amended complaint on the grounds that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. But, as noted above, Stevens-Henager did not address the Government's claims for payment by mistake and unjust enrichment, so the motion is better characterized as a motion to dismiss the Government's claims that arise under the False Claims Act. Moreover, Stevens-Henager's motion focuses almost entirely on only one of the Government's two theories of liability, the theory based on Stevens-Henager's G5 certifications.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Stevens-Henager raises, in essence, three arguments. First, Stevens-Henager argues that the Government fails to allege that Stevens-Henager's requests for payment in the G5 system constitute false claims. Second, Stevens-Henager argues that the Government fails to allege that Stevens-Henager knew that its requests for payment made in the G5 system were false. Third, Stevens-Henager argues that the Government has not alleged sufficient facts to establish that ICB noncompliance was material to the Department of Education's payment decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    1) Motion Standard\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    A complaint must contain \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED.

According to the Government, a G5 certification impliedly certifies that the student for whom the funds are requested is eligible to receive Title IV funds. And, as the Government's argument goes, a student is eligible to receive Title IV funds only if he or she is enrolled at an eligible institution.

The \"initial and continuing participation\" language does not mean that a school becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs simply because it violates the ICB.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The applicable regulations explain the possible consequences for failing to comply with a PPA:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    Noncompliance with these standards by an institution already participating in any Title IV, HEA program ...\n    <em>\n     may subject\n    </em>\n    the institution ... to proceedings under subpart G of this part.

Notably, an institution may continue to participate in Title IV programs despite noncompliance with its PPA\n    <em>\n     unless\n    </em>\n    the Secretary of Education commences proceedings that result in the \"termination of the participation of the institution in a Title IV HEA, program.\" \u00a7 668.11(b)(3).

That is, an institution can participate in Title IV programs unless and until its PPA is terminated or expires.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The Government argues that Stevens-Henager \"was not an eligible institution because it violated a core requirement in its PPA-the ICB-and that violation made the institution (and thus its students) ineligible for Title IV funds.\" But there is no regulation that provides for an automatic loss of eligibility when an institution violates \"a core requirement of its PPA.\" The Government simply ignores the applicable regulations in an attempt to suit its legal theory.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    In short, the Government fails to allege that students at Stevens-Henager were ineligible to receive Title IV funds. The Government does not allege that the Secretary of Education terminated Stevens-Henager's PPA or its participation in Title IV programs. Put simply, the Government's allegation that Stevens-Henager was ineligible to participate in Title IV because it violated the ICB is an unsupported legal conclusion that is belied by the applicable regulations. Consequently, the Government's claims fail to the extent they are based on a theory that Stevens-Henager's students were ineligible to receive Title IV funds because the school was not an eligible institution.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    <em>\n     Second\n    </em>\n    , even if the Government had alleged that Stevens-Henager was not an eligible institution (it did not), the Government has failed to allege that Stevens-Henager\n    <em>\n     knowingly\n    </em>\n    misrepresented that it\n    was an eligible institution when it submitted G5 certifications.

To support this, however, the Government cites a paragraph of its complaint that provides that Stevens-Henager was not an eligible institution because it \"knowingly violat[ed] the [ICB].\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 65.) That is not enough. The Government needed to allege that Stevens-Henager knew that it was ineligible to receive Title IV funds, and thus knew that its requests for payment were false or fraudulent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The Government notes that knowledge may be alleged generally. True, \"[k]nowledge ... may be alleged generally.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 9(b). But the Government has not even attempted to allege that Stevens-Henager knew that it was ineligible to receive Title IV funds because of ICB violations. Put simply, the Government misses the point. Perhaps the Government could have alleged generally that Stevens-Henager knew that it was ineligible to receive Title IV funds based on ICB violations. But it did not.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Because the Government has failed to allege that Stevens-Henager knew that it was ineligible to receive Title IV funds because of ICB violations, the Government has not plausibly alleged that Stevens-Henager knew that its requests for Title IV funds were false.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Stevens-Henager also argues that the Government's claims based on G5 certifications fail because the Government has not pled \"facts supporting materiality.\" The court, however, need not address this argument because the Government has failed to allege that Stevens-Henager's requests for payment in the G5 system were either expressly or impliedly false, and even if they were, the Government has not alleged that Stevens-Henager knew that the requests for payment were false.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    For the reasons stated above, the court dismisses the Government's claims under the False Claims Act to the extent that they are based upon its G5 certification theory of liability.

The Supreme Court, in\n    <em>\n     Escobar\n    </em>\n    , discussed materiality as it relates to claims for reimbursement that are allegedly false because they impliedly certify compliance with underlying regulations. Here, the Government alleges that claims were false based on promissory fraud: Stevens-Henager falsely certified that it would comply with the ICB in its 2007 and 2010 PPAs. In other words, the \"fraud\" was not a failure to disclose noncompliance with a regulation, as was the case in\n    <em>\n     Escobar\n    </em>\n    , but rather an affirmative misrepresentation: a false promise to comply with the ICB.

The relators, like the Government, have failed to allege that the Colleges were ineligible to receive Title IV funds, and even if the relators had, they have not alleged that the Colleges knew that they were ineligible to receive Title IV funds.

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) \"In 2013,\" Stevens-Henager \"allowed instructors without the required years of experience to teach medical coding and billing courses.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 155.) And in late 2013, Stevens-Henager \"allowed an instructor without a background in the law to teach a business law course.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) For CollegeAmerica Denver, the relators have alleged the examples discussed above in connection with CollegeAmerica Denver's February 2010 PPA.

This apparently led the relators to publicly file amended complaints, name additional defendants, and assert additional claims for relief. Problematically, however, nothing in the False Claims Act or the legislative history suggests that a relator can maintain the non-intervened portion of an action.

Those rights necessarily belong to the party with the primary responsibility for conducting the action-in this case, the Government.

Allowing relators to pursue the non-intervened claims is in direct conflict with this provision. The Government would not have primary responsibility for conducting the action if, after the Government files a complaint in intervention, a relator's complaint remained operative and the relator retained the right to amend that complaint, adding parties and claims to the Government's action. And it is unclear how the Government is not \"bound by an act of [a relator]\" if the relator can add allegations, defendants, and claims to the Government's action.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    At least three other provision of the False Claims Act suggest that relators may not maintain the non-intervened portion of an action.\n    <em>\n     First\n    </em>\n    , consider the provisions that deal with awards to relators. Section 3730(d)(1) provides that \"[i]f the Government\n    <em>\n     proceeds with an action\n    </em>\n    brought by a [relator] under subsection (b), such [relator] shall ... receive at least 15 percent but not more than 25 percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement of the claim.\" (emphasis added).

Neither the statute nor the legislative history suggests that a relator can pursue claims that are separate from the Government's to recover an increased award. In sum, the structure of damages provisions undermines the idea that relators can pursue \"non-intervened claims.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    Even if the court could apply the damages provisions to separate claims, the way in which this case has been litigated would create additional problems with apportioning an award between the Government and the relators. The Government seeks to impose liability on Stevens-Henager's requests for Title IV funds based on allegations that the school made false statements in certain PPAs concerning its intent to comply with the ICB. The relators seek to impose liability on the same exact requests for Title IV funds based on different sets of false statements. That is, the relators' claims against Stevens-Henager are duplicative of the Government's in the sense that the relators attempt to impose liability on the same claims for payment, but with a different factual basis. Assuming that both the relators and the Government prevail on their claims, it is entirely unclear how the court would determine the relators' share of damages. Presumably, the Government and the relators can come up with a \"practical\" solution to this problem.

And this makes sense.

Indeed, if a relator could pursue non-intervened claims after the Government intervenes in an action, it is unclear why the relator could not invoke the statute of limitations found in paragraph (2). The better approach is that the Government, when it intervenes, decides which claims are a part of the action, and the Government decides whether to prosecute any claims that fall under paragraph (2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    In sum, there is nothing in the False Claims Act to suggest that a relator may maintain \"non-intervened portion[s] of [an] action.\" Indeed, the False Claims Act is clear that the Government either \"elect[s] to intervene and proceed with the action,\" \u00a7 3730(b)(2), or it \"declines to take over the action,\" \u00a7 3730(b)(4)(B).\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n    There is no in between.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-231\">\n    When the Government intervenes in the action, the relator can \"continue as a party to the action.\" \u00a7 3730(c)(1). But that right does not encompass the right to conduct the action. If Congress intended to let relators conduct portions of the action after the Government intervened, the statute would provide, \"If the Government proceeds with the action, the action shall be conducted by the Government\n    <em>\n     and the person bringing the action\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3730(b)(4) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3730(c)(3) (\"If the Government elects not to proceed with the action, the [relator] shall have the right to conduct the action.\").

The relators also contend that \"a construction that eliminates partial intervention will simply lead the Government and relators to sever the non-intervened claims into separate actions during the seal period.\" Again, the court struggles to see how this is possible when relators cannot file a second action that is based on the underlying facts of the first action.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"13\">\n    <p id=\"p-273\">\n     <em>\n      See Claim\n     </em>\n     , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining claim as \"[a] demand for money, property, or a legal remedy to which one asserts a right; esp., the part of a complaint in a civil action specifying what relief the plaintiff asks for.-Also termed\n     <em>\n      claim for relief\n     </em>\n     \").\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"14\">\n    <p id=\"p-274\">\n     The relators argue that \"[t]he Government is primarily, not solely, responsible for the claims in which it has intervened.\" And they state that they are \"not in any way challenging the authority of the Government to prosecute the\n     <em>\n      intervened claims in whatever way the Government prefers\n     </em>\n     , with as little or as much help from Relators as the Government desires.\" (emphasis added). This statement is problematic. It implies that the relators think that they, not the Government, are primarily responsible for prosecuting portions of the action, which is troubling since it is the Government that is primarily responsible for \"prosecuting the action.\" \u00a7 3730(c)(1).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"15\">\n    <p id=\"p-275\">\n     <em>\n      See also\n     </em>\n     S.

Assuming that relators are entitled to an increased award if they prevail on their separate claims, it is in the relators' interest to prevail on their claims against Stevens-Henager without assisting the Government. Indeed, under the relators' interpretation of the statute, this would allow them to recover 25 to 30 percent of the proceeds of any award or settlement. But if the Government were to prevail on its claims against Stevens-Henager, the relators would potentially be limited to recovering 15 to 25 percent of the proceeds. Surely Congress did not intend that relators could prosecute claims in a way that makes them potentially adverse to the Government.
