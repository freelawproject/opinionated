The policy provides coverage for \"accidental direct physical loss\" to Plaintiffs' home, with certain exclusions. [14-1] \u00b6 2. The pertinent exclusion states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   We do not insure for any loss to the property ... which consists of, or is\n   <em>\n    directly and immediately caused by\n   </em>\n   ... n. pressure from or presence of tree, shrub or plant roots.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [14-2] \u00b6 3 (emphasis added) (quoting [14-1] at 41-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 11, 2015, water overflowed from a toilet on the main level of Plaintiffs' residence and caused extensive damage. A plant root had worked its way into the toilet piping and clogged it, causing an overflow. This incident resulted in the loss for which Plaintiffs seek coverage in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs submitted a claim to State Farm the same day. Later, on December 22, State Farm denied the claim, citing the root exclusion. Plaintiffs then sued State Farm for breach of contract (Count I) and diminution of value (Count II) in state court, alleging that under the policy water, not roots, was the \"direct and immediate cause\" of the damage. State Farm timely removed the action to this Court, and both parties have moved for summary judgment. State Farm moves for summary judgment on Counts I and II. Plaintiffs cross-move for summary judgment on Count I. Each count is taken in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Element One-Breach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The question of whether State Farm breached the policy boils down to this: whether Plaintiffs' loss was \"directly and immediately caused by ... pressure from or presence of tree, shrub, or plant\n   <em>\n    roots\n   </em>\n   .\" [14-1] at 41-42 (emphasis added). If it was not, as Plaintiffs argue, then State Farm breached the contract by failing to provide coverage for the water damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   State Farm contends that the damage to Plaintiffs' home, though resulting from water, was excluded from coverage because it was directly and immediately caused by roots blocking the flow of water. Plaintiffs contend otherwise, that the direct and immediate cause of the damage was not roots, but rather the backed-up water from a toilet. The roots were admittedly a remote cause of their loss, but not the direct and immediate cause as provided in the policy. Thus, the Court must define what a \"direct and immediate cause\" is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To begin, the Court holds that the policy language in this respect is unambiguous.

Having no intervening persons, conditions, or agencies[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Direct\n   </em>\n   , THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY (5th ed. 2016). It is synonymous with the word \"immediate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"435327\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/267/675/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Immediate\" is best defined as \"5.

Finally, \"cause\" is defined as the \"producer of an effect, result, or consequence.\"\n   <em>\n    Cause\n   </em>\n   , THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY . Thus, a direct and immediate cause of a certain effect is one that produces that effect without any intervening acts, agencies,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   or events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This is consistent with the way other courts have defined similar language. When there is a chain of events leading to a loss, as here, a direct and immediate cause has been defined as the one nearest in time to the specific event at issue. This is contrasted with proximate cause, which when dealing with a chain of events generally refers to the primary or legal cause for all foreseeable events in the chain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bjugan v.

Here, the chain of events giving rise to the disputed loss begins first with\n   the growth of a root. This initiated the chain of events leading to the ultimate loss (water damage) to Plaintiffs' home. The root grew into the toilet piping, which then clogged. The clogging caused the toilet water to back up, and this backup then damaged the floor. Thus, looking back from the loss, the nearest event in the chain was the toilet overflowing, not the root. Put another way, between the root growth and the loss, the water overflowing from the backed-up commode was an intervening agency or event. True, the root caused the loss. But it did not\n   <em>\n    directly and immediately\n   </em>\n   cause the loss as causation has been defined here. Without the water overflow the root would have only damaged the pipes. In order for the floors to be damaged, something other than just root growth had to occur, i.e., the backup of water.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the backup was an intervening event meaning that the root growth was not excluded from coverage because it was not the \"direct and immediate\" cause of the water damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   State Farm cites to\n   <em>\n    Wojciechowski v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-566 RMB/AMD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201623585\">\n    2012 WL 1623585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. May 8, 2012), in support of its position. But the Court respectfully declines to follow that court's interpretation of similar contract language. In\n   <em>\n    Wojciechowski\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff-insureds sought to recover from State Farm for water damage caused by wear and tear to a water pipe. The policy excluded coverage for loss that was directly and immediately caused by wear and tear. The plaintiff-insureds argued that the direct and immediate cause of their loss was the water that leaked from the worn-and-torn pipe, rather than the damage from the wear and tear itself. Their argument was essentially that the water leaking from the pipe was an intervening agency or event. The district court rejected this argument, granting State Farm summary judgment. It held that the distinction between the water damage from the leaking, worn-and-torn pipe, and the wear and tear that caused the leaking, was an \"empty distinction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On the contrary, the distinction is quite palpable because it gives meaning to the words \"direct\" and \"immediate.\" The parties' choice of language is presumably intentional, and here it reveals an intent to limit excluded causes to those that are \"direct\" and \"immediate.\" When confronted with a chain of events leading to a loss, only one of the causes in the chain is the \"direct and immediate\" cause of the loss at issue, regardless of whether a more remote event in the chain is also fairly considered the cause of the ultimate loss. Even if the primary event caused the loss, it is not the direct and immediate cause of every effect in the chain. Otherwise \"direct\" and \"immediate\" are left with little meaning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The problem with the\n   <em>\n    Wojciechowski\n   </em>\n   court's interpretation is that it too closely resembles proximate cause, which would make sense if the policy language referred to \"cause\" only without modification. It essentially holds that direct and immediate causes are the causes for any effect that is their foreseeable or natural consequence. To adopt this interpretation would effectively read out of the contract the parties' chosen language and would fail to give effect to the entirety of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v. Kaminsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"513833\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/271/719/\">\n    271 Ga.App. 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"513833\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/271/719/\">\n    610 S.E.2d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545 (2004) (\"[A] contract must be interpreted to give the greatest effect possible to all provisions rather than to leave any part of the contract unreasonable\n   or having no effect. And, one of the most fundamental principles of construction is that a court should, if possible, construe a contract so as not to render any of its provisions meaningless. The intention of the parties to a contract is ascertained from the entire contract, considering each provision in connection with the others, and not giving the contract a construction which entirely neutralizes one provision if it is susceptible of another which gives effect to all of its provisions.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Vaughn, Coltrane &amp; Assocs. v. Van Horn Constr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286058\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/254/693/\">\n    254 Ga.App. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286058\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/254/693/\">\n    563 S.E.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 550 (2002) ) ). This is why the Court charts a different path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, the Court holds that the loss to Plaintiffs' home was directly and immediately caused by water from the backed-up toilet, and not the root (excluding the physical damage caused by the root to the pipe, which was directly and immediately caused by the root). The Court grants that the root was\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   cause of the loss, but it was not its\n   <em>\n    direct and immediate\n   </em>\n   cause. Thus, the root exclusion does not apply to Plaintiffs' loss. And because State Farm has not disputed that in the absence of the root exclusion the loss would be covered, it breached its contract by failing to provide coverage for the water damage. Its motion for summary judgment must therefore be denied and Plaintiffs' cross motion granted as to breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Element Two-Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This now leaves the issue of damages. Plaintiffs have submitted documentary evidence setting forth an estimate of the damages they sustained as a result of the loss. State Farm contends that this evidence constitutes expert testimony and is inadmissible because it was not properly disclosed. Additionally, State Farm attempts to create a genuine dispute of fact as to damages by submitting evidence from one of its employees estimating a different amount of damages sustained by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs object to this as unauthenticated testimony because it conflicts with the witness's deposition testimony on the same subject. The Court begins first with State Farm's objections to Plaintiffs' putatively expert evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on an appraisal of their loss that was prepared by Bruce Fredrics, an adjuster with Professional Adjusting &amp; Consulting Service, LLC (\"PACS\"). The appraisal estimates that Plaintiffs sustained $ 75,681.11 in damages because of State Farm's breach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [17-1] at 13-14; [17-7] at 37-58. State Farm argues that this evidence is inadmissible because Fredrics is an expert whom Plaintiffs failed to timely disclose under Rule 26(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court finds that to the extent that the appraisal contains estimates of repairs required and its cost it constitutes expert evidence because it \"requires specialized knowledge or technical expertise\" possessed by Fredrics by virtue of his occupation as a trained adjuster.\n   <em>\n    Armstead v. Allstate Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 1:14-cv-586-WSD,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20928722\">\n    2016 WL 928722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 11, 2016). Plaintiffs did not disclose Fredrics as an expert witness prior to using his testimony in support of their motion for summary judgment and did not provide or seek an excuse from the requirement of providing an expert report under Rule 26(a)(2)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"When a plaintiff fails to meet a Rule 26(a)(2)(B) disclosure deadline, she must demonstrate her mistake was either justified or harmless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Finch v.

(citing FED. R. CIV. P. 37(c)(1) ). Though Plaintiffs do not put forward a justification for the nondisclosure, the Court is satisfied that it was ultimately harmless. Plaintiffs released the appraisal in the course of discovery on February 2, 2017. Discovery ended July 31, 2017, meaning State Farm had ample opportunity to depose the witness or examine Plaintiffs' evidence in the course of the proceedings but did not. Therefore, State Farm's objection is overruled, and the Fredrics appraisal will not be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Now the Court must ascertain whether State Farm's proposed counter-testimony on damages is admissible and creates a genuine dispute of material fact on the issue of damages. Chandra Jackson, one of its claim specialists, estimates Plaintiffs' loss at $ 6,137.54, exclusive of costs of emergency remediation. Jackson relied on an appraisal she prepared regarding the loss to Plaintiffs' home. Plaintiffs argue that State Farm failed to properly authenticate this evidence because Jackson previously testified by deposition on June 20, 2017 that no such estimate was prepared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This objection is overruled. Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a) requires that an \"item of evidence\" be authenticated through \"evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\" There is no serious contention that Jackson's estimate is not what it purports to be, that is, an estimate she prepared. Plaintiffs characterize the estimate as one that purports to be contemporaneous to the loss. But Jackson makes no such claim. And while the estimate is undated, there is a date stamp of September 17, 2017 on the document. It is likely, especially in light of Jackson's deposition testimony, that it was created much later than the loss incident.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [20-1] at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Though concerning, these discrepancies do not affect authenticity. Rather, they relate to the evidence's quality, its probative value, or given Jackson's deposition testimony, they create an opportunity for impeachment or undermining Jackson's credibility on cross-examination. But it is not an issue of admissibility resolvable at the summary judgment phase, as issues of credibility are reserved for trial.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, whether he is ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict.\");\n   <em>\n    Reese v.

Tort law is concerned with the vindication of private rights against certain publicly defined wrongs. Contract law, on the other hand, is concerned with the vindication of private rights against privately defined wrongs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     First State Bank of Monticello v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5582018\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/555/564/#p570\">\n     555 F.3d 564\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 570 (7th Cir. 2009) (\"Insurance-coverage cases are not concerned with the philosophical social-duty underpinnings of tort law. The action sounds in contract, and our task is to interpret the parties' agreement.\"). Because the parties have chosen a specific formulation of causation that differs from the general understanding of causation, the Court proceeds to define and apply this definition in light of the ordinary-sense definition of their chosen language.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    As Plaintiffs point out, the loss directly and immediately caused by the root was the damage to the pipes through which the roots grew. This would fit within the exclusion State Farm invoked when denying coverage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Because it appears that Fredrics was an expert \"retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case\" under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), Plaintiffs should have provided an expert report or sought the Court's leave to forego this requirement prior to using Fredrics's testimony to support their motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
