Teilborg, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court is Defendant Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.'s (\"Defendant\") Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 32) and Plaintiff Carol M. Whitmire's (\"Plaintiff\") Rule 56(d) Application (Doc. 35 at 11-13). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's Rule 56(d) Application is denied, and Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about February 20, 2008, Defendant hired Plaintiff Carol M. Whitmire (\"Plaintiff\") as a Cashier in its Show Low, Arizona store. (Docs. 36 \u00b6 1; 33-1 at 11-12, Whitmire Depo. at 35: 22-36:3, 38:1-13). During her new-hire orientation, Plaintiff received training on Defendant's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy, as well as its Discrimination and Harassment Prevention Policy. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 2; 36 \u00b6 2). Plaintiff also acknowledged and signed Walmart's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy, indicating her understanding that if \"testing indicates the presence of illegal drugs ... in [her] body in any detectable amount, [she] w[ould] be terminated.\" (Docs. 33 \u00b6 5; 33-3 at 9; 36 \u00b6 5). Plaintiff further acknowledged the drug testing policies and procedures described in this Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy, \"and the use by Wal-Mart of results thereof in further determining [her] continued employment.\" (Doc. 33-3 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2013, after working as a Cashier for approximately four years, Plaintiff was promoted to the position of Customer Service Supervisor. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 8; 36 \u00b6 8). On December 19, 2013, Plaintiff acknowledged that she had the ability to perform the essential functions of this Customer Service Supervisor position either with or without a reasonable accommodation. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 9; 33-3 at 25-27; 36 \u00b6 9). These essential functions include \"maintaining a safe shopping environment,\" \"ensuring a safe work environment,\" \"[o]perat[ing] equipment, such as\n   cash registers and related tools, to process Customer purchases,\" handling money, and \"[s]upervis[ing] Associates.\" (Docs. 33 \u00b6 10; 33-3 at 25; 36 \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In or about the end of 2013 or beginning of 2014, Plaintiff obtained an Arizona medical marijuana card, which she maintained during her employ at Walmart. (Docs. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; 36 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13). Plaintiff claims she smokes medical marijuana just before bed as a sleep aid and to help treat the chronic pain she suffers due to arthritis and a prior shoulder surgery. (Doc. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 34-36, 39-40). Plaintiff also asserts that she has never brought marijuana to work or used or been impaired by it during her hours of employment. (Doc. 36 \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2016, Defendant modified its Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy to expressly state that employees are prohibited from \"[r]eporting to work under the influence of drugs or alcohol, including medical marijuana.\" (Docs. 33-3 at 12; 36 \u00b6 2). Defendant's amended Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy also requires employees to submit to a drug or alcohol test if they suffer a workplace injury \"that requires medical treatment from an outside health care provider.\" (Doc. 33-3 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2016, Plaintiff transferred to Defendant's Taylor, Arizona store. (Docs. 36 \u00b6 1; 33-1 at 11-12, Whitmire Depo. at 35: 22-36:3, 38:1-13). While working on May 21, 2016 in the Taylor store, a bag of ice fell on Plaintiff's wrist as she was leveling the bags in the ice machine. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 16; 36 \u00b6 16). Plaintiff reported this incident to Management and filed an Associate Incident Report with Defendant that same day. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 16; 36 \u00b6 16; 36-1 at 12, 32). However, Plaintiff finished her shift and did not seek any medical attention on May 21, 2016 because she did not feel the incident was serious enough. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 17; 36 \u00b6 17; 36-1 \u00b6 15). Defendant's Associate Accident Review Form indicates that Defendant did not find Plaintiff responsible for the incident. (Doc. 36-1 at 32 (\"Not conclusive that the associate did not follow safe work practices[.] ... This could have just as easily happened to a customer.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 23, 2016, Plaintiff notified Human Resources of continued swelling and pain in her wrist. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 18; 36 \u00b6 18). Just before 2:00 a.m. on May 24, 2016, Plaintiff smoked medical marijuana prior to going to sleep. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 19; 36 \u00b6 19; 36-1 \u00b6 18). Later that same day (May 24, 2016), Plaintiff clocked in to her scheduled shift at 2:00 p.m., and told Personnel Coordinator Debra Vaughn that her wrist still hurt. (Docs. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; 36 \u00b6\u00b6 20-21). Pursuant to Walmart policy, Ms. Vaughn directed Plaintiff to an urgent care clinic for a wrist examination and post-accident urine drug test. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 21; 36 \u00b6 21). Except for this visit to the urgent care clinic on May 24, 2016, Plaintiff never missed any time at work as a result of her wrist injury. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 31; 36 \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the urgent care clinic, Plaintiff's arm was x-rayed, and she submitted a urine sample for the drug test. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 22; 36 \u00b6 22). Following this drug screen, Plaintiff claims that she returned to work and informed Ms. Vaughn that the clinic had not taken a copy of her medical marijuana card, even after Plaintiff informed the clinic of her medical marijuana usage and cardholder status. (Doc. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 43-44). At this time, Plaintiff asserts that Ms. Vaughn took a copy of the medical marijuana card. (Doc. 36 \u00b6 44). This was the first time that Plaintiff informed anyone at Walmart that she had a medical marijuana card. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 14; 36 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 45). Plaintiff also never informed anyone at Walmart that she had a disability. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 15; 36 \u00b6 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff's May 24, 2016 drug screen tested positive for marijuana metabolites at a quantitative value of greater than 1000\n   ng/ml. (Doc. 33-3 at 33).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a signed declaration, Ms. Vaughn stated that, \"upon reasonable belief, Plaintiff's May 24, 2016 positive test result for marijuana indicated that she was impaired by marijuana during her shift that same day.\" (Doc. 33-3 at 23, Vaughn Decl. \u00b6 14).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 31, 2016 (prior to the test result being reported to Defendant), Plaintiff had a follow-up interview with a Medical Review Officer to discuss her positive drug screen, at which Plaintiff told the Medical Review Officer that she had an Arizona-issued medical marijuana card. (Docs. 36 \u00b6 46; 36-1 at 26). The Medical Review Officer verified Plaintiff's medical marijuana card that same day. (Doc. 36-1 at 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In June, Plaintiff received a letter dated June 7, 2016 from the Industrial Commission of Arizona alerting Plaintiff that her employer's insurance carrier had been notified of her workers' compensation claim. (Doc. 36-1 at 10). That same month, Plaintiff received two Notices of Claim Status from the Industrial Commission of Arizona regarding her workers' compensation claim, both of which were dated June 22, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, 16). One of these letters indicated that Plaintiff's claim was accepted, but that no compensation would be paid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). The other letter stated that Plaintiff's injury had not resulted in permanent disability, and indicated that temporary compensation and active medical treatment terminated on May 24, 2016 because \"claimant was discharged.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Following the injury-causing incident on May 21, 2016, Plaintiff continued working full-time until she was suspended due to her positive drug test on July 4, 2016. (Doc. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 25, 49). On July 22, 2016 Defendant terminated Plaintiff, only citing her positive drug test as the reason for her termination. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 26; 33-3 at 35; 36 \u00b6 26). Plaintiff admits that she has no evidence that Defendant terminated her because of her status as a medical marijuana cardholder. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 33; 36 \u00b6 33). Aside from her termination, Plaintiff does not feel that Defendant discriminated against her in any way. (Docs. 33 \u00b6 28; 36 \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 22, 2017, Plaintiff dual-filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the Arizona Attorney General's Office, Civil Rights Division. (Docs. 36 \u00b6 73; 36-1 at 22). After receiving her Notice of Right to Sue from the Arizona Attorney General's Office on June 6, 2017, (Docs. 36 \u00b6 74; 36-1 at 24), Plaintiff filed her Complaint on June 9, 2017, (Doc. 1). Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that she was wrongfully terminated and/or discriminated against in violation of the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (\"AMMA\"), A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2813(B), the Arizona Civil Rights Act (\"ACRA\"), A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1463(B), the Arizona Employment Protection Act (\"AEPA\"), A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1501(A)(3)(b), and the Arizona workers' compensation statutes, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 23-901,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 1 at 1, 4-6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant filed an Answer on August\n   11, 2017 denying that it wrongfully terminated, discriminated against, or engaged in any conduct toward Plaintiff creating liability. (Doc. 6 at 1). In its Answer, Defendant also alleged as an affirmative defense that it \"has established a policy and implemented a drug testing program in compliance with Arizona law, so its actions toward Plaintiff are protected from litigation under A.R.S. \u00a7 23-493.06,\" Arizona's Drug Testing of Employees Act (\"DTEA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 5, 2018, Defendant responded to Plaintiff's First Set of Interrogatories, stating that \"Defendant does not contend Plaintiff was employed in a safety-sensitive position as defined under Arizona law.\" (Docs. 15; 36-1 at 74-75). However, Defendant thereafter filed a Motion for Summary Judgment which argued, in part, that Plaintiff was in a safety sensitive position, (Doc. 20), and supplemented its interrogatory answer to say the same, (Doc. 28). As a result, the parties attended a Discovery Dispute Hearing on August 22, 2018, at which the Court ordered that Defendant's supplemental response to its interrogatory answer (Doc. 28) be struck as untimely, and precluded any argument by Defendant that Plaintiff was in a safety sensitive position. (Doc. 31). The Court also struck Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 20), Plaintiff's Response (Doc. 24), and Defendant's Reply (Doc. 29). (Doc. 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 30, 2018, Defendant re-filed its Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 32), to which Plaintiff filed a Response and Rule 56(d) Application (Doc. 35) on October 1, 2018. On October 18, 2018, Defendant filed a Reply in support of its Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. 37).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing oral argument on November 13, 2018, the Court issued an Order on November 21, 2018 declining to rule on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 32) until it received supplemental briefing on: (1) why the Court should or should not hold that sections 23-493(6) and 23-493.06(A)(6) of the DTEA unconstitutionally amend or implicitly repeal sections 36-2813(B)(2) and 36-2814(A)(3) of the AMMA; and (2) if the Court does find these sections of the DTEA unconstitutional under the Voter Protection Act, why Plaintiff should or should not be entitled to summary judgment on her claim under the AMMA pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). (Doc. 44). The parties each filed briefs addressing these issues on December 7, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 48; 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Constitutional Question (Doc. 45) pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1(a) and certified that she served a copy of this Notice on the Attorney General for the State of Arizona via certified mail, return receipt requested on that same date. The Court served its Certification of Constitutional Question (Doc. 46) in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1(b) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202403\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) via certified mail on the Attorney General for the State of Arizona on November 27, 2018. The Attorney General did not intervene within sixty days from the date Plaintiff filed her Notice of Constitutional Question-the deadline set in the Court's Certification Order in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.1(c). (Doc. 46 at 2). However, the State of Arizona did enter an appearance as a proposed\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   on January 22, 2019. (Docs. 53; 54). Finding that allowing the State of Arizona's\n   proposed\n   <em>\n    amicus curiae\n   </em>\n   brief in support of no party would aid the Court in resolving the pending matters, the Court granted the State of Arizona's Motion for Leave to File Amicus Curiae Brief (Doc. 54) on January 23, 2019. (Doc. 55).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court now rules on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 32) and Plaintiff's Rule 56(d) Application (Doc. 35 at 11-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support that assertion by ... citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits, or declarations, stipulations ... admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials,\" or by \"showing that materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202403\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202403\">\n    56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A-B).

Section 36-2813(C) is also distinguishable from the anti-discrimination provision, \u00a7 36-2813(B), because there is a pre-existing mechanism for wronged patients to enforce violations of \u00a7 36-2813(C) by submitting a complaint to the Arizona Medical Board to investigate and discipline a physician for unprofessional conduct, which includes the violation of any state law applicable to the practice of medicine, such as the AMMA.\n   <em>\n    Gersten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310309\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/301/\">\n    395 P.3d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, \"there is no such independent enforcement mechanism against employers\" for violations of \u00a7 36-2813(B). (Doc. 35 at 5).

(Doc. 35 at 5). H.B. 2541 amended A.R.S. \u00a7 23-493.06(A)(6) of the DTEA to expand protections for employers who terminate an employee \"based on the employer's good faith belief that [the] employee had an impairment while working while on the employer's premises or during hours of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DRUGS, 2011 Ariz.

H.B. 2541 also added the \"safety-sensitive\" concept to \u00a7 23-493.06(A)(7) of the DTEA, which permits an employer to \"exclude an employee from performing a safety-sensitive\n   position\" if the employer has a \"good faith belief that the employee is engaged in the current use of any drug\" which \"could cause an impairment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182053\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/641/888/#p899\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiff, H.B. 2541 creates \"exceptions and modifications that directly impact Subsection B\" of \u00a7 36-2813 of the AMMA, thus showing that \"the Legislature believed that employers had new exposure to private lawsuits because of the AMMA.\" (Doc. 35 at 5). The Court agrees, as the Fact Sheet for H.B. 2541 explicitly mentions the AMMA before introducing the above modifications to the DTEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arizona Senate Fact Sheet, 2011 Reg.

(Doc. 1 at 4-5, 7). It is undisputed that Plaintiff, a qualified registered patient under the AMMA, smoked marijuana just before 2:00\n   a.m. on May 24, 2016 prior to going to sleep, and then clocked in to her scheduled shift at 2:00 p.m. later that same day. (Docs. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 19-21; 36 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 19-21; 36-1 \u00b6 18). It is also undisputed that the only reason given to Plaintiff for her suspension and termination was her positive drug test. (Docs. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26; 36 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 33-3 at 35). Defendant claims that the results of this drug screen, which \"was positive for marijuana metabolites at a level of greater than 1000 ng/ml, the highest level the test could record,\" gave Walmart \"a good faith basis to believe Plaintiff was impaired by marijuana on May 24, 2016, on Defendant's premises during work hours, and Walmart terminated Plaintiff's employment\n   <em>\n    solely on that basis\n   </em>\n   .\" (Doc. 32 at 9) (emphasis added). Defendant argues as an affirmative defense that it is protected from litigation because \"it has established a policy and implemented a drug testing program\" in compliance with A.R.S. \u00a7 23-493.06 of the DTEA. (Docs. 6 at 9; 32 at 9, 15). Section 23-493.06 exempts an employer from liability for \"actions based on the employer's good faith\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   belief that an employee had an impairment\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   while working while on the employer's premises or during hours of employment.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 23-493.06(A)(6).

Reading the DTEA and AMMA in harmony, an employer cannot be sued for suspending or firing a registered qualifying patient based on the employer's good faith belief that the employee was impaired by marijuana at work, where that belief is based on a drug test which establishes the presence of metabolites or components of marijuana\n   <em>\n    in sufficient concentration to cause impairment\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855520\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 23-493(6), 23-493.06(A)(6), 36-2813(B)(2), 36-2814(A)(3). At issue in this case is whether Plaintiff's positive drug screen is alone sufficient to support Defendant's \"good faith belief\" that Plaintiff was impaired by marijuana at work on May 24, 2016 in the absence of any other evidence of impairment or any expert testimony establishing that the level of metabolites present in Plaintiff's drug screen demonstrates that marijuana was present in her\n   system in a sufficient concentration to cause impairment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In presenting its affirmative defense under the DTEA, Defendant bears the burden of proving that it had a good faith belief that Plaintiff was impaired by marijuana at work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855520\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 23-493(6), 23-493.06(A)(6).

According to Defendant, it \"does not need to argue[ ] that any particular numerical reading indicates 'impairment,' \" and \"does not need expert witness testimony to correlate a specific numerical reading to 'impairment.' \" (Doc. 48 at 8). Rather, Defendant believes Plaintiff's positive drug screen sufficiently supports its good faith belief that Plaintiff was impaired at work because \"the positive reading was 'so positive' that it was above what the test could measure (that is, above 1000 ng/ml).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In opposition, Plaintiff disputes Defendant's \"good faith belief\" on the ground that it is an unreasonable belief to hold in light of Arizona case law discussing the relationship between marijuana metabolites and impairment. (Doc. 35 at 12-13 (\"the 'level' shown in a urine test cannot serve as a good faith basis for 'deeming' someone impaired\") (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Without expert testimony establishing that Plaintiff's drug screen shows marijuana metabolites or components in a sufficient concentration to cause impairment, Defendant is unable to prove that Plaintiff's drug screen gave it a\n   \"good faith basis\" to believe Plaintiff was impaired at work on May 24, 2016. Accordingly, Defendant's affirmative defense under \u00a7 23-493.06(A)(6) of the DTEA fails. Therefore, the Court denies Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment as to the second count in Plaintiff's Complaint alleging discrimination under the AMMA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   It is undisputed that Plaintiff, a registered qualifying patient, was suspended and ultimately terminated because of her positive urine screen showing the presence of marijuana metabolites. Defendant claims: \"[u]nder Walmart policy, Plaintiff was terminated for testing positive for marijuana, which is a legitimate reason for termination, even under the AMMA.\" (Doc. 32 at 14). According to Defendant, \"Walmart has a policy of terminating Associates if they test positive for marijuana while on Walmart's premises or during working hours\n   <em>\n    regardless of whether the employee possesses a medical marijuana card and regardless of the level of marijuana detected\n   </em>\n   .\" (Doc. 33-3 at 22, Decl. of Debra Vaughn \u00b6 6) (emphasis added). However, as Plaintiff points out, terminating a registered qualifying patient who tests positive for marijuana \"regardless of whether the employee possesses a medical marijuana card and regardless of the level of marijuana detected\" constitutes a \"complete and 'bright line' disregard for the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act's antidiscrimination provisions[.]\" (Doc. 35 at 1). Indeed, section 36-2813(B)(2) of the AMMA protects qualifying registered patients, like Plaintiff, who merely test positive for marijuana metabolites. Without any evidence that Plaintiff \"used, possessed or was impaired by marijuana\" at work on May 24, 2016, it is clear that Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff in violation of A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2813(B)(2) of the AMMA by suspending and then terminating Plaintiff solely based on her positive drug screen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2813(B)(2) (\"[A]n employer may not discriminate against a person in hiring, termination or imposing any term or condition of employment or otherwise penalize a person based upon ...

Accordingly, the second element of Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case is met. Rather, the contention lays in the first and third elements, as Defendant claims that Plaintiff cannot establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation because Plaintiff cannot show that she engaged in a protected activity nor demonstrate a causal connection between any purported protected activity and the adverse employment action she suffered.

In support of these contentions, Defendant only cites its own Statement of Facts (Doc. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 31-32), which purports that the following portion of Plaintiff's deposition corroborates these statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Q: Did you fill out any workers' comp paperwork, like making a claim?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   A: I don't think so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   Q: Yeah, I didn't see anything.

Rather, Plaintiff merely answered \"I don't know\" in response to questioning by counsel for Defendant. (Doc. 33-2 at 5, Plaintiff Depo. at 99:7). Moreover, while Plaintiff stated in her deposition that she did not miss any time as a result of her wrist injury, (Doc. 33-2 at 5, Plaintiff Depo. at 99:8-10), Plaintiff left her scheduled shift on May 24, 2016 to get x-rays and submit a post-accident drug screen in accordance with Defendant's company policy, (Docs. 33-3 \u00b6 12; 36 \u00b6 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Although Defendant asserts that \"Plaintiff's reporting of her wrist injury [ ] is not tantamount to 'exercising a right under the workers' compensation statute,' for purposes of establishing that she engaged in a protected activity,\" (Doc. 32 at 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Quinones v.

(Docs. 33 \u00b6 16; 36 \u00b6 16). Although Plaintiff\n   did not personally \"file\" a workers' compensation claim, she did fill out an Associate Incident Report on the date of her accident, (Doc. 36-1 at 12), which began Defendant's investigation into her accident, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32, 34-35, 42-43), and which ultimately resulted in the generation of a workers' compensation claim by Defendant on Plaintiff's behalf, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 14, 16). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). Plaintiff also requested additional medical treatment for her injuries from Ms. Vaughn beyond her initial visit to the clinic on May 24, 2016. (Docs. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 55-57; 36-1 at 30 (email from Ms. Vaughn on June 28, 2016 stating that Plaintiff requested medical care for her work injury on May 21, 2016) ). As Plaintiff exercised her rights under \u00a7 23-1021 of the workers' compensation statutes, the Court finds that Plaintiff engaged in protected activity. Therefore, Plaintiff has met the first element of her\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Whether There is a Causal Link Between the Purported Protected Activity and Plaintiff's Termination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Although Defendant claims that Plaintiff cannot show a causal connection between any purported protected activity and the adverse employment action she suffered, (Doc. 32 at 13), the Court finds that Plaintiff has established this third element of her\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for retaliation. \"To prove this 'causal link,' the employee must show that the employer's 'retaliatory motive played a part in the employment action.' \"\n   <em>\n    Knox v.

Furthermore, an email chain in the record between Debra Vaughn, Defendant's Personnel Coordinator, and Jason Krongaard, Defendant's Market Asset Protection Manager, clearly demonstrates that Defendant knew of Plaintiff's workers' compensation claim prior to Plaintiff's termination on July 22, 2016. (Doc. 36-1 at 29-30). Specifically, Ms. Vaughn emailed Mr. Krongaard on June 28, 2016-almost an entire month before Plaintiff's termination-stating: \"I need direction in regards to Carol Whitmire.

(Doc. 32 at 14 (\"Plaintiff was terminated because she tested positive for marijuana, and Walmart has a bright-line policy of terminating employees who test positive for a Schedule I controlled substance like marijuana, including medical marijuana cardholders who are deemed to be impaired at work.\").

At most, there is temporal proximity between Plaintiff's protected activity under Arizona's workers' compensation statutes and her termination, which is not enough to sustain a claim for retaliatory discharge.
