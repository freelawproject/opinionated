Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.

Thereafter, plaintiff identified \"at least\" 126 sites in New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut that satisfied defendants' stated criteria.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the Howard Group, Cumberland has since acquired the rights to, and has built, or intends to build, new convenience stores on \"at least ten\" of the sites identified by plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. \u00b6 18.

First, defendants contend plaintiff has failed to comply with New York Real Property Law (\"RPL\") \u00a7 442-d, which precludes unlicensed brokerages from pursuing unpaid commissions through civil suits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, defendants argue plaintiff has failed to identify the essential terms of any alleged brokerage agreement between the parties. Third, defendants maintain that any attempt by plaintiff to recover in quasi-contract should be considered duplicative of its apparent breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Howard Group responds by insisting that defendants have \"completely misconstrued\" the nature of its claim for relief. Plaintiff explains that it \"does not claim to have entered into an agreement with the defendants that provides for real estate commissions,\" written or otherwise. Pl.'s Mem. at 4, 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, plaintiff argues it is seeking relief under the principle of quantum meruit for the \"reasonable value\" of services it rendered on behalf of defendants; i.e., its identification of potential locations for Cumberland-branded convenience stores.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 4. According to plaintiff, it \"anticipated such compensation would be in the form of real estate commissions paid by the owners of the sites identified for the defendants when the defendants actually acquired the sites.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants reply that the Howard Group cannot evade the brokerage licensure requirement imposed by RPL \u00a7 442-d by casting its claim in quantum meruit rather than breach of contract. And even if plaintiff could, defendants argue that plaintiff's \"admission that it performed the claimed services without any expectation of compensation\" directly from defendants themselves would nevertheless be fatal to such a claim.

Plaintiff asserts it should be permitted to amend its pleading to comply with RPL \u00a7 442-d's pleading requirement in the event defendants' motion to dismiss is granted. In reply to this request, defendants suggest the reason plaintiff has not yet cured this otherwise \"simple defect\" in pleading is because it cannot actually do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

The Howard Group has not submitted a proposed amended complaint in accordance with this District's Local Rule 7.1(a)(4). More importantly, though, plaintiff has not given any meaningful indication that it could correct the pleading defect in a manner consistent with Rule 11(b), which governs representations made the Court.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Thousand Island Park Corp. v.
