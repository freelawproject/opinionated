This charge is predicated on a 2011 removal order issued pursuant to an expedited removal proceeding. During that proceeding, an immigration official considered defendant's case, determined that he was inadmissible to the United States, and entered a removal order. Defendant was then removed from the United States. In 2017, defendant was found in the District of Oregon, in violation of the prior removal order, and this indictment issued. Presently before the Court is defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment. (doc. 25) For the reasons set forth herein, the Court holds that the 2011 removal order failed to comply with the requirements of due process and cannot be used as a predicate offense to sustain the present \u00a7 1326 charge. Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss (doc. 25) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Once an individual enters the United States, she or he is entitled to the protections of the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    Shaughnessy v.

There is no evidence in the record that the immigration official allowed defendant to review Form I-860 or that defendant signed the reverse of the form as required.

This is not correct. Even if the official did serve Form I-860 as it appears in the record on defendant, there would still be a\n   due process violation. The front side of Form I-860 does not demonstrate that defendant was given notice of the charges against him and given the opportunity to respond in a sworn statement. The regulation requires that the defendant provide his signature on the reverse of the form to acknowledge receipt, and here there is no signature from the defendant.

The Ninth Circuit considered similar facts in\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   and found that a defendant could plausibly have been granted relief during his expedited removal proceedings. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   had six previous illegal reentry\n   convictions and an intent to violate immigration laws by reentering the US by walking across the border. However, the Ninth Circuit held that these factors were overridden by the \"compelling humanitarian interest in keeping families united\" because the defendant was married to a citizen and had citizen children. Despite the defendant's lengthy criminal and immigration history, the public interest and humanitarian factor \"weigh[ed] significantly\" in his favor. The court held that an immigration official could plausibly have granted relief by permitting the defendant to withdraw his application for admission.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828683\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1077/#p1079\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Likewise in this case, the humanitarian and public interest factor plausibly weigh in favor of an immigration official granting similar relief. Defendant, like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   , was married and had two citizen children living in the United States at the time of his expedited removal proceedings. Further, he is a longtime resident of the United States who had lived and worked in this country since he was 13 years old.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828683\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1077/#p1079\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Other INS Manual factors also plausibly support a grant of relief. Defendant has a minor immigration and criminal history, which is less severe than the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   . Defendant is not an aggravated felon, his criminal record consists only of misdemeanor offenses, and he had no immigration violations prior to his 2011 expedited removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Importantly, there is no evidence that defendant engaged in obvious fraud or deceit, which would generally render him ineligible for relief. While defendant's young age and apparent good health weigh against a grant of relief, he has presented a sufficient evidentiary foundation upon which an immigration officer could have afforded relief during the 2011 proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly, because defendant's due process rights were violated, and he was prejudiced by the result, I find that his 2011 removal order was fundamentally unfair. Defendant has successfully challenged the predicate offense for the current illegal reentry indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There is insufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate that defendant's due process rights were protected during his 2011 removal proceedings. There is insufficient evidence in the record to indicate that defendant received notice of the charges against him and there is no evidence in the record to demonstrate that he acknowledged those charges or was given an opportunity to respond to them. Because defendant could plausibly have been granted relief in the form of withdrawal of his application for admission, I find that his 2011 removal order is invalid and cannot serve as the predicate for the current \u00a7 1326 charge. Defendant's motion to dismiss (doc. 25) is GRANTED, and this case is DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The regulations state: \"The examining immigration officer shall advise the alien of the charges against him or her on Form I-860, Notice and Order of Expedited Removal, and the alien shall be given an opportunity to respond to those charges in the sworn statement. After obtaining supervisory concurrence in accordance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section, the examining immigration official shall serve the alien with Form I-860 and the alien shall sign the reverse of the form acknowledging receipt.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20235.3\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2)(i).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
