The Coyle/Reno Joint Venture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 12, 2011, Plaintiff Reno Contracting entered into a joint venture agreement with Coyle Residential, Inc. for the purpose of engaging in a construction project at 3471 North First Street, San Jose, California, and 251 Brandon Street, San Jose, California (\"the Riverview Project\"). (\n   <em>\n    Joint Statement of Disputed and Undisputed Facts (\"JSDUF\")\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Coyle/Reno joint venture (\"Coyle/Reno\") was to serve as the general contractor for the Riverview Project, with Silverline Construction, Inc. (\"Silverline\") serving as a subcontractor. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 9.) According to Plaintiff, the terms of the joint venture agreement were such that Coyle Residential was responsible for on-site supervision of construction activities of the Riverview Project (including subcontractors), while Reno Contracting handled off-site administrative duties. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 35] \u00b6\u00b6 86-87\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Coyle/Reno and Silverline entered into a Master Subcontract Agreement (\"MSA\") that governed their respective rights and obligations as to the Riverview Project. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 10.) The MSA specified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Subcontractor shall not make any changes to the work set forth in the Subcontract Documents, either as additions or deletions, without the written direction of Contractor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 12.) It further specified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Subcontractor shall immediately provide written notification to Contractor if a written direction could result in additional costs or time of performance so that Contractor has sufficient time to take actions to minimize any additional costs or time, and has sufficient time to provide notification to Owner in accordance with the Contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 19, 2013, Silverline executed a stop payment notice on the Riverview Project. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.) This notice asserted that Silverline \"ha[d] furnished work, labor, equipment, material, and/or services\" for the Riverview Project and that Coyle/Reno owed Silverline $ 3,895,214.00 for these labor and services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Reno Contracting contends that Coyle Residential failed to \"competently provide supervision of the construction activities at the Riverview Project[,]\" which caused \"significant problems on the construction site[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 98.) It contends that in June of 2013, \"Coyle Residential effectively abandoned the joint venture, leaving Reno Contracting solely responsible for the on-site supervision of the construction activities at the Riverview Project moving forward.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Silverline, the subcontractor, asserted in correspondence with the Coyle/Reno joint venture during the months of June and July 2013 that Coyle/Reno was improperly refusing to pay it for \"extra work\" that it had directed Silverline to do during the course of the project. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 19-23.) It accused Coyle/Reno of negligence and bad faith with respect to its management of changes to the MSA and its payments to Silverline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 24.) Silverline demanded mediation of its claims, and it threatened to sue Coyle/Reno if the disputes could not be resolved informally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Insurance Policies at Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There are two insurance policies at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The first was a policy issued by Crum &amp; Forster to the Coyle/Reno joint venture, covering the policy period June 8, 2012 to June 8, 2014 (\"the Coyle/Reno Policy\"). (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 50.) This policy provided general commercial liability coverage with a general aggregate limit of $ 1,000,000, Errors and Omissions coverage with a $ 1,000,000 per-claim limit, and a per-claim liability deductible of $ 10,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 51.) This was a \"burning limits\" policy-defense costs reduced the policy limits. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 53.) This policy provided that the joint venture's members were also insured, \"but only with respect to the conduct of [Coyle/Reno's] business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The second policy was issued by Crum &amp; Forster to Reno Contracting, covering the policy period August 1, 2013 to August 1, 2014 (\"the Reno Contracting Policy\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 66.) This policy had general aggregate and per-claim limits of $ 5,000,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 66.) It required that claims be made and reported during the policy period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 69, 71.) As relevant here, it covered \"damages\" resulting from \"wrongful act[s].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 70.) \"Damages were defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Damages\" means the monetary amount of any judgment, award or settlement that an insured becomes legally obligated to pay as a result of a \"claim\" or \"suit.\" \"Damages\" does not include \"cleanup costs,\" equitable or nonpecuniary relief, disgorgement of profits, sanctions, fines or penalties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 76.) \"Wrongful act\" was defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Wrongful act\" means an act, error or omission in the rendering or failure to render \"professional services\" by any insured covered under the Insuring Agreement of the Errors and Omissions Liability Coverage Part[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The policy required Reno Contracting to \"see to it that [Crum &amp; Forster was] notified, in writing, as soon as practicable of an 'occurrence', offense, 'wrongful act' or 'pollution condition' which may result in a 'claim' or 'suit' against any insured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This policy explicitly stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   No person or organization is an insured with respect to the conduct of any current or past partnership, joint venture or limited liability company that is not shown as a Named Insured in the Declarations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Policy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    No. PKC-100538\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-5, Exh. 4] 6.) The Coyle/Reno joint venture was not a named insured on this policy. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Underlying Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On September 16, 2013, the Coyle/Reno joint venture filed suit against Silverline in San Diego Superior Court, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , breach of the MSA. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 28.) Silverline filed a cross-complaint against Coyle/Reno, alleging that the joint venture had failed to pay for services rendered pursuant to the MSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 30.) Silverline alleged that Coyle/Reno had modified the construction plans for the Riverview Project by directing Silverline to perform extra work without confirming the changes in writing, as the MSA would require. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 32.) It further alleged that Coyle/Reno falsely denied that it had directed the extra work be performed and denied the request for payment for the work. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Silverline cross-complaint, filed on November 18, 2013, asserted claims against Coyle/Reno and other parties for: (1) breach of contract; (2) quantum meruit; (3) account stated; (4) open book account; (5) promissory estoppel; (6) equitable indemnity; (7) implied indemnity; (8) contribution and apportionment; (9) declaratory relief; (10) claim against a contractor's license bond; (11) claim against a payment bond; (12) negligence; (13) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (14) fraud by intentional misrepresentation; (15) fraud by concealment; (16) negligent misrepresentation; (17) conversion; (18) enforcement of a stop notice; and (19) professional negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 35;\n   <em>\n    Silverline Cross-Compl.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-20, Exh. 18].) Silverline filed an amended\n   cross-complaint on April 10, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 37;\n   <em>\n    Silverline FACC\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-21, Exh. 19].) This pleading asserted many of the same claims as the first cross-complaint against both Coyle/Reno and Reno Contracting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Silverline FACC\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-21, Exh. 19].) The underlying action and a number of related cases pertaining to the Riverview Project were ultimately consolidated in the Santa Clara Superior Court. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 40-46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On March 30, 2016, Riverview Capital and Riverview Property Holdings, LLC (collectively, \"Riverview\") filed a cross-complaint against Coyle/Reno and Reno Contracting, among others, in the consolidated action in the Santa Clara Superior Court. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 47.) Riverview asserted claims against Coyle/Reno and Reno Contracting for: (1) breach of contract; (2) indemnity; (3) declaratory relief: liquidated damages; (4) reformation (against Coyle/Reno only); (5) declaratory relief: adjusted guaranteed maximum price; (6) declaratory relief: contingency accounting; (7) declaratory relief: adjusted contract time; (8) specific performance; (9) declaratory relief: contract documents; (10) enforcement of performance bond (against Coyle/Reno and Travelers, Coyle/Reno's surety); and (11) enforcement of payment bond (against Coyle/Reno and Travelers). (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 48;\n   <em>\n    Riverview Cross-Compl.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-24, Exh. 22].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The facts behind Riverview's suit against Reno Contracting were related to those in the Silverline action. Riverview alleged that Coyle/Reno breached its contract with Riverview by \"[f]ailing to pay subcontractors...the amounts due to them, thereby causing mechanic's liens to be recorded and stop payment notices to be served,\" \"holding the Project hostage by implicit and explicit threats that unless Riverview paid disputed amounts, and disputed change order requests, Coyle/Reno would stop work and/or abandon all or portions of the Project,\" \"fail[ing] to defend Riverview...in connection with actions by subcontractors to foreclose on mechanic's liens and enforce stop payment notices,\" and \"issu[ing] [change order requests] seeking compensation and time for purported Riverview-caused delays...which Riverview contend[ed] [were] neither timely nor properly substantiated and [did] not entitle Coyle/Reno to additional time under the [Riverview] Contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Reno Contracting first provided notice to Crum &amp; Forster of the underlying litigation on January 27, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 56.) On that date it requested a defense under the Coyle/Reno Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Four days later, on January 31, 2014, Reno Contracting requested that Crum &amp; Forster provide a defense to Reno Contracting in the underlying litigation pursuant to the Reno Contracting Policy. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On July 22, 2014, Crum &amp; Forster agreed to defend Reno Contracting as to the claims made by Silverline subject to the Coyle/Reno Policy's eroding $ 1,000,000 per-claim limit and a full reservation of rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 58.) However, it declined to defend or indemnify under the Reno Contracting Policy, citing Reno Contracting's failure to comply with the knowledge and reporting requirements of that policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 80, 111;\n   <em>\n    July 22, 2014 Letter\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-26, Exh. 24.].) According to Crum &amp; Forster, the January 31,\n   2014 notice was ineffective because Reno Contracting had knowledge of a \"wrongful act\" before the policy period began through its receipt of the March 2013 stop payment notice. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 81;\n   <em>\n    July 22, 2014 Letter\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-26, Exh. 24.] 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On June 11, 2015, Coyle/Reno informed Crum &amp; Forster that Riverview planned to file suit against it. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 59.) On August 10, 2015, Coyle/Reno and Reno Contracting informed Crum &amp; Forster that Riverview had terminated Coyle/Reno from the Riverview Project. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 60.) It requested that Crum &amp; Forster provide a defense under the Coyle/Reno Policy for any resulting claims by Riverview. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Crum &amp; Forster agreed to defend Reno Contracting as to the Riverview Cross-complaint pursuant to the Coyle/Reno Policy, subject to the Coyle/Reno Policy's eroding $ 1,000,000 per-claim limit and a full reservation of rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On June 27, 2016, in response to a tender, Crum &amp; Forster informed Reno Contracting that it would neither defend nor indemnify it under the Reno Contracting Policy because Reno Contracting had not informed Crum and Forster of the Riverview cross-complaint until August 10, 2015, after the policy period had ended. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 83, 121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On July 21, 2017, Crum &amp; Forster informed Reno Contracting that its defense of Reno Contracting and its co-insureds had exhausted the $ 1,000,000 limit of the Coyle/Reno Policy. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 63.) Thus, Crum &amp; Forster informed Reno Contracting that it would cease contribution to its defense. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.) Reno Contracting settled Riverview's claims against it in October of 2017. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 141;\n   <em>\n    Settlement Agreement\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 35-7, Exh. W].) The claims of Coyle/Reno and Silverline against one another were later brought to a judgment by which neither party prevailed against the other. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 41;\n   <em>\n    Judgment after Trial\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 36-3, Exh. 34].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Reno Contracting filed this action against Crum &amp; Forster in San Diego Superior Court on November 15, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 1-2, Exh. 1].) It alleged: (1) breach of contract through failure to defend; (2) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing through failure to defend; (3) breach of contract through failure to indemnify; (4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing through failure to indemnify; (5) breach of contract through failure to settle; and (6) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing through failure to settle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Crum &amp; Forster removed the case to this Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship on February 28, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Notice of Removal\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 1].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant Crum &amp; Forster filed the instant motion for partial summary judgment on November 2, 2018, seeking judgment in its favor on \"the breach of contract claim for relief\" on the basis that the Reno Contracting Policy provides no coverage for the underlying litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Notice of Mot.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29].) The Complaint states three claims for breach of contract-the first, third, and fifth claims for relief, for failure to defend, to indemnify, and to settle, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 1-2, Exh. 1].) Nowhere else in the notice or in the points and authorities does the motion specify what relief it requests.

There is No Genuine Dispute that Reno Contracting is Not an Insured under the Reno Contracting Policy as to the Underlying Litigation, all of which stems from the Joint Venture Coyle/Reno's Conduct as a General Contractor for the Riverview Project.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Reno Contracting Policy specifies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   No person or organization is an insured with respect to the conduct of any current or past partnership, joint venture or limited liability company that is not shown as a Named Insured in the Declarations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Policy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    No. PKC-100538\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-5, Exh. 4] 6.) The Coyle/Reno joint venture was not a named insured on this policy. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   There is no genuine dispute that all claims in the underlying litigation arose from the Riverview Project, the general contractor for which was the Coyle/Reno joint venture. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 1-5, 35-49.) Reno Contracting was not an insured under the Reno Contracting Policy with respect to Coyle/Reno's conduct-even if it was a defendant in subsequent litigation resulting from Coyle/Reno's project. (\n   <em>\n    Policy No. PKC-100538\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-5, Exh. 4] 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This principle is simple. The addition of the joint venture partner into the business posed an additional risk for which the insurance company was not compensated by the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   What Plaintiff admits happened here is a good illustration of this principle. Reno Contracting went into business with Coyle Residential, forming Coyle/Reno. By the terms of the MSA, Coyle Residential would handle on-site supervision of the construction activities of the Riverview Project while Reno Contracting handled off-site administrative duties. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 35] \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.) Only, Coyle Residential did not \"competently provide supervision of the construction activities at the Riverview Project[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This prompted \"significant problems on the construction site\" and, ultimately, a stop payment notice to issue from a subcontractor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 98.) According to Plaintiff, \"Coyle Residential effectively abandoned the joint venture, leaving Reno Contracting solely responsible for the on-site supervision of the construction activities at the Riverview Project moving forward.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6 100.) The project grinded to a halt. Costly litigation followed-both with Silverline, and with the property owner. This litigation was a consequence of the joint venture's conduct as general contractor. (\n   <em>\n    JSDUF\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 41] \u00b6\u00b6 1-5, 35-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This eventuality was within the scope of the risk undertaken by a commercial entity going into business with a joint venture partner. That entity's insurance company would have been entitled to calculate the additional risks of the joint venture into the premiums of a policy. This particular policy required that any joint venture be named so as to allow for the calculation of an appropriate premium. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Policy No. PKC-100538\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-5, Exh. 4] 6.) No joint venture was named. No coverage existed with respect to a joint venture's conduct, or risks arising therefrom. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) This includes the Riverview Project, the general contractor for which was Coyle/Reno.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Two of Plaintiff's points in opposition bear brief discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, Plaintiff argues that Crum &amp; Forster should be equitably estopped from contending that Reno Contracting has no coverage under the Reno Contracting Policy for Coyle/Reno's conduct, as it did not rely on the joint venture limitation in its earlier letters as a basis for declining to defend under the policy. Plaintiff contends that it detrimentally relied on Crum &amp; Forster's representation that it qualified as an insured notwithstanding that limitation and denial of coverage on another basis-the failure to comply with the knowledge and reporting requirements-in later settling the case. (\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 35] 13:23-16:24.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Generally[,] \" 'four elements must be present in order to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel: (1) the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon, or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended; (3) the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and (4) he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Colony Ins.

(\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Opp'n\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 35] 8-9, 14.) Although Crum and Forster's initial reservation of rights letter asserted that Reno Contracting was an insured in spite of the joint venture limitation, it also denied coverage altogether under the Reno Contracting policy on a separate basis. (\n   <em>\n    July 22, 2014 Letter\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 29-26, Exh. 24].) And even if Crum &amp; Forster could somehow have intended its denial of coverage on another ground to cause Reno Contracting to assume liability for its surety's settlement contribution or to release its claims against the property owner, California law is \" 'well established that the doctrines of implied waiver and of estoppel, based upon the conduct or action of the insurer, are not available to bring within the coverage of a policy risks not covered by its terms, or risks expressly excluded therefrom[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Advanced Network, Inc. v.

But by Plaintiff's own admissions in this brief and in the JSDUF, this situation arose in the first place because of the additional risks Reno Contracting took in entering into a joint venture with Coyle Residential for the Riverview Project. Plaintiff did not buy insurance coverage for these risks via the Reno Contracting Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Reno Contracting Policy provided no coverage for the underlying litigation, all of which arose from Coyle/Reno's involvement in the Riverview Project as general contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

A determination of lack of coverage under the relevant policy may have some relationship to the three breach of contract claims-for failure to defend, to indemnify, or to settle, respectively.
