American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees,\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). The defendants now move to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the reasons set forth herein, that motion [31] is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Illinois Public Labor Relations Act is a set of administrative laws under which the Illinois Labor Relations Board regulates labor relations between public employers and employees, including collective bargaining. Under the IPLRA, a labor union may become the \"exclusive representative\" for the employees of a particular bargaining unit for purposes of collective bargaining. 5 ILCS 315/6(c). In exchange for conferring this exclusivity, the IPLRA requires that exclusive representatives must represent all public employees in a bargaining unit, including those who are not union members. 5 ILCS 315/6(d). To offset this burden, IPLRA allowed a labor union that is an exclusive representative to charge non-member bargaining unit employees agency fees, commonly described as \"fair share\" fees, to compensate for activities germane to the collective bargaining process. 5 ILCS 315/6(e). The sole\n   exception to this requirement is in the case of non-members whose refusal to pay union dues is based on bona fide religious tenants, in which case the IPLRA provides for alternative payments to agreed upon charitable organizations. 5 ILCS 315/6(g). The IPLRA also defines what constitutes an unfair labor practice and imposes restrictions on the scope of matters subject to collective bargaining. 5 ILCS 315/10(b)(1)(i) ; 5 ILCS 315/4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Past Supreme Court precedent permitted the imposition of agency fees such as those permitted under Illinois law.\n   <em>\n    Abood v.

In the wake of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs assert that they will be required to represent non-members who refuse to compensate the Union for its representation. The plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that the sections of the ILPRA requiring them to represent non-members without compensation violate the First Amendment, that the requirements that they represent non-members in the absence of a fair share agreement and those non-members with religious objections to paying the fair share fee violates the First and Fifth Amendments, and that the limits on the scope of collective bargaining violates their First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A Rule 12(b)(1) motion seeks dismissal of an action over which a court allegedly lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   While it is the burden of the party who seeks the exercise of jurisdiction in his favor clearly to allege facts demonstrating that he is a proper party to invoke judicial resolution, we accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint....Likewise, subject-matter jurisdiction must be secure at all times, regardless of whether the parties raise the issue, and no matter how much has been invested in a case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Minn-Chem, Inc. v.

Because the remainder of that statute, including the duty to provide fair representation to non-members, remains enforceable, the plaintiffs assert that they, and therefore their membership, will be compelled to speak on behalf of non-members, infringing on their First Amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the provisions of the IPLRA in question expressly require such speech and expressly limit the plaintiffs' ability to receive reimbursement for that speech to the fair share payments that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Janus.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs' alleged injury is accordingly far from speculative. Although the defendants claim that any injury is hypothetical at this juncture, they argue that the duty of fair representation of non-members remains binding upon the plaintiffs, and thus effectively concede that prosecution would result if the plaintiffs ended their compliance with the statute. Although it may be true that nothing has changed except for the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , that decision altered the nature of the plaintiffs' preexisting statutory obligations and created the imminent constitutional injury alleged to exist here. This injury is sufficient to establish both that standing exists and that there is a dispute ripe for resolution with respect to the plaintiffs' claims arising directly from their duty of representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 560-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Babbitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532087\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/289/#p298\">\n    442 U.S. at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532087\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/289/#p298\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs, however, also challenge the limitations on the scope of collective bargaining that Illinois law imposes in light of Janus' supposed holding that all union speech is inherently political. The IPLRA provides that employers are required to bargain collectively about policy matters directly affecting wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, but not about \"matters of inherent managerial policy,\" such as \"the functions of the employer, standards of services, its overall budget, the organizational structure, and the selection of new employees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   5 ILCS 315/4. The plaintiffs contend that, in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Janus,\n   </em>\n   these restrictions are no longer constitutionally tenable because they impose a constraint on the scope of the plaintiffs' speech. This claim, unlike those previously discussed, is not ripe for pre-enforcement consideration. The plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to the duty of fair representation derive directly from undisputed changes to the operative statutory scheme that fundamentally alter the plaintiffs' operations. The present claim, by contrast, stems from dicta providing the plaintiffs with the opportunity to advance novel legal arguments and does not reflect changed factual circumstance. Accordingly, the Court does not believe that it is appropriately the subject of a pre-enforcement challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court turns its attention to the arguments presented in the amicus curiae brief filed by Brian Trygg. Trygg argued that the claims based on the anticipated outcome of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   are unripe because the plaintiff's allegations are hypothetical in nature. Because the operative complaint was filed before\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   was decided, it is true that the plaintiffs' allegations concerning\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   were speculative in nature, being based on the plaintiff's expectations as to the outcome of that case. When considering matters of jurisdiction, however, this Court may consider matters outside the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    Capitol Leasing Co. v. F.D.I.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11953010\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/188/#p191\">\n    999 F.2d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191 (7th Cir. 1993).\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   has been decided and its resolution substantially comports with the plaintiffs' expectations. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' claims are no longer speculative, even if the phrasing of the complaint is outdated in that respect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Trygg also presents a compelling point as to the plaintiffs' claims that are premised on IPLRA sections 6(e) and 6(g) (counts III and IV). Section 6(e) provides that exclusive representatives and bargaining organizations may enter into fair share arrangements. Section 6(g) contains the religious exemption that allows non-member employees with religious objections to make their service fee payments to non-religious charitable organizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that these provisions, which require it to provide services and representation without receiving compensation, violate the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause and First Amendment Freedom of Association. Sections 6(e) and 6(g), however, both concern the implementation and collection of agency fees.\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   expressly held such fees to be unconstitutional, abrogating the portions of the IPLRA giving rise to the plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   thus renders those claims moot, depriving the plaintiffs of standing to pursue them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ciarpaglini v.

Although tangential to the enforcement role of the Illinois Labor Relations Board, the Court considers these powers sufficient to establish a connection to the enforcement of the IPLRA.

Although such an argument would be relevant to the merits of the plaintiffs' claims, the defendants' conclusory aside is not sufficient to place that portion of\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    at issue in the present ruling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The Court appreciates the plaintiffs' zeal to pursue this case. Such enthusiasm, however, does not excuse the fact that, by rushing to file their complaint before\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    was decided, the plaintiffs have presented this Court with an ambiguous complaint and have made no effort to subsequently narrow it in light of the Supreme Court's ruling. The Court encourages the plaintiffs to seek leave to amend their complaint so that it may be brought up to date at the earliest opportunity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
