STEELE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the plaintiff's motion for remand. (Doc. 5). The defendant United States of America has filed a response and the plaintiff a reply, (Docs. 8, 9), and the motion is ripe for resolution. After careful consideration, the Court concludes that the motion is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff filed this action against defendant Ruan in state court, alleging a six-figure debt arising from its storage of\n   Ruan's vehicles. The complaint names the United States as an additional defendant because Ruan has been convicted of multiple federal offenses for which he received a sentence including an eight-figure restitution obligation, and the United States has filed a notice of lien in state probate court to enforce the restitution obligation. (Doc. 1-3 at 1; Doc. 8 at 1-2). The complaint includes claims for breach of contract, declaratory judgment (confirming the breach and that the plaintiff holds a valid and enforceable warehouse lien), and judicial foreclosure. The latter claim seeks an order that the vehicles be sold and that the United States receive no proceeds of the sale until and unless the plaintiff's claim be first entirely satisfied. (Doc. 1-3 at 11-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The United States removed this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). (Doc. 1). The plaintiff moves to remand, arguing that the United States cannot satisfy the requirements for removal under that provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Section 1444.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Any action brought under section 2410 of this title against the United States ... may be removed by the United States ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201444\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]he United States may be named a party in any civil action or suit in ... any State court having jurisdiction of the subject matter ... to foreclose a mortgage or other lien upon ... real or personal property in which the United States has or claims a mortgage or other lien.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201444\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2410(a)(2). This action appears to fall within the parameters of Section 2410 so as to permit its removal under Section 1444.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The United States, however, did not invoke Section 1444 in its notice of removal. A notice of removal is required to be filed within 30 days after service of process,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and numerous authorities have held that \"[t]he Notice of Removal cannot be amended to add a separate basis for removal jurisdiction after the thirty day period.\"\n   <em>\n    ARCO Environmental Remediation, L.L.C. v. Department of Health and Environmental Quality\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11515892\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/213/1108/#p1117\">\n    213 F.3d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1117 (9th Cir. 2000).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States' brief in opposition to the motion for remand was filed seven weeks after service on the United States Attorney and Attorney General. (Doc. 1 at 2). Its invocation of Section 1444 is therefore untimely under the authorities cited above. Because the United States does not argue that its invocation of Section 1444 is timely or that its untimely invocation should be excused, the Court will not consider that provision as a basis of removal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. 5 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   An indispensable party, however, is still a party, and the United States is denominated by the complaint as a party defendant. (Doc. 1-3 at 11). The plaintiff's express purpose in naming the United States is to judicially establish that the plaintiff's lien primes the United States' competing lien. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). The plaintiff may not seek an affirmative recovery from the United States, but it does seek to recover from Ruan proceeds that otherwise would be recovered by the United States. It is difficult to imagine a more adversarial relationship, and the plaintiff offers no authority in support of its unlikely position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"The general rule is that a suit is against the sovereign if the judgment sought would expend itself on the public treasury or domain, or interfere with the public administration, or if the effect of the judgment would be to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to act.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v.

A judgment that the plaintiff's lien against the subject vehicles primes the United States' lien against the same property would render it more difficult for the United States to recover assets and would thus interfere with the public administration regarding the enforcement of restitution orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For reasons expressed above, the Court concludes that this action is against the United States for purposes of Section 1442(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"The United States or Any Agency Thereof.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Before considering the plaintiff's two remaining arguments, the Court must determine whether the requirements for removal that the plaintiff identifies - an act under color of office and a colorable federal defense - apply to the United States and its agencies in the first place.

As the\n   <em>\n    Mesa\n   </em>\n   Court recognized, the absence of a colorable federal defense requirement in the case of officer removal \"would ... present grave constitutional problems\" since, without such a requirement, removal could occur without any federal question sufficient to satisfy Article III's grant of judicial power to hear cases \"arising under\" federal law, and with no alternative fount of jurisdiction apparent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031644\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/121/\">\n    489 U.S. at 136-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031644\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/121/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, because Article III extends the judicial power \"to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party,\" U.S. Const. art.

The Court considers Section 1442(a)(1) to be unambiguous, and its scheme coherent and consistent, obviating resort to legislative history. In order for the United States and its agencies to be subject to the \"colorable federal defense\" requirement applicable to individuals, Section 1442(a)(1) as it stood following the 1996 amendment must be read as limiting removal to \"[t]he United States or any agency thereof ... sued in an official or individual capacity for any act under color of such office.\" As the Sixth Circuit noted, this reading may be grammatically defensible, but it \"does not make sense\" because, unlike federal officers, the United States and its agencies are not \"sued in an official or individual capacity,\" nor are they \"sued ... for any act under color of ... office.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734747\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/380/\">\n    484 F.3d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, Section 1442(a)(1) speaks of acting under color of \"such office,\" which necessarily refers to an office previously identified in the text. The statute does not identify the United States or any agency as holding any office (unsurprising, since they do not), but it does identify \"any officer ... of the United States or of any agency thereof.\" Therefore, the \"act under color of such office\" language can refer only to the \"office\" held by the \"officer\" at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Not only does the \"such office\" language plainly restrict the clause to \"officer\" removal, this reading also accords with the \"rule of the last antecedent.\" Under that rule, \"a limiting clause or phrase ... should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows.\"\n   <em>\n    Lockhart v.

Under the rule of the last antecedent, the \"official or individual capacity\" and \"under color of such office\" qualifiers are to be read as restricting only removal by federal officers, because federal officers constitute the final category in the list of those that can remove under Section 1442(a)(1). The rule is most easily applied when, as here, the listing \"does not contain items that readers are used to seeing listed together[, does not contain] a concluding modifier that readers are accustomed to applying to each of them,\" and as to which \"the varied syntax of each item in the list makes it hard for the reader to carry the final modifying clause across all three.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602432\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/958/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602432\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/958/#p962\">\n    at 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"Of course, as with any canon of statutory interpretation, the rule of the last antecedent is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12602432\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/958/#p962\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotes omitted).

For reasons explained above, the Court concludes that Section 1442(a)(1) unambiguously permits removal by the United States and its agencies irrespective of whether they assert a colorable federal defense or act under color of office. The Court therefore finds it unnecessary to consider the legislative history of the 1996 amendment. Nevertheless, because the\n   <em>\n    City of Cookeville\n   </em>\n   Court addressed that history, the Court does so as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The known legislative history of the 1996 amendment is contained in two brief discussions in the committee reports. The Senate report addressing the amendment is confined to two paragraphs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The House report consists of a verbatim repetition of these two paragraphs, plus a third paragraph that does not appear in the Senate report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Sixth Circuit described the Senate report as \"provid[ing] compelling confirmation of this reading\" of Section 1442(a)(1),\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that \"a federal agency defendant may remove without more.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734747\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/380/\">\n    484 F.3d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court does not share that opinion but agrees that the legislative history is insufficient to support the construction urged by the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Sixth Circuit stressed that the Senate report speaks of suits \"against federal agencies as well as those against federal officers sued in either an individual or official capacity\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and concluded that the report, \"therefore, demonstrates that the 'sued' clause applies only to federal officers and not to federal agencies.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734747\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/380/\">\n    484 F.3d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees that this is the most reasonable reading of the report, but it sees a less likely alternative reading: that the categories of defendants that may remove include both (a) agencies and (b) federal officers (whether sued in an official or an individual capacity), with both categories subject to the \"for any act under color of such office\" language. As with the text of Section 1442(a)(1), the Court finds such a construction, though possible, contrary to any sensible understanding of the quoted term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Only one other item in the Senate report seems capable of reflecting on the congressional intent at issue here. In their final, identical sentence (which was not addressed by the Sixth Circuit), both congressional reports state as follows: \"This section does not alter the requirement that a federal law defense be alleged for a suit to be removable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is thus clear that the 104\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Congress considered the requirement of a colorable federal defense. Less clear is what it contemplated. One reading is that Congress meant only to preserve the requirement in its existing context of removal\n   by federal officers (the only context in which the requirement was capable of \"alter[ation]\"), with the sentence added to ensure that the amendment's rewording of the statute (including its insertion of \"sued in an official or individual capacity\") did not lead courts to erase the requirement and thus expose the statute, as to federal officers, to the constitutional vulnerability predicted by the\n   <em>\n    Mesa\n   </em>\n   Court. Another reading - arguably supported by the sentence's unqualified reference to \"a suit\" - is that Congress intended to expand the federal defense requirement to the newly added categories of those able to remove under the statute (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to the United States and its agencies). Although the Court considers the former reading more likely, the existence of an alternative reading leads the Court to conclude that this portion of the legislative history is potentially ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As noted, the House report includes a third paragraph absent from the Senate report. That paragraph (which the Sixth Circuit did not address) explains that the \"official or individual capacity\" language of the amendment was added to counter the decisions of several courts that a federal officer sued exclusively in her official capacity could not remove under Section 1442(a)(1). The report complains that \"[t]he result of these decisions has been that federal agencies have had to defend themselves in state court, despite important and complex federal issues ....\" The paragraph concludes with the following: \"Note that under the change made in this section, cases would be removable only where federal officers are acting pursuant to a federal law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   This sentence may best be read as limiting the requirement of a colorable federal defense to federal officers. However, because the paragraph addresses suits against officers in their official capacities and seems to equate such suits with suits against the sued officer's agency, it might be possible to construct an argument that the legislative history suggests that agencies also need to assert a federal defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The upshot is that the legislative history of the 1996 amendment does not clearly show a congressional intent to require the United States and its agencies to assert a colorable federal defense in order to remove. At most, the legislative history is ambiguous in this regard. Because, as discussed above, the statutory language is clear and is made more so in light of Congress's awareness of\n   <em>\n    Primate\n   </em>\n   when it crafted that language, the amendment's ambiguous legislative history can work no change in the statute's construction.\n   <em>\n    National Association of Manufacturers v.

That amendment expanded the first phrase to \"against\n   <em>\n    or directed to\n   </em>\n   ,\" and it changed the latter phrase to \"for\n   <em>\n    or relating to\n   </em>\n   any act under color of such office.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (emphasis added). As Section 1442(a)(1) now reads, the governmental act need only \"relat[e] to\" the civil action; it need not be the basis for the relief demanded.

In this case, however, the complaint plainly identifies a governmental act related to the lawsuit. Specifically, the complaint expressly alleges that the United States \"claims an interest\" in the subject property as a result of Ruan's judicially imposed restitution obligation. (Doc. 1-3 at 11-12). The United States' assertion of an interest in the property is surely an act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that act clearly relates to the plaintiff's civil action, since it is what prompted the plaintiff to seek a judicial ruling that its lien is superior to the government's asserted interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Colorable Federal Defense.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The plaintiff's third and final argument is that the United States cannot raise a \"colorable defense arising out of its duty to enforce federal law.\" (Doc. 5 at 3). The\n   <em>\n    Mesa\n   </em>\n   Court appears to have used this language interchangeably with \"colorable federal defense\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   but, to the extent the\n   two phrases carry distinct meanings, the United States satisfies them both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The United States defends the plaintiff's demand for a judicial determination that the plaintiff's lien has priority over any interest of the United States with the assertion that it has the legal obligation to enforce the restitution order; that it fulfilled this obligation by filing the notice of lien; and that, by virtue of that filing, its lien primes any lien of the plaintiff.

Section 3613(c) declares that a lien arises immediately upon entry of a judgment that includes an order of restitution, and Section 3613(d) provides for the filing of a notice of lien and describes the consequences for priority of such a filing. The United States asserts that, by the filing of this notice of lien, the restitution order took priority over the plaintiff's warehouse lien.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on the above, it is clear that the United States has asserted a defense (lien priority) arising out of its duty to enforce federal law (the duty to enforce restitution orders, including by filing notices of lien). The plaintiff offers no argument to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Instead, the plaintiff argues that the question of priority is \"to be resolved under State law.\" (Doc. 9 at 3). If the plaintiff were correct, the United States might be unable to assert a \"federal defense\" to the plaintiff's claim of lien priority. The plaintiff, however, is not correct. A restitution lien is \"treated as a liability for a tax assessed under the Internal Revenue Code\" and, \"when recorded ..., the lien ha[s] the same effect as a federal tax lien ....\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
