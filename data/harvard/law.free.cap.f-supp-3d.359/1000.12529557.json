PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 2, 2018, the Plaintiffs filed this putative class action (1) challenging the constitutionality of RCW 41.80.100 and the CBA provisions related to the deduction of membership fees, as a violation of their First Amendment rights, (2) asserting that the Defendants conspired to violate their constitutional rights, and (3) claiming that the Union was unjustly enriched.

The provisions authorizing the withholding of dues and making that authorization irrevocable for certain periods were in clear, readable type on a simple one-page form, well within the ken of unrepresented or lay parties.

The State Defendants' \"mandatory indifference to the underlying merits,\" content, or validity of the agreements \"refutes any characterization\" by the Plaintiffs of a joint action between the State Defendants and the Union as to the \"aspects of the [agreements] alleged to compromise\" the Plaintiffs' First Amendment rights.\n    <em>\n     Naoko,\n    </em>\n    at 997. The Plaintiffs argue that they seek recovery, not only for the continued deduction of dues after\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    (and their notification that they no longer wished to be Union members), but also seek recovery for deductions of compelled agency fees before\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    was decided, which was authorized by a Washington statute at the time. The Plaintiffs make no showing that\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    should be given retroactive effect in a manner that would allow them to bootstrap such a claim.\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    specifically stated that its holding was limited, providing that, \"States can keep their labor-relations systems exactly as they are - only they cannot force\n    <strong>\n     nonmembers\n    </strong>\n    to subsidize public-sector unions.\"\n    <em>\n     Janus,\n    </em>\n    at 2485, n. 27 (\n    <em>\n     emphasis added\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    While the Plaintiffs assert that it is RCW 41.80.100 that is the source of the Union's authority to impose a fee on nonmembers (Dkt. 56, at 15), that argument is without merit. It is the agreements themselves that authorize the Union to collect dues in exchange for benefits. Even in the absence of RCW 41.80.100 or Article 40 of the CBA, the Union could attempt to enforce the agreements to pay dues independently, in a breach of contract action. RCW 41.80.100 and Article 40 of the CBA only require the State Defendants to perform an administrative task - after the Plaintiffs provided express written authorization for dues to be paid for a year, the State Defendants are to deduct those dues and send them to the Union. The State points out that it does this for other entities with periods of payment that are not revocable for a set period of time, like for the retirement plan and health plan. Dkt. 47, at 17. Moreover, there is no evidence that the State Defendants \"in any meaningful way accept[ ] benefits derived from the allegedly unconstitutional actions.\"\n    <em>\n     Naoko,\n    </em>\n    at 997.

The Plaintiffs First Amendment claims against the State Defendants, then relate only to RCW 41.80.100, as amended, and Article 40 of the amended CBA, which are currently in effect, and only for prospective relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The Plaintiffs assert that RCW 41.80.100 and the CBA compel the State to \"deduct union dues/fees from the Plaintiffs' ... wages even though they have not clearly and affirmatively consented to the deductions\" and so violate the First Amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment against the State Defendants for violation of their First Amendment rights should be denied and the State Defendants' motion for summary judgment should be granted. RCW 41.80.100 provides that upon the Plaintiffs' written authorization, the State is obligated to \"deduct[ ] from the payments to bargaining unit members the dues required for membership in the [Union].\" RCW \u00a7 41.80.100 (3)(b)(i). Likewise, as amended in July of 2018, \u00a7 40.2 of the CBA provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n    The Employer agrees to deduct an amount equal to the membership dues from the salary of employees who request such deduction in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of a properly completed request submitted to the appropriate agency payroll office.

In amended \u00a7 40.6, the CBA further provides that \"[a]n employee may revoke his or her authorization for payroll deduction of payments to the Union by written notice to the Employer and the Union in accordance with the terms and conditions of their signed membership card.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at 7.

The parties do not dispute that all the Plaintiffs here signed the membership agreements and that they did not need to do so as a condition of their employment. The parties do not dispute that the State plays no role in deciding what terms and conditions are in the membership agreements; and under state law, cannot participate in any way in making those determinations. The State's deduction of dues from the Plaintiffs' pay is pursuant to the Plaintiffs' explicit written instructions in the 2017 agreements. The fact that the Plaintiffs are now challenging the constitutional validity of the underlying agreements does not lead to liability for the State, especially where the State is prohibited from interfering with Union activity. Further, Plaintiffs' assertions that the agreements are not valid because they had not waived their First Amendment rights under\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    in their authorization agreements because they did not know of those rights yet, is without merit.

To do so would require the State Defendants to make a judgment about the validity of the contracts the Union and its members choose to enter, something the State is prohibited from doing.
