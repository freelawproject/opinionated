R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (b)(6) (\"Motion\"). (Doc. No. 26). On January 12, 2018, Plaintiff filed her opposition to Defendants' Motion. (Doc. No. 28). Defendants filed their Reply in Support of their Motion on January 25, 2018. (Doc. No. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After considering the papers filed in support of, and in opposition to, the Motion, the Court Grants the Motion in part and denies the Motion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges the following facts in her First Amended Complaint (Doc. No. 19) (\"FAC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff suffered strokes in 2004 and 2007 that caused multiple physical disabilities. (FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 11). Plaintiff is unable to walk, and is confined to a wheelchair. (FAC at 11). While she can understand what a person says to her, she cannot respond verbally. (FAC at \u00b6 5). Since she is right-handed, and her strokes have affected the right side of her body, Plaintiff cannot hold a pen to write. (FAC at \u00b6 11). She communicates with others by nodding or shaking her head. (FAC at \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff suffers from several other medical conditions including diabetes, incontinence, hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic ischemic heart disease, and sick sinus syndrome. (FAC at \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2014, Plaintiff's sister, Chantel Bonet, made arrangements for Plaintiff to move from a skilled nursing facility in Los Angeles to a residential facility for disabled persons in Arizona. (FAC at \u00b6 18). Bonet moved to Arizona herself, arranged\n   for Plaintiff's new residence, and transferred Plaintiff's Medicare/Medicaid payments from California to Arizona. (FAC at \u00b6 18). Because Plaintiff's California Medicare/Medicaid payments were terminated effective March 31, 2014, Plaintiff had to move to Arizona by April 1, 2014 so the State of Arizona would pay for Plaintiff's living facility. (FAC at \u00b6 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It appears that in advance of her April 1, 2014 flight, Plaintiff did not have any other form of photo identification apart from a California Identification Card that had expired on September 28, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 12). On March 20, 2014, Bonet wrote to the California Department of Motor Vehicles to request a renewal of Plaintiff's identification card. (FAC at \u00b6 19). Plaintiff's other sister, Sherry Wright, took her to the California Department of Motor Vehicles on March 31, 2014, and received a receipt for an application for an identification card renewal. (FAC at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 25, 2014, Bonet wrote to executives of Southwest, Delta, American, and United, requesting assistance for Plaintiff at the Los Angeles Airport (\"LAX\"). (FAC at \u00b6 20). Bonet also tried to contact the Transportation Security Administration's \"TSA Cares\" department to prepare Plaintiff for her April 1, 2014 flight. (FAC at \u00b6 20). Bonet placed calls to TSA Cares on March 25, 26, 27 and 30, but did not receive assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Bonet finally left a telephone message with TSA Cares Supervisor Karen Hennigan on March 31, 2014, asking for the appropriate steps Plaintiff would need to take to board a flight on April 1, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Hennigan did not return Bonet's phone call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   With Wright's assistance, Plaintiff went to LAX the evening of April 1, 2014 so she could take Southwest Airlines Flight 1015 for Phoenix, Arizona. (FAC at \u00b6 12). At the airport, Plaintiff attempted to get through TSA security screening by presenting her expired California Identification Card, the receipt for application for a new identification card, and her Social Security card. (FAC at \u00b6 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   TSA employees Sandra Vences and Pablo Paiva were responsible for screening passengers for Plaintiff's flight. (FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17). They refused to accept Plaintiff's proffered forms of identification, and did not allow Plaintiff to pass through the TSA security screening. (FAC at \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between 8:00 p.m. and 9:44 p.m., Vences and Paiva repeatedly asked Plaintiff to either say or write her name to identify herself. (FAC at \u00b6 15). They made it clear to Plaintiff that if she did not write or say her name, she would not be allowed to board her flight. (FAC at \u00b6 15). Plaintiff tried to say her name, but because of her disability, she could only make garbled sounds. (FAC at \u00b6 15). Neither could Plaintiff hold a pen to write her name. (FAC at 15). Plaintiff was reduced to tears and remained crying while Vences and Paiva continued to demand that Plaintiff write or say her name. (FAC at \u00b6 15). Vences and Paiva did not let Plaintiff board her flight, which departed at 9:55 p.m. (FAC at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Plaintiff had missed her flight, her sister made arrangements for Plaintiff to travel alone by bus to Phoenix. (FAC at \u00b6 21). The bus ride was long and uncomfortable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff's photo identification had expired, and Vences and Paiva determined that it was unacceptable. (Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19). According to TSA guidelines, the identity verification process in this situation required Plaintiff to fill out a certificate of identity and to answer questions regarding her identity verbally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   81 FR 78623-01 (\"To initiate the identity verification process, a traveler without an acceptable verifying identity document must complete ...

Plaintiff alleges that Vences and Paiva asked her to identify herself when they knew or should have known that she was unable to comply. (Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 15, 35). The Court recognizes the difficulties that Plaintiff's disability causes her while traveling, and is aware that the stress of traveling can be made worse by others' insensitivity. The type of conduct described by Plaintiff's complaint, however - repeated questioning regarding identity verification at an airport security screening checkpoint - is not the sort that gives rise to a claim for NIED claim.
