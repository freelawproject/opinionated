McFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently issued a directive announcing new membership priorities for its federal advisory committees (the \"Directive\"). The Directive requires, in part, \"that no member of an EPA federal advisory committee be currently in receipt of EPA grants.\" The Plaintiffs complain that this requirement is arbitrary and capricious, conflicts with several statutes and regulations governing advisory committees, and is a shift in policy that EPA failed to explain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   EPA's Acting Administrator,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, has moved to dismiss the suit under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). At the outset, EPA alleges that the Plaintiffs lack standing and their claims are unripe. It also argues that because the Directive is an appointment policy, it is a matter reserved to agency discretion and the Plaintiffs largely rely on statutes that are either inapposite or offer no meaningful standard for review. And even if the Plaintiffs have identified applicable statutes, EPA argues that the Plaintiffs have failed to allege a violation of any specific statutory provision. For the reasons stated below, EPA's motion to dismiss will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   EPA's mission is to protect human health and the environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA,\n   <em>\n    Returning EPA to its Core Mission\n   </em>\n   , https://www.epa.gov/home/returning-epa-its-core-mission (last visited Feb. 11, 2019). Besides developing and enforcing environmental regulations, EPA accomplishes its mission by awarding grants to state environmental programs, non-profits, and others to conduct research and implement environmental projects. Indeed, many statutes that EPA administers authorize grant programs that fund environmental research.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207403\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) (Clean Air Act);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201254\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) (Clean Water Act).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   EPA relies on 22 federal advisory committees for guidance on various environmental\n   and health issues to ensure effective regulation. Advisory committees can be established by statute or by the President or an agency head. Eight of EPA's advisory committees are established by statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   EPA's advisory committees are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (\"FACA\"), 5 U.S.C. App. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 1 - 15, which regulates the operations of federal advisory committees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Agency heads have broad discretion over the composition of advisory committees. Under the General Services Administration regulations implementing FACA, \"[u]nless otherwise provided by statute, Presidential directive, or other establishment authority, advisory committee members serve at the pleasure of the appointing or inviting authority. Membership terms are at the sole discretion of the appointing or inviting authority.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.130\">\n    41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-3.130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   FACA imposes no specific constraints or requirements on who may serve on advisory committees. But agencies must ensure that membership is \"fairly balanced in terms of points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee.\" 5 U.S.C. App. 2 \u00a7 5(b)(2). And there must be provisions \"to assure that the advice and recommendations of the advisory committee will not be inappropriately influenced by the appointing authority or by any special interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20102-3.130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The statutes establishing particular EPA advisory committees do, however, impose some qualification requirements for committee membership. Some qualification requirements are specific-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the CASAC must have \"at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences, one physician, and one person representing State air pollution agencies.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207409\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A). Others are general-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the SAB's members \"shall be qualified by education, training, and experience to evaluate scientific and technical information on matters referred to the Board\" by statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204365\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Members of EPA advisory committees are often scientists, academics, medical professionals, or experts in areas relevant to EPA's mission. While serving, some committee members are classified as \"special government employees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Directive announced four \"principles and procedures\" that EPA would apply \"when establishing the membership of [advisory] committees,\" in order to \"strengthen and improve the independence, diversity and breadth of participation on EPA federal advisory committees.\" Am. Compl., Ex. A (\"Dir.\"), ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   No. 20-2. This suit relates to the Directive's first principle. It requires that \"[m]embers shall be independent from EPA ... includ[ing] a requirement that no member of an EPA federal advisory committee be currently in receipt of EPA grants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204365\">\n    \u00b6 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The principle, however, does \"not apply to state, tribal or local government agency recipients of EPA grants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In an accompanying memorandum, EPA explained that it sought to avoid \"creat[ing] the appearance or reality of potential interference with [committee members'] ability to independently and objectively serve\" EPA. Am. Compl., Ex. B (\"Mem.\") at 3, ECF No. 20-3. Previously, EPA allowed scientists and experts to serve on advisory committees while receiving EPA grants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Directive's three other principles are not at issue, but they provide context. The Directive requires that \"committee balance should reflect prominent participation from state, tribal and local governments,\" and \"[s]uch participation should be appropriate for the committee's purpose and function.\" Dir. \u00b6 2. To enhance geographic diversity, the Directive requires that \"membership should be balanced with individuals from different states and EPA regions,\" and emphasis \"should be given to individuals from historically unrepresented or underrepresented states and regions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204365\">\n    \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, \"[t]o encourage and promote the inclusion of new candidates with fresh perspectives and to avoid prolonged and continuous service,\" the Directive requires that \"membership should be rotated regularly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204365\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204365\">\n    \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Plaintiffs in this case-Physicians for Social Responsibility, the National Hispanic Medical Association, the International Society for Children's Health and the Environment (ISCHE), Joe Arvai, Edward Avol, and Robyn Wilson (collectively, \"Physicians\")-are individuals and organizations representing individuals, who are serving, have served, or hope to serve on EPA advisory committees. After EPA issued the Directive, it removed Dr. Wilson from the SAB because she was receiving EPA grant funding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 57, ECF No. 20.

In Count I, Physicians allege that the Directive clashes with the conflict of interest statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20208\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and ethics regulations promulgated by the Office of Government Ethics (\"OGE\") because it bars activity that those rules allow,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202340.203\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 2340.203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). And they allege that the Directive is a shift in EPA's policy that the agency failed adequately to explain. They allege in Count II that EPA did not comply with OGE procedural requirements for supplementing the federal ethics rules. Physicians allege in Count III that the Directive eliminates FACA's requirements that committees be \"fairly balanced\" and not \"inappropriately influenced,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C. App. 2, \u00a7 5(b)(2), (3). Finally, Physicians allege in Count IV that the Directive violates the statutes establishing EPA advisory committees by removing otherwise qualified scientists from consideration for committee membership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   EPA, however, asks that Physicians' claims be dismissed under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). EPA first argues that Physicians lack standing and their claims are not ripe. EPA also claims that Physicians are outside the zone of interests protected by the conflict of interest statute and OGE regulations, and those authorities do not apply because the Directive is an appointment policy, not an ethics rule. So EPA argues\n   that the conflict of interest statute and regulations provide no meaningful standard against which to judge EPA's exercise of its discretion, making Counts I and II unreviewable. Count III is nonjusticiable, EPA asserts, because Sections 5(b)(2) and 5(b)(3) of FACA provide no meaningful standard for judicial review. Finally, EPA maintains that Count IV fails under Rule 12(b)(6), because Physicians have failed to allege a violation of any specific statutory requirement for membership on EPA advisory committees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Whatever choice Dr. McConnell makes, he will lose a significant benefit. Thus, at this stage of the proceedings, Physicians have sufficiently alleged that Drs.

Dr. Wilson \"received an email notifying her that she had been removed from the SAB due to the Directive.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 57. And \"an EPA staff person ... confirmed that Dr. McConnell must choose between his EPA-funded research and his service on the CASAC Particulate Matter Review Panel, because of the Directive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Indeed, EPA conceded at the hearing on the motion to dismiss that Dr. Wilson and ISCHE had established injuries traceable to the Directive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 41, ECF No. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Physicians have sufficiently alleged redressability. If the Court invalidates the Directive, then Dr. Wilson may serve again on the SAB without sacrificing her EPA funding. And Dr. McConnell will not need to choose between EPA grant funding and service on an advisory panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   EPA objects that the Plaintiffs other than Dr. Wilson and ISCHE have not independently established standing. It also argues that Dr. Wilson and ISCHE's standing does not extend to Counts III and IV, if those counts relate to violations of statutory requirements for committees other than the SAB and the CASAC Particulate Matter Review Panel. But EPA's arguments are not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, Counts III and IV do not allege that particular advisory committees violate their animating statutes or FACA. Instead, Count III alleges that the Directive frustrates FACA's \"fair balance\" and \"inappropriate influence\" provisions, applicable to all EPA advisory committees. And Count IV alleges that the EPA advisory committees established by statute have a \"statutory direction to recruit the most qualified scientists for service on EPA advisory committees,\" which the Directive frustrates. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 157-59. Whether the Directive preempts or frustrates these statutory provisions is a legal question that is not necessarily contingent on\n   the ultimate composition of any particular committee. Thus, because vacatur of the Directive based on any defect in its promulgation, including those alleged in Counts III and IV, would address Dr. Wilson's and ISCHE's injuries, they have standing to bring all four counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Physicians advance the same arguments challenging the Directive, and \"if one party has standing in an action, a court need not reach the issue of the standing of other parties when it makes no difference to the merits of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Ry.

Here the hardship to Physicians from delaying review is obvious. Physicians allege that Dr. Wilson has already suffered an injury because of the Directive, and Dr. McConnell faces an imminent threat of harm. Moreover, review of Physicians' claims would not inappropriately interfere with further administrative action. Finally, the Court would not benefit from further factual development. The crux of Physicians' complaint is that the Directive is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and violates statutes governing membership of federal advisory committees.

The Directive, however, is a statement of EPA\n   <em>\n    policy\n   </em>\n   , explaining who EPA will consider for appointment to advisory committees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dir. at Preamble (\"... [EPA] shall, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, apply the following principles and procedures when establishing the membership of such committees.\"). That someone\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   serve on an advisory committee without incurring liability under the conflict of interest statute does not dictate that an agency\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   appoint him as a member. While EPA clearly cannot appoint someone to an advisory committee that Section 208 prohibits, Section 208 does not require EPA to appoint anyone not otherwise excluded under the statute. In other words, Section 208 and the OGE regulations function as a floor, not a ceiling, for acceptable government service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Physicians, however, argue that OGE is responsible for promulgating \"a single, comprehensive, and clear set of executive-branch standards of conduct,\" Executive Order 12,731 \u00a7 201(a), and \"\n   <em>\n    uniform\n   </em>\n   regulations for the issuance of waivers and exemptions under\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20208\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (emphasis added). Thus, they reason that if a financial interest would not be disqualifying under the conflict of interest statute and OGE regulations, then the Administrator may not make it disqualifying when crafting agency appointment priorities. Otherwise the regulations do not apply uniformly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   But Section 208(d)(2) gives OGE authority to issue \"uniform\" regulations only for determining when certain financial interests will be exempt from criminal and civil liability under Section 208(a). It provides that OGE \"shall issue uniform regulations for the issuance of waivers and exemptions under subsection (b),\" and subsection (b) describes only when subsection (a) and its penalties will not apply. The Directive is different in scope and means from the authorities that Physicians claim are in conflict. It, for instance, does not threaten criminal or civil penalties under Section 208(a) for noncompliance. And the Directive is addressed to the agency-announcing the Administrator's priorities for membership of advisory committees-not to individual employees. Thus, the Directive is better understood as an appointment policy promulgated under the Administrator's broad appointment discretion. While this policy is guided by ethics concerns, it is distinct\n   from the conflict of interest statute and OGE regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Next, Physicians contend that, under FACA, agency appointments are subject to the conflict of interest statute and the OGE regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress enacted FACA to regulate the operations of federal advisory committees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 U.S.C.

And since an advisory committee's role is to review and recommend EPA regulations, it is to EPA's benefit to have experts capable of rendering informed recommendations. The Directive says as much in its preamble: \"it is in the public interest to select the most qualified, knowledgeable, and experienced candidates.\" Dir. at Preamble. Indeed, EPA acknowledged that the \"Administrator should choose qualified candidates to serve on the EPA's\" advisory committees. Mem. at 2.

For example, is a Medical Doctor a more qualified \"physician\" than a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine to serve on the CASAC? Is a cardiologist more qualified than a pulmonologist? There are virtually infinite metrics to assess potential members' relative qualifications, and the statute offers no clues how to weigh them. The Court will not second guess EPA's exercise of its discretion in an area peculiarly within its expertise. Ultimately, Physicians' Count IV relies on \"statutory directives\" that, even if they were explicit in the statutes, would be nonjusticiable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   And Physicians have not alleged that EPA has appointed members to any advisory committee in violation of explicit statutory requirements. For example, there is no allegation that the CASAC is missing a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Amici, however, argue that by electing not to appoint grant recipients under the Directive, EPA undermines the efficacy of its advisory committees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Amicus at 12-15; Officials Amicus at 15-20. But no one has identified any allegedly unqualified scientist that EPA has recruited, or any allegedly \"more qualified\" scientist dismissed or not recruited because of the Directive. Under the Directive there remains a universe of qualified scientists, academics, physicians, and experts capable of conducting the scientific decision-making EPA needs. Even under the Directive, EPA can fulfill its duty to \"consider a\n   cross-section of those directly affected, interested, and qualified, as appropriate to the nature and functions of the advisory committees.\" 41 C.F.R. 102-3.60(b)(3).
