The student, D.M., and his legal guardian, Laura Manees, sue the TPS Board and three of its employees assigned to Robinson: Principal David Manley, teacher Valerie Powell, and classroom aide Sonja Austin. The suit arises from a classroom incident involving physical restraint of D.M. by the three individual defendants.

(Doc. 5, at 4, \u00b6 13). During the Summer of 2016, D.M. attended a Robinson-run supplemental summer reading program. (Doc. 5 at 4, \u00b6 15). On June 10, 2016, Manees received a phone call from a guidance counselor, who asked Manees to pick up D.M. from school because staff could not calm him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Manees, accompanied by an adult son, arrived at the school, Manees saw Manley, Powell, and Austin, restraining D.M. face down on the floor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 7, \u00b6 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Manley held down D.M.'s neck with one hand, while twisting D.M.'s arm behind his back with the other. Meanwhile, Manley used his body weight to keep D.M's upper body on the floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00b6 18). Powell, with Austin's help, held D.M. by his legs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00b6 19). Manley, Powell, and Austin released D.M. when Manees shrieked at this scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   D.M.'s injuries included scratches and bruising on his face and neck, abrasions on his knee and elbow, and a hematoma over his left eye. He received emergency room treatment for his injuries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    at 5-6, \u00b6\u00b6 21-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Manees did not receive a report of any kind from Robinson about the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, \u00b6 25). D.M.'s IEP does not address whether Robinson personnel may use physical restraint on him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about September 16, 2016, Manees filed a complaint with the Ohio Department of Education, Office of Exceptional Children (OEC), about the incident. The OEC informed her that the matter was outside the scope of the office's responsibilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34). Thereafter, on or about November 18, 2016, Manees filed a complaint about the incident with the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights. As of the date when Manees filed her pending amended complaint, that investigation remains pending. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants' motion depends, to the extent it asserts a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, on whether plaintiffs have stated a claim for which relief can be granted. That is, the parties agree that, if I dismiss the current federal claims for failure to state a claim, I should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state common law claims. (Doc. 6 at 10-11; Doc. 7 at 15). I therefore begin my analysis with defendants' arguments pursuant to Fed. R. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under that Rule, the amended complaint \"must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Defendants also note that plaintiffs' complaint (Doc. 5 at 7, \u00b6\u00b6 29-32) cites to O.A.C. \u00a7 3301-35-15, which \"protects children in a school environment.\" To the same effect is a TPS Policy that, as referenced by the plaintiffs' complaint, prohibits prone restraint. (Doc. 5 at 7 \u00b6\u00b6 29-32 (citing TPS Board Policy Manual Section J, number JP) ). That plaintiffs have used these provisions in their complaint further shows, defendants\n   argue, that their claims are grounded in the school environment, and are not of either constitutional or state common law dimension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants also claim the second clue shows that plaintiffs' amended complaint seeks relief for denial of a FAPE. To that end, they note that plaintiffs first sought relief with the OEC, which investigates IDEA complaints, prior to filing suit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.6 at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that their amended complaint does not seek relief for denial of a FAPE. They focus on the first clue, arguing that they could bring the same claims they allege in their amended complaint if D.M. \"had ... been physically battered as a result of his disability by a librarian at the public library, or had an adult visitor with a disability experienced the same physical battery by a teacher at Robinson.\" (Doc. 7 at 7). They argue that using terms from the IDEA in their amended complaint has no bearing on the essential nature of their claims. Rather, they claim, the references to these terms put defendants on \"notice ... of the conditions that put [D.M.] at risk\" and are not \"central to the dispute of this litigation.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    K.G. v.
