Because Defendant was present at the hearing despite the NTA's failure to include the date and time, the result of the hearing would not have been different had the NTA included the date and time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lara-Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206590798\">\n    2018 WL 6590798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"There is nothing in the record to indicate that if the Notice to Appear had included the date and time of the removal proceeding - a proceeding at which Defendant was present - the proceeding would not have resulted in Defendant's removal.\").

Defendant must show that he exhausted any administrative remedies, the proceedings deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review, and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair. Defendant has only argued that he was denied due process, and the court is\n   unpersuaded because Defendant was present at his hearing. Therefore, \u00a7 1326(d) does not permit Defendant to collaterally attack the unlawful deportation order. Accordingly, it is recommended that Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The presiding district judge must conduct his or her own review (that is, make a de novo determination) of those portions of the Memorandum and Recommendation to which objection is properly made and may accept, reject, or modify the determinations in the Memorandum and Recommendation; receive further evidence; or return the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ; Fed.
