Dkt. 918. For the following reasons the Petitions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   From 2004 to 2014, Defendants were the leaders and partners in a counterfeiting scheme that manufactured over $ 70,000,000 in counterfeit currency over an almost ten year period. This Court found that Arkadiy Bangiyev reasonably knew about at least $ 20,000,000 of counterfeit currency as he was involved at the higher levels of the conspiracy and financed some of the operations. Dkt. 736. This Court found that Eduard Bangiyev was also a leader and \"knew that between $ 7,000,000 and $ 20,000,000 was generated by the conspiracy.\" Dkt. 733.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants pleaded guilty to participating in a RICO conspiracy, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Dkt. 504, 507. In their plea agreements, Defendants agreed to \"waive all constitutional and statutory challenges to forfeiture in any manner (including direct appeal, habeas corpus, or any other means) to any forfeiture carried out in accordance with this Plea Agreement on any grounds, including that the forfeiture constitutes an excessive fine or punishment.\" Dkt. 505, 507.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Each Defendant contested the loss amount identified in their Presentence Reports and therefore the Court held an evidentiary hearing to establish the loss amount on May 28, 2015. Two of the lead law enforcement agents involved in the case testified and were cross-examined. While the Court was concerned that a portion of coconspirator Loz's statements to the agents were not corroborated (December 2013 shipments to the Bangiyevs), the Court found that other testimony was corroborated and credible, and established that the brothers, partners, and leaders of this counterfeit conspiracy had received between $ 2,500,000 to $ 3,000,000 a month from Loz between 2008 to 2011. This sum equaled $ 30,000,000 to $ 36,000,000 and fully supported the $ 20,000,000 loss figure. Further, each Defendant agreed that the loss figure was $ 7,000,000 to $ 20,000,000. So there is no question that each Defendant obtained $ 20,000,000 in proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After Defendants were sentenced, Preliminary Orders of Forfeiture were entered against each Defendant on October 27, 2015. Dkt. 730, 733. This was followed by an amended order pertaining to Arkadiy Bangiyev entered October 28, 2015, Dkt. 736, and an amended order pertaining to Eduard Bangiyev entered December 23, 2015. Dkt. 757. No appeal of a forfeiture order was ever filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Both Defendants filed motions pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to vacate, set aside, or correct their sentences. Dkt. 781, 800. This Court denied both motions. Dkt. 845, 861. The Fourth Circuit dismissed both appeals.

Arkadiy Bangiyev knew at least $ 20,000,000 in counterfeit currency had been produced in the course of the conspiracy and Eduard Bangiyev knew between $ 7,000,000 and $ 20,000,000 in counterfeit currency had been produced in the course of the conspiracy. Neither was an incidental figure, but rather were at the center of a large, sophisticated conspiracy to produce and sell counterfeit currency for ten years.
