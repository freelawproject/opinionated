VILARDO, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On January 6, 2015, the plaintiff, Christopher McCrobie, filed this action seeking damages against defendants Palisades Acquisition XVI, LLC (\"Palisades\"), and Houslanger &amp; Associates, PLLC (\"Houslanger &amp; Associates\"). Docket item 1. McCrobie alleges that the defendants violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices\n   Act (\"FDCPA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a, et seq., by trying to collect a debt that was not theirs to collect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Before this Court is McCrobie's motion for leave to amend his complaint and the defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 19, 2015, McCrobie filed his first amended complaint (\"FAC\") adding Todd Houslanger, the attorney for Palisades and Houslanger &amp; Associates, as a defendant. Docket Item 7. McCrobie also added a cause of action: violation of New York General Business Law (\"GBL\") \u00a7 349.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, he added several factual allegations pertaining to events that occurred after the date of the original pleading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 28, 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a plausible claim of relief under the FDCPA or GBL and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Docket Item 17. McCrobie responded by filing a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Docket Item 19. He sought to add Palisades' corporate parent, Asta Funding, Inc., as an additional defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also sought to add claims for declaratory and injunctive relief and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 25, 2016, United States District Judge John T. Curtin dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine. Docket Item 41. McCrobie appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed Judge Curtin's decision. Docket Item 47. The Second Circuit remanded the case to this Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to address the other arguments raised in the motions that had been pending before Judge Curtin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the Second Circuit's remand, this Court held a status conference on January 30, 2017, and permitted the parties to file supplemental briefing. Docket Item 52. On March 22, 2017, the defendants filed supplemental briefs in support of their motion to dismiss McCrobie's FAC and in opposition to McCrobie's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. Docket Items 55 and 56. On April 24, 2017, McCrobie responded, Docket item 63, and on May 8, 2017, the defendants replied, Docket Items 66 and 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court considers McCrobie's motion for leave to amend his complaint, Docket Item 19. Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that leave to amend should be freely given \"when justice so requires.\" The defendants oppose McCrobie's request to amend his complaint a second time. Among other reasons, the defendants contend that the second amended complaint fails to comply with Local Rule 15(b), Docket Item 55 at 11-12, which provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [u]nless the movant is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the amendment(s) or supplements(s) to the original pleading shall be identified in the proposed pleading through the use of a word processing 'redline' function or other similar markings that are visible in both electronic and paper format.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A \"local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a way that causes a party to lose any right because of a nonwillful failure to comply.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(a)(2). In this case, the plaintiff's counsel specifically acknowledged \"that the local rules generally require a 'redlined' copy of a proposed amended complaint to be submitted along with a motion to amend a complaint.\" Docket Item 19-2 at 2. Nevertheless, he decided that \"in light of the significant additions, subtractions, and revisions, a 'redlined' copy would not be practicable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Contrary to the assertion by plaintiff's counsel that \"a 'redlined' copy of a proposed amended complaint\" is only \"generally require[d],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , the language in Local Rule 15(b) is mandatory. What is more, this Court can find no authority for an attorney's unilaterally deciding that the rule need not be followed because it is not \"practicable.\" In fact, at least one court in this district has strictly held plaintiffs who are represented by counsel to the requirements of Local Rule 15(b) when requesting leave to file complex amendments to their complaints.\n   <em>\n    Doe by and through Doe v.

Therefore, this Court denies McCrobie's request to amend his FAC for failure to comply with Local Rule 15(b) without prejudice to his filing another request to amend that complies with that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     MOTION TO DISMISS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Having denied McCrobie's motion for leave to amend his complaint, this Court considers the defendants' motion to dismiss McCrobie's FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When considering a motion to dismiss, this Court accepts \"the factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw[s] all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff['s] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Mantikas v.

The FAC tells the following story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2007, Centurion Capital Corporation obtained a default judgment against McCrobie, Docket Item 7 at 1, 6, relating to credit card debt that McCrobie owed to Providian Financial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. McCrobie says that his debt to Providian Financial was \"allegedly assigned\" to Centurion Capital Corporation and that he did not know about the lawsuit or default judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2014, defendant Houslanger &amp; Associates-and, in particular, defendant Todd Houslanger, an attorney with the firm-represented defendant Palisades.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. On behalf of Palisades, Houslanger forwarded an income execution to McCrobie's employer designed to garnish McCrobie's wages so as to enforce Centurion Capital Corporation's judgment against McCrobie.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 6-7. Centurion Capital Corporation never notified McCrobie about the alleged assignment of the judgment to Palisades, nor did it file the assignment in the City Court of Buffalo, the court where the default judgment was entered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. Such a filing may have given McCrobie constructive notice of the assignment, but that never happened.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In March 2015, McCrobie contacted Houslanger &amp; Associates and asked for a copy of the chain of title that gave Palisades the right to enforce the default judgment obtained against McCrobie by Centurion Capital Corporation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Houslanger and Associates sent McCrobie several documents, but none of them referred to the default judgment against him or gave Palisades any right to enforce that judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. McCrobie therefore claims that the defendants had no right to try to enforce the judgment and, in doing so, violated the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But McCrobie certainly can challenge whether a debt collector used false and misleading, \u00a7 1692e, or unfair and unconscionable, \u00a7 1692f, means to collect a debt from him. In doing so, he can challenge the defendants' \"\n   <em>\n    misrepresentation of its right to\n   </em>\n   \" collect the debt \"because abusive debt collection-even of a debt actually owed-is a harm in itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Im v.

Section 1692e provides that \"[a] debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt\"; and \u00a7 1692f provides that \"[a] debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.\" McCrobie's complaint contends that Houslanger himself committed those violations while acting as an agent for Houslanger and Associates. Docket Item 7 at 1. Thus, whether the Act reaches Houslanger himself depends on whether he was a \"debt collector\" when he allegedly committed the violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \"The term 'debt collector' means any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce ... in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts, or who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.\" \u00a7 1692a(6). \"[T]here is a split of authority about whether the corporate form insulates the shareholder, officer, or director from personal liability under the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schwarm v.

Nothing in the statutory language reflects an intent to permit only\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability upon the corporation for the acts of its agents; instead, the language suggests that both corporate debt collectors and their individual agents may be jointly and severally liable for FDCPA violations. In this case, because McCrobie alleges that Houslanger himself violated the FDCPA, Houslanger may be held liable for his own violations. Docket Item 7 at 1. This Court reaches that conclusion for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, individual liability is consistent with the plain language of the FDCPA and the FDCPA's broad remedial purposes. The FDCPA defines a debt collector as \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   person ... in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   business.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6) (emphasis added). The language does not restrict liability to corporate employers when the natural person who took the actions that violated the FDCPA was a corporate employee or agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Musso v. Seiders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"200126\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/194/43/#p46\">\n    194 F.R.D. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (D.

Statements of General Policy or Interpretation Staff Commentary on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050%2C097\">\n    53 Fed. Reg. 50,097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50,102 (Dec. 13, 1988). In that guidance, the FTC listed a number of examples of individuals and entities that would meet the statutory definition of debt collector, explicitly noting that the term encompasses \"[e]mployees of a debt collection business, including a corporation, partnership, or other entity whose business is the collection of debts owed another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Fed.%20Reg.%2050%2C097\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Finally, the broad language that Congress used when defining \"debt collector\" in \u00a7 1692a(6) is consistent with broad language that Congress has used elsewhere when it intended to extend liability to individual agents or employees; conversely, it is inconsistent with the language Congress has used when it intended to limit liability only to employers or corporate entities. For example, the Second Circuit (and every other circuit to address the issue\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), has held that \"an owning stockholder who manages the corporation\" may be individually liable for environmental contamination cleanup costs as an \"operator\" under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\").\n   <em>\n    New York v.
