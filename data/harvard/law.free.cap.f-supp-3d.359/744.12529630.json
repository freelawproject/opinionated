It is organized under the laws of Delaware and has its headquarters and principal place of business in Salt Lake City, Utah. Guardian Flight is the successor in interest to Valley Med Flight, Inc. (\"Valley Med Flight\"). On July 19, 2017, Valley Med Flight and several affiliated air ambulance companies were purchased by Air Medical Group Holdings, Inc. (\"AMGH\"). As of November 22, 2017, Valley Med Flight's North Dakota emergency air ambulance operations were transferred to Guardian Flight, and as of December 29, 2017, all related FAA Part 135 air ambulance operations were transferred to Guardian Flight. Guardian Flight is registered with the North Dakota Secretary of State to do business as Valley Med Flight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Jon Godfread is the North Dakota Insurance Commissioner. North Dakota law empowers the Insurance Commissioner to issue cease and desist orders respecting violations of Title 26.1, and to bring an action in state court to enjoin any acts or practices which are prohibited by Title 26.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 26.1-01-03.1 and 26.1-01-03.2. The Insurance Commissioner may also seek administrative penalties\n   for violations of Title 26.1. N.D.C.C. \u00a7 26.1-01-03.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Wayne Stenehjem is the North Dakota Attorney General. He investigates and prosecutes any violations of state law, and is authorized by law 'to institute and prosecute all cases in which the state is a party, whenever in their judgment it would be for the best interests of the state so to do.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 54-12-02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     GUARDIAN FLIGHT AIR AMBULANCE SERVICES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Guardian Flight is a federally regulated air carrier which provides air ambulance services in North Dakota and around the country. It maintains a fleet of air ambulances ready to promptly respond to medical emergencies, often in rural or remote locations that lack sophisticated medical services. Guardian Flight's air ambulances transport patients facing serious or life-threatening emergencies, while providing medical care during the flight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As an emergent care provider, Guardian Flight may be dispatched by first responders, the emergency department of a hospital, or by an attending physician. Guardian Flight does not self-dispatch. Where a covered hospital or attending physician orders a transport, the regulations and procedures set out by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (\"EMTALA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd, generally apply. North Dakota regulations require air ambulances to provide adequate care when called in emergency situations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D. Admin. Code\u00a7 33-36-01-05(8), (12), (16). Under state law, air ambulance providers may only refuse care in specified non-emergent situations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 23-27-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In keeping with federal and state law, Guardian Flight transports patients regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay. Air ambulance services are extremely expensive. The median price charged by air ambulance service providers nearly doubled between 2010 and 2014. The amount Guardian Flight is reimbursed for its services depends in part on the patient's insurance coverage and whether Guardian Flight is an in-network or out-of-network provider with a particular insurance company. Due to the nature of the need for an air ambulance, patients have little or no control over which air ambulance service provider is used. Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rates are limited and substantially below Guardian Flight's billed charges. Similarly, Guardian Flight generally recovers very little from patients who are uninsured. The cost of undercompensated care is shifted to and borne by other payors such as commercial insurers and patients. The portion of the billed charges which are not covered by insurance, which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, is ultimately the responsibility of the patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   These large and unexpected bills lead many patients to complain to the North Dakota Insurance Department. North Dakota has twice passed legislation in an attempt to remedy the problem. The first attempt was found to be preempted by the Airline Deregulation Act (\"ADA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valley Med Flight, Inc. v. Dwelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344215\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/171/930/\">\n    171 F.Supp.3d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.D. 2016). It is the second attempt, SB 2231, which is the subject of this declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     GUARDIAN FLIGHT SUBSCRIPTION MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In most states in which it operates, Guardian Flight offers a subscription membership program. In exchange for a membership fee of less than $100 per year, Guardian Flight considers any air ambulance charges beyond the amount paid by\n   a member's insurance or other third parties to be prepaid by the member. Guardian Flight offers this membership program as part of an alliance of air ambulance providers affiliated under the name \"AirMedCare Network.\" The same parent company, AMGH, owns each of the AirMedCare Network companies. Persons who purchase an AirMedCare Network subscription are automatically enrolled in the membership program for each of the air ambulance companies in the AirMedCare Network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The program allows members to partially prepay Guardian Flight for the services it provides. The membership program does not guarantee service. Members cannot contact Guardian Flight or any other AirMedCare Network provider to provide transport when services are needed, and Guardian Flight is not required to indemnify or pay any specified amount to members or to third-party providers if the member is ultimately transported by an air ambulance service that is not part of the AirMedCare Network. If the patient is a member, the portion of the billing which is the responsibility of the patient is considered prepaid by the membership fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Until the passage of SB 2231 in 2017, Guardian Flight's predecessor (Valley Med Flight) offered this membership program in North Dakota and had hundreds of members. SB 2231 prohibits subscription agreements. Guardian Flight would like to offer a subscription membership program in North Dakota but is prohibited from doing so by SB 2231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     SB 2231\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2015, in an attempt to protect patients from enormous bills for air ambulance services, the North Dakota Legislature passed HB 1255 which created air ambulance call lists, required air ambulance providers to provide fee schedules upon request, and created a fee schedule for workers' compensation cases.\n   <em>\n    Dwelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344215\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/171/930/\">\n    171 F.Supp.3d at 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court determined that HB 1255 was preempted by the ADA and the McCarran-Ferguson Act did not provide reverse pre-emption protection because the law did not regulate the business of insurance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344215\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/171/930/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344215\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/171/930/\">\n    at 942-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2017, the North Dakota Legislature again tried to remedy the situation by passing SB 2231. SB 2231 is codified at N.D.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 26.1-47-08 and 26.1-47-09. Section 26.1-47-09(3) provides a payment by an insurer to a provider for air ambulance services to be a full and final payment with no option for the provider to seek the balance form the patient. Section 26.1-47-08 prohibits air ambulance subscription agreements. The two provisions provide as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   An air ambulance provider, or an agent of an air ambulance provider, may not sell, solicit, or negotiate a subscription agreement or contract relating to services or the billing of services provided by an air ambulance provider. An air ambulance provider, or agent of an air ambulance provider, which violates this section is subject to a civil fine in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars for each violation. The fine may be collected and recovered in an action brought in the name of the state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   N.D.C.C. \u00a7 26.1-47-08.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1.

An insurer may not use the average of an insurer's in-network rates for air ambulance providers in the state in order to decrease current or future contractual\n   rates between an insurer and an air ambulance provider.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   3.\n   <strong>\n    For purposes of settling a claim made by the insured for air ambulance services, a payment made by an insurer under the plan in compliance with this section is deemed to be the same as an in-network payment and is considered a full and final payment by the insured for out-of-network air ambulance services billed to the insured.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   4.

The law states \"a payment made by an insurer ... is considered a full and final payment by the insured for out-of-network air ambulance services billed to the insured.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 26.1-47-09(3). The law mandates that when Guardian Flight is out of network with the insurer it must accept as payment in full the payment made by the insurer as long as that payment complies with Section 26.1-47-09(1). In effect, Guardian Flight must accept the state-mandated rate and no balance billing is permitted. Obviously then, the law relates to air ambulance rates. There can be no question that such interference with air ambulance rates and prices is precisely the type of state regulation Congress sought to prevent when it included an express preemption clause in the ADA.\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/\">\n    504 U.S. at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729384\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/374/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Placing the law in Title 26.1, which regulates insurance, does not save it from preemption.

While the policy choices the State is attempting to impose in Section 26.1-47-09(3) are well-intentioned, the enactment once again misses the mark by focusing on air ambulance charges and limiting the amount which is considered a full and final payment, rather than focusing on the percentage of the charges the insurance provider must pay. Congress has assumed the field in the area of air carrier regulation. Insurance regulation remains the province of the states. If the State wishes to protect patients who need air ambulance services it would do well to mandate insurance providers pay a larger percentage of the charges rather than trying to regulate how much the air ambulance bills for its services. If Congress believes patients are in need of protection from out-of-control air ambulance rates, and they surely are out of control, it may act to exclude air ambulance\n   service providers from the ADA or provide some other form of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     N.D.C.C \u00a7 26.1-47-08\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Guardian Flight also contends the ADA preempts North Dakota Century Code \u00a7 26.1-47-08, because the law relates to the prices that air ambulance service providers may charge in North Dakota. The Subscription Provision prohibits air ambulance service providers from offering or selling air ambulance subscription agreements. Generally speaking, such subscription agreements require an annual fee which then exempts the member from any co-pays or balance billing the member might otherwise be responsible for if the member uses an air ambulance. The only argument the State offers in opposition to Guardian Flight's contention is that the State retains the authority to regulate insurance and the McCarran-Ferguson Act reverse preemption provision saves it from preemption because the State is regulating insurance. The Court will address that issue below. Clearly, the Subscription Provision relates to air ambulance rates and services as it prohibits subscription agreements which directly impacts charges for air ambulance services. The Court finds ADA preemption applies to the Subscription Provision unless the McCarran-Ferguson Act analysis alters the conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     McCARRAN-FERGUSON ACT REVERSE PREEMPTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The State contends McCarran-Ferguson Act (\"MFA\") saves both the Subscription Provision and the Payment Provision from preemption as both provisions regulate insurance.

All three\n   <em>\n    Pireno\n   </em>\n   factors indicate the Payment Provision does not regulate the \"business of insurance.\" An individual has a relationship with the provider as a patient and a relationship with the insurance carrier as a policyholder. As is often the case, the air ambulance service provider charges too much and the insurance carrier pays too little. The individual is caught in the middle and one of the three parties involved is going to lose the struggle to see who must pay or absorb the loss. In the final analysis, the Payment Provision is aimed at protecting the patient from the air ambulance service provider by capping the amount the provider may collect from\n   the patient. In effect, prohibiting balance billing. If the provider's billings are capped the provider must absorb the loss. The Payment Provision does not require the insurer to pay more of the charged billing. Since the Payment Provision alters the relationship between the provider and the patient rather than the insured and the insurer, its focus is not on the \"business of insurance\" or \"adjusting, managing, or controlling the business of insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    Fabe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11654\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/491/#p500\">\n    508 U.S. at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525632,11654\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/113/2202/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516778,12516779\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/1259/\">\n    889 F.3d at 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The law provides that \"[a]n air ambulance provider, or an agent of an air ambulance provider, may not sell, solicit, or negotiate a subscription agreement or contract relating to services or the billing of services provided by an air ambulance provider.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 26.1-47-08. Guardian Flight contends subscription agreements it offers are not insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. No. 1-1. Thus, the only question the Court need resolve is whether the subscription agreements banned by Section 26.1-47-08 are a form of insurance. By any reasonable definition, the subscription agreements banned by Section 26.1-47-08 are a form of insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Insurance is \"[a] contract by which one party (the insurer) undertakes to indemnify another party (the insured) against risk of loss, damage, or liability arising from the occurrence of some specified contingency.

Put another way,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [I]nsurance is a contract by which one party (the insurer), for a consideration that usually is paid in money, either in a lump sum or at different times during the continuance of the risk, promises to make a certain payment, usually of money, upon the destruction or injury of \"something\" in which the other party (the insured) has an interest.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   1 Steven Plitt et. al.,\n   <em>\n    Couch On Insurance\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1:6 (3d ed. 2018). In North Dakota, an insurance contract is defined as \"a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss, damage, or liability arising from an unknown or contingent event.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 26.1-29-01. An accident and health insurance policy is \"any contract policy insuring against loss resulting from sickness or bodily injury, or death by accident, or both.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 26.1-36-02. \"An insurer is a person who undertakes to indemnify another by an insurance contract and the insured is the person indemnified.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 26.1-29-02. \"Anyone who is capable of making a contract, except as restricted by law, may be an insurer, and anyone except a public enemy may be an insured.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 26.1-29-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   There is no dispute subscription agreements are contracts. And it is clear they spread risk. For a fee, the air ambulance agrees the patient who uses an affiliated air ambulance will incur no out-of-pocket expenses. Whether a member will ever need the services of an air ambulance is the contingent event upon which the contract is based. The air ambulance agrees to seek reimbursement only from the patient member's insurer or another third party who may be responsible. This is the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   benefit conferred by the contract. The air ambulance assumes the member's risk. The vast majority of members will never need to use an air ambulance. The air ambulance will collect fees from many members but will only transport a very\n   few. The air ambulance is assured a steady stream of revenue. The risk of an enormous bill is spread as many will pay a manageable fee so that no one person is faced with a catastrophic bill and the air ambulance provider will assume the risk that multiple members will need their services. The Subscription Provision alters the relationship between the air ambulance and the member by entirely prohibiting air ambulances from selling subscription agreements and the provision only applies to air ambulance service providers. The Court concludes such an arrangement is a form of insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Love v.

Simply and repeatedly saying a contract is not a contract of insurance does not make it so. A Costco membership does not shift risk, but rather confers a immediate certain benefit of entry into the member stores and the privilege of purchasing the goods for sale in the stores. The Court rejects Guardian Flight's contention that the contract in question is one for contingent services rather than insurance.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Care must be taken to distinguish mere contracts to render service on the happening of a contingency from true contracts of insurance. The cases have failed to declare a satisfactory rule for distinguishing between the two types of agreements, but it would seem that\n   <em>\n    the contract should not be classed as insurance if the paramount purpose in its formation was to be the rendition of the services rendered.\n   </em>\n   However,\n   <em>\n    it should be insurance if the chief purpose of the agreement is the protection against the risk involved.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

In this case, the clear purpose of the subscription agreement is not the provision of a service, but rather to protect against the risk of a catastrophic billing for the use of an air ambulance. Such balance billings can run as high as $80,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 7-1.
