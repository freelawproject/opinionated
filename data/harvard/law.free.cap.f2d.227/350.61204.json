An Internal Revenue Agent was duly assigned to investigate the status of those persons. The Agent was unable to complete the investigation because Beatty refused to&gt; produce his records pertaining to their employment. Beatty\u2019s refusal was based upon his determination that the individuals in question were independent contractors and consequently the details of their employment were none of the Agent\u2019s business. The Agent and his superiors insisted upon determining that question for themselves from the facts, including Beatty\u2019s records. A \u201cDirector\u2019s Summons to Testify and to Produce Books and Records\u201d was issued by the District Director of Internal Revenue for the District of Iowa and served upon Beatty by the Internal Revenue Agent, commanding him to appear before the District Director and produce the desired records. Beatty appeared at the time and place specified in the summons. The Agent appeared for his superior, the District Director. Mr. Beatty refused to produce his books and records pertaining to the persons whose status was under investigation and refused to give the Agent their names or any other information about them. The District Director formally complained to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, in the name of the United States, requesting an order of that court requiring Beatty to show cause why he should not obey the summons and produce the records, or failing to do so be punished therefor. The Order to Show Cause was issued. Beatty appeared with counsel and again refused to produce the records for the same reason he had refused to produce them in response to the summons. Whereupon, the District Court issued an order and judgment directing that Beatty produce the records no later than a date fixed, or failing to do so that he be committed to the custody of the Attorney General un&lt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>til he did so. Beatty appealed and the court stayed the order of commitment pending the disposition of the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Upon this appeal Beatty contends that the District Director did not lay the proper procedural foundation for invoking Sections 7602 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 7604 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7602, 7604.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">He asserts that the Internal Revenue Code, Section 3615(d), Title 26 U.S.C.A., specifically provides that the \u201cSummons\u201d shall be served \u201cby a Deputy Director\u201d and since the summons was served by an Internal Revenue Agent the service was not good. The difficulty with Mr. Beatty\u2019s position in this particular is 'that he appears to have been operating tinder the 1939 Internal Revenue Code which has been antiquated in this regard by Sections 7602, 7603, 7604, and 7701(a) (12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 7602-7604, 7701(a) (12). By Section 7602 of the 1954 Code \u201cthe Secretary or his delegate\u201d is authorized to examine the books of the taxpayer. By Section 7603 of the 1954 Code the summons may be served by \u201cthe Secretary or his delegate\u201d. By section 7701(a) (12) of the 1954 Code the term \u201cSecretary\u201d is defined to mean the Secretary of the Treasury, and the term, \u201c \u2018Secretary or his delegate\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201cany officer, employee, or agency of the Treasury Department duly authorized by the Secretary (directly, or indirectly by one or more redelegations of authority) to perform the function mentioned * * *.\u201d By Section 7805(a) of the 1954 Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7805(a), Congress authorized the \u201cSecretary or his delegate\u201d to prescribe \u201call needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this title, including all rules and regulations as may be necessary by reason of any alteration of law in relation to internal revenue.\u201d Pursuant to the authority given by Section 7805(a), by various departmental orders, delegations and redelega-tions of authority were made authorizing various subordinates to perform various functions. Specifically, Treasury Department 5900, 1952-1 Cum.Bull. 237 (17 F.R. 4464) provided that a reference to a deputy collector should be deemed to refer to an internal revenue agent. A sympathetic understanding may exist concerning Beatty\u2019s lack of knowledge of the contents of these bulletins and orders variously published and legal knowledge thereof thereby brought home to the layman, see Mr. Justice Jackson\u2019s dissent in Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 68 S.Ct. 1, 92 L. Ed. 10, but further than, an expression of sympathy for understandable ignorance, the law does not permit the courts to go. See majority opinion, Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, supra. Hence, even if, in view of Beatty\u2019s response to the summons, the question of service was consequential, which it was not, still he has no ground for complaint that the summons was served by an internal revenue agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Appellant contends that proper foundation was not laid for the order of the District Court because the complaint asking for the order to show cause \u201cfailed to state facts showing that the examination was not unnecessary.\u201d The contention is based on Section 3631 of the 1939 Code (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3631) now 7605(b) of the 1954 Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7605(b), providing that \u2014 \u201cNo taxpayer shall be subjected to unnecessary examination or investigations * * *.\u201d The complaint did allege the necessity for the examination of the records in question. The facts developed at the hearing supported the allegation. Beatty contended the examination was unnecessary because he, Beatty, had determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the employees in question were independent contractors. 'He was not entitled to make such a conclusive determination of the question. The Internal Revenue authorities were entitled to the information contained in the records. If, after obtaining the facts, a difference of opinion arose between these authorities and Beatty concerning the status of these employees, Beatty would then have ample opportunity to submit the dispute to the courts. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Beatty says that since the summons provided that he should appear before the \u201cDirector\u201d and the Director did not appear to examine him but instead delegated that duty to the Agent, the Director may not now complain of Beatty\u2019s failure to produce the records. This complaint is inconsequential and again ignores the delegation of authority to the Agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Other questions presented are not worthy of further discussion. The order and judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-6\">. By request we treat the order and judgment as being one from which an appeal may be taken without determining that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">.
