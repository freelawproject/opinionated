Sunkist Growers, Inc., et al. His clients, Sunkist Growers, Inc., Exchange Lemon Products Company and Exchange Orange Products Company seek to intervene to assert their interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-22\">It appears from the affidavits of his clients that they do not intend to have Williams conduct the trial of the litigation but that they will be represented by other counsel, duly admitted therefor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>The attorneys actually having the trial of the case may have Williams sit with them as advisor, as would any nonadmit-ted law clerk or secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">It would appear that the matter is one de minimis presenting merely a moot question not appropriate for a writ of mandamus. See Bankers Life &amp; Casualty Co. v. Holland, 1953, 346 U.S. 379, 74 S.Ct. 145, 98 L.Ed. 106; Roche v. Evaporated Milk Ass\u2019n, 1943, 319 U.S. 21, 63 S.Ct. 938, 87 L.Ed. 1185; Jewell v.
