CARTER, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b750-21\">This case arises on an amended petition to review a decision of the Tax Court of the United States. It involves a merger of corporations, and raises the question whether the taxpayer, Gallo Winery, (hereafter Gallo) may use the unused excess profits tax credit of Valley Agricultural Company, (hereafter Valley), the merged corporation, as a carry-over under Sec. 710(b) (3) and (c) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 710(b) (3), (c) for its taxable year ending April 30, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-22\">The case was tried below on a stipulation of facts. A memorandum opinion was filed, the equivalent of findings, and a decision entered on August 31, 1953. Within time the petition for review was filed. The opinion and decision below was not officially reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-23\">The facts are as follows: Gallo, the taxpayer, was incorporated under the laws of California on May 28, 1942, under the name of Gallo Tank Lines, to engage in the railroad tank car business. On March 9,1944, Gallo amended its articles of incorporation so as to substitute its present name for Gallo Tank Lines and to authorize it to engage in the winery business.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-24\">Valley was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on March 6, 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-25\">On December 19, 1945, by proceedings duly had and taken in accordance with Section 361 of the California Civil Code,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Valley was merged with and into Gallo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Pursuant to that section, an agreement for the merger was approved by the board of directors of each of the two corporations on November 7, 1945. The execution of the merger agreement was delayed' until the following month, pending the result of a hearing by the Commissioner of Corporations of California, on the fairness of the terms and conditions thereof. The Commissioner of Corporations approved the terms and conditions on December 7,1945, and the merger was effected on December 19, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Valley filed a tax return for its last taxable year of operation beginning January 1, 1945, and ending December 18, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The excess profits credit of Valley was $169,478.26. Its excess profits net income for the same taxable year was $102,777.22, and after annualization in accordance with Regulations 112, Section 35.710-3, the annual net income for the year totaled $106,572.97. Accordingly, the unused excess profits credit of Valley for its taxable year was $60,664.-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Gallo\u2019s fiscal year ran from May 1, 1945 to April 30, 1946, and its excess profits tax net income for its fiscal year was in excess of $589,000.00.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The Tax Court held that Gallo was not entitled to use, in its taxable year ended April 30, 1946, any unused excess profits credit of Valley arising out of the latter\u2019s taxable year ended December 18, 1945. The correctness of this decision is the sole question presented on this appeal. All other disputes have been adjusted or conceded by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">There is no contention by Respondent that Gallo acquired in Valley a hollow shell for tax deduction purposes. In the Revenue Act of 1943, amending Sec. 129 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, Congress provided against such practices. Section 128, Revenue Act of 1943, Act of Feb. 25, 1944, 58 Stat. 21 et seq., 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 129. Respondent has not cited or relied upon this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Section 710 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 710, pertinent to our problem, is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">There Occurred a True Merger The merger of Gallo <em>and </em>Valley was pursuant to California law and was a statutory merger. See. 361, Civil Code of California in effect in 1945,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the date of the merger provides in subd. (5) that upon following the statutory procedure, the merging corporations, \u201cshall be one corporation\u201d; and in subd. (7) \u201cupon the merger * * * the separate existence of the constituent corporations shall cease, except that of the surviving corporation * * *\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">In Mutual Building &amp; Loan Ass'n of Pasadena v. Wiborg, 1943, 59 Cal.App.2d 325, 139 P.2d 73, the California court said of a merger under Sec. 361 Civil Code: \u201cBy virtue of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Title Guarantee suffered the fate of all merged corporations, to wit, they became a part of the muscle and the blood stream of the mergee corporation, transfusing into the mergee all its (their) rights and privileges * * * \u201d, 59 Cal.App.2d at page 328, 139 P.2d at page 74. \u201cWhile the Title Guarantee merger with Title Insurance caused it to lose its identity as to its separate existence, yet <em>it become an integral part of Title Insurance, </em>and carried with it all of its rights, powers, liabilities, and assets \u2018except the indicia and attributes of a corporate body, distinct from that into which it is merged.\u2019 \u201d 59 Cal.App.2d at page 329, 139 P.2d at page 75. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Valley therefore, on merger with Gallo, under California law, became an integral part of Gallo by statutory merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">The Supreme Court Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">New Colonial Ice Co., Inc., v. Helver-ing, 1934, 292 U.S. 435, 54 S.Ct. 788, 78 L.Ed. 1348, involved a construction of Sec. 204(b) of the Revenue Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 231, a statute permitting a taxpayer to carry over to a succeeding year, a loss from a prior year, and thus very similar to the statute involved in this case. The court rejected a contention that for all practical purposes, a successor corporation, where no merger existed, was the same entity as the old one and therefore the same taxpayer. The court pointed out various reasons why there was no basis for the contention, 292 U.S. at page 441, 54 S. Ct. 788. These, petitioner refers to as the requirements laid down by the Supreme Court for establishing identity between the two corporations. Suffice it to say that if these were requirements for such a test, the Gallo-Valley merger met them all. In Gallo there was a true statutory merger. In New Colonial, there was nothing resembling a merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 1939, 306 U.S. 522, at page 523, 59 S.Ct. 634, at page 635, 83 L.Ed. 957, presented the question as to \u201cwhether under the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, a Pennsylvania corporation may deduct unamor-tized bond discount and expense in connection with redemption of the bonds of a subsidiary, all of whose assets it had previously acquired pursuant to local lav/.\u201d The circuit court had reversed the Board of Tax Appeals and answered the question in the affirmative. The Supreme Court affirmed the Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Helvering, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, conceded that if a true merger existed, the decision below was correct, but contended the transaction was a mere sale by one corporation of all its assets to another which assumes the liability of the former.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The respondents therein, contended the transaction constituted merger under Pennsylvania law. The court said the question was solely one of Pennsylvania law and proceeded to analyse that law. This much of Hel-vering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, the petitioner herein refers to as the \u201cmajor premise\u201d in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">As to the two transactions, involving two sets of corporations, the court held as to one, that it \u201chas all the elements of a merger and comes within the principle that the corporate personality of the transferor is drowned in' that of the transferee\u201d, and as to the other transaction, \u201cthe transfer in question constituted a de facto merger * * The final holding was that \u201cthe continuing corporation may deduct unamortized bond discount and expense in respect of the obligations of the transferring affiliate.\u201d 306 U.S. at page 529, 59 S.Ct. at page 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Respondent concedes \u201cthat a successor corporation may in some instances succeed to a deduction which its submerged corporation would otherwise have had, as in Helvering\u201d * * * (supra). We believe that the Supreme Court held, <em>a fortiori, </em>that in the event of <em>a true statutory merger, </em>the mergee corporation was entitled to the deductions of the other corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">New Colonial Ice Co., supra, had pointed out that \u201cthe statutes have disclosed a general purpose to confine allowable losses to the taxpayer sustaining them, i. e., to treat them as personal to him and not transferable to or usable by another;\u201d 292 U.S. at page 440, 54 S.Ct. at page 790. Thus the Supreme Court held in substance in Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, that the old corporation continued in the new as so integral a part, that it might use, acting through the identity of the new corporation, its own deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">The Stanton Case</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">Gallo relies upon, and the Commissioner attacks Stanton Brewery, Inc., v. C.I. R., 2 Cir., 1949, 176 F.2d 573.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There the corporate transaction was between an operating company and a holding corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>pany and the court termed it a \u201cmerger.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The tax year was 1942 and a carry over of the unused excess profits credits of the component corporations for years 1940 and 1941 under the same statutes involved here, was held proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Relying on Sec. 710(c) (3) (B), Title 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 710(c) (3) (B), \u201cIf for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1939, the <em>taxpayer </em>has an unused excess profits credit, such unused excess profits credit shall be an unused excess profits credit carry-over for each of the two succeeding taxable years * * * \u201d, [Emphasis added], the petitioner contended and the court held that \u201cas the \u2018taxpayer\u2019 in the quotation, it is entitled to the carry-over from its component operating company\u2019s unused excess profits credit\u201d, 176 F.2d at page 574. \u201cHence we conclude that under the natural interpretation of \u00a7 710, petitioner, who has absorbed the two former corporations, is \u2018the taxpayer\u2019 noW obligated to pay their taxes and entitled to their credits.\u201d 176 F.2d at page 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Respondent herein makes much of the word \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in Sec. 710(c) (3) (B). In Stanton, supra, the court relied on decisions holding that such a resulting corporation was the \u201ctaxpayer\u201d primarily liable for the tax obligations of a component, C. I. R. v. Oswego Falls Corp., 2 Cir., 1934, 71 F.2d 673, 676, and was entitled to its component\u2019s deductions, Koppers Coal Co. v. Com\u2019r, 6 T.C. 1209, 1223, and others relating to the word \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in similar situations. The court also relied upon Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">We hold and Stanton held, that the surviving corporation is the \u201ctaxpayer,\u201d who may use the unused excess profits tax credit of the former corporation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">Petitioner characterizes the Stanton case, supra, as applying the <em>holding </em>of Metropolitan Edison Co. rather than its major premise. <em>A fortiori, </em>the rule would apply with at least equal force in the case of a true statutory merger such as exists in our case. Respondents\u2019 position is in substance an attack on Metropolitan Edison Co. and a direct attack on the correctness of Stanton.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">The court in Stanton was not impressed by the merger argument. It said, \u201cmore properly we must regard the \u2018resulting corporation\u2019 as the union of component corporations into an all-embracing whole which absorbs the rights and privileges, as well as the obligations, of its constituents.\u201d 176 F.2d at page 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">We think that whether or not there was a true statutory merger and whether the identity of the old corporation continued in the surviving corporation, is a question of state law. This was the approach in Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, 306 U.S. at page 527, 59 S.Ct. 634, in Jones v. Noble Drilling Co., 10 Cir., 1943, 135 F.2d 721, at page 724, in American Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. C. I. R., 2 Cir., 1936, 85 F.2d 527, 531, and in Pennsylvania Co. for In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>surances on Lives and Granting Annuities v. C. I. R., 3 Cir., 1935, 75 F.2d 719, 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">We do not doubt that a state law in conflict with a federal tax statute would not control, see Stanton Brewery, supra, 176 F.2d note 1, at page 575, but we are equally sure that state law controls in determining what state law has created, and in supplying foundation material in many tax situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">If state law controls in determining the character and content of the continuing corporation on a merger, then under the major premise, or the <em>a fortiori </em>holding of Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, Valley continued as an integral part of Gallo. If state law does not control as to the character and content of the continuing corporation, and there was not a true merger of Gallo and Valley, in any event Valley was \u201cdrowned\u201d in Gallo, Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, and Gallo, the surviving corporation, was the \u201ctaxpayer,\u201d and could use the credit, which belonged to a part of Gallo. Stanton, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Bond Discount and Expense v. Unused Excess Profit Tax Credit</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, involved unamortized bond discount and expense. Stanton Brewery, Inc., v. C. I. R., supra, and the case at bar involved loss carry-forward of unused excess profit tax credits. Deductions are \u201ca matter of legislative grace and * * * the burden of clearly showing the right to the claimed deduction is on the taxpayer\u201d, Interstate Transit Lines v. Commissioner, 1943, 319 U.S. 590, 593, 63 S.Ct. 1279, 1281, 87 L.Ed. 1607. They are also personal to the taxpayer and \u201cnot transferable to or usable by another\u201d, New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, supra, 292 U.S. at page 440, 54 S.Ct. at page 790. Allowance of bond discount and expense is not specifically provided for but is apparently based on Sec. 23 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23, providing for deduction of expense and losses, fortified by court decisions. Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, and cases cited in 306 U.S. note 9, at page 526, 59 S.Ct. note 9, at page 637.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Provision for deduction of loss carry-forward in computing net income is found in Sec. 23(s) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 23(s), and provisions for the deduction of the unused excess profits tax credit in computing adjusted excess profits'net income appear in Sec. 710(b) (3) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 710(b) (3). We fail to see a distinction which makes one a deduction by legislative grace, and not the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">Respondent argues that Stanton, supra, is based on a fiction and that deductions may not be based on fictions. Possibly the concept that the former corporation continues its identity and is an integral part of the successor is a fiction. (The so-called major premise in Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra.) Possibly, the concept that the earlier corporation is \u201cdrowned\u201d in the successor is a fiction, Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, 306 U.S. at page 529, 59 S.Ct. 634. But the successor corporation was allowed the deduction of the \u201cdrowned\u201d corporation. If the fiction can support a bond expense deduction, it can bear the weight of an unused excess profits tax credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">5,</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">Legislative Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b755-15\">Respondent raises the question of legislative intent with respect to Sec. 710 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code and says that.if Congress had intended the result herein, it would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">Respondent points to Part II, Supplement A, Sections 740-744, of subchapter E of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, respecting the computation of excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>profits credit based on the income of a so called \u201cacquiring\u201d corporation. These sections were added by the Act of October 8, 1940, C. 757, Title II, Sec. 201, 54 Stat. 991, as later amended, 26 U.S. C.A.1952 Ed. \u00a7\u00a7 740-744. Sec. 710 of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. 1952 Ed. \u00a7 710, was added by the same Act, Oct. 8,1940, c. 757, Title II, Sec. 201, 54 Stat. 975. Passed at the same time by Congress, they must be considered as part of the whole. Sections 740-744 included many situations entirely different from merger or from \u201cdrowning\u201d of a prior corporation in a survivor. The sections were necessary for such other situations hut it does not follow that the sections detracted from the express provisions of Sec. 710(c) for unused excess profits credit carry-over.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The same contention was advanced and rejected in Stanton Brewery, Inc., v. C. I. R., supra, 176 F.2d at pages 576-577.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Moreover, New Colonial Ice Co. v. Commissioner, supra, with its intimation that in a merger situation the result would be different, and Helvering v. Metropolitan Edison Co., decided in 1934 and 1939 respectively, were in the official reports when in 1940 Congress enacted Sec. 710 on October 8, 1.940. Section 710 must be read in the light of these decisions, United States v. Merriam, 1923, 263 U.S. 179, 187, 44 S.Ct. 69, 68 L.Ed. 240. Legislative construction is an aid to statutory interpretation, Alaska Steamship Co. v. United States, 1933, 290 U.S. 256, 54 S.Ct. 159, 78 L.Ed. 302; First National Bank in St. Louis v. State of Missouri, 1924, 263 U.S. 640, 658, 44 S.Ct. 213, 68 L.Ed. 486.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Nor does Section 1 of the Act of July 15, 1947, c. 249, 61 Stat. 324, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 122 note, show Congressional intent that Sec. 710, should be applied differently from the way in which we have applied it. By the statute, Congress retroactively granted relief to certain railroad corporations by way of net operating loss carry-over and excess profits credit carry-over, from a predecessor corporation. The statute gave this benefit to a railroad corporation which acquired property from another railroad corporation \u201cin a receivership proceeding, or in a proceeding under section 77 of the National Bankruptcy Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">Such a new corporation would not result from merger under state law nor would there be \u201cdrowned\u201d in it, a predecessor. Without the 1947 statute it could clearly not claim the benefits of Sec. 710. The House Report No. 624, 80th Congress, 1st Session, 1947 U.S. Code Cong.Service, p. 1297, states, \u201cUnder existing law * * * The reorganized corporation is regarded as a different taxpayer from the old corporation.\u201d Like Stanton Brewery, Inc., v. C. I. R., supra, which considered the same contention, we think any Congressional intent revealed by the statute \u201csuggests the opposite conclusion\u201d, 176 F.2d at page 577, from respondent\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">6.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">Repeal of the Excess Profits Tax</p>\n<p id=\"b756-17\">The Revenue Act of 1945, c. 453, 59 Stat. 556, Sec. 122, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, repealed the excess profits tax. We are not in accord with respondent\u2019s reading of that Section. He states \u201cThe excess profits tax statutes were repealed as of December 31, 1945, except for the computation during the calendar year 1946, of an excess profit credit which could be carried <em>back </em>to prior years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-18\">Although subd. (a) of Sec. 122 provided generally that \u201cthe provision of subchapter E of chapter 2\u201d Secs. 710-740, U.S.C.A. Title 26 \u201cshall not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>any taxable year beginning after December 31,1945\u201d, subdivision (b) of Sec. 122 provided the subchapter \u201cshall remain in force for the purpose of the determination of the taxes imposed by such subchapter for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1946\u201d subject to subd. (c) of Sec. 122 and Sec. 131 of the Revenue Act of 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Subd. (c) of Sec. 122 added to the end of Sec. 710(c) (2) (definition of unused excess profits credit), the following sentence, \u201c \u2018There shall be no unused excess profits credit for a taxable year beginning after <em>December SI, 1946. </em>The unused excess profits credit for a taxable year beginning in 1946 and ending in 1947 shall be an amount which is such part of the unused excess profits credit determined under the preceding provisions of this paragraph as the number of days in such taxable year prior to January 1, 1947, is of the total number of days in such taxable year.\u2019 \u201d [Emphasis added]. There was no apportionment provided for such a credit in a tax year beginning in 1945 and ending in 1946, (like Gallo\u2019s or Valley\u2019s herein).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Sec. 131 of the Revenue Act of 1945 provided,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">\u201c\u00a7 131. Fiscal Year Taxpayers</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agy-dedup-0\">\u201c(a) Income taxes. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-7\">\u201c(b) Excess profits tax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">\u201c(1) In general. Section 710(a) (imposing the excess profits tax) is amended by inserting at the end thereof the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">\u201c \u2018(7) Taxable years beginning in 1945 and ending in 1946. In the case of a taxable year beginning in 1945 and ending in 1946, the tax shall be an amount equal to that portion of a tentative tax, computed as if the law applicable to taxable years beginning on January 1, 1945, were applicable to such taxable year, which the number of days in such taxable year prior to January 1, 1946, bears to the total number of days in such taxable year.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Thus, Sec. 131 of the Revenue Act of 1945, provides how the <em>excess profits tax </em>for a year beginning in 1945 and ending in 1946, should be apportioned. [Gallo\u2019s year began May 1, 1945, and ended April 30, 1946.] Sec. 122 of the 1945 Act provides for an <em>unused excess profits credit </em>for taxable years beginning before December 31, 1946. [Gallo\u2019s year and Valley\u2019s year in question each began before December 31, 1946.]</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">Gallo was not prohibited by the repeal of the Excess Profits Tax, from applying Valley\u2019s unused profits credit from its last taxable year, to Gallo\u2019s taxable year beginning May 1, 1945 and ending April 30, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">7.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">The Taxable Years of Gallo and Valley</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">Respondent argues that Valley could not have carried over its unused excess profits credit because after December 19, 1945 it had no succeeding year to which to carry it. If Valley was dissolved on December 19, 1945, respondent would be correct. But respondent is merely rearguing the problem in different words.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">After December 19, 1945, Valley\u2019s assets and profit producing capital was all in Gallo. Gallo had an excess profits tax for the year beginning May 1, 1945 and ending April 30, 1946 which tax was brought about in part by Valley\u2019s profit producing assets. This tax would be computed under Sec. 710 of the Revenue Act of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 710, and under Sections 122 and 131 of the Revenue Act of 1945 c. 453, 59 Stat. 556, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-17\">(1) Ascertain Gallo\u2019s entire adjusted excess profits net income for the full taxable year ending April 30,1946, under Sec. 710(a) Revenue Code of 1939;</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">(2) Apply Valley\u2019s unused excess profits credit in reduction pursuant to Sec. 710(b) and (c) of the Revenue Code of 1939 as amended by Sec. 122 of the Revenue Act of 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-19\">(3) Compute Gallo\u2019s excess profit tax for the full taxable year ending April 30, 1946 under Sec. 710 of the Revenue Code of 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>(4) Under Sec. 131(b) \" (1) of the Revenue Act of 1945, compute that portion of the tax bearing the ratio that the number of days of the taxable year prior to January 1, 1946 bear to the number of days of the taxable year.'</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Thus, there were 245 days in Gallo\u2019s taxable year prior to January 1, 1946. Gallo would owe 245/365 of the tax first computed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Since Gallo was paying tax on income produced in part by Valley\u2019s assets, we see nothing unfair or shocking about the result we reach. Gallo\u2019s adjusted excess profits tax income was in excess of $589,-000. 00. On the assumption that this income was earned evenly throughout the year, 132/365 of this or $213,000.00 was earned with Gallo\u2019s and Valley\u2019s assets after December 19, 1945.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Valley credit, Gallo seeks to use is $60,664.83.</p>\n<p id=\"AnN\">Finally, respondent would distinguish the Stanton case in that there the two corporations, were each on a calendar basis arid the carry-overs from 1940 \u00bfrid 1941 were used in 1942; while here Valley\u2019s last taxabl\u00e9 year was frohi January 1, 1945 to December 18, 1945, and Gallo\u2019s year was from May 1, 1945 to April 30, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">Congress has not said that Sec. 710 ' only applies where both corporations are on a <em>calendar </em>year. Respondent\u2019s view would unequally apply the law and give benefits t\u00f3 a taxpayer, where by chance each corporation had a calendar year and deny benefits if taxpayer\u2019s \" fiscal year overlapped one day on the ending taxable year of the merged corporation.'</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">It seems clear, that since Valley is now an integral part of Gallo, that Gallo\u2019s year ending April'30, 1946 is the next succeeding year to Valley\u2019s old year ending December 18, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">As to problems of this sort arising in the future, Congress has provided in Sec. 381(c) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 381(c) (1) \u201cThe taxable year of the acquiring corporation to which the net operating loss carryovers of the distributor or transferor corporation are first carried shall be the first taxable year ending after the date of a distribution or transfer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">We conclude that Gallo is entitled to the carry-over of the unused excess profits tax credit of its now component part, Valley, against Gallo\u2019s excess profits tax of its taxable year ending April 30, 1946; and that the Tax Court was in error in not so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-17\">The judgment of the Tax Court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-26\"> Now West\u2019s Ann.Corp.Code, \u00a7\u00a7 4100-4117.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\">. Gallo makes its computations on the basis of the notice of deficiency, the stipulation of facts and the opinion of the tax court. We compute $596,517.74. The exact amount is' not pertinent to this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\">, Internal Revenue Code of 1939:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANT\">\u201cChapter 2 \u2014 Additional Income Taxes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"apt-dedup-0\">* * 3 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A45\">\u201cSubchapter E \u2014 Excess Profits Tax</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_yu\">\u201cPart I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APn\">710 [as added by See. 201, Second Revenue Act of 1940, c. 757, 54 Stat. 974].
