The questions raised by the appeal resolve themselves into one question, viz., whether the plaintiff has exercised due diligence to protect its rights under the Fair Trade Act, or whether it is precluded from relying on the act by reason of failure to use due diligence in that regard and in its dealings with wholesalers and distributors. We think that the evidence in the case clearly supports the decision of the trial judge as set forth in his opinion which is adopted as the opinion of this court. See General Electric Company v. Home Utilities Company, 131 F.Supp. 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
