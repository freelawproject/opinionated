L. R. B. v. Red Rock Co., 5 Cir., 187 F.2d 76, J. A. Bentley Lumber Co. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 180 F.2d 641, and N. L. R. B. v. Southern Pine Elec. Co-op, 5 Cir., 218 F.2d 824, correctly points out that these objections are without merit. In answer to objection 3, the board, citing N. L. R. B. v. Taormina, 5 Cir., 207 F.2d 251, and N. L. R. B. v. Sanson Hosiery Mills, 5 Cir., 195 F.2d 350, points, as completely sustaining it, to the facts of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-18\">We agree with the board that none of respondent\u2019s objections are well taken and that its order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
