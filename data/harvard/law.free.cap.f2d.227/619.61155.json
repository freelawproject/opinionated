The second count is brought under the general maritime law relating to compensation to a seaman for injuries resulting from the unseaworthiness of the vessel. The third count is for maintenance and cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">- Among the alleged acts of negligence on the part of. the defendant in the first count are: (1) failure to provide and maintain a reasonably safe place in which to work, (2) failure to provide and maintain adequate and proper working tools for the plaintiff to work with and (3) failure to provide the plaintiff with an adequate number of fellow employees to assist, the plaintiff in the course of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">In the second count the plaintiff alleges his injuries were due to and resulted from the unseaworthy condition of the \u201cAfrican Endeavor\u201d in the following respects among Others:' (1) lack of a reasonably safe place in which to work, (2) lack of adequate and proper \u2022 working tools for the plaintiff to work with and (3) lack of an adequate number'of employees to assist the plaintiff in the course of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">The plaintiff, Joseph E. Nunes, an engine maintenance man on the defendant\u2019s vessel, \u201cAfrican Endeavor\u201d, testified that when that vessel was in the harbor of Durban, South Africa, on October 5, 1951, he was injured under the following circumstances. Upon, reporting for duty on the morning of October 5, 1951, he received orders from the engineer, who was his superior, to remove a valve located beneath the floor of the fire room. This floor consisted of removable rectangular steel plates, some of which were held in position by screws and others merely resting in position, readily removable by means of a handle. The latter plates were called \u201cmanholes\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">About <em>2Yz or </em>3 feet below the fire room floor were located the bilges, covered with water and oil and slippery under foot. Between the bilges and the floor above were located various pipes, upon one of which was mounted the valve which the plaintiff was directed to remove.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">The plaintiff inspected the valve and found it to be corroded and rusted on one side.. He reported this fact to the engineer who sent down a cadet to help with the job. The plaintiff and the cadet attempted to remove the plate immediately over the valve but the screws were found to be frozen. Plaintiff was then directed to get the \u201cmanhole\u201d off and to commence working on the valve from underneath the fireroom floor. He did so, but found some of the nuts so rusted that the wrenches were inadequate to remove them. He then proceeded to work with hammer and chisel in an effort to cut off the rusted nuts. At this juncture the cadet was taken off the job by the engineer, ostensibly only for' the time being, but in point of fact he never did return. At some stage of the work before the cadet was. taken away \u2014 it is not clear precisely when \u2014 plaintiff had attempted to find a \u201cburner\u201d to cut off the rusty nuts. This man could not be found and plaintiff was ordered to go ahead and get the job done.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">After the cadet left, plaintiff succeeded in cutting off the two remaining'bolts, btit the valve remained frozen. The engineer told him to- try wedges, but they were in a rough unworkable condition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>When he. reported this, plaintiff was instructed to grind the wedges down. He did so, but they proved too soft and would not do the job. Plaintiff was then told by the engineer to use a valve spreader, but it proved to be too large and no valve spreader of the proper size was available. Plaintiff was then directed to try chisels. He asked for the cadet and was told that the cadet was busy elsewhere but would be down later.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The chisels didn\u2019t help. By this time the engineer \u201cwas excited\u201d. Plaintiff got a heavier hammer and began tapping the valve. He was leaning over a small 2-inch pipe on his stomach and one leg was straddling another pipe. The toe of his left foot was on the tank top. With his free left hand plaintiff attempted to hold the valve in order to protect certain small pipes below. Plaintiff testified: \u201cThe valve had broke loose and let go. Well, I held it, and the weight of it, and the oil on the floor, pulled me forward, and my foot slipped and I banged my head\u201d against an angle iron that supported the deck plates.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">In attempting to decide whether there was introduced sufficient evidence of causal negligence under count one, and unseaworthiness under count two, this court must be \u201c * * * concerned solely with whether the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff, and reasonable inference to be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, made out a prima facie case allowing the plaintiff to have a jury pass upon his cause of action.\u201d Gold v. Groves, 3 Cir., 1950, 182 F.2d 767, 769, 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Putting to one side, for the moment, a consideration of the legal effect of the testimony relating to the plaintiff\u2019s failure to use the wooden block which was available, we believe that there was sufficient evidence to take this case to the jury on counts one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">We find support for our view that there was sufficient evidence of negligence to go to the jury on count one in a strikingly similar case, Jacob v. City of New York, 1942, 315 U.S. 752, 62 S.Ct. 854, 86 L.Ed. 1166. In that case, likewise brought under the Jones Act, the petitioner was serving as water-tender in charge of the fireroom on respondent\u2019s ferryboat operating between Staten and Manhattan Islands. In the course of his duties he was required to change oil strainers about three times weekly. This task involved loosening and tightening six nuts which held the entire assembly in position. Petitioner customarily used an S-shaped end wrench of the proper size which had seen a lot of service and had a lot of play in it. On three separate occasions petitioner asked the chief engineer for a new wrench, the last of these requests being only a few days before the accident. In reply the chief engineer told him to \u201c * * * look in the tool closet and see if there was one in there * * * \u201d but the petitioner\u2019s search was unsuccessful. On the day of the accident, petitioner found no end wrench of proper size, did not know if a Stillson wrench was available, but believed that a monkey wrench was. When he got hurt, petitioner was using the worn, S-shaped end wrench to tighten the nuts after changing the oil strainer. As he began to tighten the fifth nut, the wrench slipped causing him to fall eighteen inches to a catwalk below, and in the course of his fall he struck and injured his side against an adjacent angle iron.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">The court said, 315 U.S. at pages 755, 756, 62 S.Ct. at page 855:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">\u201c-x- -x- * The salient points of petitioner\u2019s testimony, summarized above, made a sufficient showing to allow the jury to consider the issue of respondent\u2019s negligence. The wrench petitioner was using had become defective for the purpose for which it was designed. After discovering that defect petitioner made three requests to the proper person, the chief engineer, for a new wrench. The first of those requests was about three weeks prior to the accident, the last but two or three days before it occurred. * * * While the best tool for doing the work was a straight end wrench of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the proper size, petitioner had access to a monkey wrench which \u2018probably\u2019 could be used on any nut. We think these facts entitled petitioner to have the jury consider whether his injury was caused by any \u2018defect or insufficiency, due to its (respondent\u2019s) negligence, in its * * * appliances'. That is to say, it was for the jury to decide whether a monkey wrench was a reasonably safe and suitable tool for petitioner\u2019s work, whether respondent\u2019s failure, although it had at least two days\u2019 and possibly three weeks\u2019 notice of the defect, to supply petitioner with a new wrench amounted to negligence on its part, and whether respondent, after it had knowledge of the defect, might not haye reasonably foreseen the possibility of resulting harm if it allowed the worn wrench to remain in use. Cf. Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra [305 U.S. 424, 59 S.Ct. 262, 83 L.Ed. 265]. Without doubt the case is close and a jury might find either way. But that is no reason for a court to usurp the function of the jury. We are satisfied that a due respect for the statutory guaranty of the right of jury trial, with its resulting benefits, requires the submission of this case to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We believe that if the plaintiff in the Jacob case was entitled to go to the jury on the basis of those facts involving the voluntary use of one defective wrench when other relatively suitable tools were available, then certainly the plaintiff in the instant case should, a fortiori, reach the jury on the basis of testimony that he was ordered to proceed with the task of removing the valve despite the absence of the \u201cburner\u201d, the softness of the wedges, the inappropriate size of the valve spreader, and under the additional handicap that his assistant was taken from him at the very time when the defects in the tools and the difficulty of the job were being brought increasingly to the attention of his superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Although the Jacob case is not identical in all respects with the instant case, there is nevertheless an extremely close factual approximation which convinces us that the plaintiff Nunes has been wrongfully deprived of his right to a jury trial \u2014 if we assume, for the time being, that he did not caus\u00e9 his own injury by failing to utilize the available wooden block.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">With respect to count two, it seems to us that the same testimony relating to the defectiveness or inadequacy of the various tools which he was instructed by his superior to employ is sufficient to take this case to the jury on the question of unseaworthiness. In The Tawmie, 5 Cir., 1936, 80 F.2d 792, 793, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">\u201cThough shipowners are held to a strict degree of diligence, seaworthiness does not require absolute perfection, nor are owners held to the duty of furnishing appliances having the highest known degree of safety. It is sufficient if the equipment be that which is reasonably fit and safe for its purpose, and reasonably adequate to the place and occasion where used by direction of the owners. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">See Doucette v. Vincent, 1 Cir., 1952, 194 F.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">We think that the plaintiff has introduced testimony which might permit a jury to decide that the defendant has not met this standard of seaworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">We believe, therefore, that the defect, if any, in plaintiff\u2019s presentation of evidence is not that there is insufficient evidence to justify a favorable verdict, but rather that there may be too much evidence \u2014 that is, plaintiff\u2019s testimony may have demonstrated, as a matter of law, that his own conduct was the proximate cause of his injury. In this connection plaintiff\u2019s failure to use the wooden block becomes important. l)f his failure to thus support the valve was the proximate cause of the injury, then of course plaintiff cannot recover on either count since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the defendant\u2019s negligence and the unseaworthiness of its vessel, assuming that they existed, would be non-operative and completely irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">That the trial judge took this view of the case is made clear to us by his comment in discussing with counsel the motion for a directed verdict, page 318 of the record appendix: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t plenty of room for him in one sense but there was plently of room for him to put a wooden block under there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">We will assume, without so deciding, that if plaintiff could have used the wooden block in support of the valve, his failure to do so constituted the proximate cause of his own injury. We do not agree, however, that it necessarily follows that the directed verdict was proper, since we find no clear and convincing evidence in this case that the block could have been successfully employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">As we have said, in testing the propriety of the directed verdict, plaintiff is entitled to all \u201creasonable inferences\u201d to be drawn from the testimony \u201cin the light most favorable to the plaintiff\u201d. Gold v. Groves, supra [182 F.2d 769]. Approaching the ease from this point of view, the important question is this: Is there any evidence in this case that the physical environment of the valve was such that this particular block could have been fitted into proper supporting position? It seems to us that the answer to this question must be in the negative unless the plaintiff\u2019s assent to the following statement constitutes such evidence: \u201cIt\u2019s what you would expect a competent, experienced man to do if he were really trying to do his job right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AppT\">Defendant admits in its brief that \u201cthere is a void in the evidence concerning the relative position of all fixed objects,\u201d and we believe that the plaintiff\u2019s assent to the above statement, when considered together with preceding testimony and in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, does not supply the missing evidence. Plaintiff testified in cross examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it an established practice on the part of a maintenance man in cases of that nature to put a block of wood underneath it? A. I don\u2019t know whether the pipes were even or not if they\u2019re at an angle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-13\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t try it? A. No, sir, 1 didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-14\">\u201cQ. It never occurred to you? A. It may have and I may not have been able to do it. I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-15\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t remember? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-16\">\u201cQ. Well, now yesterday you told us about the dimensions in there. Have you had any loss of memory about the dimensions in there since yesterday? A. I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-17\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t attempt to put a block of wood under the valve to hold it in place when you were removing it? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-18\">\u201cQ. I\u2019m sure that in your many years of experience that you have done that in the past, haven\u2019t you? A. I have done it occasionally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-19\">\u201cQ. It\u2019s what you would expect a competent, experienced man to do if he were really trying to do his job right, isn\u2019t it? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-20\">It seems to us, putting the interpretation most favorable to plaintiff upon this testimony, as we must, that he was responding here not to a specific question relating to this particular case, but rather to a general hypothetical situation as to how such valves should ordinarily be removed. We think that the plaintiff, when he assented to the proposition that \u201cIt\u2019s what you would expect a competent, experienced man to do if he were really trying to do his job right * * * \u201d must, for present purposes at least, be regarded as agreeing only that a competent, experienced man would do it <em>whenever he could. </em>In other words, we think the plaintiff clearly admitted that he did not <em>try </em>to use the block, and that he should have tried to use the block, but we find nothing which compels us to interpret his remarks as meaning that if he had tried to use the block, the immediate physical environment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>valve was such that it would have.been possible for him to.do so. .</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">If this view of plaintiff\u2019s testimony is the proper one* then the \u201cvoid in the evidence concerning the relative position of all fixed objects\u201d remains unfilled, and there is no evidence in the case that this block could have been successfully employed. Accordingly, we find nothing to support the view that plaintiff\u2019s failure to use the block was the proximate cause of his injury. For this reason we believe that the directed verdict was improper with respect to counts one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On the question of maintenance we find no reason to disturb the decision of- the trial court'.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the verdict is set aside as to counts one and two and the case is remanded for a new trial on said counts. The judgment on count three is affirmed. The appellant recovers costs on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
