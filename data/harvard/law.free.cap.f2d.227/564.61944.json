Seattle, a city in that state, advertised for bids for fire hose of the quality here involved. Dealer enquired of the Manufacturer, which made such fire hose, whether it would sell it to Dealer and deliver it to Seattle, and the price thereof. The manufacturer agreed to deliver its hose to Seattle and fixed the price to be paid by Dealer. The Dealer then determined its price for its sale of the hose to Seattle, made its bid to Seattle for that amount and Seattle accepted Dealer\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Thereafter Manufacturer delivered the hose to Seattle on April 8, 1952, and Dealer paid Manufacturer the $5,618.88. After a delay until May 27, 1952, Seattle claimed some of the hose was defective when delivered to it and gave it to the Dealer in Seattle. Later Seattle claimed other hose was defective and on October 27, 1952, gave all the rest of the hose to Dealer in Seattle, refusing to pay it any of its bid price. Dealer then returned all the hose to Manufacturer. The latter had it inspected by its own officials and experts of an independent organization, The Underwriter\u2019s Laboratory. They decided that the damage was caused by external injury rather than latent defects in its structure. Manufacturer advised Dealer that the hose, being in good condition when delivered to Seattle, it was not liable to Dealer to return the purchase price. The suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">We agree with the District Court that the burden of proof is on the Dealer, the counter-claimant, to show (a) that the hose was not in good condition when delivered to Seattle and if in good condition (b) that there was an agreement for a rescission of the sale from Manufacturer to Dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">The case was decided upon exhibits and depositions. On both the issues the evidence was conflicting and we are unable to say that on either it was so overwhelming in favor of Dealer that the court erred in deciding against it. Manufacturer\u2019s evidence is that before delivery it tested the hose by water pressure and that it satisfied the requirements for effective use. Further, photographs showed bruises to the hose couplings caused after delivery and the testimony of laboratory experts showed that the hose had been injured externally. The testimony of the Seattle experts was that the hose was of a defective structure. We cannot say that the District Court\u2019s decision is clearly erroneous. Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 52(a), 28 U.S. C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-15\">Likewise with regard to Dealer\u2019s claim that Manufacturer agreed to rescind the sales agreement and return to Dealer its purchase price. Dealer\u2019s manager, Corbett, testified that he made such an agreement verbally in a telephone con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>versation with Smith, the manager of Manufacturer. Smith denies this. With the burden of proof on Dealer, we cannot say here was manifest error.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-16\">. The suit was brought by the manufacturer for $3,387.96 for other goods bought by Dealer. Dealer admitted this liability but counterclaimed for the recovery of the $5,618.88, the purchase price of the hose herein discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
