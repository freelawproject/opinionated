Appellant prays a reversal of that judgment on the ground that the evidence fails to sustain the finding that the mortgage was \u201cfraudulent, fictitious and without consideration\u201d. On this appeal appellant must carry the burden of showing that these findings of fact were clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The testimony of appellant and the bankrupt were not accepted by the referee. According to that testimony, appellant was approached by Brown who desired to borrow $5,000.00 with which to settle, at a discount, the accounts of certain creditors who were \u201con his neck\u201d. The bankrupt offered to secure the loan by a mortgage on certain merchandise together with store fixtures, a good portion of the security being already under pledge for other indebtednesses. After examining the security, appellant agreed to make the loan and a note payable in thirty days was executed along with the mortgage which latter was promptly recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The money was delivered in cash by appellant to the bankrupt in the office of an attorney who was acting for both parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant stated that he obtained the cash money by borrowing $2,-600.00 from his brother and putting up the remaining $2,400.00 from funds he was keeping at his home. He did not use any portion of $7,000.00 he stated he had in a \u201csecret hiding place\u201d, which developed, upon pressure from the referee, to be a locked tool chest at the home of his son in another state. He moved that money to his brother\u2019s home a few days after the loan was made. The brother and the son were not produced as witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">When the bankrupt did not respond to his several demands for payment, appellant, on June 26, began foreclosure proceedings which, with the aid of a waiver by the bankrupt of certain time factors, resulted in a sale of the mortgaged property. Promptly thereafter appellant joined in an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against Brown, averring that his claim exceeded the value of the security by $400.00. The claim he filed against the bankrupt after adjudication represented the principal of $5,000.00 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">The foregoing facts were testified to by appellant and the bankrupt and, if the referee had believed them, would necessarily have resulted in a finding in appellant\u2019s favor. But the referee did not believe them. He entered his findings of fact<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the effect that appellant did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>not have $5,000.00 to lend, that the loan was not bona fide but was a mere fiction, and that the mortgage and all actions in connection with it were part of a conspiracy between appellant and the bankrupt to defraud the creditors of the latter. These findings and conclusions by the referee rejecting the appellant's claim were adopted by the District Court, and appellant\u2019s petition for review was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-20\">Both the referee and the court below adverted to certain Georgia statutes respecting proof of fraud which tend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>mitigate the strict requirements of proof at common law where fraud is alleged;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and appellee relies upon the broad discretion lodged in the fact-finder by other Georgia statutes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It was proper that these statutory policies should be thus influential.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We have read the evidence carefully and are unable to say that these findings are clearly erroneous. No good purpose will be served by enumerating or cataloging the evidence which the referee and the Court below accepted as sufficient to overturn the testimony of the appellant and the bankrupt. The referee had a right to reject their evidence if, after observing the witnesses as they testified, their manner on the stand, their candor or evasiveness, the conflicts and inconsistencies in their testimony, weighed in the balance with the other countervailing facts and circumstances, he found what they said to be highly improbable or inherently unbelievable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The referee was persuaded to some extent by a transaction between the bankrupt and one Smith the day following the giving of the mortgage to appellant. The bankrupt then executed a note and mortgage in the sum of $5,600.00 which Smith recorded but which he virtually repudiated at the trial as spurious. The referee concluded that the two similar transactions were part of a well-laid scheme of the bankrupt to defraud his creditors. This evidence was properly considered by the referee in reaching his conclusion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">Every trier of the facts forms his conclusions not only from what the witnesses before him say, but their appearance when they say it. The cold printed page does not preserve this important ingredient of proof, and we are relatively unable to appraise its cogency. Except in plain cases it is the duty of a court denied that vantage point to accept the findings of the one who occupied it \u2014 in this case, the referee. The court below did accept and approve them, and we are unable to say that they were clearly erroneous. The judgment is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"AXu\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\">. Brown will sometimes be referred to herein as the bankrupt, but his adjudication as such followed by three months the giving of the mortgage.

The following are excerpts from his findings and conclusions: \u201cThe Court had the opportunity of observing Clifford H. Brown, P. G. Griffin and E. Mace Smith, as witnesses, when they testified and observed their manner on the witness stand, and after a careful consideration of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>evidence, I make the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A58\">\u201c1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZX\">\u201cThat P. G. Grifiin did not have $5,-000.00 and did not make any loan of $5,-000.00 that was a bona\u2018fide loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8z\">\u201c2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"anm-dedup-0\">\u201cClifford H. Brown owes around $125,-000.00 and has not paid any creditors anything; suits were being pressed against him and Brown conceived the idea of giving a lien to two of his friends, P. G. Griffin and E. Mace Smith, with the view of saving all of his personal property consisting of his two stocks of goods which only had two prior mortgages for around $3500.00, and to save the fixtures and the motel furnishings and fixtures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A05\">*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"azx-dedup-0\">\u201c5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai7\">\u201cI find that Brown, when the Griffin mortgage was foreclosed, requested the sheriff to not close the store but to let him keep the same open, and he acknowledged service for John T. Ferguson, who was his lawyer and who was representing Griffin in the foreclosure, in which he waived the two day notice in order that an order in State Court could be had for the sale of the fixtures and stocks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFv\">\u201c6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab3\">\u201cI find that he asked the sheriff how he was going to advertise the property and said the sheriff told him, one time on a bulletin board and one time on a tree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaj\">\u201c7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afg-dedup-0\">\u201cI find that John T. Ferguson, representing Griffin, filed an involuntary petition against Brown, who was formerly his client, and that he, John T. Ferguson, secured an acknowledgment of service from said Brown and that he, John T. Ferguson, his attorney, prepared the schedules for Brown which were filed with the Clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVB\">\u201c8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvU\">\u201cI find that the mortgage that was given by Brown was given to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors, and I further find that there was no valid loan made to the said Brown, as Griffin did not have the money available to lend to said Brown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"auo-dedup-0\">*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyS5\">\u201cConclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVS\">\u201cFrom hearing the witnesses testify and considering the reasonableness and unreasonableness of their testimony, the Court makes the following conclusions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aax-dedup-0\">\u201c(a) That the bankrupt, Clifford H. Brown, for some time prior to his bankruptcy, was arranging his business affairs so as to protect himself against his creditors to the end that he would be able to settle with them either for a nominal amount or by the execution of fictitious liens for property sold and then acquire it so that he could get' rid of his debts and at the same time continue to operate his said business free from any obligations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbX\">\u201cThat P. G. Grifiin was a party to this arrangement and conspired with the bankrupt to accomplish the end above mentioned; that Griffin did not have the cash to have furnished Clifford H. Brown with the $500.00 [$5,000.00] in question; that the explanation of Griffin as to where he kept his money and how he acquired it was not such that can be accepted by the Court; he made no deposit of any money in the bank where he had a regular cheeking account and in which he at no time had more than $500.-00 on deposit, yet he claims to have had hidden in a tool chest in Tallahassee the sum of $7,000.00 which was no part of the $5,000.00 alleged to have been furnished to Brown; this contention was not supported by any corroborating evidence, such as the testimony of his son. It is significant that this transaction did not appear from the books of the bankrupt, although the bankrupt testified that he kept records and that this particular transaction was recorded there. All of these facts, taken with the E. Mace Smith transaction, which is now conceded to be fraud, leads to the only possible conclusion that the P. G. Griffin note and mortgage for $500.00 [$5,000.00] are fictitious and void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACf\">*******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARj\">\u201cJudgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj1\">\u201cIt is the judgment of the Court, therefore, that the mortgage given by Clifford H. Brown to P. G. Griffin is without consideration and made for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding the creditors\u2019 of Clifford H. Brown, it is, therefore, void.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">. e.g. Georgia Code Annotated, Title 37, Sec. 76, provides: \u201cPresumption; slight circumstances sometimes sufficient.\u2014 Fraud may not be presumed, but, being in itself subtle, slight circumstances may be sufficient to carry conviction of its existence.\u201d And cf.
