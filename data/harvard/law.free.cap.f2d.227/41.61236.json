The plaintiffs arrived in the United States in August or October, 1952. They claimed and were denied admission as citizens of the United States. Section 503 of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1171, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed.) \u00a7 903, provides that \u201cif any person who claims a right or privilege as a national of the United States is denied such right or privilege * * such person, regardless of whether he is within the United States or abroad, may institute an action * * * for a judgment declaring him to be a national of the United States * <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">In 1954 the plaintiffs filed separate complaints for judgments declaring them to be citizens of the United States, and asked that the defendants be restrained from interfering with their rights as citizens. In each case the District Court denied a preliminary injunction on the ground that it was \u201cwithout jurisdiction to hear plaintiff\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment.\" These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">In December, 1952, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 et seq., had become effective. Section 403(a) (42), 66 Stat. 280, repeals the Nationality Act of 1940. Section 360(a) of the Act of 1952 provides in effect that if any person \u201cwho is within the United States\u201d claims a right as a national of the United States, and the right is denied upon the ground that he is not a national, he may institute an action for a declaratory judgment, \u201cexcept that no such action may be instituted in any case if the issue of such person\u2019s status as a national of the United States (1) arose by reason of, or in connection with any exclusion proceeding under the provisions of this or any other act,' or (2) is in issue in any such exclusion proceeding.\u201d 66 Stat. 273, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">The question is whether the 1952 Act deprived the plaintiffs of their right under the 1940 Act to have the issue of their citizenship, which had arisen in exclusion proceedings, decided in actions for declaratory judgments. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">The question turns upon the savings clause of the 1952 Act. That clause, \u00a7 405(a), provides that \u201cNothing contained in this Act, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, shall be construed to affect * * * any status, condition, right in process of acquisition, act, thing, liability, obligation, or matter, civil or criminal, done or existing, at the time this Act shall take effect; but as to all such prosecutions, suits, actions, proceedings, statutes, conditions, rights, acts, things, liabilities, obligations, or matters the statutes or parts of statutes repealed by this Act are, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, hereby continued in force and effect. * * <em>* \u201d </em>66 Stat. 280, 8 U.S.C. p. 734 .[8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 note].</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">The general language in this savings clause is broad enough to cover the plaintiffs\u2019 rights, under the 1940 Act, to sue for declaratory judgments. It may be said that the only \u201crights\u201d directly referred to in the savings clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>are rights \u201cin process of acquisition.\u201d But we think this phrase was intended to have a broadening rather than a narrowing effect. Congress can hardly have intended to preserve <em>only </em>rights \u201cin process of acquisition\u201d and cut off rights fully acquired. Moreover, the savings clause is to be liberally interpreted. \u201cThe whole development of this general savings clause * * * manifests a well-established congressional policy not to strip aliens of advantages gained under prior laws. The consistent broadening of the savings provision, particularly in its general terminology, indicates that this policy of preservation was intended to apply to matters both within and without the specific contemplation of Congress.\u201d United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 535, 75 S.Ct. 513, 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The general language in this savings clause operates \u201cunless otherwise specifically provided\u201d in the Act. This exception does not cover this case. Nowhere in the 1952 Act is it \u201cspecifically provided\u201d that if the issue of citizenship has arisen in an exclusion proceeding, a right already accrued under the 1940 Act, to have the issue decided in an action for a declaratory judgment, shall be cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Considered by itself, and apart from the fact that the savings clause is to be liberally interpreted, the reference in \u00a7 360(a) of the Act to exclusion proceedings under \u201cthis or any other act\u201d might perhaps seem to bring the case within the words \u201cotherwise specifically provided.\u201d But specificity is a matter of degree. What may be relatively specific in one context may not be so in another. At several points in the 1952 Act, exceptions to the general principle of the savings clause are so specifically expressed as to make \u00a7 360(a) seem, by comparison, to fall far short of \u201cspecifically\u201d providing an exception. For example, \u00a7 241(d), 66 Stat. 208, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1251(d), enacts that \u201cthe provisions of this section shall be applicable to all aliens belonging to any of the classes enumerated [as deport-able] in subsection (a), notwithstanding * * * that the facts, by reason of which any such alien belongs to any of of the classes enumerated in subsection (a), occurred prior to the date of enactment of this Act.\u201d Section 360(a), on the other hand, merely refers in general terms to an exclusion proceeding under \u201cthis or any other act\u201d and does <em>not </em>add: \u201cnotwithstanding that the exclusion proceeding occurred prior to the enactment of this Act.\u201d Section 313(a), 66 Stat. 240, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424(a), enacts that \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b) [a savings clause regarding petitions for naturalization] no person shall hereafter be naturalized as a citizen of the United States \u2014 (1) who advocates or teaches * * * opposition to all organized government * * and \u00a7 318, 66 Stat. 244, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1429, provides that \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b) * * * no person shall be naturalized against whom there is outstanding a final finding of deportability pursuant to a warrant of arrest * \u25a0 * *.\u201d Section 360(a), on the other hand, does <em>not </em>enact that no action for a declaratory judgment may be instituted \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of section 405(a) * * Section 360(a) does not mention \u00a7 405 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\"> We take \u00a7 360(a) to mean that no right to have the issue of citizenship determined in a suit for a declaratory judgment shall arise in the future, if the issue of citizenship arose in connection with exclusion proceedings. In view of the savings clause, we do not take \u00a7 360 (a) to mean that an existing right to sue for a declaratory judgment shall be cut off.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Our view of the case makes it unnecessary to decide whether the plaintiffs are \u201cwithin the United States\u201d in the sense in which \u00a7 360(a) uses that term. Unless they are, the section does not apply to them at all. Even if they are, it does not bar their present suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">We think the District Court erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
