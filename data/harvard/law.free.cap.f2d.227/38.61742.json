He contends that the necessary intent was not shown and that the exclusion proceedings were defective in other respects. He asks that these proceedings be declared void. The District Court dismissed his complaint on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction because an order of exclusion cannot be reviewed except by habeas corpus. We think the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">If appellant were attacking a deportation order instead of an exclusion order, his right to the review <em>he </em>seeks would be clear. Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 75 S.Ct. 591. We think the principle of that case extends to this one.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The pertinent provisions of the 1952 Act in respect to deportation and in respect to exclusion are substantially similar. Section 242(b) says: \u201cIn any case in which an alien is ordered deported * * * the decision of the Attorney General shall be final * * 66 Stat. 210, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b). Section 236(c) says: \u201cwhere an alien is excluded from admission * * * the decision of- a special inquiry officer shall be final unless reversed on appeal to the Attorney General.\u201d 66 Stat. 200, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1226(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">It is irrelevant that with regard to a \u201cperson who has been issued a certificate of identity under the provisions of subsection (b)\u201d and is \u201cin possession thereof\u201d, \u00a7 360(c) of the Act provides that a \u201cfinal determination by the Attorney General that any such person is not entitled to admission to the United States shall be subject to review by any court of competent jurisdiction in-habeas corpus proceedings and not otherwise.\u201d 66 Stat. 273, 274, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1503(c). Appellant is not \u201cany such person\u201d. It does not appear that he \u201chas been issued\u201d, or has applied for, a certificate of identity under the provisions of subsection (b). It appears that he is not entitled to one, for only certain classes of persons who claim to be nationals of the United States are entitled to certificates, and appellant says he is a citizen of Honduras.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 360(a) of the 1952 Act, 66 Stat. 273, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1503(a), likewise has no application here. It applies only to persons \u201cwithin the United States\u201d who claim \u201ca right or privilege as a national of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-16\">. Although the exclusion case of Tom We Shung v. Brownell, 346 U.S. 906, 74 S. Ct. 237, 98 L.Ed. 405, involved the 1917 Act, and the present case involves the 1952 Act, it is perhaps significant that in Tom We Shung the Supreme Court relied solely on Heikkila, a deportation case. [Heikkila v. Barber, 345 U.S. 229, 73 S.Ct. 603, 97 L.Ed. 972.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A-\">. In Rubinstein v. Brownell, 92 U.S.App. D.C. 328, 331, 206 F.2d 449, 452, a deportation case, we had no occasion to point out that \u00a7 360(c) does not apply to all exclusion cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
