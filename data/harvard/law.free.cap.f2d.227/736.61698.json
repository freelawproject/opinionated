For the judgment appealed from is the judgment of sentence and nothing in the record relevant to that appeal at all impeaches it.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-19\">The judgment is affirmed, without prejudice, however, to the right of the appellant to proceed as he may be, advised by motion to correct or vacate judgment under Section 2255.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
