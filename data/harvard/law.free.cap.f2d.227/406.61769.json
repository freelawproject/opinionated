L. Press, Officer in Charge. The petition was purportedly based on 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1503(c). It alleged, in substance, that appellant had sought admission to the United States as a citizen thereof, and that the Board of Immigration Appeals had ordered him excluded therefrom. However, it did not appear from the petition that appellant had been issued a certificate of identity under the provisions of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1503(b), or that there had been a final determination by the Attorney General that he was not entitled to such admission. It therefore did not appear from the petition that \u00a7 1503(c) was applicable to appellant. Neither did it appear that appellant was in the custody of appellees or either of them. See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2241 et seq. Accordingly, and properly, the petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-18\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
