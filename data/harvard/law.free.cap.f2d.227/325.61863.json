This imprisonment was inquired into by the Maryland courts in Presley v. Warden, 205 Md. 660, 109 A.2d 922, certiorari denied 348 U.S. 955, 75 S.Ct. 445, where the Court of Appeals of Maryland said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-23\">\u201cThis Court has repeatedly stated that the legality of a search and seizure may be raised on appeal but cannot be raised on habeas corpus. Sykes v. Warden, 201 Md. 662, 93 A. 2d 549; Dodson v. Warden, 201 Md. 655, 92 A.2d 754; Presley v. Warden, 201 Md. 660, 92 A.2d 754; Laslo v. Warden, 204 Md. 663, 103 A.2d 342; Barr v. Warden, 200 Md. 657, 90 A.2d 216; nor can the legality of arrest \u2014see Spence v. Warden, 204 Md. 661, 103 A.2d 345; Lewis v. Warden, 203 Md. 676, 100 A.2d 803; Cumberland v. Warden, 205 Md. 646, 109 A.2d 66; nor can his allegations that the police used force and threats to gain incriminating statements from him be raised on habeas corpus \u2014 see State ex rel. Freeland v. Warden, 193 Md. 696, 65 A.2d 886, certiorari denied 338 U.S. 836, 70 S. Ct. 45, 94 L.Ed. 511. See also Goodman v. Warden, 190 Md. 746, 60 A. 2d 527, certiorari denied 335 U.S. 847, 69 S.Ct. 58, 93 L.Ed. 397.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cPetitioner\u2019s contention that he was deprived of counsel was answered, as was his contention of unlawful search and seizure without warrant, in his former petition, Presley v. Warden, 201 Md. 660, 92 A.2d 754. See also Daisey v. Warden, 203 Md. 653, 98 A.2d 99, which states that the petitioner has the burden of showing that for want of the opportunity of counsel,' \u201can ingredient of unfairness operated actively in the process that resulted in his confinement.\u201d \u2019 Martucci v. Warden, 202 Md. 648, 96 A.2d 490, 491; Selby v. Warden, 201 Md. 653, 92 A.2d 756.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"> As the questions which appellant sought to raise by habeas corpus had been adequately considered and properly decided by the courts of the state, the court below was not required to issue the writ. Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 460-465, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469. The appeal from the denial of. the writ is not properly before us, however, for lack of the certificate of probable cause required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
