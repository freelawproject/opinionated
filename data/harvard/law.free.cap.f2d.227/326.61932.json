On redeter-mination the Tax Court held with the taxpayers. The question presented is whether first-year rentals paid the government by respondents in obtaining noncompetitive oil and gas leases are ordinary and necessary business expenses deductible as rentals under \u00a7 23 (a) (1) (A) of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23(a) (1) (A), or whether, as contended by the Commissioner, they constituted capital expenditures recoverable only through depletion deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-24\">In holding that the rentals paid were true rentals, and therefore deductible as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>business expenses, the Tax Court followed its earlier decision in Olen F. Featherstone, 22 T.C. 763, which latter was reviewed and unanimously upheld by the full court. The Tenth Circuit in the cognate case of United States v. Dougan, 214 F.2d 511, reached the same conclusion. We are satisfied that these holdings are correct, and the decision below is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
