Edwards and his wife and Bruce W. Hulbert and his wife, each having a one fourth interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">We now set forth the essential facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">Following protracted negotiations, Century, on <em>March </em>26, 1946, entered into a written contract for the sale of the partnership business, including a leasehold of its business premises, to Kungs-holm Baking Company.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This contract was in the form of a letter addressed by Kungsholm to the copartners of Century, accepted on its face by the four partners. The contract showed that the sale was made upon the basis of the <em>January </em>26, 1946 balance sheet of the firm. It provided that the firm \u201cshall operate\u201d the business for the benefit of the buyers from \u201cJanuary 26, 1946\u201d to the date of consummation of the agreement, which was fixed by the agreement as \u201con or before June 26, 1946\u201d but not thereafter. The contract designated this period as the \u201cBuyer\u2019s Business Period.\u201d It further provided that one half of the net profits of the business from January 26, 1946 to the date of consummation of the agreement, after deducting federal income taxes computed on the profits at the rate of 38 per cent and Indiana gross income taxes, would belong to Kungsholm. The other half of said net profits would constitute a part of the purchase price of the above described leasehold, and would be paid by Kungsholm to Century.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">The agreement related that Kungs-holm intended to sell stock through underwriters for the purpose of raising the money to consummate the purchase, that the underwriting agreement was contingent upon registration and qualification of the stock by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States and under the Blue Sky laws of the various states, and that it was anticipated that this 'would require about 90 days\u2019 time. The agreement provided that, if for any reason such stock was not sold or the underwriting not carried into effect, Century would \u201cretain as liquidated damages and not as a penalty the sum of $7,500 deposited with\u201d it by Kungs-holm, otherwise said \u2022 sum to be credited on the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">By the agreement of March 26, 1946 in paragraph 10 the sellers represented that \u201csince January 26, 1946 no action has been taken outside the ordinary course\u201d of <em>their </em>business. It was also agreed \u201cthat during the period between the date hereof and the date of closing, you\u201d (sellers) \u201cwill operate your business and maintain and care for all assets being sold to us\u201d (Kungsholm) \u201cin a business like manner,\u201d etc. Paragraph 11 of said contract said \u201cIt is agreed that in the event the sale contemplated by this agreement shall not be consummated, we\u201d (Kungsholm) \u201cshall not be responsible for any losses resulting dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>ing the Buyer\u2019s Business Period, and you\u201d (sellers) \u201cshall retain the profits resulting during said period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The Securities and Exchange Commission did not approve Kungsholm\u2019s stock issue. Nevertheless its purchase of the firm business was consummated on June 26, 1946 by a bill of sale, for which Kungsholm issued a check payable to the partners in the amount of $339,755.08 and gave them its note for $100,000 due on or before February 15, 1947. During the Buyer\u2019s Business Period the partners conducted the business and, upon consummation of the sale, partnership withdrawals during that period and direct payment by Kungsholm for other costs incidental to the sale were credited against the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Petitioners in this court submit that, to the extent that the decision(s) of the Tax Court imposes a tax liability against petitioners on $91,220.94 as \u201cordinary income\u201d for the year 1946, it is erroneous and should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The business operated by the sellers during the Buyer\u2019s Business Period and the net profits <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> accruing therefrom were the business and the profits of the sellers. The fact that their agreement required them to deliver that business and those profits to Kungsholm does not detract from the fact that, by use of their own property, the sellers as a firm made profits and that as a matter of law the partners became liable for income taxes on such profits in the year when they accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">In Heiner v. Mellon, 304 U.S. 271, at page 281, 58 S.Ct. 926, at page 931, 82 L.Ed. 1337, speaking of income tax under \u00a7 218(a) of the Revenue Act of 1918, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">\u201cThe tax is thus imposed upon the partner\u2019s proportionate share of the net income of the partnership, and the fact that it may not be currently distributable, whether by agreement of the parties or by operation of law, is not material.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">To the same effect see Harriss v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 143 F.2d 279, 281; Ruprecht v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 39 F. 2d 458, 459 and 47 C.J.S., Internal Revenue, \u00a7 116, p. 246. In Scherf v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 5 Cir., 161 F.2d 495, at page 497, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-12\">\u201cEach partner as an individual pays taxes on his distributive share of the net income from the business whether distributed or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">Such share is returnable as ordinary income. Johnston v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 86 F.2d 732, 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">If losses had been sustained, under the general law of partnership the partners would have been chargeable pro rata with such losses, and paragraph 11 of the agreement is not inconsistent with this rule of law. For two reasons, it was to the self-interest of the partners to so operate the business during the period in question that it would profit. First, as a matter of law that profit belonged to them (although they had contracted to pay part of it to Kungsholm). Secondly, losses incurred would fall upon them personally, and also might cause Kungsholm to abandon the entire transaction, which was obviously of pecuniary value to the partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">By their contract, the Century partners undertook to dispose of the income of the partnership during the Buyer\u2019s Business Period. The power to dispose of income is the equivalent of ownership of it and the exercise of the power to procure its payment to another is within the reach of the statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> taxing income \u201c \u2018derived from any source whatever.\u2019 \u201d Harrison v. Schaffner, 312 U. S. 579, 580, 61 S.Ct. 759, 760, 85 L.Ed. 1055. To the same effect are Lucas v. Earl, 281 U.S. 111, 114, 50 S.Ct. 241, 74 L.Ed. 731; Galt v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 7 Cir., 216 F.2d 41, 46 and 47, and Pleason v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 7 Cir., 226 F.2d 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>For the reasons above set forth, we affirm the decisions of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-12\">.

It seems clear to me that the only tax liability incurred by the partners was that arising from their capital gain in their sale of assets. This conclusion is impelled by our decisions in Meyer v. United States, 7 Cir., 213 F.2d 278, and Swiren v. Com\u2019r, 7 Cir., 183 F.2d 656, the reasoning of which I adhere to, and believe to be applicable to and decisive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
