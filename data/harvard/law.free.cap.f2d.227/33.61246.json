The court granted the motion to dismiss without saying why it did so. For all that appears, it may have disagreed with the contention that it lacked jurisdiction and agreed with the contention that the complaint failed to state a cause of action. We think both contentions erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Since the suit was filed after the 1952 Act took effect, judicial review of the deportation order and of the refusal to suspend it is not restricted to habeas corpus. Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 75 S.Ct. 591; Muscardin v. Brownell, 97 U.S.App.D.C.-, 227 F.2d 31. It follows that the court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The complaint states a cause of action. Section 19(c) of the 1917 Act, as amended in 1948, '62 Stat. 1206, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) \u00a7 155(c) (2) (b), authorized the Attorney General to suspend deportation of a deportable alien who has \u201cresided continuously in the United States for seven years or more and is residing in the United \u2019States upon July 1, 1948.\u201d It fairly appears from the complaint that the Attorney General did not exercise his discretion under this statute, but \u201cpursuant to\u201d the more stringent provisions of the 1952 Act, which require a showing of \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d. \u00a7 244(a) (1), 66 Stat. 214, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1254(a) (l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\"> The savings clause of the 1952 Act, \u00a7 405(a), 66 Stat. 280, 8 U.S.C. p. 734 [8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 note] provides that the Act shall not affect any proceedings brought at the time it takes effect, and that an application for suspension of deportation shall be regarded as a proceeding. If appellant had formally applied for suspension before the 1952 Act was enacted, it would clearly have been necessary, even after it took effect, for the Attorney General to exercise the discretion allowed him by the 1917 Act as amended. United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 261, note, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681; Hatzistavrou v. Brownell, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 187, 225 F.2d 26. No formal application for \u201csuspension\u201d of deportation was filed until later, but appellant had filed a motion for \u201creconsideration\u201d. In 1950, in consequence of this motion, the original order and warrant of deportation were withdrawn and the hearing was \u201creopened for the reception of such application for relief from deportation as may be made and for further appropriate proceedings in connection therewith.\u201d We think the savings clause applies to the proceedings thus reopened. The whole development of the savings clause \u201cmanifests a well-established congressional policy not to strip aliens of advantages gained under prior laws. The consistent broadening of the savings provision, particularly in its general terminology, indicates that this policy of preservation was intended to apply to matters both within and without the specific contemplation of Congress.\u201d United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 535, 75 S.Ct. 513, 518. Accordingly the Attorney General should exercise the discretion allowed him by the 1917 Act as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-11\">. In Caddeo v. McGranery, 92 U.S.App.D. C. 19, 202 F.2d 807, it did not appear from the complaint that discretion had not been exercised or had been abused.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
