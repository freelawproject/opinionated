The trial court who saw and heard the seaman found that his failure to seek medical assistance on the specified occasion was not wilful and that his actions were not of such nature as to warrant a forfeiture of his right to maintenance and cure. The record bears out the correctness of this con-elusion.</p>\n<p id=\"AXL-\">The judgment of district court will be affirmed. D.C., 129 F.Supp. 225.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
