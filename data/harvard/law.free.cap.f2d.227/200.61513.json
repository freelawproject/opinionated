The Board, following the report of its examiner, found that respondent violated \u00a7 8(a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (3), by discharging an employee named Weyer because of his membership in the Teamsters\u2019 Union, and violated \u00a7 8(a) (1) by this and other conduct. The usual cease and desist order was entered, together with an order to make Weyer whole for loss of pay and to post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\"> The sole argument here has to do with the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the unfair practice charges. While the evidence was conflicting, there was abundant testimony, not inherently incredible, to support the Board\u2019s findings on the point. Questions of credibility in such circumstances are for the examiner and the Board, not for us, to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">A decree enforcing the order will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
