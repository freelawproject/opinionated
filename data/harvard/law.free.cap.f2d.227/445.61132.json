On <em>September 4 </em>Graves had two short conclusions during which he became rigid and shook while lying in bed. He remained in bed for two days. On September 7 his wife, who is the plaintiff, being concerned about his irrational remarks, called the doctor who told her Graves was seriously ill. At the trial the doctor testified he' believed Graves was schizophrenic. Later in the evening Graves walked the dog and returned with the dog\u2019s collar around his neck. He threatened to kill the plaintiff.and a Mrs. Hampden with whom they were living and also threatened to kill the children if they should wake and disturb him. In the early morning Graves left the house, went to a diner in Suffern and proceeded to go berserk. He pounded the counter, threw things, and assaulted one Williams knocking him the 30 foot length of the diner. When police officer Lieutenant Krouse attempted to quiet the insured, the insured hit him with a chair fracturing his skull and causing a brain concussion. Krouse went for help and when he returned the .insured, who was by this time alone in the diner, threw a ketchup bottle through the plate glass, window. Krouse started toward the diner and as he approached it- the insured threw things at him. Krouse fired a warning shot and then the two shots that were, fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">In August of 1948 Graves had been hospitalized in a sanatorium for about two weeks. The following March he had been a patient at the Psychiatric Division of Bellevue, Hospital for about two weeks. At both times he was excited and talked irrationally, expressing- grandiose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>ideas, but he was not violent. There was also evidence that the decedent was treated by two physchiatrists from 1947 until his death. Plaintiff testified, however, that except for the incidents in August 1948 and March 1949 the decedent had never acted irrationally or expressed peculiar ideas. Another witness who had known decedent for a long time and seen him frequently testified that prior to September 1949 she had never seen him emotionally disturbed or excited.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The Company asserts that Graves\u2019 death resulted from a disease or mental infirmity and that the complaint should have been dismissed. We agree with the trial judge\u2019s refusal to so rule and his submission of the case to the jury for their determination whether Graves\u2019 death resulted from any disease or mental infirmity from which he suffered or whether it resulted from a transient illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Under New York law, which apparently governs and which both parties treat as governing, plaintiff is entitled to recover if the insured\u2019s mental condition was a temporary disorder or disturbance rather than an infirmity or ailment of a more permanent nature. As Judge Cardozo said in Silverstein v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 1930, 254 N.Y. 81, 171 N.E. 914, 915:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201cThe disease or the infirmity must be so considerable or significant that it would be characterized as disease or infirmity in the common speech of men.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Most of the New York cases have dealt with permanent weaknesses which did not amount to disease or infirmity, such as the dormant ulcer of the Silverstein case or an unusual sensitivity to novo-caine, Berkowitz v. New York Life Insurance Co., 1st Dept., 1939, 256 App. Div. 324, 10 N.Y.S.2d 106. The principle enunciated in those cases is broad enough to cover temporary disorders as well. Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York v. Dodge, 4 Cir., 1926, 11 F.2d 486, 59 A.L.R. 1290, certiorari denied, 1926, 271 U.S. 677, 46 S.Ct. 629, 70 L.Ed. 1147; Manufacturer\u2019s Accident Indemnity Co. v. Dorgan, 6 Cir., 1893, 58 F. 945; Meyer v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York, 1895, 96 Iowa 378, 65 N.W. 328. Thus in Gittelson v. Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York, 1st Dept., 1943, 266 App. Div. 141, 144-145, 41 N.Y.S.2d 478, 481, the court acknowledged the principle in passing, thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\">\u201cIn posing our question we assume * * * that insured was suffering from a well defined and settled disease, in other words, that the disorder causing the fall was not merely a temporary disorder or weakness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">Defendant has urged, however, that a mental derangement is always an \u201cinfirmity\u201d no matter how temporary or transient it may be. We find no reason why a temporary mental derangement should be an \u201cinfirmity\u201d when a temporary physical enfeeblement is not. Directly in point is Williams v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, 1933, 271 Ill. App. 532, and we think that case is in accordance with the New York rule. The cases of Gittelson v. Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York, supra, and Mandles v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, D.C.D.Colo.1940, 32 F.Supp. 619, affirmed 10 Cir., 1940, 115 F.2d 994, relied upon by defendant, are not in point. In the Gittelson case the deceased was suffering from Parkinson\u2019s disease, obviously a \u201cdisease\u201d; the only question was whether it directly or indirectly caused the death. And in the Mandles case the court was not concerned with the permanence of the derangement since the decedent had been adjudged insane and was an inmate in an institution at the time of the accident which caused her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Whether the insured\u2019s condition here was a temporary disorder or a \u201cdisease\u201d or \u201cinfirmity\u201d was a fact for the jury to find. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York v. Dodge, 4 Cir., 1926, 11 F.2d 486, 59 A.L.R. 1290; Berkowitz v. New York Life Ins. Co., 1st Dept., 1939, 256 App.Div. 324, 10 N.Y.S.2d 106. The trial judge carefully and thoroughly ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>plained the issues to the jury, and submitted to them two written questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">\u201cQuestion No. 1: Was the deceased insured at the time he met his death suffering from an. illness or disease or a physical or mental infirmity which was somewhat fixed and settled and more than of a slight or temporary nature, and not over in a short period of time, and not of such a nature that when it has been recovered from, leaves the body or mind as it was previous to the slight' or temporary condition?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cQuestion No. 2: If you have answered Question No. 1 in the affirmative, then answer: Did the death of the deceased insur\u00e9d result directly or indirectly from such illness or disease or mental infirmity ?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The judge instructed the jury that if they answered either of these questions in the negative, their verdict must be for the plaintiff. These questions closely followed the language of the court in Williams v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">After some deliberation the jury asked clarification of the words \u201csomewhat fixed,\u201d \u201csettled,\u201d \u201cslight,\u201d and \u201ctemporary\u201d used in Question 1, and the judge, after briefly restating the issue, defined them as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">\u201cSomewhat fixed\u201d means definitely ascertainable by observation and not of short or transient duration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">The same would be the definition that would be applied to \u201csettled\u201d; an ailment or a condition which is definitely ascertainable by observation and not of a short or transient duration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">\u201cSlight\u201d means short in point of duration of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av2\">\u201cTemporary\u201d is temporary in the sense that it is a temporary episode and not a recurrent condition which is characteristic or symptomatic of a definite disease or ailment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaqO\">Whatever doubts or uncertainties there may have been after the charge were cleared up by the judge\u2019s supplemental charge and his definition of the word \u201ctemporary.\u201d The instructions were in accordance with the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">The jury answered the first question in the negative and returned a verdict for the plaintiff. As there was ample evidence from which the jury could find that Graves was suffering from a temporary illness and not from a disease or mental infirmity of more permanent nature, and as the jury was fairly and fully instructed, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
