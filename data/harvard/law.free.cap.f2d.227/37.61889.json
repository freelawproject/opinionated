In 1954 he filed his complaint for a declaratory judgment and for review under the Administrative Procedure Act [5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001 et seq.] of the Attorney General\u2019s refusal to suspend a deportation order. The complaint alleges that the Attorney General failed to exercise the discretion vested in him by law. It alleges that deportation would result in serious economic detriment \u201cto citizens of the United States who are appellant's adoptive parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Section 19(c) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended in 1948, authorizes the Attorney General to suspend deportation if he finds that it \u201cwould result in serious economic detriment to a citizen * * * who is the spouse, parent, or minor child\u201d of the alien. 62 Stat. 1206, 8 U.S.C. (1946 ed., Supp. V) \u00a7 155(c) (2) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The warrant of arrest for deportation was issued in 1950 and hearings were held. The complaint does not say when the deportation order was issued. The order provided that unless appellant \u201cvoluntarily\u201d left the United States by May 1, 1954, he would be taken into custody and. deported. The government informed us in oral argument that application for suspension was pending when the 1952 Act [8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101 et seq.] was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The District Court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that habeas corpus was appellant\u2019s only remedy and that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Since the court said in substance that it lacked jurisdiction, it cannot have intended to rule on any other question. We think the court had jurisdiction. Shintaro Miyagi v. Brownell, 97 U.S. App.D.C. -, 227 F.2d 33, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
