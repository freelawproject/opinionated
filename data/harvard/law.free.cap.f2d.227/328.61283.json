The case was submitted to a jury in a fair and impartial charge to which no exception was taken. Certain instructions requested were not given, but the law was fairly covered in the general charge. There were no errors in the admission or rejection of testimony that are worthy of consideration. If there was any error in the trial of the case, it was in not directing a verdict for defendant; for the ridiculing of the self laudatory brochure did not exceed fair comment and there was nothing in the concluding line of the article \u201cAnybody like to go with him steady?\u201d which justifies the construction that it charged homosexuality by innuendo. Contention to that effect is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
