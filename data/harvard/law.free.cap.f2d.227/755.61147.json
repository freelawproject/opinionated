Allstate contends that the trial court erred in not holding that Erickson\u2019s representation in his application for Allstate insurance that no insurer had ever cancelled any automobile insurance against him was a materially false representation which voided his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">Allstate contends that the insured made such a material misrepresentation to it in marking X in the square before the word \u201cNo\u201d in answer to the following question asked by Allstate of the insured when he applied to it on December 17, 1952 for his insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-18\"><em>\u201cHas </em>any insurer <em>ever cancelled </em>any automobile insurance to the applicant or to any of his household? \u201c\u25a1 Yes Kl No.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaeM\">The claimed material misrepresentation is based on the fact that when the question was asked, the insured then had a policy in the State Farm Insurance Company concerning which he had received from that company on December 17, 1952, a letter stating that the policy \u201cis being cancelled <em>effective 12:01 A.M. Standard Time on the 27th day of December, 1952, </em>and <em>no further protection will be afforded after that date.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">The district court construed Allstate's question <em>\u201cHas </em>any insurer <em>ever cancelled </em>any insurance\u201d as ambiguous as to whether it meant insurance already cancelled or to become can-celled at a later date. It applied the universal rule that such an ambiguity should be resolved against the insurance company and held Allstate liable. We think the court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-20\">Allstate has a California decision, American Glove Co. v. Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co., 15 Cal.App. 77, 113 P. 688 which it claims is controlling because the policy was issued in California to the insured, a citizen of California. We do not think this case applicable. There the insured plaintiff on April 11, 1906 received from the insurer a letter dated April 9, 1906, stating: \u201cthe policy will be canceled on our books on the 14th inst., five days from date.\u201d The loss sued for occurred on April 19, 1906, <em>five days after the stated date of cancellation. </em>There was no such ambiguous question as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>asked in the instant case, and of course, no discussion of its ambiguity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Likewise in the case of Allstate Ins. Co. v. Moldenhauer, Cir. 7, 193 F.2d 663, cited by Allstate, there was no consideration of the ambiguity in such a question as was asked by Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-16\">. The law of California is that the language of an insurance policy is to be construed most strongly against the insurer who wrote that language. California Civil Code, \u00a7 1654; Island v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Indemnity, 1947, 30 Cal.2d 541, 184 P.2d 153, 173 A.L.R. 896; Farmers Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange v. Calkins, 1940, 39 Cal.App.2d 390, 103 P.2d 230; Woodman v.
