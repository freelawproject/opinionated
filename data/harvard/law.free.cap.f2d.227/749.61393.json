The other information charged the violation of section 6.4(e), which provides a daily bag limit of four wild ducks.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">In a fully considered oral opinion, analyzing' both the facts and the applicable law, United States District Judge Kloeb reviewed the substantial evidence upon which conviction was based and cited and discussed pertinent authorities : among others, United States v.

Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 40 S.Ct. 382, 64 L.Ed. 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Upon the basis of the reasoning of the . United States District Court, and upon its findings of fact which are, upon consideration of the entire record in the cases, found to be supported by substantial evidence and not clearly erroneous, the judgment of the district court finding defendants guilty as charged in each information, and assessing the fines imposed, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
