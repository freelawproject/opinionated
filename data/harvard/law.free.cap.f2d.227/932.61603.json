Burke (the Insured), and Bertha Montgomery [Burke]; and, applying this, rejected a Mother\u2019s claim, \u00a7 202(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(g), by Bertha and a Child\u2019s claim, \u00a7 202(d), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(d) for their illegitimate son, Charles Montgomery Burke. On appeal, \u00a7 205(g), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g), the district court went down the middle \u2014 affirming the denial of the Mother\u2019s claim for want of a valid marriage, but, coining a new phrase, finding a \u201cqualified\u201d common law marriage sufficient to legitimate Charles, reversed the Secretary and allowed the Child\u2019s benefits. In the Government\u2019s appeal from this allowance, Bertha acquiesces, without cross appeal, in denial of the Mother\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-18\">The finding against common law marriage, which we accept, is decisive since determination of eligibility under the Act for Child\u2019s benefits requires the Administrator to \u201capply such law as would be applied in determining the devolution of intestate personal property by the courts of\u201d Georgia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under Geor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>gia law a child born out of wedlock is illegitimate <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and does not take by devolution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">If this is harsh, it flows from local concepts which, if need be, can be ameliorated by appropriate local, Georgia action as its declared policies on such domestic matters may come under its legislative or judicial review. On such internal matters, Congress, by \u00a7 216(h) (1), takes the state policy as it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Reflecting the contemporary distaste for the visitation of penalties upon the innocent victims of such illicit relationships,. the district court apparently thought that the Georgia declaration of policy .favoring legitimacy, \u00a7\u00a7 74-101, 26-5603, and 53-104, Code of Georgia, avoided the harsh denial' of the statutory benefits to a child of acknowledged paternity and dependence. But \u00a7 53-104 of the Georgia Code<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the policy which it codifies does not legitimate the innocent offspring of an illicit relationship. This declared policy is applicable only to those situations, broadly defined in the Code, where a marriage contract has been undertaken, but is void or voidable because of the legal inability of one of the parties to make a valid contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Where, as here, no marriage, either ceremonial or common law, ever took place and the relationship contemplated, at most, the future consummation of a contract to marry, the offspring are illegitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">Since, under Georiga law, the child was not legitimate, the district court\u2019s allowance of Child\u2019s benefits was clearly erroneous and must be</p>\n<p id=\"aem-dedup-0\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-8\">. The Act, \u00a7 205(g), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 405(g), provides, \u201cThe findings of the Administrator as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive * * *.\u201d See Thompson v. Social Security Board, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 154 F. 2d 204; Hobby v. Hodges, 10 Cir., 215 F. 2d 754, 757; N. L. R. B. v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660; N. L. R. B. v. Poultry Enterprises, Inc., 5 Cir., 207 F.2d 522, 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">The conclusion was fully justified on documentary and testimonial evidence. Bertha had lived with at least two other men. One or both of these relationships might have been sufficient to constitute a common law marriage, with no dissolution by divorce or death adequately proved. She had, in addition to Charles, three other children whose paternity was doubtful even to her. She first fixed the time she and Burke began living together at 1945, another time at 1947, with Charles being born in 1946. Charles\u2019 birth certificate is blank as to father (cf. \u00a7 88-1111, Code of Georgia). They maintained two households a few blocks apart, required, she said, because of the largo number of children. She was known indiscriminately to friends and relatives as Bertha Burke and Bertha Montgomery. Her description of the \u201cagreement\u201d to marry was, \u201cMe and him talked everything over\u201d, and agreed that, \u201cWe would try to live together * * * and maybe one day we might marry.\u201d * * * \u201cWe was planning to get married this year [1952] but he died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AG9E\">During Edward\u2019s lifetime he claimed (1950 Income Tax Return) only one additional exemption \u201cCharles Burke \u2014 \u25a0 son\u201d and none was claimed for a wife, in Application (1949) for Earners Primary Benefits, he listed himself as unmarried. In 1950 he sought benefits for what he described as illegitimate child, stating in one interview (Sept. 1950) that he might take action to legitimate the child. By will he left all property to \u201cmy baby Charles Burke\u201d with no mention of Bertha as his wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-20\">. Georgia, following the usual approach for a valid common law marriage, requires (a) parties able to contract, (b) an actual contract, (c) consummation. \u00a7 53-101, Code of Georgia; Campbell v. Allen, 208 Ga. 274, 66 S.E.2d 226; Drewry v. State, 208 Ga. 239, 244, 65 S.E.2d 916; Lefkoff v. Sicro, 189 Ga. 554, 576-580, 6 S.E.2d 687, 133 A.L.R. 738. As foreign as the statement of legalistic standards may be to the illiterate and ignorant who are so frequently participants in these relationships, the law rigorously exacts evidence of a present intention to be husband and wife and where words, conduct and other evidence indicates the intent that marriage shall take place sometime in the future, neither the continued living together nor the holding out as man and wife is sufficient. Peacock v. Peacock, 196 Ga. 441, 452, 26 S.E.2d 608.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b983-21\">.

Legitimation can be effected by (a) subsequent marriage of the mother and reputed father with recognition of the child as his by the father, \u00a7 74-101, Code of Georgia, or (b) by court order on petition of the father, \u00a7 74-103, Code of Georgia. Neither of these steps were taken here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b984-13\">. \u00a7 113-904, Code of Georgia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b984-16\">. \u201cVoid marriages; legitimacy of issue of marriage. \u2014 Marriages of persons un- \u2022 able to contract, or unwilling to contract, or fraudulently induced to contract, shall be void. The issue of such marriages, before they are annulled and declared void by a competent court, shall be legitimate. In the latter two cases, however, a subsequent consent and ratification of the marriage, freely and voluntarily made, accompanied by cohabitation as husband and wife, shall render valid the marriage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b984-19\">. Perkins v. Levy, 158 Ga. 896, 124 S.E. 799; Eubanks v. Eubanks, 34 Ga. 407; Campbell v. Allen, 208 Ga. 274, 66 S.E. 2d 226; Griffin v. Booth, 176 Ga. 1, 167 S.E. 294, so heavily relied upon to sustain legitimacy here, each involved an actual marriage, ceremonial or common law, which marriage was void because of a prior undissolved marriage. The prior marriage, undissolved, prevented the second marriage from being valid, but until it was annulled, the issue were recognized as legitimate and eligible to inherit. Actually this is what Judge McDuffie did in Ray v. Social Security Board, D.C.S.D.Ala., 73 F.Supp. 58, although he also stated a construction that eliminated legitimacy as a test if the child were living with the insured; see Mayers v. Ewing, D.C.E.D.Pa., 102 F. Supp. 201, which rejected such construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
