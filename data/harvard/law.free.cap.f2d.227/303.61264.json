Nickles, 223 Ark. 894, 270 S. W.2d 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-14\">On the former appearance of the case before us, 8 Cir., 215 F.2d 731, we had vacated the judgment of the District Court and remanded the cause, for consideration and determination of that question, to which the Nickles opinion, in its use of those terms, had given rise. In so doing, we said that, \u201csince the trial court\u2019s previous act of allowance [of attorney\u2019s fees out of that portion of the amount paid by the third party to which the deceased\u2019s employer and its compensation insurer were subrogated under Ark.Stats.1947, \u00a7 81 \u2014 1340] cannot here be said to have been made in relation to the construction of the statute contained in the Arkansas Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, * * * the court should have the opportunity to consider and dispose of the situation on that basis\u201d, and that \u201cthe case should be remanded * * * to enable the conflicting contentions of compromise settlement and contested case, now being abstractly urged before us [by virtue of the Nickles opinion], to be developed and considered in their full light, and with the benefit of that court\u2019s knowledge of the proceedings had before it.\u201d 215 F.2d at page 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">After the remand, the trial court engaged in a full hearing, on the history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>which had been involved in the estate\u2019s assertion of its third-party claim, and the elements of skill, preparation, efforts, relationships and processes which had entered into the effecting of the disposition of it. On the whole situation, the court concluded Boulden v. Herring, D. C., 126 F.Supp. 885, 897, that what had been done and accomplished made the disposition effected more than a mere compromise settlement, and that in practical aspect and substance, for purposes of the attorney\u2019s fee statute, \u201cthis was a contested case within the holding of the Nickles case\u201d. The court accordingly again made a fee allowance to the attorney for the deceased\u2019s estate, out of the portion of the proceeds to which the employer and its compensation insurer were subrogated, and they have taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">No question is raised by appellants on the amount, as such, of the allowance made. The contentions which they make are (1) that the situation could not legally be termed one of \u201ccontested case\u201d, because the disposition involved was not a matter of actual trial and forensic result; and (2) that, if the concept of \u201ccontested case\u201d under the Nickles opinion was intended to go beyond the criteria of trial proceedings and jury or court result, the elements and incidents of the disposition here involved could not in any event be said, on their factual substance, to rise above the level of a \u201ccompromise settlement\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We had said in our previous opinion that we did \u201cnot feel warranted in abstractly assuming that the opinion of the Arkansas Supreme Court means that a mere filing of pleadings in court of itself has the effect * * * of necessarily lifting whatever payment may be thereafter made by the third party * * * into the category of fruits of <em>\u2018a </em>contested case\u2019 \u201d, and, further, that neither did we \u201cfeel entitled to hold abstractly that what may be in fact a compromise settlement of a claim against a third party, without representing the product of such legal services and processes as are usually incident to the preparing, conducting and terminating of litigation, will * * * automatically acquire the status of proceeds of \u2018a contested case\u2019, within the use of that term in the Arkansas Supreme Court opinion, merely because the parties, or one of them, may desire, for some extraneous reason or purpose, to have the court cloak the settlement with the formality of a judgment entry.\u201d 215 F.2d at pages 733 and 734. And in making remand, we also were refusing abstractly to declare that, unless the situation was one of formal trial and forensic result, it would be impossible for a \u201ccontested case\u201d to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">In thus refusing to deal, abstractly and legalistically, with the connotation of the terms \u201ccompromise settlement\u201d and \u201ccontested case\u201d, as used by the Arkansas Supreme Court, for purposes of the attorney\u2019s fee statute, and in remanding the case \u201cto enable the conflicting contentions of compromise settlement and contested case * * * to be developed and considered in their full light,\u201d we necessarily were leaving the District Court free, and were imposing upon it the responsibility, to evaluate all the aspects of the situation, as a matter of local legal interpretation and application of the holding of the Nickles case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">This was in accord with our settled general policy that, \u201con the question of resolving what local law is, which is unclear or unsettled, * * * we desire and will heavily rely upon the considered appraisal of a District Judge as to what the local law of his jurisdiction is.\u201d Kasper v. Kellar, 8 Cir., 217 F.2d 744, 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">On the resolution and determination which the trial court has made, we do not feel that there is any reasonable and convictional basis for us to say that the court was clearly erroneous in its view that the terms \u201ccompromise settlement\u201d and \u201ccontested case\u201d, as used by the Arkansas Supreme Court, in their significance for purposes of the attorney\u2019s fee allowance statute, were not meant to be legalistic absolutes, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>were intended to have practical and flexible content, as a matter of allowing realistic evaluation to be made compositely of the -incidents of skill, preparation, efforts, relationships and processes, which have entered into the production of a result and disposition in a particular situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">We believe that there was adequate local legal margin for the court to say, as it did, that, under the Nickles opinion, \u201cthe term \u2018contested case\u2019 may have varied meanings depending upon the context in which the term is used, and the meaning of the term in a particular case must be determined from a consideration of all the facts and circumstances, particularly what was done and what was required to be done to bring about or to produce the judgment or recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">And, on our acceptance of this concept of Arkansas law, there further is no basis in the present situation for us to declare the trial court\u2019s factual appraisal\" and application to be clearly erroneous, .that the substance of the elements and incidents which had entered into the producing of the disposition effected was such as to entitle the matter to be regarded as a contested case, for purposes of the question of an attorney\u2019s fee allowance under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The court said in its memorandum opinion that the case \u201cwas actively contested from the time of its inception until shortly before the entry of the judgment in favor of plaintiff and against the defendants\u201d; that the entire proceeding \u201cwas adversary in every detail until the defendants became convinced of the justice of plaintiff\u2019s claims\u201d; aind that \u201chad the instant case been litigated prior to the adoption of the [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.], there is little doubt but that a trial would have been required to settle the issues between plaintiff and the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In effect, the court found that the elements and incidents of skill, preparation, efforts, relationships and processes ordinarily necessary for a disposition by trial had been- so substantially engaged in and had played such a part in the situation as realistically to have been productive of the disposition effected. Thus, among other things, the court pointed out that the parties had appeared at a pre-trial conference; information had been exchanged between them under the Rules of Civil Procedure; and the taking of a deposition had been arranged and engaged in. The nature of this deposition and the character of <em>the </em>witness by whom it was given were such that, as the third-party here admitted, and as the trial court found, it \u201cproved to be the deciding factor in the case\u201d, on the effecting of disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Other elements and incidents of the situation also were involved in the trial court\u2019s appraisal, which we do not deem it necessary to detail. As we have indicated, the evaluation made seems to us to rest upon such substance that we have no right to declare it clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
