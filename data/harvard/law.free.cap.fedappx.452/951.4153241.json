The Veterans Court vacated the Board\u2019s decision regarding Murton\u2019s claim for an increased rating and remanded for reconsideration in view of amended criteria for alopecia, the possibility of entitlement to an extra-schedular rating, and additional favorable evidence. The Veterans Court also addressed Murton\u2019s psychiatric disability claim, holding that the Board had finally decided this claim in 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Murt\u00f3n appeals only that part of the Veterans Court\u2019s decision which addressed his claim for psychiatric disability. Murt\u00f3n also filed what he characterized as a \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d seeking, in effect, to overturn the Veterans Court\u2019s denial of his motion to bifurcate his alopecia claim so that the remand thereof could become effective without awaiting a determination on his claim for psychiatric disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">Because Murton\u2019s appeal to the Veterans Court was taken from a Board decision regarding only his increased-rating claim from 2002, and not regarding a prior claim for psychiatric disability, the latter was not before the Veterans Court and the Veterans Court did not have jurisdiction to address it. <em>See Kirkpatrick v. Nicholson, </em>417 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed.Cir. 2005) (explaining that a claim could not be adjudicated by the Veterans Court in the first instance when it was not the subject of a decision by the Board). Because the Veterans Court did not have jurisdiction over Murton\u2019s psychiatric disability claim, it should not have addressed that claim, and that portion of its opinion cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-15\">While this appeal presents nothing to this court on the merits of any claim that we are authorized to review, this court does possess jurisdiction to address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>the Veterans Court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Wick v. Brown, </em>40 F.3d 367, 370 (Fed.Cir.1994) (explaining that where the Veterans Court lacks jurisdiction over a matter, this court has jurisdiction on appeal only for the purpose of correcting the error of jurisdiction). Accordingly, this court exercises only that jurisdiction required to correct the Veteran\u2019s Court\u2019s error of its jurisdiction and hereby vacates the portion of the Veterans Court\u2019s opinion which addresses Murton\u2019s claim for psychiatric disability. No other aspect of the Veterans Court\u2019s decision is affected by this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">VACATED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">.
