If (a) is answered adversely to plaintiff\u2019s contention, then (b) must be answered. The contentions seem to be made in good faith, and they involve the construction of the two contracts. This suit was \u25a0commenced a little more than four months ago, and the patent will expire before this opinion can be announced. Defendants are solvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">There was no abuse of discretion in deny ing the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
