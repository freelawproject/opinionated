The facts are not in dispute. The aliens were not entitled to enter the United States. They made arrangements with unidentified persons in Havana for transportation to Key West, and were taken by those persons to Middleton, who brought them in a small motorboat from a point on the coast of Cuba near Havana through the Northwest Channel and by the bell buoy described in the indictment, which is some seven or eight miles northwest of Key West, but is less than three miles from an uninhabited island, and then to a point about five miles to the northeast, where the motorboat caught fire from an explosion, which occurred about nine o\u2019clock in tlie morning. The fire did not completely destroy the boat, and the aliens made their way with it to the northwest bell buoy, which they had passed about half an hour before. Middleton swam toward Key West for assistance, but both he and the aliens were later taken on board a passing boat and carried into Key West. On the trip from Cuba, Middleton did not take the direct route into Key West, perhaps because he did not think it safe to do so, or because he had lost his way. At any rate, the boat went aground in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>shallow water within half a mile of one or more of the Florida Keys in the vicinity of Key West. After receiving directions from a fisherman, he proceeded to the Northwest Channel. One of the aliens testified that he suggested to Middleton to put them ashore on one of the keys, but that Middleton replied that they would \u201cget through all right.\u201d About an hour afterwards the explosion occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">It is suggested in argument that Middle,ton would not have violated the law if it had been his intention merely to pass through the Northwest Channel on his way to some other port, but Middleton made no pretens\u00e9 that he had any such intention. Nor did he deny the testimony of the aliens that the common purpose was to come into the United States at or near Key West in violation of the statute. It is beyond dispute that he brought the aliens into the territorial waters of the United States when he came within half a mile of the Keys, and also when he passed by the bell' buoy of the Northwest Channel within three miles of an island. It does not make any difference that these islands were uninhabited; it is sufficient that they were islands of the United States. The statute under consideration provides that-any. person who shall \u201cbring into or land in the United States-, by vessel or otherwise,\u201d any <em>alien not </em>lawfully entitled to enter, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. The words \u201cbring into\u201d are not synonymous with, but are more comprehensive than, the words \u201cland in,\u201d and were intended by the statute to punish violations of the immigration laws in eases where an actual landing or placing of aliens on shore could not be shown. It was so held in United States v. Butt, 254 U. S. 38, 41 S. Ct. 37, 65 L. Ed. 119. In that case a ruling in Stoneberg v. Morgan (C. C. A.) 246 F. 98, which sustained the contention now made by appellant was expressly disapproved by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
