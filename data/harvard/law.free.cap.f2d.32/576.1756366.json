Originally four cases at law were filed in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Oklahoma, numbered respectively 3508, 3509, 3510, and 3511. The pleadings in these cases are conceded to be identical, except as to the names of the plaintiffs and the interest of the parties in the various properties involved. The cases -were consolidated. for trial, and submitted to the court upon one set of facts, under a waiver of jury in writing. The eases come to this court on a single transcript, it being stipulated \u201cthat but one appeal be prosecuted regarding said consolidated eases, and that all considerations, orders, judgments, and mandates made by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, or the United States Supreme Court, in ease appeal is finally taken to that court, be effective in each of the individual cases above described, the same as if an appeal bad been taken in each of said eases individually.\u201d It -will be necessary, therefore, to consider the pleadings in but one as typical of all of these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-24\">The alleged contract, the asserted breach of which is the foundation of this controversy, is in the words and figures following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-25\">\u201cExhibit A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-26\">\u201cDivision Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-27\">\u201cThis agreement made and entered into on this 6th day of March, 1925, by and between the Simpson-Fell Oil Company, of Ardmore, Oklahoma, W.

Simpson-Fell Oil Company, by H. B.-Fell, President. Attest: W. D. Potter, Secretary. [Seal] W. T. Hales, by -, Parties of First Part. E. A. Walker, Party of the Second Part. Pierce Petroleum Corporation, by-, President, Party of the Third Part. Attest: -, Secretary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">It is alleged in the petition that -on the said 6th day of March, 1925, plaintiffs consummated a contract of sale and purchase with the defendant, Pierce Petroleum Corporation, acting by its Oklahoma manager, E. P. Kistler, its duly authorized agent and representative; that under the terms and conditions of said contract the defendant did, on the 15th day of March, 1925, cause all other pipe lines to disconnect from the property described, and made its connections with all of .the wells on said property, furnishing all connections, lines, and power at its expense, and did receive said oil, as provided in said agreement, and paid for the same, as therein provided, from the 15th day of March, 1925, until about the 11th day of June, 1925; that on the latter date the defendant, Pierce Petroleum Corporation, disconnected its pipe line from the tank and wells of the plaintiffs, and refused further to comply with the terms and conditions of said agreement. It is further alleged that, after June 11, 1925, the time when the alleged breach occurred, the demand for oil was not so strong; that plaintiffs were compelled to store their oil for a time; and that, after the most diligent effort on their part, the contract they were able to make for the balance of the period of said alleged contract was for a price of 15 cents per barrel above the posted price of the Prairie Oil &amp; Gas Company- for similar grades of Mid-Continent crude oil \u2014 a loss under the terms of said agreement of 10 cents per barrel. The number of barrels produced from the same propery thereafter, from June 11, 1925, to March 15, 1926, is stated, and damages' are prayed accordingly for this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">By their answer, under oath, the .Pierce Petroleum Corporation denied that any binding contract was made between the parties, and stated that the said E. P. Kistler had neither right nor authority to make the same. It was further alleged that the plaintiffs and Kistler agreed upon the terms of a tentative contract for the sale of oil. from the property described in the petition, but that such contract was subject to the approval of the president of the company, was put in writing and submitted to the president for Ms approval, and for the signature of the proper officers of the company, if so approved; that such approval was refused, unless certain amendments were made; that the contract was returned to the plaintiffs unsigned, advising them of the alterations and amendments suggested; that, pending the approval and signature of said contract, oil produced from the premises was run and furnished to the defendant, upon what is known as an open division order, that is to say, upon a day to day basis only, with the right to cease purchasing at any time; that the plaintiffs were so advised, and furnished oil accordingly, for all of which payment has been made. It is further alleged that the plaintiffs declined to make the alterations or amendments suggested, and that the eontratt was therefore never executed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-15\">It is conceded by appellants in brief and argument that on or about the 15th day of April, a representative of the Pierce Corporation advised the plaintiffs that the division agreement as drawn was unsatisfactory, upon the ground that it based the price to be paid by the Pierce Corporation upon the price posted by the Prairie Oil &amp; Gas Company in the Mid-Continent field, demanding that this should be changed to read, \u201cthe price posted by the Prairie Oil Company in the Hewitt field,\u201d and further that on May 5th the copies of this division agreement were returned to plaintiffs, because not drawn to the satisfaction of the president of the Pierce Corporation. The letter of transmittal contained this paragraph :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-16\">\u201cUnless certain alterations can be made, it will be necessary for us to operate on open division orders. In the meantime, we will continue running the oil and paying for same on open division order basis, and not on the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-17\">The contract was never signed by the Pierce Corporation, nor by any one authorized to represent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-18\">At the close of the testimony the defendant moved the court for judgment in its favor, and after consideration of arguments and briefs the court made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-19\">\u201cFindings of Fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-20\">\u201c1. The terms of the contracts, otherwise called division agreements, dated March 6, 1925, attached to plaintiffs\u2019 petition, were agreed to on March 6, 1925, by Mr. Fell and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Mr. Hales on behalf of the plaintiffs and were adopted by the other plaintiffs, and Mr. Kistler who, in the negotiations looking to the entrance into the contract acted on behalf of the defendant, fully assented thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\"><em>\u201c2. </em>Mr. Kistler, who represented the defendant in such negotiations, did not sign the division agreements, though he did agree to tho terms thereof, and at the instance of the plaintiffs sent the division agreements to the defendant\u2019s New York office for formal execution. Such agreements wore not formally executed by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">\u201c3. Negotiations conducted by Mr. Kistler were conducted by him alone on behalf of the defendant. Tho plaintiffs have not sustained the burden resting upon them of showing the authority of Mr. Kistler. To the contrary, the testimony of Mr. Pierce, president of defendant corporation, is undisputed, and is not denied, and it is accordingly found that in fact Mr. Kistler had no authority to make the contracts here in question as the agent of defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">\u201c4. In fact no contract exists between plaintiffs and the defendant, and the division agreements attached to plaintiffs\u2019 respective petitions never became effective or binding upon the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">\u201c5. The testimony is undisputed to the effect that the division agreements were executed by the plaintiffs on the 6th day of March, 1925, and that these division agreements provided that on March 15th the defendant should connect up its lines with the wells of the plaintiffs and take the oil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\u201c6. The testimony is further undisputed that the defendant did connect up its lines with all the producing properties described in the division agreements, and that tho defendant continued to take all the production therefrom up to about the 10th day of June, 1925, and that the defendant paid therefor a 25 per cent, premium, as provided in said division orders and the court so finds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">\u201c7. The evidence is undisputed that there was a greater demand to purchase oil in the vicinity where plaintiffs\u2019 wells are located on March 6, 1925, than on June 11, 1925, and such evidence is accepted as true by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">\u201cConclusions of Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">\u201cIn the promises, the court concludes as a matter of law as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">\u201c1. No legal enforceable contract exists between the plaintiffs and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-14\">\u201c2. No note or memorandum in writing, subscribed by the defendant, the party sought to be charged, or by its agent, exists between the parties to the respective actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-15\">\u201c3. The contracts alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 respective petitions are invalid, under the first subdivision of the Oklahoma statute of frauds, being section 5034, Oklahoma Compiled Statutes 1921.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-16\">\u201c4. The contracts alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 respective petitions are invalid under the Oklahoma statute of frauds, being section 5034, Oklahoma Compiled Statutes 1921; for that, assuming the correctness of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim (which the court does not sustain) that the defendant accepted and paid for the oil upon the terms of the so-called division agreements, the acceptance and part performance would not take the ease out of the operation of the statute, where, as is here found, a contract did not exist between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-17\">\u201c5. Plaintiffs\u2019 contention, based upon alleged acquiescence in the contract, is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-18\">\u201c6. The respective plaintiffs are not entitled to any relief herein, and the defendant is entitled in each case to judgment for its costs, same to be taxed to the respective plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-19\">\u201c7. The court finds, as a matter of law, that if the division agreements were executed by the plaintiffs and delivered to tho defendant, and thereafter the plaintiffs disconnected their wells from other pipe line companies, and the defendant went upon the plaintiffs\u2019 property, connected its lines with plaintiffs\u2019 wells, and took and paid for the production therefrom at a premium of 25 cents per barrel, as provided in the division orders, and continued to take and pay for the same as therein provided up to June 11,1925, that said act did not remove the application from the first subdivision of the statute of frauds, and that the defendant had tho right to plead said statute, notwithstanding that it had taken possession of plaintiffs\u2019 property, in so far as it is necessary to take the oil, and made its connections and took the oil for a period of nearly three months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-20\">\u201c8. The court further concludes that, as a matter of law, the defendant had tho right to hold the contracts or division agreements, which were executed and binding on the plaintiffs from March 9, 1925, up until May 5, 1925, without the agreement becoming binding on it, notwithstanding it had gone into possession of the property, taken the oil, and paid for it at the price provided in said agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-21\">\u201c9. The court further holds, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff cannot claim in a law action such as this that the acts of the defendant claimed by the plaintiffs to he a partial performance of the contracts would take it out of the statute of frauds, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>plaintiffs cannot plead an equitable estoppel against the defendant claiming the benefit of the statute of frauds, because this is an action at law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">\u201c10. The court holds as a matter of law that it is necessary to show the authority of the agent, Kistler, an employee of the defendant, to make this contract, and the fact that, after the plaintiffs executed the proposed contract and delivered it to Kistler, the defendant, as provided in said contract, connected up its lines, took the oil, and paid the same premium as provided in said proposed contract for a period of about 85 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cTo each of such. findings of fact and conclusions of law the plaintiffs in such respective' actions except, and such exceptions are allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Judgments followed in favor of defendant in all four eases. No requests for findings of fact or declarations of law were made by appellants. In this state of the record our review is limited to an ascertainment of whether the facts found support the judgment. Section 700, R. S. U. S.; USCA title 28, \u00a7 875; Fleischmann Const. Co. v. United States, 270 U. S. 349, 355, 46 S. Ct. 284, 70 L. Ed. 624; Newlands v. Calaveras Mining &amp; Milling Co. (C. C. A. 8) 28 F.(2d) 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">We cannot weigh the evidence, and the question of whether the findings of fact are supported by the evidence is not open. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Board of Com\u2019rs of Woodson County, Kan. (C. C. A. 8) 145 F. 144; Wear v. Imperial Window Glass Co. (C. C. A. 8) 224 F. 60; Pennok Oil Co. v. Roxana Petroleum Co. (C. C. A. 8) 289 F. 416; McClay v. Flemming (C. C. A. 8) 271 F. 472; Stoffregen v. Moore (C. C. A. 8) 271 F. 680; United States v. A., T. <em>&amp; </em>S. F. R. Co. (C. C.

A. 8) 298 F. 71; Denver Live Stock Commission Co. v. Lee (C. C. A. 8) 20 F.(2d) 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Examination establishes the fact that the findings made support fhe judgment. The statute of frauds of the state of Oklahoma reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">\u201cThe following contracts are invalid, unless the same, or some note or memorandum thereof, be in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged, or by his agent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">\u201cFirst. An agreement that, by its terms, is not to be performed within a year from the making thereof. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-13\">\u201cThird. An agreement made upon consideration of marriage, other than a mutual promise to marry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-15\">\u201cFourth. An agreement for the sale of goods, chattels, or things, in action, at a price not less than fifty dollars, unless the buyer accept or receive part of such goods and chattels, or the evidences or some of them, of such things in action, or pay at the same time some part of the purchase money; but when a sale is made by auction, an entry by the auctioneer in his sale book, at the time of the sale, of the kind of property sold, the terms of sale, the price and the names of the purchaser and person on whose account the sale was made, is a sufficient memorandum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-16\">\u201cFifth. An agreement for the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the sale of real property, or of an interest therein ; and such agreement, if made by an agent of the party sought to be charged, is invalid, unless the authority of the agent be in writing, subscribed by- the party sought to be charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">Compiled Statutes Oklahoma 1921, \u00a7 5034.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">The alleged agreement by its terms was made March 6, 1925, and was not to be fully performed until March 15, 1926. It falls, therefore, within the first subdivision of the statute. The court found that the alleged contract was not signed by the Pierce Petroleum Corporation nor by its agent; that at the instance of plaintiffs it was sent to the New York office for execution; that, therefore, the divisions agreement never became binding upon appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-19\">Counsel for appellants freely concede that the contract was not signed, as required by the first subdivision of the statute, and that it is not taken out of the statute by part performance, but contend that, by accepting oil and paying for it on the terms specified in the divisions agreement, appellee ratified the contract; that this alleged ratification took effect March 15th, on which date oil began to be accepted by appellee; that the contract was thus one to be performed within a year, and, therefore, not subject to the bar of the statute of frauds. This contention, if indulged, would rob that statute, in large measure, of effective force, and would open the door to the very evils which it was enacted to prevent. The court finds that there was in effect no contract to be ratified by conduct; that the acceptance of oil, and payment at the price fixed, pending consummation of the tentative agreement, would not operate to take that agreement out of the statute, and to bind the defendant. The argument made by counsel for appellants must as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>sume that another and different contract was entered into by the acceptance of oil on March 15th and thereafter; otherwise, the agreement of March 6th is validated by indirection, and in obvious conflict with the express terms of the statute; but this position is rendered untenable by the petition itself. By its allegations the contract sued on is the contract of March 6, 1925. The pleader says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201cOn or about the 6th day of March, 1925, these plaintiffs * * * consummated a contract of sale and purchase with the Pierce Petroleum Corporation. * * * Plaintiffs further allege that as a memorial of the contract and agreement, they, and each of them executed a written division agreement embodying the terms and conditions of said contract of sale and purchase above referred to, and after the plaintiffs had executed said division agreement the same was delivered to, and accepted by, the Pierce Petroleum Corporation; that the division agreement was in all things accepted and acquiesced in by the defendant herein, who held the same and assented to its terms and acted thereon by making its connections as therein provided, by taking all of said oil as therein provided, by paying for the same as therein provided and set forth, and in every way performing said contract as therein provided until the 10th day of June, 1925, that no objection or objections, was or were, made to said agreement, held it and acted upon it as a valid instrument, and not until just prior to the breach of said contract by the defendant herein. A copy of said division agreement is hereto attached, marked Exhibit A and made a part hereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">In their brief appellants say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">\u201cTherefore, we. unhesitatingly assert that under any theory of the ease, this contract was both made on March 6, 1925, by Kistler, the duly authorized agent, and it was readopted, and its terms agreed to by the parties, on March 15, 1925, when they connected to the wells and commenced running the oil under its provisions, and paying for it under the specific terms of the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">The case was tried upon that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">It will thus be seen that the petition declares upon this specific contract of March 6, 1925, a contract by its terms \u201cnot to be performed within a year from the making thereof,\u201d and not subject to validation by part performance. Browne on Statute of Frauds (25th Ed.) \u00a7 272, p. 359; Pomeroy on Contracts (2d Ed.) p. 141; Chitty on Contracts (11th Ed.) p. 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">The courts with substantial unanimity support the text-writers in this regard. Furthermore, the doctrine of part performance by tho buyer, to take a contract out of the statute of frauds, obtains only in equity. Franklin v. Matoa Gold Mining Co. (C. C. A. 8) 158 F. 941, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 381, 14 Ann. Cas. 302; Pomeroy on Contracts (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 98, 99, p. 139. And this is an action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">Finding no error in the application of the law to the facts found, we conclude that the judgment below in all four eases should be affirmed; and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
