In the absence of the evidence, it will be presumed that it was sufficient to support the verdict of the jury and the judgment entered thereon. The learned trial justice, disposing of the ease, said: \u201cThe court is of opinion that the regularity of the proceedings should be presumed; as well, also, that it should be presumed that there was testimony in the case tending to support the jurisdictional aver-ments found in the petition for the writ de lun\u00e1tico to the effect that the respondent, in addition to being of unsound mind, had tendencies dangerous either to herself or others; and, a fortiori, should such presumption be indulged in as against a collateral attack subsequently made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">It is further asserted that the notice served upon appellant in the lunacy proceedings was insufficient and void. It appears, however, that appellant appeared and was present at the proceedings, which constitutes a waiver of any defect in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">As further bearing on the insufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s petition to invoke the jurisdiction sought, it may be suggested that while a decree of insanity may be inquired into at any time for the purpose of determining whether or 'not the person has become sane, the petition to vacate in the present ease contains no suggestion of present sanity, nor is any such contention made in the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
