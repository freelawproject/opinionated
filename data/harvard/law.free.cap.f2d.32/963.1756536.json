W., his home. The testimony indicates that the defendant occupied the second floor of the building. The officers entered the hall on the first floor, went upstairs, and, finding the door of defendant\u2019s place unlocked, entered. \u201cZerega was sitting at a blackjack table, dealing blackjack and there was considerable silver on the table.\u201d There was a telephone operator in the \u2019phone booth. Zerega, questioned, \u201cstated that he was running the whole place; that he usually used it only for taking bets on the horses.\u201d Two other witnesses, who were in the place at the time of the arrest, testified to the effect that they were there for the purpose of making a bet on a horse race. One testified that at the time he placed a bet \u201che was pretty sure it was with the defendant; the defendant was behind the b\u00f3oth with ear \u201c\u2019phones on; and that thereafter the defendant left the booth and went to the blackjack table and started to deal in the blackjack game; and was so engaged when the police came in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">It appeared that the officers had a warrant of arrest, which on its face showed that a police officer by the name of Cox had made oath before the presiding judge of the- police court of the District of Columbia that the defendant on a day named did set up, use, and permit to be used, a gaming table in his premises. Counsel for the defendant offered to show that the warrant was void because Cox did not appear before the presiding judge of the police court oji the District of Columbia, or any other magistrate authorized to issue warrants, but that, on the contrary, he appeared \u201cbefore a deputy clerk of the Polite Court of the District of Columbia and induced him to issue a warrant for the arrest of the defendant.\u201d The court declined to permit the introduction of such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">At the close of the government\u2019s ease, counsel for defendant moved the court to strike out all the evidence (introduced by the government without objection) \u201cwhich had been obtained by the officers as a result of their entry into the premises of the defendant for the reason * * * that the warrant was.not issued by a judicial magistrate after a finding of probable cause for the issuance of the warrant.\u201d The court declined to grant this motion, and defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"axv-dedup-1\">Section 865 of the Code, by prescribing a maximum penalty of five years\u2019 imprisonment for setting up or keeping a gaming table, makes the offense a f\u00e9l\u00f3ny. See Act of March 4, 1909, 35 Stat. 1152 (Cr. Code, \u00a7 335; U. S. C., tit. 18, \u00a7 541 [18 USCA \u00a7 541]). Zerega was apprehended in the act of violating the provisions of this section. Therefore, no warrant for his arrest was necessary. Carroll v. Parry, 48 App. D. C. 453, 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">It is perhaps not inappropriate to suggest that the issuance of a warrant of arrest is a judicial act which can be exercised only by an officer authorized by law. 16 C. J. 299, \u00a7 517. In Marks v. Eckerman, 57 App. D. C. 340, 23 F.(2d) 761, 56 Wash. Law Rep. 22, we held that a municipal court clerk in Ohio, having the status there of a magistrate, would be so regarded here; but the Ohio statute expressly authorizes such a clerk to issue a warrant of arrest. No such authority is conferred upon the clerk and deputy clerks of the police court of the District of Columbia. Section 54 of the Code merely provides that \u201cthe said clerk and deputy clerks shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">Counsel for defendant at the dose of the Government\u2019s ease also \u201cmoved the Court to require the Government to elect on which of the counts it desired the ease submitted to the jury, for the reason that in view of the fact that the entire transaction took place in one room, the defendant could not be found guilty on more than one count.\u201d The motion was overruled, and an exception noted. Counsel now seek greatly to enlarge the scope of their contention by insisting that two separate and distinct offenses are charged by sections 865 and 869 of the Code, and that \u201cas the record now stands, defendant has been found guilty of a felony, for the commission of an offense specifically described and nominated a misdemeanor.\u201d Section 869 reads, in part, as follows: \u201cPool selling, and so forth. \u2014 It shall be unlawful for any person or association of persons to bet, gamble, or make books or pools on the result of any trotting or running race of horses, or boat race, or race of any kind, or on any election, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>or any contest of any kind, or game of base ball.\u201d Counsel for the government cites Swan v. United States, 54 App. D. C. 100, 295 F. 921, but an examination of that decision does not disclose that section 869 was considered by the court. But see Miller v. United States, 6 App. D. C. 6, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Counts, 6, 7, and 8 clearly cover an offense under section 865, and the evidence justified a conviction under those counts. The sentence imposed under all the counts was less than one-third of the maximum sentence that might have been imposed under either counts 6, 7, or 8. The other counts need not be considerd. Sinclair v. United States, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States on April 8, 1929, 49 S. Ct. 268, 73 L. Ed. - \u2014; Abrams v. United States, 250 U. S. 616, 619, 40 S. Ct. 17, 63 L. Ed. 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">It results that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
