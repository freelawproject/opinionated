But it denied that this merchandise was subject to customs duties and denied that the merchandise was unlawfully laded at night on said automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-11\"> On the issues thus made, the parties were entitled to a trial by jury. The District Court heard the case without a jury, but without tthe written stipulation required by R. S. \u00a7 649 (28 USCA \u00a7 773). Garnhart v. United States, 16 Wall. 162, 165, 21 L. Ed. 275; Confiscation Cases, 7 Wall. 454, 462, 19 L. Ed. 196; Armstrong\u2019s Foundry, 6 Wall. 766, 18 L. Ed. 882; National Surety Co. v. United States (C. C. A. 9) 17 F.(2d) 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">On the record thus made, without an agreed statement of facts before the District Court, the right of review in this court is limited to the process, pleadings, and judgment. City of Cleveland v. Walsh Construction Co. (C. C. A.) 279 F. 57; Buessel v. United States (C. C..A.) 258 F. 811; Ulmer et al. v. United States (C. C. A.) 266- F. 176; Streeter v. Sanitary District (C. C. A.) 133 F. 124; Ladd &amp; Tilton Bank v. Hicks Co. (C. C. A.) 218 F. 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-14\">The record on.which the ease has been argued has further fatal defects: The final decree is dated January 5, 1928. On November 23, 1928, an agreed statement of the ease signed by counsel for appellant and the United States Attorney, was filed, which was approved by the court below on November 26, 1928. -Obviously, this agreed statement of the case, filed and approved long after the court below had lost all jurisdiction of the ease, is no part of the record for this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-15\">It remains to consider whether, on the process and pleadings and judgment, forfeiture can be sustained. Castro v. United States (C. C. A.) 23 F.(2d) 263, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-16\">The government grounds its ease for forfeiture under R. S. \u00a7\u00a7 3061 and 3062 (19 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 482, 483), the pertinent parts of which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-17\">\u201cSec. 3061. Any of the officers or persons authorized to board or search vessels may stpp, search, and examine, as well without as within their respective districts, any vehicle, * * * on which * '* * he or they shall suspect there is merchandise which is subject to duty, or shall have been introduced into the United States in any manner contrary to law, whether * * * by, in, or upon such vehicle * * * or otherwise, and, * * * if any such officer or other person so authorized shall find any merchandise on or about any such vehicle, * * * Which' he shall have reasonable cause to believe is subject to duty, or to have been unlawfully introduced into the United States, whether * * * by, in, or upon such vehicle, * * * or otherwise, he shall seize and' secure the same for trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-22\">\u201cSec. 3062. Every such vehicle and * * * all other * * * means of concealment, * * * shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-25\">The power to .search and seize given by these sections is subject to the express provision that the officer \u201cshall have reasonable cause to believe\u201d that the merchandise found in such vehicle \u201cis subject to duty\u201d; or has been \u201cunlawfully introduced into the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-26\">The gist, then, of this ease is whether the libel sets forth facts from which it can be fairly inferred that the liquors seized on this auto truck had been smuggled. Plainly, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>does not. The mere fact that the merchandise in question, being' loaded on the truck at the place of seizure, is in part described as Scotch whisky and Holland gin \u2014 without stating\" that the liquors bore foreign labels or other facts indicating foreign origin\u2014 is not enough to make the libel adequate within the fair meaning of section 3061.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The,same observation is applicable to the second paragraph, which also proceeds on the theory that the liquors, being unlawfully laded at night, were smuggled \u2014 without stating any grounds on which a reasonable person could fairly infer foreign origin. In Brown v. United States, 16 F.(2d) 682, 685, this court held that the fact that the liquors were taken from a schooner anchored 30 miles at sea in Rum Row did not warrant the inference that it Was of foreign origin. In this information is no allegation that the seized liquor had been unloaded from a vessel \u2014 nothing but the charge of seizure on land at North Plymouth.-</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Por these reasons, we are constrained to hold the information inadequate to support the judgment of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The judgment of forfeiture must be vacated, and the ease remanded to the District Court with opportunity to the government to file an amended libel and have a new trial; and if such trial is before the court without a jury, and the parties desire to preserve a right to a full review in this court, a written stipulation waiving a jury, as required by R. S. \u00a7 649, should be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The judgment or decree of the District Court is vacated, and the ease is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
