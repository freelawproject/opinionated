This stipulation left no legal room for the plaintiff\u2019s contention that it had a continuing right for commissions on the remaining half of the schedule approved by defendant for advertising in ' the Saturday Evening Post and Collier\u2019s Weekly; for the orders given by the plaintiff to these publishing concerns were, as plainly appears by the correspondence and otherwise, not \u201ccommitments\u201d made at the request of the defendant, within the fair meaning of this stipulation. They were nothing but revocable orders, whieh, in fact, plaintiff canceled after receiving notice from the defendant of the termination of its contract with the defendant. The fact that orders for publishing the same advertisements were made by the defendant through another advertising agency gave the plaintiff no legal cause for complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed, with costs to the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
