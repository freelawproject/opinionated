The first alleges that on or about the 3d of February, 1865, the defendant, John K. Comstock, sold the plaintiff, Creighton, three floats in a raft of pine timber, Creighton having previously taken one float out of the same raft; that Comstock represented that there were three floats, the ice and snow at the time of purchasing preventing any accurate measurement; that in point of fact there were but two floats, instead of three, and that Comstock, therefore, received one-third more money than he ought to have received, together with a small amount for difference between pine and hemlock timber, not now material to be considered. On this 'cause of action plaintiff' claims to recover $1,296.72. For a second cause of action, Creighton says that upon the same date, February 3, 1865, he bought of Comstock a raft of hemlock timber for $300, and paid for it. That defendant, Comstock, was to be responsible for the safety of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>raft, and if lost by high water or casualty, the loss was to fall upon Comstock. That it was so lost, and plaintiff \u25a0therefore asks to recover back said $300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-5\">A judgment is asked by Creighton for $1,596.72, and interest from February 3, 1865</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-6\">The answer is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-7\">\u201c The defendant, for answer to the petition of plaintiff, .\u25a0says that he is not indebted to said plaintiff in any sum as therein charged. He denies that he sold and delivered a \u2022.float out of a raft of timber to the said plaintiff, but avers that the said plaintiff used said floats without the authority \u25a0of defendant. He denies that he made any representations in regard to said raft, but avers that the said plaintiff examined the same, and purchased without warranty and representations, but on prior inspection thereof; that no representations were made as to kind and quality, and that the said contract and sale were reduced to writing between the parties, and that the said timber was purchased for more or less by the plaintiff'.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-8\">\u201c The defendant, in answer to the second cause of action, \u25a0says that he denies that he sold plaintiff the timber therein mentioned; that it was agreed between the parties that plaintiff therefor should pay the party in charge for his ser\u25a0vices in taking charge of the same ; that no moneys came to plaintiff therefor, or that he made any representations in relation thereto, and denies that the defendant is indebted to plaintiff in any sum, and asks to be dismissed with his -costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-9\">The reply is:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-10\">\u201c The plaintiff, by way of reply to the new matter set up in the answer of the defendant, says that it is not true, that the contract referred to in his first cause of action, was reduced to writing. He says that a contract by which defendant became liable to make good any loss of said timber by ice \u25a0or high water was reduced to writing; but that no contract as to timber was written, except as herein already stated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-11\">The contract referred to in these pleadings is this :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201c Columbia, <em>February </em>3, 1865.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-4\">\u201c R.

It also appeared, from the evidence, that Creighton gave a note to Comstock, for $5,000, in payment for the timber; that Comstock got the note discounted, and transferred it, before maturity, for a valuable consideration, to an innocent holder. Creighton, under these circumstances, paid' this note. The court very properly charged that such payment did not bar Creighton\u2019s right to recover for the deficiency of timber.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The court also charged the jury, \u201c That if they found', from the evidence, that the plaintiff, after discovering the deficiency in the quantity of the timber in controversy, sawed and disposed of it and failed to bring suit on account of the deficiency for six months or more thereafter, and had failed to show that he made a claim or demand of, or gave notice to, Comstock on account of such deficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>during that period, it may be considered as evidence of a ratification of the sale and a waiver of a claim for loss in quantity, and if you so find, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover.\u201d To which plaintiff then excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">This, we think, was calculated to' mislead.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The court did not, probably, mean to be understood as saying that a delay in bringing suit for six months was a waiver of the claim. Nor could they have meant that failing to give notice of the deficiency of the claim, for that length of time, was such waiver; and yet the jury, having their attention directed to the matter in this way, might have erroneously supposed such to be the law. The court say this might be \u201c considered as evidence of a waiver.\u201d Doubtless there might be cases where, the issue being upon the question of waiver, delay in setting up a claim might properly be considered; but we find no such issue made in these pleadings. The answer does not make the slightest allusion to the subject, nor do we find in the record any evidence shoeing that the parties made this a material point. Certainly there is nothing to justify the assumption that any waiver had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">With regard to the second cause of action : This was to recover the $300 paid for the hemlock raft. Creighton paid to one Orr the amount; it appearing that Comstock was owing Orr, and was satisfied with this arrangement. It was, therefore, in fact, a payment to Comstock. This raft was to be at Comstock\u2019s risk, and was lost by high water. Creighton had paid for it, and, in our judgment, was entitled to recover the money back; and upon what ground the jury proceeded, in ignoring the claim, we are unable to see. The answer to this second cause of action does not appear t\u2018o deny the allegations of the petition that Creighton bought, that the risk was Comstock\u2019s, and that the raft was lost. The evidence sustains these allegations, and the right of recovery, to the extent of the sum paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">It seems to be claimed, in argument, that this loss was in some way attributable to some negligence in Creighton, but this view is not sustained by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Judgment of District Court and Common Pleas reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b563-5\">Scott, Chief Judge, Day, Johnson, and Ashburn, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
