The plaintiff is widow of Thomas B. Smith, deceased, who was the son of John Smith, late of Cincinnati, deceased, and the defendants are the children and heirs of John Smith. The question of title turns principally upon the. construction of a deed of John Smith to his son, Thomas B. Smith, made May 9, 1850, whereby, in consideration of $1,625 to him paid, and in further consideration of natural love and affection, \u201cJohn Smith sold, granted, and conveyed unto the said <em>Thomas B. Smith and his heirs </em>the following described .real estate\u201d [describing it], \u201cto have and to hold the same to the said Thomas B. Smith during his natural life, and after his death to his heirs forever; provided, that if the said Thomas B. Smith shall die without children, then and in that event the property hereby conveyed is to revert and vest in the heirs of the said John B. Smith, the grantor herein.\u201d Thomas B. Smith had seven children, but they, .and his father, John Smith, all died in his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">Eor the plaintiff, it is claimed that the deed conveyed to Thomas B. Smith a fee-simple estate; that the <em>habendum </em>\u2022clause is repugnant to the granting clause, and must be rejected ; and that on the death of Thomas B. Smith without \u25a0children, the plaintiff, as his wife, inherited the fee, under the statute law of Ohio.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The defendants, on the contrary, claim that upon the deed, considered as a whole, it appears that the grantor intended to convey only a life estate, or else a fee-simple, determinable on the death of Thomas B. Smith without children, so that when Thomas B. Smith died, the estate passed by this deed directly to the issue of John Smith.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-4\"><em>King &amp;; Thompson, </em>with <em>Von Seggern, </em>for plaintiff in error r</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b382-5\">Insisted that the deed operated as a sale and not as a gift; that the intention of the deed must govern. 2 Blk.

Nor is there any reason why the term \u201c heirs \u201d in the granting clause might not be explained or qualified in the clauses which follow, so as to limit the grant to the issue \u2022of the grantee, and to show that the grantee was only to take a life estate or a qualified fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The property is conveyed by the granting clause to Thomas and his heirs, but the fee thus granted in general terms, by the more specific language that follows, is explained so as to mean a fee, qualified with the condition that if he died without issue, it should go to and vest in the heirs or issue of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">We think no construction more favorable to the plaintiff than this can be given to the deed, without doing violence to the intention of the grantor, as manifested therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">It follows that when Thomas died without issue living, the estate passed, by the deed, to the issue of John Smith, the grantor, and left nothing to the plaintiff by way of inheritance or of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-12\">Scott, Chief Judge, Wright, Johnson, and Ashburn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
