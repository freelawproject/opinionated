The writ of <em>ne exeat, </em>under tbe practice prior to tbe adoption of tbe code of civil procedure, was a process in chancery, and in aid of the chancery jurisdiction of the courts, issued upon cause shown, to restrain a party from leaving the state until bail was given to perform the decree of the court. It was limited, in equity, to suits to recover an equitable debt or money demand.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AV2\"><em>2. </em>As to all civil actions coming within the provisions of the civil code, this writ is abolished.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-8\">Error to the District Court of Erie County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-9\">This is an action on a penal bond against the sureties, the principles not being before the court. The bond was .given by John Beck and Sarah, his wife, to obtain their discharge from arrest in an action then pending against \u25a0them, upon a writ of <em>ne exeat, </em>issued in said action upon the \u25a0order by a judge of tbe Court of Common Pleas of said \u25a0county. The following is a statement of the causes of action in which the writ was issued :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b664-10\">On the 14th of December, 1871, -the plaintiff filed his petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie county, Ohio, wherein he represented that on the twentieth of October, 1870, he filed his petition in the same court against John Beck and Sarah Beck, defendants; setting forth that said John Beck, on the 7th of December, 1868, entered into a written contract with the plaintiff', whereby he acknowledged to have received of the plaintiff $800, for which he agreed to <em>furnish to said Gable </em>a Government title, or Government certificate of entry of the undivided one-half of the lands therein described.; to be furnished within two months from the date, and the other half he agreed to locate <em>in his own name. </em>The lands were particularly described and located in Wisconsin. It was further set forth in said contract that said John Beck, had before that time discovered valuable copper mines on said land, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>made all improvements on said land to entitle him to locate the same under the laws of\u2019 the United States. That said mines were of good quality, and that his statements in said contract \u2014 in regard to the quality of said mines, and to all other matters connected therewith \u2014 were true in every particular. That it was further prescribed in said contract that if Beck should fail to furnish Cable, within two months, the title to said lands, Beck was to refund to Cable said $800, with the interest. That it was also stated in said contract that Beck claimed he had expended on said land the sum of $2,000, one-half of which he (Cable) was to pay Beck at any time Beck might call for it, provided the statements he made in the contract were true. And further alleged, that at the time Cable paid Beck the $800, and when the contract was made, Beck, for the purpose of defrauding Cable, represented that he could purchase said lands of the United States as mineral lands, and would be obliged to. pay therefor the sum of $5 per acre. That Cable, relying on the statements of Beck, supposed said lands -were exceedingly valuable; all of which was false. That the lands were purchased of government at $1.25 per acre by Beck, and paid for out of the money of Cable. That Beck took a certificate of location in the name of his wife Sarah Beck and Lawrence Cable. That Beck refused to deliver said certificate to Cable, and had never furnished Cable with any government title or certificate for any part thereof; but to do so wholly refused and still refuses ; that said John and Sarah Beck were about to leave the state ; that they had' no property in the state, save their household goods, which w'ere ready to be shipped out of the state; .and that they were entirely insolvent; and if they departed from the state, said Cable would be remediless in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-5\">It was also averred in said petition that Beck was at the time said petition was filed indebted to Cable in the sum of $400. The plaintiff asked an injunction against John and Sarah Beck, to enjoin them from transferring said certificate to anybody other than the plaintiff; also that a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>of <em>ne exeat </em>might issue against them, to prevent them from departing the state until they have transferred said certificate to the plaintiff, or until they should give sufficient security to perform the judgment and decree of the court to-be rendered in said case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-4\">Plaintiff averred that on the 20th of October, 1870, Judge-Stone, a judge of said court, made an order as follows: \u201cUpon the application of the plaintiff, an injunction is-hereby allowed in the above-named case, restraining the-defendants, as prayed for in the petition. The plaintiff is-required, before the order takes effect, to give an undertaking to defendants, in the sum of $500, conditioned and with securities as required by law. And upon the application of the plaintiff, a writ of <em>ne exeat </em>is hereby granted and allowed in said ease against the said defendants, and the-sum of $1,000 is fixed as the amount of security to be given by said defendants, to the plaintiff, to procure their discharge, which amount is ordered to be indorsed on said, writ.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-5\">The plaintiff gave the bond, and the wilt was issued, and legally served by the sheriff' of said county, and said John and Sarah taken into custody, and thereupon they gave the bond, with Elis'ha Alvord and Voltaire Scott as-securities in the sum of $1,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-6\">The condition of the bond was : \u201cNow, if the said John Beck and Sarah Beck shall do and perform the decree and-judgment of said court that shall be rendered against them, or either of them, in said action in the said Court of Common Pleas, or in any court into which said action may be carried or appealed, then,' and in such case, the above obligation is to be void ; otherwise, to be and remain ;in full force and virtue.\u201d On the execution of said bond ^they were discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-7\">At the October term of said court, 1873, the court found that the contract was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff^ as alleged in the petition, and-that John Beck was indebted to the plaintiff\u2019 in the-sum of $468.60. They were required to transfer and-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>deliver the certificate, etc., and to pay the amount due, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-5\">They failed to perform the decree, and this suit was-brought on the bond, to recover the penalty. \u2022.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-6\">The breaches' of the bond alleged are, that they did not transfer the certificate for the laud, nor convey the same to-plaintiff, as decreed by the court, nor did they pay the money judgment and costs, by reason of which judgment of $1,000 is demanded on the bond. The District Court affirmed the judgment of the Common Pleas, holding the plaintiff had no cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-7\">To reverse these judgments, this action is brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b667-8\"><em>H.

Stat. \u25a053), it is provided:</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-5\">\u00a3\u00a3 Sec. 1.

See <em>Cass </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>2 Ohio St. 607; <em>Ohio ex rel. Evans </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>1 Ohio St. 437. This necessarily involves the inquiry as to what laws were in force, when the new constitution took effect, which \u25a0.authorized the issuing of the writ of <em>ne exeat </em>as a provisional remedy or remedial writ. By sections 36 and 87 of the act of March 14, 1831, <em>\u201c </em>directing the mode of proceeding in chancery,\u201d the Supreme Court, or any judge thereof, and the Court of Common Pleas, or any president judge thereof, might order the issuing of writs of <em>ne exeat. </em>'.Swan\u2019s Stat. (1841), 710.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-7\">The code of civil procedure of the State of Ohio saw \u2022passed by the legislature on the 11th of March, 1853, and by section 614, S. &amp; C. 1136, took'effect <em>July </em>1, 1853, .and not <em>June </em>1, 1853, as stated by compiler. By section 606 of the codte, S. &amp; C. 1133, the act of 1831, and which \u2022was the practice act of the old court of chancery, and which contained the two sections above referred to, together with all amendments to that act, were repealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-8\">There was then no law in force when the new constitution took effect which authorized the issuing of the writ of <em>ne exeat </em>by the Court of Common Pleas, and if the power has been possessed by that court at any time since the 1st day of July, 1851, it has been granted by legislation since that date. The only law enacted by the legislature under the new constitution which authorized the issuing of writs \u2022of <em>ne exeat </em>was passed on the 19th day of February, 1852. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>3 Curwen\u2019s Revised Stat. 1701, chap. 1115. The power to issue writs of <em>ne exeat </em>was conferred by section 4 of this act upon the Supreme Court; by section-13 upon the District Coui\u2019ts, and by section 15 upon the Courts of Common Pleas. A general power to issue writs was also conferred by section 18. Sections 4, 13, and 15 of said act continued in force a little more than one year, and were then all repealed by the act of 14th of March, 1853, an act passed three days after the act establishing our code of civil procedure. 3 Curwen\u2019s Rev. Stat. 2249, chap. 1115. Section 18 of the act of February 19, 1852, was repealed by the act of April 30, 1852 (3 Curwen\u2019s Rev. Stat. 1733, chap. 1133, sec. 4), and section 1 of the act of April 30, 1852, is also repealed by section 9 of the act of 14th of March, 1853, above referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b669-5\">The act establishing a code of civil procedure, and the act of March 14, 1853, above referred to, both took effect on the 1st day of July, 1853, and section 6 of the last-named-\u2022act (3 Curwen, 2250), in speaking of former laws, provides, in substance, that they shall not have force and effect when they conflict with or are repugnant to the code, or with any law passed since the present constitution took effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b669-6\">Since July 1,1853, there has at no time existed any power -or authority in the Court of Common Pleas, or any other court of this state, to issue, or order and direct the issuing \u25a0of any writ of <em>ne </em>exeat, and it can not be done without overriding and violating the express provisions of the code.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b669-7\">Johnson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHX\">The only question made in this case is, whether there was jurisdiction to issue the writ of <em>ne exeat, </em>and require the defendants, John.and Sarah Beck, to give bail to obtain their discharge. From the record before us, it would seem that the injunction -was allowed, and the writ of <em>ne exeat </em>issued on the order of the judge, <em>at </em>chambers, and not by the court; but as counsel have argued the case as if it was upon orders of the <em>court, </em>we will consider the question in that aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The writ in question appears to have been granted upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the petition, and without other affidavit than the verification to the petition, and without requiring the plaintiff to give bond, as in cases of arrest and bail, as required by the civil code. It was based on an allegation that defendants were about to leave the state; that they had no property in the state, save household goods, which were ready to be shipped out of the state ; that they were insolvent, and if they left the state the plaintiff'would be without remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The relief sought was a specific performance of the contract for the land, and for a money judgment on the indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The Common Pleas gave judgment as prayed for, that the land should be conveyed, and, in default, that the decree should operate as such conveyance, and also for the four-hundred-dollar debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">This action was then brought on the bond, and the breach alleged is that John and Sarah Beck failed to perform that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">It is conceded that since the adoption of the code of civil procedure, and the passage of the act of March 14, 1858, \u201c to amend an act relating to the organization of courts of justice, and their powers and duties\u201d (1 S. &amp; C. 382), both of which took effect July 1, 1853, there is no power in the court to issue a writ of <em>ne </em>exeat, unless it can be derived from section 603 of that code, which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Rights of civil action, given' or secured by existing laws, shall be prosecuted in the manner provided by this code, except as provided in section 604. <em>If a case ever arise, 'in which an action for the enforcement and protection of a right, or the redress or prevention of a, wrong, can not be had under this code, the practice heretofore in use may be adopted, as far as may be necessary to prevent a failure of justice.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">The 36th section of \u201c an act directing the mode of proceeding in chancery,\u201d passed March 14, 1831 (Swan Stat. 1840, p. 710), authorized the Supreme Court, or any judge thereof, and the Court of Common Pleas, or any president judge thereof, \u201c to grant writs of <em>ne exeat </em>to prevent the departure of any defendant out of this state, until security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>is given to perform the decree.\u201d This could he done in \u25a0term-time or in vacation upon petition filed, with an affidavit annexed of the truth of the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">This act was repealed by section 606 of the code (2 S. \u25a0&amp; C. 1133), and is no longer in force, unless saved by the provisions of section 603, above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">It is claimed in argument that the case in w\u00edxich the writ was issued was <em>\u201c </em>an action for the enforcement and protection of a right,\u201d and \u201c the redress and prevention of a wrong \u201d that \u201c could not be had under the code,\u201d and therefore, to prevent \u201c a failure of justice,\u201d the practice \u201c heretofore in use;\u201d that is, this act of 1831, might be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">It is urged that this provision of section 603 is in the nature of a saving clause to the repeal of the old chancery practice, and that the original action of plaintiff was one \u2022coming within it.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The writ of <em>ne exeat, </em>as it was known and used in Ohio, prior to the code, was a process in chancery, and occupied the same relation-to the suit in chancery as the <em>capias respondendum </em>did to an action at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">The constitution of 1802, art. 3, sec. 3, gave the Court of Common Pleas \u201c common-law and chancery jurisdiction in all such cases as shall be directed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">By the act of February 7, 1831, to organize the judicial courts (Swan Stat. 1840, p. 222), the Court of Common Pleas \u201c shall have original jurisdiction in all civil cases, both at law and in equity, where the sum or matter in dispute exceeds the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace ; . . and shall have the same power to issue remedial and other process (writs of error and mandamus excepted) as the Supreme Court has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">By the same act (sec. 3) it is provided <em>\u201c </em>that the Supreme Court shall have powex\u2019, oxi good cause shown, to issue writs of <em>habeas corpus, cum causa, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, procedendo, error supersedeas, habeas corpus ne exeat, </em>and .all other writs not otherwise specially provided for by statute, which may be neeessai\u2019y to enforce the due administration of right and justice throxxghout the state, and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>exercise of its jurisdiction agreeably to the usages and principles of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">This act remained in force until after the constitution of 1851 was adopted. By art. 9, sec. 4, of that instrument,. \u201c The jurisdiction of the Courts of Common Pleas, and the judges thereof, shall be fixed by law,\u201d and by the schedule (sec. 1), \u201c all laws of this state in force on the first .day of September, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, not inconsistent with this constitution, shall continue-in force until amended or repealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">By \u201c an act relating to the organization of courts of justice, and their powers and duti\u00e9s,\u201d passed February 19y 1852 (3 Curwen, 1701), sec. 15, \u201cthe Court-of Common Pleas shall have original jurisdiction in all civil cases, in law and equity, when the sum of matter in dispute exceeds the jurisdiction of justices of the peace; . . and; shall have the same power to issue remedial and other process, writs of error, <em>quo warranto, </em>and <em>mandamus, </em>as the-District Court has.\u201d By sec. 13 of the same act, \u201c The-District Court, in addition to the original jurisdiction conferred by art. 4, sec. 6, of the constitution, shall have power,, on good cause shown, to issue writs of error, <em>certiorari, supersedeas, ne exeat, </em>and all other writs not specially provided for by statute, whenever such writs may be necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction in the due administration of justice throughout the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Sections 13 and 15 were repealed by the amendatory act,, passed March 14, 1853 (1 S. &amp; C. 382). By section 2 of this act, which took the place of section 13, \u201c the District Court . . shall have power on good cause shown to issue writs-of error and <em>certiorari </em>in criminal cases, and all other writs, not specially provided for, nor prohibited by statute, whenever they may be necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction; in the due administration of justice ;\u201d and by section 5 of that act (3 Curwen, 2250), \u201c the Common Pleas shall have-the same power to issue remedial and other process <em>{quowarranto </em>and <em>mandamus </em>excepted) as the District Court, has.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>In the legislation prior to this act of 1853, which took effect the same date as the code (July 1,1853), <em>ne exeat </em>was specially named as one of the writs which the court could issue, hut it was omitted in the act of 1853. \"Why was this ? By keeping in the mind the fact that the same legislature which passed the act of 1853 also adopted the code, the force of this omission is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The code of civil procedure was intended to provide a general mode of proceeding applicable to all civil actions both at law and in equity, unless excepted in its provisions. The commissioners who submitted that code to the legislature, on page 84 of their report, in explaining the chapter on \u201c arrest and bail,\u201d say that the spirit of our modern legislation is against imprisonment for debt, and add: \u201c This chapter supplants, it may be said, the old <em>capias respondendum, and the writ ne exeat.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Looking at this legislation,it is manifest it was the intention of the legislature to abolish this writ, and restrict the power of arrest in all actions at law <em>and in equity </em>to civil actions, <em>\u201c for the recovery of money, </em>where it comes within the provisions of the code.\u201d (Code of Civil Procedure, title 8, chap. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">This view is strongly supported by the fact that all the prior acts conferring power on the Courts of Common Pleas specially name the writ of ne <em>exeat </em>as one of the-remedial writs the courts may issue, while in the act of 1853 it is omitted, and additional force is given to this view when we look to the act of April 29, 1854 (1 S. &amp; C. 386), to amend section 5 of the act of 1853. By this amendatory section, the clause in that section which provides that \u201c the Common Pleas shall have the same power to issue remedial and other process <em>(quo warranto </em>and <em>mandamus </em>excepted) as the Distinct Court has,\u201d is omitted, leaving the granted jurisdiction to stand as to \u201c all civil cases where the sum or matter in dispute exceeds the jurisdiction of justices of the peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">This omitted clause in section 5 of the act of 1853 left the power of the court as to remedial process to depend on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>section 6 of the act of 1858 (1 S. &amp; 0. 383). It reads as follows : \u201cAll process and remedies authorized by the laws of this state, when the present constitution took effect, <em>not hereinbefore provided for, </em>may be had and resorted to in the courts of the proper jurisdiction under the present constitution, and all the laws regulating the practice of and imposing duties on, or granting powers to the Supreme Court, or any judge thereof, and the Courts of Common Pleas, or any judge thereof, respectively, <em>under the former constitution, </em>in regard to matters <em>not hereinbefore provided for, </em>except as to matters of probate jurisdiction, in force when the present constitution took effect, shall govern the practice of and impose like duties on the District Courts and Courts of Common Pleas and the judges thereof respectively, created by the present constitution, so far as such process, remedies, and laws shall be applicable to said courts respectively and the judges thereof, <em>and not inconsistent with the act entitled \u2018 an act to establish a code of civil procedure,\u2019 nor with the laws passed, since the present constitution took effect, and which laws are still in force.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">A majority of the court are of the opinion that this section is not broad enough to embrace a <em>ne exeat, </em>which, by the same amendatory act, was omitted, in view of the provisions of the code, and the express l\u2019epeal of the chancery practice act by the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">This view is made clear by an examination of the nature and office of the <em>ne exeat </em>as a process in chancery prior to the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Cousins, </em>6 Randolph (Va.) 191, it is.said: The <em>ne exeat, </em>as now understood and practiced upon, is a proceeding in equity to obtain <em>bail </em>in a case where there is a <em>debt due </em>in equity, though not at law, except in cases of account and perhaps a few other cases of concurrent jurisdiction. The general rule is, that where you can get bail at law, equity will not grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">\u201c In the exercise of this power, courts of equity will be very cautious, as it is a strong step, tending to abridge the liberty of the citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u201c To induce that court to issue a <em>ne exeat, </em>it must appear : 1. That there is a <em>precise amount of debt positively due. </em>2. That it is an <em>equitable </em>demand, upon which the plaintiff can not sue at law, except as before, on account and some other cases of concurrent jurisdiction. 8. That the defendant is about quitting the country to avoid payment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Lord Eldon says: \u201c The affidavit to authorize the writ must be as positive as to the equitable debt as an affidavit -of a legal debt to hold to bail.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Petrie, </em>10 Vesey, 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\"><em>Blaydes </em>v. <em>Calvert, </em>2 Jacobs &amp; Walk. 211, was a bill to \u25a0enforce an agreement to give a bill of exchange to secure the debt of a third person, and prayed for a <em>ne exeat regno.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Lord Eldon says: \u201c After looking into the books, my present opinion is that the party can not be held to equitable bail; in other words, I do not find authority to warrant granting the writ in such a ease as this.\u201d The reason was it was not a <em>money demand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A71\"><em>Cowdin </em>v. <em>Cram, </em>3 Edw. Ch. 232, was a demand for a <em>ne exeat. </em>It is there said that whenever, in a bill for specific performance, the writ is allowed, it has. been against the <em>vendee, </em>where there is a <em>money demand </em>which is sought to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">In such eases, if the vendor can give a good title, he may have the writ, provided the defendant is about to leave the jurisdiction; \u201c because there is an <em>equitable money demand </em>or <em>indebtedness, </em>the amount of which governs the court in \u25a0making the writ for bail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">This was a process unknown to the ancient common law, which, in the freedom of its spirit, allowed every man to -depart the realm at his pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">Prom an early period it was used as an auxiliary jurisdiction of courts of equity, and at one time it issued at the instance of the king as a prerogative writ. As a writ of right in cases of private rights, Judge Story says: \u201cIn general, it will not be granted unless in cases of <em>equitable </em>debts; for, in regard to civil rights, it is treated as in the nature of <em>equitable bail.\u201d </em>2 Story Eq. Juris., sec. 1470. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Only two exceptions are recognized; one is the case of alimony decreed to the wife, which will be enforced against the husband by <em>ne </em>exeat, and in cases of account, on which: a balance is admitted by defendant, but a larger claim is insisted on by the creditor. 2 Story Eq., sec. 1470. In. Adams on Eq. 360, the same limitations are used in describing this writ. It is said : \u201c It is granted wherever <em>a present equitable debt is owing, </em>which, if due at law, would warrant an arrest, and also to enforce arrears of alimony in aid of the spiritual court in respect of the inability of that court to require bail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Haff, </em>5 Page, 239, the chancellor says, \u201cthat to entitle the complainant to a writ of <em>ne exeat, </em>he must show a demand actually due at the time the writ issued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">So the writ was refused in <em>Cock </em>v. <em>Ravie, </em>6 Vesey, 283, \u201c upon an undertaking for an indemnity; to obtain it there-must be an equitable demand <em>in the nature of a debt </em>actually due.\u201d Lord 'Eldon asks : \u201c Has it not always been a money demand ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">In <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Colt, </em>1 Hopkins Ch. 500, it is said by the-court: \u201cAccording to the adjudged cases, a positive affidavit of an existing debt is required as a foundation for the writ of <em>ne exeat-, </em>and this rule has been observed with great strictness.\u201d <em>De Carrier </em>v. <em>De Callone, </em>4 Vesey, 577, and notes; <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>7 Vesey, 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">It is never issued to enforce specific performance of an agreement, except where there is a money demand to be enforced in equity. <em>Raynes </em>v. <em>Wyse, </em>2 Merivale, 473; <em>Blaydes </em>v. <em>Calvert, </em>2 Jac. &amp; Walk. 218; nor to compel the defendant to abide the event of an action. <em>Gardner\u2019s case, </em>15 Vesey, 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">It is a writ to obtain equitable bail, <em>Mitchel </em>v. <em>Bunch, </em>2 Page, 617; <em>Smedbarge </em>v. <em>Mark\u2019s Ex\u2019r, </em>6 John. Ch. 138; <em>Dick </em>v. <em>Swinton, </em>1 Vesey &amp; Bearnes, 372; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>19 Ves. 312; <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Sayers, </em>5 Mad. Ch. 471; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>3 Russell, Ch. 598; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>5 Harris <em>&amp; </em>John. 398; <em>Shearman </em>v. <em>Shearman, </em>3 Brown Ch. 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">It is said by Story, that there are two, and <em>only two, </em>ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ceptions to the rule that there must be an equitable money demand, and the affidavit must be as certain as for a <em>capias </em>,- they are in cases of alimony, and the action in equity for an account, when that court has concurrent jurisdiction. Both of these exceptions are mouey demands, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><em>Denton </em>v. <em>Denton, </em>1 John. Ch. 364, is an instance in alimony, and <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>10 Barb. 46, is another.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\"><em>Russell </em>v. <em>Ashby, </em>5 Vesey, 96, is an instance of an equitable action for an account.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In the light of these authorities, as to the office of the-writ <em>ne exeat </em>under the former chancery practice, showing-that it was to a court of equity what a <em>capias </em>for the body was in legal actions \u2014 a process to hold the custody of the-body, until he should give bail to abide the decree of the-court \u2014 we are prepared to appreciate the force of section 145 of the codev It provides, that \u201c A defendant in a <em>civil' action, </em>can be arrested before and after judgment, in the-manner prescribed by this code, <em>and not otherwise; </em>but this, provision does not apply to proceedings for contempt; nor does it apply to actions or judgments prosecuted in file-name of the State of Ohio, to recover fines or penalties for crimes, misdemeanors, or offenses.\u201d The writ of arrest under this section may issue in any civil action, legal or equitable, when there is an affidavit \u201cstating the nature of the-plaintiff\u2019s claim; that it is just, and the amount thereof, as-nearly as may be, and establishing one or more of the \u201d grounds for arrest specified in section 146. This language-is broad enough to embrace equitable money demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Under the analogous section, authorizing attachment in a civil action, it has been held \u201c that the code has extended the remedy, not only by embracing legal cases, in which the remedy had not before been allowed, <em>but also equitable actions brought to recover money, and actions for the recovery-of money only.\u201d </em>Per <em>Gholson, </em>J., <em>Goble </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>12 Ohio St. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">It thus appears that a remedy under the safeguards provided in the code, the affidavit, and the plaintiff\u2019s undertaking, to pay the defendant all damages which he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>sustain by reason of the arrest, if the order be wrongfully \u2022obtained, has been provided by the code, applicable to all \u25a0equitable money demands. Hence the 603d section of the code has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">By that section, \u201c if a case ever arise, in which an action for the enforcement and protection of a right . . . <em>can not be had under the </em>code, the former practice heretofore in use may be adopted, so far as may be necessary to prevent a failure of justice.\u201d It was not the intention of the code to \u2022create <em>new causes of action, </em>but to provide a mode of procedure to \u201c all rights of civil action, given or secured by existing laws,\u201d (except as excepted in section 604).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The writ <em>ne exeat, </em>was a <em>remedial process </em>in chancery, not .an \u201c action for the enforcement and protection of a(right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Neither is it saved by section 6 of the act of 1853. That \u25a0only saves \u201c process and remedies \u201d not inconsistent with the constitution of 1851, nor laws passed since its adoption, nor with the provisions of the code of civil procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">We conclude, therefore, that the code provides as full .and ample remedy for all cases in equity wherein formerly this writ was allowable (in some respects broader than the \u25a0old remedy), under the safeguards with which the liberty of the citizen should always be surrounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">We have examined a number of decisions of the Supreme and Superior Courts of New York, cited by counsel. In some of these, it is held that under a similar provision in the New York code (section 468), the <em>ne exeat </em>is not abolished. See <em>Forrest </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>5 How. 125; <em>Bushnell </em>v. <em>Bushnell, </em>7 How. 393; while other cases hold that it was abolished, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>16 Abb. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">These New York cases cited are cases of alimony. As \u2022our code, section 604, excepts from its operation proceedings relating to alimony, the cases are not analogous. Whether this writ was ever applied in Ohio to cases of alimony, and if so, whether the power to issue it in such cases still exists, we are not called on to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">The action in this case was for both legal and equitable relief. As to the legal demand, it is not claimed but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the plaintiff had ample remedy under the code to prevent the departure of the defendants from the state until they had given bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">As to the equitable demand, which was to compel a vendor to convey the title to lands, we have shown, that under' the former practice the plaintiff' had no right to such a writ, and hence it is not saved by section 603 of the code, nor by the 6th section of the act of 1853, before cited. We hold, therefore, that as to all civil actions covered by the provisions of the code of civil procedure, the writ <em>ne exeat' </em>is abolished in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">This conclusion comports with the spirit of our constitution and laws relating to imprisonment for debt,\"and the ancient maxims of the law, that process which abridges the-liberty of the citizen \"should be resorted to with great caution.</p>\n<judges id=\"b679-7\">Day, Wright, and Ashburn, .TJ., concurred; Scott, O.
