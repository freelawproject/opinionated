Ev. sec. 86; 1 Russell on Crimes, 839; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jeness, </em>5 Mich. 305; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Lovell </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 12 Ind. 18; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>1 Denio, 574; <em>Elam </em>v. <em>The State, </em>26 Ala. 48; <em>Hugh </em>v. <em>The State, </em>35 Ala. 48; <em>Kinchlow </em>v. <em>The State, </em>5 Humph. 9; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>10 Conn. 372; State v. <em>Smith, </em>22 Vt. 74; v. <em>Croteau, </em>23 Vt. 14.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-5\">The plaintiff in error was indicted for a single offense; he was tried for many offenses; he was convicted for some one of the many for which he was tried, but for which one no human being can tell, and there is no device known among men by which it can be ascertained. If the proceedings in this'case be correct, then'a man may at any time be indicted \u2018 for one offense, tried for fifty, and compelled to make defense against all, found guilty for a. different offense from that for which he was indicted, and in conclusion have no idea for what he is convicted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-6\">But there is still another serious question in this case, which is that the defendant in the Common Pleas might have been \u2014 and perhaps was \u2014 convicted without having Peen found guilty by the <em>agreed </em>verdict of the jury; that the jury might, in fact \u2014 and perhaps did \u2014 render a verdict without <em>ever agreeing </em>together; for while one juryman might have thought him guilty of one act of crime, another might have thought him not guilty of that, but guilty of some ether act; and thus, while the jury might have brought in a verdict of guilty, and each juryman thought him guilty of some one offense, yet no two jurymen might have <em>agreed </em>\u25a0as to the identical offense proved. If this practice can be sustained, a defendant may at any time be convicted, and yet no two of the jury ever <em>agree </em>as to the identical offense proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b575-7\">I claim, therefore, that the court erred : 1. In allowing evidence to be given of more than one offense; 2. In refusing to require the state to elect on which offense it relied to sustain the indictment; 3. In charging the jury that to convict they might \u201cconsider all the evidence offered tending to show any of said sales between the first of September, a. d. 1871, and the first day of the present term.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>\u2022Scott, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqe\">As the precise time laid in the indictment is immaterial, the plaintiff in error might well have been convicted, on proof that he committed the offense charged,at any of the times in regard to which evidence was offered by the state. But the indictment contained but one count; the plaintiff in error stood charged by the grand jury with one single misdemeanor, with one specific criminal act. To this charge he had pleaded not guilty. A single issue was thus formed, which it was the province of the jury to determine, according to the evidence, under the instructions of the court. No evidence should have been admitted which was not relevant to that issue, and as that issue was limited to a single transaction, the evidence should have been restricted accordingly. The rule on this subject is thus clearly stated in 1 Bishop on Crim. Pro., sec. 460 : \u201c Where there is a single count, in an indictment for a misdemeanor, as well as in an indictment for felony, whatever the number of counts, the court will restrict the prosecutor, by so compelling him to elect as-shall prevent his giving evidence of more than the one transaction.\u201d And in this doctrine, so far as we are aware, the adjudged cases agree. <em>The People </em>v. <em>Jeness, </em>5 Mich. 305; <em>Lovell </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 12 Ind. 18; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>1 Denio, <em>574; Elam </em>v. <em>The State, </em>26 Ala. 48; <em>Kinchlow </em>v. <em>The State, </em>5 Humph. 9; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>10 Conn. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">In this case, the prosecutor offered evidence of a number of. distinct offenses, of the same character, extending over a period of four months, and for either of which, if fully proved, a conviction might have been sustained under the-indictment. So far as appears, this was done without objection. Whether, after offering evidence of a particular offense which would sustain the charge made in the indictment, the state should be permitted, against objection, to-offer evidence in proof of another substantive offense, is a question addressed, perhaps, to the sound discretion of the coui\u2019t under the circumstances of the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>10 Conn. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">But, be this as it may, it was the clear right of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>fendant to know, before entering on his defense, for what particular transaction he was being tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Having been arraigned .on a single charge, he should not have been required to defend against many charges. We are clear in the opinion that the court erred in' not requiring an election to be made by the prosecutor, when asked for by the party on trial. Of course, we do not- mean to 'controvert tbe doctrine that in classes of cases in which guilty knowledge, a particular intent, or a scienter, are essential ingredients in the offense charged, it is competent to prove these, if possible, by evidence of other criminal acts committed by the defendant about the same time. But such' evidence is only competent when it tends to prove some fact necessary to constitute the offense on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The court also erred in directing the jury to consider all the evidence tending to prove any of the sales in regard to which evidence, had been offered. Under this charge, it was quite possible that part of the jury might base their verdict upon one act, and part upon anothef, and a verdict be thus rendered without an actual agreement of the jury. And it is very clear, that'after verdict, the plaintiff in error could not legally know of what particular specific offense he had been found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for new trial.-</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AS0\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Day, Wright, Johnson, and Ashburn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
