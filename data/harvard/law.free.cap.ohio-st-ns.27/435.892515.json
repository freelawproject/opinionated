Upon November 23, 1869, they found in their pens this lot of hogs, forty-nine in number, which had been left there for safe-keeping, but they appeared to be without an owner. They kept them until December 1st, and fed and properly cared for them. Diligent but ineffectual search was made for the owners, and as the continued keeping of the animals was attended with expense and probable loss, it was deemed best that they should be sold. Kaufman &amp; Fishburne, plaintiffs in-error, being advised of all the facts, agreed to become purchasers, the Stock Yards, to receive and hold the money for the proper owner when he should appear. Kaufman &amp; Fishburne, having thus obtained the\u2018hogs, sold them to-one Merkle and received pay. Me,rkle drove the animals to his slaughter-house in Millcreek township and there slaughtered them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">Kaufman &amp; Fishburne declined to pay the Stock Yards-Company, who then brought this suit for the price of the hogs \u2014 two of them having died at the pens and some others becoming diseased there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-6\">Kaufman &amp; Fishburne filed a demurrer to the petition, which was overruled and exception taken. They then file answer, denying plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, for which they aver the following as the principal reason : \u201cAnd the defendants, .for further answer, say that the plaintiffs had no right to take up, keep, or sell the hogs mentioned in the petition; that said hogs were strays, and that the plaintiffs are a body corporate, not a free-holder nor a house-holder,\u201d etc. They further state that the trustees of Millcreek township claimed the value of the hogs, which claim defendants acknowledged and paid, and hence they owe plaintiffs nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The trustees of Millcreek township, although they do not appear to have been made parties specially, obtain leave of \u2022court to file answer and cross-petition. They say that Eishburne &amp; Kaufman, their co-defendants, having in their possession, in Millcreek township, certain stray hogs, being the same referred to in petition, and being ignorant of their rights in reference thereto, sold the said hogs to Merkle. That Merkle being also ignorant of his rights, and of the facts and law governing title to the hogs, slaughtered them. That inasmuch as the hogs were strays, they, the -trustees of Millcreek township, by virtue of their office, were entitled to the property. That Eishburne &amp;' Kaufman are willing to pay over to them the sum they received for the hogs. That they, the trustees, are the proper ones to keep the money, and neither the Brighton Stock Yards nor any other party to the suit has any interest in this distribution of the proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-4\">Thereupon the city of- Cincinnati intervenes and files an \u2022answer, although the record does not show that she was made defendant originally. The city avers, that as there appears to be no other owner of the hogs, and inasmuch as they were within the limits of Cincinnati before they were in Milcreek township, she will appropriate the fund for the benefit of the common schools. She therefore prays that the money be paid to the city treasury, to be accounted for in the event that any owner makes claim within the time prescribed by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">The court found the allegations of the petition to be true, and that the plaintiffs below, the Brighton Stock Yards, were entitled to the relief prayed for. By consent of the Stock Yards the court ordered the money, with certain deductions not necessary to be considered, to be paid over to the city treasurer, to be held for the proper owners -\u2022should they appear, if not, for the benefit of the common schools.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">To this Kaufman &amp; Eishburne and the trustees of Mill-\u2022creek township except and file petition in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>James B.

The hogs were not running at large, and so liable to be taken up under the general statute on the subject of estrays, nor do they fall within any of the provisions in regard to animals at large in a city. It may be that the Stock Yard Company ought to have advertised them before the sale, but Kaufman &amp; Eishburne can not be-heard to raise an objection on that ground. They had notice,.and they recognized the right of the company to sell. They, Kaufman &amp; Eishburne, also exercised the same right, and got the money for the hogs, although they refused to-pay it over to the company to be disposed of. These sales-were all made, and the money from Merkle to Kaufman' &amp; Eishburne paid in Cincinnati. Under no rule or reason could Millereek township assert any right to the money. If there was no sale, then the money belonged to Merkle, and no other; if there was a sale, and the money, and not the hogs, was estray, then it ought to be disposed of in Cincinnati, where it is located; and there is no reason why these parties, Kaufman &amp; Eishburne, should, after these hogs had lost their identity as such, carry the money received for them from Cincinnati to Millereek township, and place it in the hands of the trustees of the latter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>This, it will be seen, was done, too, after the suit was begun against Kaufman &amp; Eishburne.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-4\">We submit this cause, then, with the observation that the matters of law stated by the plaintiffs have no application in the case; and that the judgment of the court below was correct, and should be sustained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b449-5\">Wright, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVn\">It is not necessary to pass upon the demurrer' to the petition, as the case itself settles all the questions involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">It will be seen that the hogs were properly in the custody of the Brighton Stock Yards ; that Kaufman &amp; Eishburne bought and agreed to pay for them, and subsequently declined to do so, because the stock yards had no right to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">It appears to us that the stock yards must be held to possess such authority as is adequate to the emergency. They made proper and diligent search for the owner without success. A just discharge of their duties did not require that they should keep the animals until a bill of expense should swallow up their entire value. They were called upon to do exactly that which the interests of the owners demanded they should do. If, on fair consideration of all the circumstances \u2014 of future falling markets, of disease and death, of the difficulty and expense of keeping the property \u2014 sound judgment dictated, and necessity required, that the animals be sold; if this was really for the best interests of all concerned, the stock yards had the right to sell, at least as against those to whom they sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The position that the necessity of the case justifies the exercise of a fair discretion, and authorizes the sale of property, where such property is perishable in its nature, and is likely to become entirely lost, where owners are unknown, finds strength in the fact that the statutes of the state have inaugurated a policy looking to this precise end. Section 8 of the law \u201cproviding for the disposition of unclaimed freight,\u201d etc., S. &amp; S. 94, is as follows: \u201c If any perishable property shall so be conveyed as freight as aforesaid, and remain unclaimed until danger of great depreciation, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the same shall he refused, or the owner thereof can not he found, then such persons, associations, or companies may sell at private sale or auction, without giving notice, for the best price it will bring, and apply the proceeds as aforesaid.\u201d The disposition of the money referred to is this: the proceeds are held for one year for the owner, and then turned into the common school fund. Within five years, the owner may reclaim it from the auditor of state.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">This statute authorizes to be done only that which without it sound judgment, governed by correct intention, would dictate.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The stock yards appear to have acted in the utmost good faith. They sold to Kaufman &amp; Fishburne for the highest market price, and one of the stipulations of that sale was that the stock yards were to hold the money as a special deposit for the owner when he should arrive. What right have these purchasers now to say that the money shall go elsewhere ? To repudiate the agreement when they got the property upon the faith of it ? In the face of these facts and such a contract, the refusal to pay on the part of the purchasers seems extraordinary. They base their refusal on the ground that the animals were \u201c strays.\u201d But under the statute on that subject, to which counsel refer, we are unable to see that these hogs can be considered as coming under that class of \u201c strays.\u201d It can not be said that they were at any time found \u201cstraying,\u201din the popular acceptation of that term. They were first discovered in the Brighton pens. The \u201cstrays\u201d spoken of in our statute are those which are \u201c running at large.\u201d This can not be predicated of hogs securely p\u2019enned.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The statute also refers to strays being \u201c taken up.\u201d We can not see that the stock yards did any \u201c taking up \u201d within the legal meaning of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Nor do we see how the trustees can successfully claim that the hogs \u201c strayed \u201d into Millcreek township, when the testimony shows that a man bought and drove them there for slaughtering purposes. Nor can we see that there was any such \u201crunning at large\u201d in Millcreek township as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>would justify the trustees in impounding, as they did, the price for which the animals sold. The particular manner in which the hogs reached their ultimate destination is not otherwise detailed than in a single sentence of Kaufman\u2019s testimony: \u201cWe drove them to Millereek township, and slaughtered them there.\u201d Erom this alone the court are unable to say'that they were \u201cstrays\u201d and \u201crunning at large,\u201d as the trustees desire us to do. The trustees, doubtless, with a high sense of their public duties, seemed to thiuk that these animals were waifs, and as nobody owned them, they would. This idea seems also to. have been shared by Kaufman &amp; Eishburne and the city of Cincinnati ; still in law, we think, the position is not tenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The action of the Superior Court was entirely correct. That court found that the stock yards were entitled to recover, and as they consented that the money might be put in the hands of the city to await future events, plaintiffs in error can not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b451-7\">Scott, Chief Judge/ Day, Johnson, and Ashburn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
