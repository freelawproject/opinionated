The ease is this: Nancy Woodman married Gran-ville Shelby. They had one child, John Shelby. Granville <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>having enlisted in the army, and expecting to be absent five years, on the 28th day of June, 1848, joined with his wife and deeded sixty-six and a half acres of land, of which he was seized, in Montgomery county, to Samuel Woodman, the father of his wife. The deed, on its face, was an abso lute deed in fee, and the consideration named in the deed was two thousand dollars. The -wife and child went back to her father\u2019s house; and in November following she filed a petition for divorce, which was granted in May, 1849, for the adultery of her husband. Pending the divorce case, in April, 1849, Granville, her husband, confessed judgment in favor of one Forsythe, for $2,100. As Granville had no property to satisfy execution on the judgment, Forsythe brought suit against him and Samuel Woodman to subject the land, deeded as before stated, to the satisfaction of the judgment. On the 8th day of August, 1849, Woodman filed an answer, signed and sworn to by him. In the answer he admits the execution of the deed to him by Gran-ville Shelby and his wife, for the nominal consideration of two thousand dollars, but says the real consideration and circumstances under which the deed was made were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-4\">\u201c Granville Shelby had married his daughter, by whom he had one child, a male infant about eleven months old at the execution of said deed. The said Granville Shelby had some time before enlisted as a soldier in the army of the United States, for the period of five years ; and expecting shortly to be ordered away on service, he applied to this defendant to purchase the said tract of land, and proposed the following terms: That this defendant should pay him one hundred dollars as follows : to deduct therefrom sixty dollars, which Granville Shelby then owed this defendant, for which he held his two notes \u2014 one for forty-five dollars, the other for fifteen dollars \u2014 given by him to this defendant foragood consideration, and then due and unpaid in whole or in part; that this defendant should satisfy and discharge a judgment on the docket of Esq. Watson of one Sellers, against him, for sixteen dollars, and should also satisfy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>discharge a claim of Israel Olinger on the said Granville Shelby on which his mother, Sarah Shelby, was security for him \u2014 amounting to about twenty-seven dollars, which the said Granville Shelby declared were all the debts he then owed, and that the remainder of the one hundred dollars should be paid by this defendant to him \u2014 and also, on the further consideration, that this defendant should take home-his \"wife and child, take care of them, and provide for them necessaries and comforts; and if he should sell the said lands, to appropriate the proceeds, or so much thereof as was necessary for the support and maintenance of his wife- and for the support, maintenance, and education of his child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">\u201c This defendant being satisfied that the said Granville' Shelby, from his character and habits, would squander this, property, and leave his wife and child utterly destitute and dependent, did, on the importunity of the said Granville Shelby, accept his proposition, and he accordingly, with his wife, executed and delivered the deed to this defendant;, and he has paid not only the sum of one hundred dollars, in the mode and manner proposed, but the further sum of fifty-five dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">^ <em>'-k</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-7\">\u201c This defendant further answers, that he now holds the-said premises in trust for the use and benefit of his said daughter and her child, and the proceeds thereof, if he-should sell the same, for the same purpose, and to reimburse himself for the money advanced by him to GranvilleShelby.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-8\">Forsythe\u2019s petition was dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-9\">In 1853, Granville Shelby died. In 1854, Nancy, his divorced wife, married William Broadrup, and then left her father\u2019s and lived with her husband. In 1860, Samuel Woodman, her father, also died. John Shelby, her son, continued to live with his grandfather, Woodman, until his-death, and afterward lived in his family until he arrived at the age of majority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ad1\">On the 10th day of November, 1865, Nancy Broadrup and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>her husband filed their petition in the Superior Court of Montgomery county, against Thomas Woodman and others, heirs and devisees of Samuel Woodman, deceased, charging that the deed of Granville Shelby to Samuel Woodman, though absolute on its face, was in truth a deed in trust, after paying certain claims, for the benefit of Nancy Broadrup and her son, John Shelby, who was made defendant The facts upon which the alleged trust is based, as stated in the petition, are nearly the same as those stated in the answer of Woodman to the bill of Eorsythe against him in 1849. The petition charges that Woodman and his devisees have enjoyed the l\u2019ents and profits of the land, which are said to be more than sufficient to pay all the debts of Shelby \u25a0and the expense of supporting the above-named beneficiaries of the trust. The petition prays for an account, and that the land may be decreed to Nancy Broadrup and her son John Shelby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-4\">John Shelby, by his guardian, answered, admitting the allegations of the petition, but denied that Nancy Broadrup is entitled to any further benefit of the trust, and prayed for an account, and that a conveyance of the land may be \u2022decreed to him alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-5\">The other defendants answered denying the trust alleged in the petition, and aver that no written instrument exists establishing the trust, or binding their ancestor to reconvey the land to Nancy Broadrup. They further aver that the consideration for which the land was conveyed to tbeir ancestor, as stated in the petition, was fully paid and performed by him and the defendants. They also further aver :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-6\">\u201c That although it was no part of the contract or consideration, in the purchase or conveyance of said land, yet that it was the intention of said Woodman, declared before his decease, to devise said land to his grandson, John Shelby, \u25a0or bequeath him a sum of money equivalent in value to the \u2022same; and that in pursuance of said intention, he did bequeath to said John Shelby the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars, payable on his arrival at majority.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The plaintiffs replied that Samuel Woodman, in the Forsythe case, answered, under oath in writing, that he held the land in trust for the uses mentioned in the petition; and deny that the legacy to John Shelby was intended to be in lieu of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-5\">The answer of Samuel Woodman and the record in the Forsythe ease, were given in evidence on the trial; also, in-addition to the facts already stated, a written memorandum, made at the request of Samuel Woodman (who could not write) about the year 1854, was given in evidence by the defendants (except John Shelby). The memorandum is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-6\">\u201c On the 28th day of June, a. d. 1848, I received from Granville H.

The consideration mentioned in the deed is nominal. The real consideration is as follows : That I was to take his-\u25a0wife and son John home with me, and provide for them in every way, as if they never had left my house, to educate the hoy in a proper manner, and to pay certain debts of the-said Granville Shelby.

Moreover, in the case before us, all the evidence upon which it is sought to establish a trust is in writing, and the principal document is, signed by the party sought to be charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The first question to be determined is, whether the deed in controversy, though absolute in form, was a trust deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The grantee, under whom the defendants claim, in a suit controverting his title, declared in his written answer, signed and sworn to by him, that the deed was a trust deed, and stated the real consideration of the deed, and the terms and conditions of the trust. In <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Tindall, </em>2 Green Ch. 357, it was held, that where a bill claims a deed to be a deed in trust, and the answrer admits it, the answer will be good evidence of the trust, and a sufficient writing to support it. To the same effect was the holding in <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>2 Vern. 287. In <em>Cripps </em>v. <em>Jee, </em>Brown Ch. 472, the principle was extended to other written evidence. See also, <em>Leman </em>v. <em>Whitley, </em>4 Russ. 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">It is true the answer relied upon as evidence of the trust was not made in this case; but it related to the deed in question, and is none the less clear, certain, and conclusive as evidence of the trust. It not only expressly declares the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>deed to be a deed of trust, but sets forth and admits a state of fact constituting a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The phraseology of the deed matters little, since it is made to appear clearly that it was made only for the purpose of paying the debts of the grantor, and to furnish necessaries for his wife and child, and that the proceeds, if the lands should be sold, should be appropriated, \u201c so much thereof as was necessary,\u201d to their maintenance and to the education of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The conduct of-the grantee, as manifested by the memorandum given in evidence, exhibits him as acting in the character of a trustee. He keeps an account of taxes paid on the land, and of moneys expended in establishing and defending the trust. Had he been a purchaser of the land, this was unnecessary; nor would he have been required to appropriate the proceeds of the sale of the land to the support of the grantor\u2019s wife and child, if he had personally assumed their support, as a consideration for the absolute purchase of the land. Such provision for the appropriation of the property is consistent only with the idea of a trust, and not with that of a purchase. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the conveyance, in the absence of any specific undertaking of the grantee to pay the debts of the grantor and support his wife and child, indicate confidence placed in the grantee in relation to the land and the objects prompting the conveyance, rather than any idea of an absolute sale. Though the deed was absolute in form, we think it entirely clear that it was a deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The terms and conditions of the trust are next to be considered. We think they are indicated with sufficient clearness by the written answer of the grantee of the deed, when read in the light of the surrounding circumstances. Certain specified debts of the gx-antor were to be paid, and, so far as necessary, the remainder was to be applied to the support of his wife and child, and to the education of his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">It is conceded, that the grantee of the deed did care for and support the wife of the grantor until her divorce from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>him and subsequent marriage, when she withdrew from such support; and that like support was furnished to the son, by the grantee and those claiming under him, until.he arrived at the age of majority. Thus it would seem that the conditions of the trust have been 'fully performed; for it can not be presumed that the support provided for by the trust extended to a period beyond that contemplated by the ordinary parental relation. This is clearly indicated by both the answer and memorandum in evidence ; for it appears by them that the wife and child were . to be taken home by the grantee and cared for as if in their father\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\u25a0\"Whether the full performance of the trust would exhaust\u2019 the trust property, we have no means of knowing; but from the fact that the property has not been disposed of, nor is claimed to have been spent in discharge of the trust, it may be presumed that it has not. Nor can this fact he ascertained until an account has been taken showing the true-state of the case as between the trustee and the <em>cestuis quetrust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Assuming that there would remain a surplus in the hands-of the trustees, the question arises, to whom does it belong ?'</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">It can not, we think, be inferred from the evidence that-the grantor intended it to go to the grantee. It is quite-clear that the grantee had no such idea. His object was to-save the wife and child from destitution. Eor this purpose, and to pay the grantor\u2019s debts, the property was placed in the hands and under the control of the grantee. Moreover,, where the trust character of a deed is established, and a particular use is declared, \u201c the residue of the use results to the grantor; for the presumption, that the grantor meant to part with the whole use, is thereby repelled,\u201d unless the-contrary be shown by the deed, 2 Story\u2019s Eq. sec. 1199. The-use of the grantee in his trust, as shown by the deed, has a, limited extent, and does not embrace the residue after performing the trusts. Nor does the uses of the wife and child, of the grantor, as shown by the evidence, extend to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>residue beyond their necessary support and the education \u2022of the child, for such support and education was the limit \u25a0of their use.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\"Where certain trusts are created by a deed, which are fully executed, and yet leave an unexhausted residuum, \u2022\u201cthere will arise a resulting trust to the party creating the ,itrust, or to his heirs and legal representatives, as the case may require.\u201d 2 Story\u2019s Eq. sec. 1196a. From this principle it follows, that Granville Shelby, the grantor, being dead, \u00a1his son, John Shelby, as\u2019his heir, is entitled to the residuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Nor can his rights as such heir be affected by the will of-the trustee, made shortly before his death, unless there be .\u25a0something of which we are not advised, that may put him \u2022to his election to take either the residuum or under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">What, if any, right Mrs. Broadrup may have by way of \u2022dower in the residue, if any there be, we are not called upon to determine. It is only necessary to say that we think there was no error in dismissing her petition to have any part -of the property decreed to her as a beneficiary under the deed of trust. The same must he said as to her co-plaintiff in error, John Shelby. \u2022 But he has, though' imperfectly, through his guardian, set up a claim to the entire estate ..after the trust is executed, by way of cross petition or claim.' We think he was entitled, as the heir of the grantor of the \u2022deed in question, to an account, and to a decree for any residue in the hands of the defendants as trustees of the prop\u2022erty held under the deed, by way of a resulting use, subject to any dower right his mother may have therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">It follows that the judgment of the court below, so far ras it relates to the plaintiff, Nancy Broadrup, might prop\u2022erly be affirmed; but to save to her- all embarrassment as to any right she may have in the property, other than that \u25a0\u25a0claimed in her petition, and, as the judgment must be reversed as t'o her co-plaintiff, John Shelby, the judgment may be reversed generally, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-8\">Scott, Chief Judge, and Wright, J., concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b572-9\">Johnson and Ashburn, JJ., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
