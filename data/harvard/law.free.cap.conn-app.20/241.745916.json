The defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) in failing to compel the state to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for its peremptory challenge of a black venireperson, and (2) in omitting from its rereading to the jury of its charge on reasonable doubt several crucial instructions, thereby diluting the state\u2019s burden of proof. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s failure to compel the state to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for its peremptory challenge of a black venireperson violated his state and federal constitutional rights to equal protection and an impartial jury. U.S. Const., amend. VI, XIV; Conn. Const. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 20. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Of the thirty-three venirepersons voir dired, six jurors and two alternates were chosen, and thirteen venirepersons were excused by the court, eight by the defendant and four by the state. The state asked the same questions of each venireperson. After eliciting background information, the prosecutor asked each venireperson whether he or she believed society suffers from a drug problem, whether he or she would be influenced by the quantity rather than the quality of the testimony, and whether he or she would be able to be fair to both sides, follow the court\u2019s instructions and vote for a verdict of guilty or not guilty according to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">From our review of the transcripts it appears that each of the first nine panelists responded to these and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>similar questions in a straightforward and unequivocal manner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The tenth venireperson<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was challenged by the state. Immediately thereafter, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY3\">\u201cThe Court: First challenge for the state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyE\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5C\">\u201cThe Court: The court will take a short recess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aua\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I don\u2019t know how many panelists we\u2019ve had for voir dire, it\u2019s quite a few. I\u2019ve lost count.</p>\n<p id=\"Ald\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s number ten.</p>\n<p id=\"AVg\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Number ten, and the state has not exercised any challenges thus far and [this venireperson] was the first black panelist to be subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>to a voir dire and it was the first man against which the state has exercised the challenge. Now, when [the state\u2019s attorney] was engaging in a voir dire with [this venireperson], I took very good notes about the responses that [he] gave to [the state\u2019s attorney]. The responses by and large were no different than most of the responses given to [the state\u2019s attorney] by all of the white panelists and in accordance with the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>recent Supreme Court opinion on this issue I move this court for a hearing that [the state\u2019s attorney] be put under oath and made to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"A1k\">\u201cThe Court: Motion denied. Recess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnE\">Although it has been well settled for over a century that the systematic exclusion of otherwise qualified citizens from jury service on account of race violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment; <em>Strauder </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>100 U.S. 303, 25 L. Ed. 664 (1880); until recently, criminal defendants were unable to challenge effectively the state\u2019s use of peremptory challenges for discriminatory purposes in specific cases. See <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S. Ct. 824, 13 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1965) (equal protection violation shown only where discriminatory use of peremptory challenges is evident in case after case, whatever the circumstance). In 1986, the Supreme Court, in <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986), overruled <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, and held that the discriminatory use of a peremptory challenge in a single case violates the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"AqM\">Under Batson v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, the defendant must first make a prima facie showing that the state exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>cised a peremptory challenge with a racially discriminatory purpose. Id., 96. This showing must include evidence that the defendant \u201cis a member of a cognizable racial group . . . and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\u2019s race. . . . Finally, the defendant must show that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used [peremptory challenges] to exclude the venireman from the petit jury on account of their race.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. In making his prima facie showing, the defendant may \u201crely on the fact, as to which there can be no dispute, that peremptory challenges constitute a jury selection practice that permits \u2018those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">If the defendant successfully makes this prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the state to articulate a neutral explanation for excusing members of the defendant\u2019s racial group. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>10 Conn. App. 683, 696, 525 A.2d 528, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 807, 528 A.2d 1154 (1987). The trial court must then determine whether the defendant has carried the overall burden of showing purposeful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 553 A.2d 166 (1989), a case published after the defendant\u2019s trial, our Supreme Court, in an exercise of its inherent supervisory authority, modified the <em>Batson </em>procedure, ruling that \u201cin all future cases in which the defendant asserts a <em>Batson </em>claim, we deem it appropriate for the state to provide the court with a prima facie case response consistent with the explanatory mandate of <em>Batson\u201d </em>Id., 646. Because the court expressly limited the applicability of this rule to future cases, the <em>Batson </em>procedure, as outlined above, controls this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>In this case, the state peremptorily challenged the first black venireperson. The defendant objected, gave the factual basis for his objection, and moved to place the state\u2019s attorney under oath to proffer a neutral reason for the challenge. The trial court summarily denied the motion and took a short recess. Under <em>Batson, </em>the trial court should deny such a motion only after determining that the defendant had failed to make a prima facie showing of discriminatory abuse of the challenge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wylie, </em>supra. Accordingly, we must determine whether the trial court could reasonably have reached such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Our task is complicated by the very flaw in the record that the <em>Holloway </em>rule will eradicate from future cases, namely, the absence of any neutral explanation given by the state for the challenge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 645-46. Nevertheless, we can review the record to determine whether the defendant made the requisite prima facie showing. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>2 Conn. App. 605, 614, 482 A.2d 70 (1984), cert. denied, 195 Conn. 802, 488 A.2d 457, cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1009, 105 S. Ct. 2706, 86 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1985) (appellate courts may look to the evidence produced in support of a ruling when a trial court rules on motion to suppress without detailing facts supporting its decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The first <em>Batson </em>factor is satisfied. The record reveals that the defendant is black and that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to remove the tenth venireperson, a black man, from the venire. The only other \u201crelevant circumstance\u201d; <em>see Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 96-97; alleged by the. defendant was that the venireperson\u2019s responses to the voir dire were \u201cno different than most of the responses given\u201d by other, white venire panelists to the same questions. We disagree with this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Generally speaking, the venireperson in question mumbled or spoke softly when answering questions on the stand. It is evident from the transcript of his testimony; see footnote 2, supra; that he was confused by hypothetical questions, was equivocal in his opinion of whether society suffers from a drug problem and was unsure of his ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions and to be fair to both sides. Furthermore, he testified that he considered himself to exercise common sense only about \u201c50 percent of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We also note that both the state and the defendant asked basically the same questions of this venireperson as they did of other venire panelists, and that the state\u2019s questioning of him does not appear from the transcript to have been perfunctory. Of the three remaining venire panelists excused by the state, it appears from the transcript that one was excused for his equivocal position on the existence of a societal drug problem, another due to his negative view of police officers, and the third because she had been a victim of crime. Thus, no pattern of racial discrimination emerges from the state\u2019s exercise of the challenge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 391, 399, 538 A.2d 210 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We conclude that the record before us does not support a reasonable inference that the state exercised the challenge for a racially discriminatory purpose. Because the defendant did not make the required prima facie showing, the trial court did not err in refusing to compel the state to explain the challenge at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in its rereading to the jury of its charge on reasonable doubt. The following facts are pertinent to our analysis of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The court charged the jury on Friday, February 19. The court explained what is not a reasonable doubt, then instructed the jury on what constitutes a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, the court explained that the state bears the burden of proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant must be presumed to be innocent unless there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that the state must prove all elements of the crime charged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Later that afternoon, after it had begun its deliberations, the jury requested that the court \u201creread that statement about reasonable doubt.\u201d The court replied that it would do so the following Monday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The court\u2019s rereading included the instruction on what constitutes a reasonable doubt; see footnote 3, infra; but omitted the paragraphs concerning the presumption of innocence, the state\u2019s burden of proving every element of the crime charged, and the jury\u2019s duty to acquit if it found the evidence supported a hypothesis consistent with innocence. See footnote 4, infra. The defendant took exception to the recharge, complaining that it was \u201coverly beneficial to the state\u201d in comparison to the charge given on Friday. He did not, however, specifically apprise the court of the exact passages that were omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The state argues that because the defendant failed at trial to advise the court of the precise nature of his objection, on appeal this court should not review a more carefully distilled version of his objection. Under Practice Book \u00a7 4185 we are not bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at trial, and was \u201c \u2018 \u201cso stated as to bring to the attention of the court the <em>precise </em>matter on which its decision is being asked.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>75 Conn. 679, 682, 55 A. 167 (1903).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>198 Conn. 386, 396, 503 A.2d 576 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lonergan, </em>16 Conn. App. 358, 362, 548 A.2d 718 (1988), cert. granted on other grounds, 210 Conn. 812, 556 A.2d 611 (1989). The defendant\u2019s exception and legal argument do not meet this test. From the transcript, it is impossible to discern any discrete legal theory for the defendant\u2019s exception, other than that the recharge was \u201coverly beneficial\u201d to the state. From this argument, the trial court could not have been expected to deduce that the defendant was really complaining that the recharge unconstitutionally diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof, which is the defendant\u2019s theory on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Neither is this claim entitled to review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Although the defendant\u2019s claim wears the mantle of the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>tution, the claim itself is not truly of constitutional proportions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>10 Conn. App. 330, 334, 523 A.2d 906 (1986), cert. denied, 203 Conn. 809, 525 A.2d 525 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMayo, </em>18 Conn. App. 297, 302, 557 A.2d 571, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 807, 563 A.2d 1355 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The jury had been fully instructed on the state\u2019s burden of proving each element, on the presumption of the defendant\u2019s innocence, and on what constitutes a reasonable doubt, conceptually distinct but related subtopics of the state\u2019s overall burden of proof. The defendant has not challenged the court\u2019s original charge. The jury later asked for reinstruction on reasonable doubt, which the court provided. We fail to see how the jury could have considered the court\u2019s limited reinstruction on reasonable doubt as a reinstruction on the state\u2019s overall burden of proof, or as a substitute for the earlier instruction. Viewing the charge as a whole; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>207 Conn. 619, 633, 543 A.2d 270 (1988); we conclude from our limited review of the record that the defendant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s rereading of its instructions on reasonable doubt without reiterating its entire general charge on the state\u2019s burden of proof is not a claim of constitutional proportion. \u201cThe defendant has attached a constitutional label to what is analytically, at its core, a nonconstitutional claim. . . . We therefore decline to review this claim further.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>supra, 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AtV\"> The transcript of the voir dire of the second venire panelist, for instance, sets forth in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQk\">\u201cQ. . . .

He, the accused, is not \u2014 does not have to prove his innocence. The law presumes the defendant to be innocent of the crime.

The State, in other words, can establish the burden and rest on it only by proof of every element beyond a reasonable doubt. ... As I said, proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof which precludes every reasonable hypothesis of guilt [sic]. If two conclusions can be drawn, reasonably drawn from the evidence, one of innocence and one of guilt, you must adopt the one of innocence unless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, convinced of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find Mr. Tappin not guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
