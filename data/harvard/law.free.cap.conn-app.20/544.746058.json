The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant radiologist, John A. Tighe, finding that the plaintiff\u2019s expert never stated, either in his deposition or his affidavit, that the defendant was guilty of malpractice or that he deviated from the applicable standard of care. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred (1) in granting Tighe\u2019s motion for summary judgment, (2) in concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s expert did not raise a factual question as to Tighe\u2019s deviation from the standard of care, (3) in ruling that Tighe would suffer undue prejudice if the plaintiff were allowed to proceed to trial or redepose the plaintiff\u2019s expert, (4) in failing to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and (5) by abusing its discretion in determining that there was no factual issue as to the plaintiff\u2019s expert opinion. We agree with the plaintiff that his expert did raise a genuine issue of fact as to the standard of care and Tighe\u2019s deviation from it and, therefore, find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The documentation submitted in connection with Tighe\u2019s motion for summary judgment included the deposition of the plaintiff\u2019s expert, R. Harlow Herman-son, a radiologist, a letter of opinion from Hermanson dated June 15,1987, and a sworn statement from Hermanson in the form of a letter to the plaintiff, dated December 15,1989, explaining the answers in his deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The following facts are relevant. In April, 1985, the plaintiff was referred to Tighe for a barium enema procedure. Tighe\u2019s report to the referring physician did not indicate that any growths or lesions were discovered. In January, 1986, the plaintiff, after a three week period of rectal bleeding, went to another physician, who performed a sigmoidoscopy procedure, which revealed that the plaintiff had a large hemorrhagic malignant mass in the area of his rectum.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The plaintiff brought this medical malpractice action against the defendants for failure to diagnose the rectal cancer. After a series of discovery motions by Tighe, the trial court granted his motion in limine precluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the plaintiff from relying on testimony of any expert witness other than Hermanson on the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Hermanson\u2019s initial report<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that Tighe\u2019s barium enema procedure was inadequate to exclude pathology and that the procedure should have been repeated and a sigmoidoscopy suggested to the patient. In September, 1988, Tighe deposed Hermanson. Tighe asked Hermanson whether Tighe had committed medical malpractice. Hermanson did not respond in the affirmative but he did testify that Tighe\u2019s procedure was not the way he would have done it and \u201cnot the way most of the people [he knew] would have acted.\u201d He testified that it was his opinion that the examination as a whole was inadequate. He also testified to the additional steps that a radiologist of adequate competency would have taken, namely, a repeat examination and a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">After the deposition, Tighe moved for summary judgment on the ground that no genuine issue of fact existed between the parties because the plaintiff did not present an expert that would testify that Tighe\u2019s conduct deviated from the standard of care. The plaintiff filed Hermanson\u2019s letter of December 15,1988, which flatly states: \u201cMy testimony in response to that and subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>quent questions . . . clearly shows the ways in which, in my opinion, Dr. Tighe deviated from the Standard of Care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The trial court granted Tighe\u2019s motion for summary judgment, stating, \u201cHermanson never testified, either in his deposition or his affidavit, that [Tighe] was guilty of malpractice or deviated from the applicable standard of care. His testimony, therefore, does not provide the basis for the necessary expert opinion on the issues of the applicable standard of care and whether [Tighe\u2019s] conduct deviated from it. Since his is the only expert testimony on liability, the plaintiff cannot make out a <em>prima facie </em>case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201c \u2018A trial court may appropriately grant a motion for summary judgment only when the affidavits and evidence submitted in support of the motion demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining between the parties and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book \u00a7 384; <em>Catz </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, </em>201 Conn. 39, 48-49, 513 A.2d 98 (1986); <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Schlein, </em>192 Conn. 732, 738, 473 A.2d 1221 (1984). Although the party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact, a party opposing summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. <em>Strada </em>v. <em>Connecticut Newspapers, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 313, 317, 477 A.2d 1005 (1984). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u2019 <em>Rotophone, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danbury Hospital, </em>13 Conn. App. 230, 232-33, 535 A.2d 830 (1988).\u201d <em>Maruca </em>v. <em>Standard, </em>19 Conn. App. 16, 19, 559 A.2d 1167 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>A physician is required by law to exercise the degree of skill, care and diligence that is customarily demonstrated by physicians in the same line of practice. <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>191 Conn. 282, 300-302, 465 A.2d 294 (1983). The physician must exercise such reasonable skill and diligence in all aspects of providing care and treatment to a patient. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Guiliano, </em>144 Conn. 573, 574, 135 A.2d 904 (1957). Whether a physician\u2019s conduct was sufficient to meet the appropriate standard of care or whether such conduct was unskillful presents questions of fact for a jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">To prove that a physician has breached the legally required standard of care, the plaintiff must offer some evidence that the conduct of the physician was negligent. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>143 Conn. 290, 295; 122 A.2d 21 (1956). Except in the unusual case where the want of care or skill is so gross that it presents an almost conclusive inference of want of care; <em>Puro </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>188 Conn. 301, 305, 449 A.2d 176 (1982); the testimony of an expert witness is necessary to establish both the standard of proper professional skill or care on the part of a physician; <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 66, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986); \u201cand that the defendant failed to conform to that standard of care.\u201d <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 131, 540 A.2d 666 (1988); <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">It is not necessary, however, for the expert witness specifically to label a defendant\u2019s conduct as malpractice in order for the jury to reach the conclusion that the defendant was negligent. <em>Slimak </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>106 Conn. 366, 370, 138 A. 153 (1927) (\u201cto demand a positive condemnation of the operator\u2019s course as a prerequisite to recovery would in such case be prohibiting of any recovery therein\u201d); see <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Giuliano, </em>supra, 574-75; <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>supra, 295. In medical malpractice cases, it is proper for the trier of fact to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>inferences and reach conclusions from facts that are found to be proved. See 1 B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence \u00a7 64 (a) through (d). Proof by circumstantial evidence is sufficient where rational minds could reasonably and logically draw the inference. <em>Console </em>v. <em>Nickou, </em>156 Conn. 268, 275, 240 A.2d 895 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In this case, the trial court based its decision to grant summary judgment on its finding that Hermanson did not state, either in his deposition or his affidavit, that Tighe was guilty of malpractice or deviated from the applicable standard of care. This decision erroneously applied the relevant law.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">A review of the transcript and affidavit shows that the witness did not testify that Tighe was guilty of malpractice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The transcript reveals, however, that he did sufficiently testify to a breach of the standard of care in the deposition, and he further clarified his testimony in the affidavit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his deposition, Hermanson testified that he thought the April 18,1985 examination was inadequate and that a radiologist of adequate compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>tency should repeat the examination to get an adequate examination and then should recommend a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy in addition. He further testified that the examination as a whole was inadequate and was performed using a technique that \u201cI think is not the way I\u2019d like to do it; not the way most of the people I know do it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He went on to describe the technique that he and most of his professional colleagues would use. In his December 15 affidavit; see footnote 3, supra; Her<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>manson stated that Tighe deviated from the standard of care. He further stated that the tumor was present at the time of Tighe\u2019s examination of the plaintiff. This testimony was sufficient under the principles articulated in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Guiliano, </em>supra, <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>supra, and <em>Simlak </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In this case, the witness testified to the standard of care and to what he and his professional colleagues would have done under the circumstances of this case. There was sufficient testimony given by Hermanson in his letter, deposition, and affidavit to present a question for the trier of the fact as to the standard of care and Tighe\u2019s deviation from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\"> The following are excerpts from Hermanson\u2019s opinion letter of June 15, 1987. \u201cReview of the examination of April 18,1985: Only 5 films are available for review, 3 overhead 14 x 17 films and 2 spot films. The examination is of technically poor quality because of a large amount of extraneous material in the bowel, and because the amount of films is inadequate. Moreover I feel that this was done as a single contrast study, following which air was injected after evacuation of the bowel. No definite lesion is shown, but one of the spot films shows slight irregularity of the rectosigmoid region, probably on the left anterolateral wall. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">\u201cIn my opinion, the examination of April 18, 1985, was inadequate to exclude pathology, and should have been repeated or sigmoidoscopy should have been suggested. It appears probable that adequate examination would have disclosed this lesion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> During Hermanson\u2019s deposition the following relevant colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201cQ. I understand you would do that, but are you telling me that a doctor who did not add that last part would be committing malpractice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">\u201cA. No. I\u2019m not telling you that at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">\u201cQ. In other words, some physicians would do it one way; you would prefer to do it the way you just mentioned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-12\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\"> Hermanson\u2019s affidavit states as follows: \u201cIn reviewing the transcript of my deposition on this case, I note certain answers which require clarification. I was asked . . . if I had an opinion as to whether Dr. Tighe deviated from or failed to meet a standard of care in the field of radiology. My testimony in response to that and subsequent questions . . . clearly shows the ways in which, in my opinion, Dr. Tighe deviated from that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">\u201cI was asked ... if indeed these were the only views that Dr. Tighe took, would it be my opinion that he committed malpractice because he did not take the other views? I said that I could not answer because I did not know if he fluoroscoped the patient or not. Actually, since there were spot films taken, we know that fluoroscopy was done. In fact, I pointed out . . . a suspicious area on the spot film that warranted further investigation and was in the very location where the tumor was subsequently demonstrated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>I am certain that the tumor was present at the time of the barium enema performed by Dr. Tighe and that it was about two centimeters in diameter.</p>\n<p id=\"AvuC\">\u201cI testified . . . that if I had done that examination, and those were the films that I saw in the office, I would either have done it (repeated the barium enema) myself or suggested it to the referring physician.</p>\n<p id=\"AcW\">\u201cI was asked ... if I had said that if a radiologist in that position did not suggest that, I wouldn\u2019t say that that was malpractice, that there are some out there who would and some who wouldn\u2019t. I answered, \u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019 Malpractice is a legal term whose meaning, as I understand it, goes beyond the issue of standard of care. I was speaking only of the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"Axb\">\u201cI was asked . . . if the average competent radiologist would have been satisfied with the barium enema films. I answered that I wasn\u2019t satisfied with them. I declined to speak for the \u2018average competent radiologist\u2019 because I cannot speak for another. I do, however, speak about the standard of care.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\"> Hermanson\u2019s deposition states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">\u201cQ. If I can go back to my original question. Am I to understand you correctly that there\u2019s nothing inadequate with the x-ray which was marked Exhibit No. 3. However, when you talk of inadequacy, you\u2019re talking about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">\u201cA. The examination as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">\u201cQ. Are you through with Exhibit 3 which was the oblique view?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-13\">\u201cA. Not entirely, because there are areas of the bowel here that we don\u2019t see completely, and this was done by a technique that I think is not the\u2014 certainly not the way I\u2019d like to do it; not the way most of the people I know do it. We do a primary double contrast examination as opposed to this which is starting out \u2014 which starts out as a single contrast examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">\u201cMoreover, somewhere mention was made of this being inadequate to exclude polyps, and it certainly is inadequate to exclude polyps. They could be there. You couldn\u2019t see them. You wouldn\u2019t have the faintest idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">\u201cQ. He would have fulfilled his duty in telling that to the referring physician, would he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">\u201cA. I\u2019d have to say yes and no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-17\">\u201cQ. What\u2019s the not part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-18\">\u201cA.
