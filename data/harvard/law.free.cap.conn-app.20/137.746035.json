These convictions were based on a short, continuous incident wherein two police officers, while in the process of assisting in the execution of an arrest warrant against a different individual, observed the defendant on the second floor landing of the fire escape of a building. The defendant first dropped a white handkerchief from his right hand and, as the officers proceeded to the second floor, he entered a doorway into the building. The same two officers immediately retrieved the handkerchief, which was found lying on the landing of the fire escape, and, upon seeing that twelve packets of cocaine and a loaded gun were wrapped in the handkerchief, they proceeded to chase the defendant. Another officer in the vicinity assisted in the defendant\u2019s arrest by apprehending him.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The defendant appeals the conviction of unlawful possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ing (1) that the trial court erred in giving a jury instruction on the meaning of constructive possession since there was insufficient evidence to warrant an instruction on this form of possession, and (2) that the trial court violated his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict by failing to instruct the jury that it had to agree on how the element of possession was proven by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">As to the first issue, we find, from our review of the record, that sufficient evidence was presented to warrant a jury instruction on constructive possession. As to the second issue, this court denies review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 526 (1973), because the defendant\u2019s claim of error is not of constitutional dimension. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 322, 337-38, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Paladino, </em>19 Conn.
