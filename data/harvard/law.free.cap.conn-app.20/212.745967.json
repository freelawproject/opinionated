The defendant appeals challenging the denial of his request for a competency evaluation and the denial of his motion to suppress his confession. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his request, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for an evaluation to determine his competency to stand trial. Defense counsel\u2019s motion was based upon the defendant\u2019s statement to the court, <em>Hadden, J., </em>during jury selection but outside of the panel\u2019s presence that he would plead guilty, but only if he was assured that he would receive the maximum sentence of twenty years. After Judge Hadden told the defendant that he would not necessarily receive the maximum sentence if he pleaded guilty, the defendant stated that he wanted to proceed to trial. No competency hearing was requested at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">On the first day of trial before the court, <em>Quinn, J., </em>but prior to the presentation of evidence, defense counsel moved for the first time that a competency hearing be ordered. This motion was based upon the defendant\u2019s statement before Judge Hadden. Defense counsel claimed that the defendant was not able to assist in his own defense. The defendant then stood before Judge Quinn and ultimately stated, for the second time, that he wanted to receive the maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">After a lengthy colloquy, Judge Quinn told the defendant that he was giving reasons to the court why he should not be sentenced to twenty years. To this, the defendant replied, \u201cI am finally getting through to somebody ... I tried my hardest on Friday. . . . I wasn\u2019t trying to put on a crazy role. I was trying to prove to the court [that putting me in prison was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the answer].\u201d After canvassing the defendant, Judge Quinn concluded, \u201clam satisfied, after talking to this gentleman, that there is no basis for an examination for mental capacity. The young man has expressed himself very, very plainly. He knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">A competency hearing should not be available upon demand. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>199 Conn. 359, 366, 507 A.2d 992 (1986). \u201cThe decision to grant a hearing requires the exercise of sound judicial discretion.\u201d Id. It is the job of the trial judge to examine the facts before him and to determine the need for a hearing. He is in the best position to weigh the evidence and to evaluate the credibility of the defendant. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In this case, Judge Quinn, an experienced criminal trial judge, observed and spoke with the defendant and was aware of that which had transpired before Judge Hadden when the defendant made his first statement. After defense counsel moved for a competency hearing, Judge Quinn spent considerable time and effort canvassing the defendant to determine whether a competency evaluation was warranted. The record reflects that the defendant engaged in an intelligent and articulate dialogue with Judge Quinn. It was, therefore, reasonable for Judge Quinn to conclude that the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial was not of a questionable nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u201c \u2018[Prisoners are not entitled and need not be permitted to make bald charges of mental incompetency to stand trial for the purpose simply of obtaining an excursion from the penitentiary. . . . A balance must be struck between the practical and the theoretical, and this can best be done by [a trial court.]\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>[437 F.2d 1255, 1258-59 (2d Cir. 1977)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>supra, 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">This court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling absent an abuse of discretion. We find that no such abuse occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his confession to Wethersfield police because (1) the state failed to prove that he voluntarily and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) his waiver was improperly obtained through promises of leniency by Detective John Salvatore of the Wethersfield police department. The defendant alternatively claims that, even if the waiver was valid, the confession was nonetheless involuntary because Salvatore\u2019s promise of leniency caused him to confess to the commission of a crime in Meriden.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The record reflects that after the police had read the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the defendant signed a notice of rights and waiver of those rights. He was then asked if he wanted to make a statement. At that time, the defendant appeared to be coherent and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The defendant testified at the suppression hearing that Salvatore had not made any promises to him but had said that he would \u201cdo some talking for\u201d the defendant. The defendant, thereafter, confessed to committing a robbery in Meriden. He was subsequently charged with that crime, and his conviction is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The defendant first challenges the denial of the suppression of his confession claiming that it was involuntarily given. The court held a full suppression hearing and heard the testimony of both the defendant and Salvatore.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>There is no dispute that the defendant received his warnings and signed a waiver. Nonetheless, the defendant claims that he was deceived by Salvatore into believing that he would be treated more leniently, and, therefore, he waived those rights. The essence of the defendant\u2019s claim is that after he was in custody at the Wethersfield police department and had been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Salvatore\u2019s statement that he would talk to the prosecutor if the defendant would cooperate constituted a promise of leniency that induced him to waive his rights. After a full hearing, Judge Quinn denied the motion finding that \u201c[tjhere is no doubt in the court\u2019s mind that [tjhe defendant knew what he did, that he understood his rights and signed the statement as to what he did.\u201d The trial court has broad discretion in evaluating the evidence and testimony presented before him. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>195 Conn. 505, 516, 488 A.2d 1256 (1985). We find that the trial court\u2019s ruling was not clearly erroneous, and, therefore, we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim, this court must take the facts as found by the trial court unless those findings are clearly erroneous. Id. This court cannot retry the facts or reconsider the credibility of witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>197 Conn. 247, 258, 496 A.2d 513 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra. On appeal in a case involving the question of voluntariness, however, our \u201c \u2018deference to the trial court\u2019s findings on questions of this nature is qualified by the necessity of an independent examination of the entire record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings of voluntariness is supported by substantial evidence.\u2019 ...\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wynter, </em>19 Conn. App. 654, 658, 564 A.2d 296 (1989). It was reasonable, on the basis of the record, for Judge Quinn to have concluded that the defendant\u2019s waiver was voluntarily and knowingly given.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The defendant alternatively argues that his statement should be suppressed because even if his waiver was valid, the confession was involuntary. He claims that the alleged promise of leniency by Salvatore caused him to confess to his criminal activity in Meriden. This claim also must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The Wethersfield police have no jurisdiction over crimes committed in Meriden. Our Supreme Court dealt with a similar factual situation in <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>supra. In that case, the court held that the confession was not coerced since it was reasonable to conclude that any promises by the police in one jurisdiction would have no impact on the defendant\u2019s decision to confess to crimes in other jursidictions. Id., 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Here, even though Salvatore might not have explicitly limited his statement concerning leniency to crimes committed within the town, as did the officer in <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>supra, that alone is not enough to render the otherwise voluntary confession involuntary. A statement by a police officer that it would be to a defendant\u2019s benefit for him to cooperate \u201c \u2018falls <em>far </em>short of creating the \u201ccompelling pressures which work to undermine the individual\u2019s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.\u201d \u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra, 519-20; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Householder, </em>7 Conn. App. 1, 10, 507 A.2d 1012 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">It is significant that the court in this case determined that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntarily given. \u201c \u2018A confession, otherwise freely and voluntarily made, is not vitiated by a promise of leniency unless such promise was the motivating cause of the confession.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tardiff, </em>374 A.2d 598, 601 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>(Me. 1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra, 519; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 18, 444 A.2d 213 (1982). Further, a statement by police that the accused\u2019s cooperation will be brought to the attention of the court is not sufficient to render it involuntary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra, 520; <em>State </em>v. <em>Householder, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">As in <em>Perry, </em>the defendant here was given no assurances that his statement would affect the outcome of the proceedings. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra, 519. Accordingly, the trial court reasonably found that the defendant\u2019s statement was voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b237-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (c) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf at any time during the criminal proceeding it appears that the defendant is not competent, counsel for the defendant . . . may request an examination to determine the defendant\u2019s competency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
