Lo Sacco\u2019s \u201cmotion for judgment of costs.\u201d This issue arises from a rather complex procedural scenario which bears description.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In 1982, the plaintiff, Triangle Contractors, Inc., successfully brought an action against Debra M. Young, Inc., to collect monies for services rendered on a construction project. Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, but, to date, the plaintiff has been unsuccessful in satisfying that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">In 1985, Triangle brought the present action against the defendants, Debra M. Young, Inc., Debra M. Young, and Frank X. Lo Sacco, alleging that the previously obtained judgment could not be satisfied because the entirety of the assets of Debra M. Young, Inc., had been transferred to Lo Sacco. On October 11, 1988, Triangle withdrew the action as to the defendant Lo Sacco. Thereafter, Triangle and the other defendants stipulated to judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">On November 29,1988, Lo Sacco filed a bill of costs with the court, and, on the next day, he filed a \u201cmotion for judgment for costs as to Defendant Frank X. Lo Sacco upon withdrawal by plaintiff.\u201d After a hearing on December 12,1988, the trial court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>denied the motion. In response to Lo Sacco\u2019s motion for articulation, Judge Fracasse stated that he denied the motion because \u201cthere is not such a motion or pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>cedure provided by the rules of practice.\u201d It is from that denial that Lo Sacco now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">To complete the procedural scenario, however, we must also note that, subsequent to the trial court\u2019s denial of his \u201cmotion for judgment of costs\u201d and his appeal therefrom, Lo Sacco filed an amended bill of costs with the clerk of the court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 412.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing held on January 31,1989, the clerk denied Lo Sacco\u2019s motion and ordered no taxation of costs \u201csince there is an appeal pending to the Appellate Court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lo Sacco took no appeal from that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Lo Sacco argues that the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of costs. He bases his claim on General Statutes \u00a7 52-81<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which mandates that, if claimed by him, a judgment for costs be entered upon the withdrawal of an action by the plaintiff. The gravamen of Lo Sacco\u2019s argument rests on the fact that he initially looked to the clerk of the court for his costs, but the clerk directed him to the court. The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>denied his motion and, in effect, returned him to the clerk. Lo Sacco appealed the trial court\u2019s denial and the clerk, in turn, denied him costs because of the pending appeal. The essence of Lo Sacco\u2019s argument is that in light of this procedural maze he was wrongfully denied his statutorily mandated reimbursement of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">This appeal exposes an unresolved gray area of procedure between the rules of practice and the General Statutes. The right to costs must be based on some statute or authorized rule of the court. <em>Condon </em>v. <em>Pomroy-Grace, </em>73 Conn. 607, 614, 48 A. 756 (1901); see also <em>Bridgeport Gas Co. </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers, </em>21 Conn. Sup. 331, 154 A.2d 530 (1959). General Statutes \u00a7 52-81 authorizes the taxation of costs in favor of a party against whom any civil action has been withdrawn. Indeed, the statutory language <em>mandates </em>the allowance of costs upon withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Alternatively, Practice Book \u00a7 412 establishes the general procedure for the taxation of costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That procedure requires that the taxation of costs in civil cases begin with action by the court clerk. \u201cOnly after the clerk has given notice to the adverse party to be present and has proceeded to tax costs does the rule provide for appeal of that taxation to the trial court.\u201d <em>(E. O\u2019Connell, J., </em>dissenting). <em>Birmingham </em>v. <em>Kielczewski, </em>17 Conn. App. 219, 224, 551 A.2d 1260 (1988). This general procedure applies in a civil action where there is a prevailing party in whose favor a decision or verdict is rendered and judgment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Lo Sacco argues that the statutory language of General Statutes \u00a7 52-81, which mandates the taxation of costs upon withdrawal of an action, does not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>that he follow the procedures specified in Practice Book \u00a7 412. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Notwithstanding the fact that judges and not clerks \u201crender\u201d judgments, to be consistent with our rules of practice the pertinent language of General Statutes \u00a7 52-81 must be interpreted so as to require the party against whom an action has been withdrawn to follow the procedures of Practice Book \u00a7 412. Under that provision, the clerk acts as an agent of the court. Should there be no resulting appeal, the clerk\u2019s action will become a part of the trial court\u2019s judgment in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">While the clerk has no discretion to order the taxation of the costs, the amount of the costs might well be contested at a hearing before the clerk.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An appeal from that decision would lie in the trial court. See Practice Book \u00a7 412; <em>Krawiec </em>v. <em>Kraft, </em>163 Conn. 445, 447-48, 311 A.2d 82 (1972); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>36 Conn. Sup. 15, 16, 409 A.2d 1250 (1979). Should the clerk refuse to tax <em>any </em>costs pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-81, \u201cthe remedy is a petition to the court to order the clerk to perform an act as required by law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>32 Conn. Sup. 322, 323, 353 A.2d 796 (1975); <em>Gordan </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>5 Conn. Sup. 292, 293 (1937); see <em>Shaker </em>v. <em>Shaker, </em>12 Conn. Sup. 197, 198 (1943); 2 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 312e.\u201d <em>Birmingham </em>v. <em>Kielczewski, </em>supra, 223-24 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In the present case, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow Lo Sacco, in effect, to bypass the procedures of Practice Book \u00a7 412 and create a new procedure that cannot be found in our rules of practice. The court\u2019s denial of Lo Sacco\u2019s \u201cmotion for judgment of costs upon withdrawal\u201d created an appealable order; see <em>Wildman </em>v. <em>Munger, </em>70 Conn. 380, 382, 39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>A. 599 (1898); that has allowed this court to clarify the procedure for the taxation of costs upon the withdrawal of an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We conclude that our decision to confine the remedy of seeking costs upon withdrawal exclusively to the confines of Practice Book \u00a7 412, (1) relieves the trial court of a duty that the clerk, as an arm of the court, provides routinely in other nonwithdrawal civil cases, and (2) keeps the administration of the taxation of all costs consistently within one office. Our decision today neither works any injustice nor imposes any unnecessary burden on any party. Rather, it is within the spirit of Practice Book \u00a7 6 to allow for the liberal interpretation of our rules of practice which have been designed to \u201cfacilitate business and advance justice.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">There is no error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 412 provides: \u201cBills of costs in civil cases may be taxed by the clerk or assistant clerk, but reasonable notice shall be given to the adverse party, or his attorney, to be present at the taxation, if the appearance of such party be entered on the docket. Either party may appeal from such taxation to the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\"> The appeal referred to here is Lo Sacco\u2019s appeal of the denial by the trial court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>of his motion for judgment of costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-81 provides: \u201cUpon the withdrawal of any civil action after it has been returned to court and entered upon the docket, and after an appearance has been entered for the defendant, a judgment for costs, if claimed by him, shall be rendered in his favor, but not otherwise. Judgment for costs shall not be rendered after the expiration of six months from the date of the withdrawal and no costs may be allowed which accrued after actual notice in writing of the withdrawal and no costs may be allowed which accrued after actual notice in writing of the withdrawal was given by the plaintiff to the defendant or his attorney, unless good reason therefor is shown to the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> See 2 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d. Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 302a and 312, regarding the complete procedure for taxation of costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b246-8\"> In the present case, there does, in fact, seem to be a dispute as to the appropriate amount of costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b247-11\"> Practice Book \u00a7 6 provides: \u201cThe design of these rules being to facilitate business and advance justice, they will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AcD\"> We note again that the clerk to whom the defendant submitted the \u201cAmended Bill of Costs\u201d denied the costs on the basis of the pendency of this present appeal. With the resolution of this appeal, it is evidently incumbent upon the clerk to process Lo Sacco\u2019s bill of costs in a manner that comports with this decision, the rules of practice and the General Statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
