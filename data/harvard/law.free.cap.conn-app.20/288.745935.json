App. 174, 551 A.2d 763 (1988). After obtaining the written consent of the victim and her mother, the trial judge complied with the order on remand and found \u201cthat there is no relevant evidence in the victim\u2019s psychiatric records which would be admissible for impeachment purposes and that, notwithstanding nonaccess to said records, the defendant was not denied the right of cross-examination guaranteed to him by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\u201d The defendant claims that the trial court erred in making that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">We have reviewed the psychiatric records submitted as sealed exhibits and after a careful and thorough examination we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant access to the privileged material. <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 58-59, 561 A.2d 422 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
