In November, 1985, the defendant, Campanaro Construction Company, entered into a construction contract with the state to build a flood control channel at the Great Creek Silver Sands State Park in the city of Milford. In connection with this project, the defendant entered into a subcontractor agreement with Northeast Dredging, Inc., under which Northeast was to furnish all labor and equipment necessary to construct the new Great Creek Channel. On or about August 19,1986, a sewer pipe ruptured in the area of the Great Creek Silver Sands Park where Northeast was working.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The named plaintiff, Larry Williams, is a commercial shellfisherman who leases shellfish beds in the Connecticut waters off the coast of Milford.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of the pipe rupture, sewage was discharged into the surrounding waters causing the closure, from August 19 to September 3,1986, of shellfish beds leased by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">The case was referred to an attorney trial referee who, after a hearing, issued a report recommending that judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiffs on the negligence count<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the complaint in the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>of $6809.60, which was the amount of damages to which Williams had testified. The trial court accepted the referee\u2019s recommendation and rendered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in accepting the referee\u2019s conclusion that the evidence introduced at trial established a cause of action in negligence against the defendant. Specifically, the defendant argues that the evidence failed to establish (1) that the sewer pipe was ruptured due to the negligent conduct of the defendant, and (2) that Northeast was an agent of the defendant company. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">A review of the record reveals that, in her report, the referee made absolutely no reference to agency, negligence or negligent conduct. The defendant filed a motion to correct the memorandum of decision requesting that the referee address these deficiencies. The referee, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion, articulated that \u201cevidence adduced at trial\u201d led her to conclude that Northeast \u201cwas an agent and under contract with the defendant and that the sewer line rupture was caused while Northeast Dredging Company, Inc., was in performance of its contract with the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The function of this court is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>1477 Central Avenue Apartments, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 246, 256-57, 524 A.2d 610 (1987); <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions of the trial court are \u201c \u2018legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision ....\u2019\u201d <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>1477 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>Central Avenue Apartments, Inc., </em>supra, 256. \u201c \u2018In reviewing the evidence ... we must give it the most favorable construction in support of the verdict of which it is reasonably capable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 67, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Our review of the record reveals that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of liability for negligence against the defendant. \u201cRecovery of damages in negligence requires proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the actor owed a <em>duty </em>of care to the victim, which was breached by the actor\u2019s failure to meet the <em>standard of care </em>arising therefrom and that the breach was the proximate cause of actual harm suffered by the victim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Lenox Homes, Inc., </em>186 Conn. 370, 372, 441 A.2d 620 (1982). \u201c[T]he trier may not decide an issue which is wholly unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>New Haven Savings Bank </em>v. <em>West Haven Sound Development, </em>190 Conn. 60, 71-72, 459 A.2d 999 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">At best, the evidence before the trial referee established (1) that Northeast and the defendant had entered into a general contractor-subcontractor relationship that related to dredging work in the waters off of the Great Silver Sands State Park area, (2) that a sewer pipe ruptured in the area where Northeast was working, and (3) that the state of Connecticut closed the shellfish beds leased by the plaintiffs, causing them to lose certain revenues during the period of closure. It is clear from the record, however, that the plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence to establish that Northeast or Campanaro was responsible for the rupture. The referee heard absolutely no evidence from which she could conclude that the sewer pipe ruptured due to a deviation from an applicable standard of care by either Northeast or the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, there is no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>dence regarding the nature of Northeast\u2019s dredging operations. Furthermore, the record reveals no evidence as to the circumstances under which the sewer pipe ruptured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">While the trial referee recognized during the hearing that \u201cproximate causation . . . is the issue here\u201d and while she requested posthearing briefs on \u201cwhatever duty you feel that you, the general contractor, owed the plaintiff[s],\u201d she ignored these issues in her final decision. In the final analysis, there was no evidence upon which the court could have logically concluded as to how the pipe broke, who broke it or under what circumstances it broke. \u201cThere is no question but that a plaintiff must remove the issues of negligence and proximate cause from the field of conjecture and speculation.\u201d <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Drezek, </em>175 Conn. 230, 236, 397 A.2d 1335 (1978). Because we find that the trial referee\u2019s conclusions rest not on sufficient evidence but on speculation, the plaintiffs cannot prevail.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the trial court with direction to render judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-10\"> The other plaintiff in this action is Jesse D., Inc., a Connecticut corporation that operates a shellfish harvesting business in the waters off Milford and that is wholly owned by and employs the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b734-11\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sought recovery based on theories of negligence, nuisance, trespass and violation of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-427, which prohibits pollution or discharge of wastes in any of the waters in the state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>The referee\u2019s memorandum of decision made no mention of the nuisance and trespass counts. Accordingly, we must conclude that the referee found no basis in the evidence to support those allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\"> This case is distinguishable from <em>Wilcox Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mansour Builders, Inc., </em>20 Conn. App. 420, 567 A.2d 1250 (1989) (where it was error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>for the trial court, sua sponte, to substitute its own factual findings for those of the factfinders). In this case, we take the facts as found by the trial referee, and we conclude that those facts are insufficient to support a conclusion of negligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b737-11\"> The essence of this insufficiency was captured during the following portion of the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-examination of Robert Campanaro, vice president of operations of the defendant company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">\u201cQ: Did Northeast Dredging break the pipe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-13\">\u201cA: I don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">In addition, we are not persuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Robert Campanaro\u2019s statement at the hearing, that \u201cNortheast was responsible for the break,\u201d was a concession of negligence. We conclude from our review of the record that the statement was not based on anything other than speculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b737-15\"> In light of our decision on this issue, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence from which the referee could have concluded that an agency relationship existed between the defendant and Northeast.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b737-16\"> See <em>Dills </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>210 Conn. 705, 713, 557 A.2d 517 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
