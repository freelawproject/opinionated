We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">In this appeal, the plaintiff attacks the discretionary and factfinding functions of the trial court. In reaching its decision, the trial court properly considered the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 and the evidence and financial affidavits of the parties. Our review of the record, transcripts and briefs fails to disclose any abuse of discretion. The trial court\u2019s conclusions were in accordance with applicable law. \u201cA fundamental principle in dissolution actions is that a trial court may exercise broad discretion in awarding alimony and dividing property as long as it considers all relevant statutory criteria.\u201d <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>13 Conn. App. 129, 131, 534 A.2d 1251 (1987).
