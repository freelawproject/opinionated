The defendant had denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for a declaratory ruling to establish a three acre farm pond for the operation of a Christmas tree farm on his premises. The plaintiff claims that the court erred in concluding (1) that he was not entitled to establish a three acre farm pond as a matter of right pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (1), as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>amended by Public Acts 1987, No. 87-538, and \u00a7 3.1 of the regulations of the conservation commission of the town of Easton, (2) that the defendant\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record, and (3) that the hearing afforded to the plaintiff was fundamentally fair. We have fully considered the plaintiff\u2019s claims, the defendant\u2019s responses thereto, the entire record of this case and the trial court\u2019s thoughtful memorandum of decision. On the basis of that review, we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s claims of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
