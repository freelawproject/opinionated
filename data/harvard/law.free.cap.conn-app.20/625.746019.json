The defendants Frank and Rosalie Lato (hereinafter defendants) appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment accepting the report of the attorney trial referee and ruling in favor of the plaintiff, All American Pools, Inc. They claim that the attorney trial referee erred (1) in finding that the Home Solicitation Sales Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not apply to the parties\u2019 agreement, (2) in finding that the defendants failed to prove that the plaintiff did not hold the necessary licenses and permits required by the Home Improvement Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) in finding that the plaintiff did not use a fictitious name in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 35-1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or \u00a7 42-110b,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) in finding that the agreement between the parties was not void as a matter of public policy and not awarding sums already paid to the plaintiff and attorney\u2019s fees to the defendant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>(5) in allowing the plaintiff to amend its pleadings after trial in order to conform to the requirements of new case law. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Most of the relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. The plaintiff and the named defendant, the husband of the defendant Rosalie Lato, entered into a written service contract dated June 10,1984, for repair work to be performed on the defendants\u2019 pool. The services described in that agreement were performed, and Frank Lato made the full cash payment. Subsequently, the plaintiff performed additional services on the defendants\u2019 pool. That additional work is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The plaintiff claims that these additional services were performed pursuant to an agreement between the plaintiff and Frank Lato, who acted with his wife\u2019s knowledge. The defendants do not deny this contention, but rather they assert that the agreement is unenforceable because the services fall under the Home Solicitation Sales Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The defendants challenge several factual findings made by the attorney trial referee. In addressing a challenge to the facts found by the attorney referee, this court\u2019s function is to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 473, 542 A.2d 692 (1988). Only if they are clearly erroneous can we reverse the findings. \u201cThe resolution of conflicting factual claims falls within the province of the trial court.\u201d Id. This court cannot retry those facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The defendants claim that the attorney referee erred in finding that the Home Solicitation Sales Act was inapplicable to this case because the initial contact between the parties occurred at the plaintiff\u2019s place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>business. They further claim that the referee erred in finding that the plaintiff held the necessary licenses and permits required by General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq. to perform home improvement work and that the plaintiff did not use an unregistered and fictitious name in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 35-1 or General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The plaintiffs president, John Romano, testified that the initial contact between the parties took place at its place of business. The defendants testified that no contact took place at the plaintiffs office, but rather, that the contract was entered into at their home and that, therefore, the agreement fell under the Home Solicitation Sales Act. Romano also testified before the referee that he was a licensed contractor and that a plumbing permit, which the defendants claim was necessary, was not specifically required for the work that his company performs. The defendants, although alleging a violation by the plaintiff of the Unfair Trade Practices Act for using an unregistered or fictitious name, produced no evidence to support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The attorney referee found the following facts. Rosalie Lato initially contacted the plaintiff at its place of business to engage its services to repair the defendants\u2019 pool. Frank Lato then entered into a written agreement with the plaintiff. After performance of the work outlined in the written contract was completed, the plaintiff advised the defendants that additional work was required, and Frank Lato agreed. He agreed to pay the amount due, $2561, within one week after completion. Upon completion of the work, the plaintiff sent bills to the defendants, but they did not pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Upon review of the entire record, we can find no reason to disturb the attorney referee\u2019s findings of fact. The finder of fact is in the best position to pass on the credibility of witnesses; <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>supra; and she was free, therefore, to believe the plaintiffs witness. Because the referee\u2019s findings are adequately supported by the record, we conclude that there is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Having concluded that the attorney referee did not err in finding that the initial contact between the parties occurred in the plaintiff\u2019s office, it follows that she correctly held the Home Solicitation Sales Act inapplicable to this case. Further, because we have concluded that the referee was reasonable in finding no statutory violation by the plaintiff, the defendants\u2019 claim that the contract was void as against public policy, based upon these alleged violations, also must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Finally, the trial court did not err in allowing the plaintiff to amend its pleadings after trial in order to conform with the proof presented at trial and with new case law that was decided during the trial. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>R.F.K. Corporation, </em>19 Conn. App. 548, 550, 563 A.2d 738 (1989). \u201c \u2018The trial court may allow, in its discretion, an amendment to pleadings. . . . Such a ruling can be reversed only upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. . . . Factors to be considered in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion include unreasonable delay, fairness to opposing parties and the negligence of the party offering the amendment. . . .\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Colonial Bank &amp; Trust </em>v. <em>Matoff, </em>18 Conn. App. 20, 26, 556 A.2d 619 (1989); see also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>R.F.K. Corporation, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Midway through trial, our Supreme Court decided the case of <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 513 A.2d 43 (1986). That case held that General Statutes \u00a7 20-429, a section of the Home Improvement Act, bars enforcement of oral home improvement agreements that have been fully performed by the contractor and partially performed by the homeowner. In light of <em>Caulkins, </em>and of the fact that the defendants attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>to prove that the agreement for additional work was not outlined in any written documents, the plaintiff moved to amend his complaint to conform with that law and evidence. The court granted that motion, characterizing the amendment as technical, and gave the defendants the opportunity to present additional evidence to the attorney referee. The defendants presented no further evidence, and judgment was then entered upon the referee\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The trial, court did not abuse its discretion in allowing this amendment. The defendants suffered no prejudice because the court offered them an opportunity to respond. Moreover, the plaintiff had no way of knowing that <em>Caulkins </em>would be decided midway through trial and that the defendants would be able to rely on its ruling in presenting their evidence, and, therefore, it was not negligence that necessitated the amendment. A party is permitted to amend the pleadings to conform with the proof offered. Practice Book \u00a7 178; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>R.F.K. Corporation, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-5\"> The Home Solicitation Sales Act is contained in General Statutes \u00a7 42-134a et seq. General Statutes \u00a7 42-134a (a) defines a home solicitation sale as: \u201cA sale ... of consumer goods or services ... in which the seller or his representative personally solicits the sale, including those in response to or following an invitation by the buyer, and the buyer\u2019s agreement or offer to purchase is made at a place <em>other than the place of business of the seller. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The federal Commercial Practices Act, 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 429.1, note 1 (a) (1988), defines a door to door sale in language identical to that of our state act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq. constitute the Home Improvement Act.
