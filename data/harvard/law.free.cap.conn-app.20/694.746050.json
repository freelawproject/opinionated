We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The evidence produced at trial reasonably supports the following facts. On an evening in May, 1988, the victim\u2019s mother was caring for the eight year old victim and the thirteen year old defendant. She discovered the children alone in a bedroom, the defendant standing before the victim with his hands on her head and his erect penis exposed. The defendant was subsequently tried and found guilty of a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court determined that there was insufficient evidence to find that the children had engaged in sexual intercourse, but did find that sexual contact had occurred. On the basis of this violation, the defendant was adjudicated a delinquent, and committed to the department of children and youth services. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The defendant claims that \u00a7 53-21 is vague as applied to him and, therefore, that his prosecution under that statute was in derogation of his due process rights under the state and federal constitutions. A claim that a statute is void for vagueness implicates the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>have notice that an activity is prohibited by a criminal statute. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 460, 542 A.2d 686 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 165, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984). The test of unconstitutional vagueness is whether the law as applied to the circumstances of a particular defendant creates doubt about the legality of his particular conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Proto, </em>203 Conn. 682, 696, 526 A.2d 1297 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The defendant first claims that he had no notice that the statute applies to the actions of one who is himself a minor. We cannot agree. Section 53-21 provides that \u201cany person\u201d who engages in the proscribed conduct is in violation of the statute. Statutory language clear on its face will be construed for what it says. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 150, 460 A.2d 26 (1983). The statute does not limit the definition of \u201cany person\u201d to adults. The legislature was free to, and did not, define violators in terms of age. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (a) (scope of offense of illegal sale of controlled substance to minors limited to sellers at least eighteen years old). The defendant cannot contest the fact that he is in the class of \u201cany person,\u201d nor is there any merit to his claim that he is the first juvenile to fall within the statute\u2019s purview. See <em>In re Michael B., </em>41 Conn. Sup. 229, 566 A.2d 446 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The defendant argues that, as a matter of policy, \u00a7 53-21 should not apply to violators who are minors since they are themselves within the class of children protected by the statute. Despite the defendant\u2019s assertion that interpreting \u00a7 53-21 to include acts between children would criminalize instances of \u201cplaying doctor,\u201d we will not interpret the law to give minors license to sexually molest other minors. It is contrary to the law\u2019s intent, and to common sense, to establish a policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>that withdraws the law\u2019s protection from the victim in order to protect the violator, even one who is a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The defendant also claims that \u00a7 53-21 is vague as applied to the facts of this case because he had no notice that his conduct was within the ambit of the acts proscribed. Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, the defendant claims that his conviction for impairing a minor\u2019s morals cannot stand because there was no proof that he deliberately touched the victim\u2019s private parts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Our Supreme Court has determined that while the language of \u00a7 53-21 fails to provide an objective definition of proscribed conduct, judicial decisions have provided sufficient guidelines to save the statute from its facial invalidity. Id., 462. The defendant here was charged with committing an act upon the victim likely to impair the victim\u2019s morals, one of two general types of behavior proscribed by \u00a7 53-21. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Laracuente, </em>205 Conn. 515, 521-22, 534 A.2d 882, cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1036, 108 S. Ct. 1598, 99 L. Ed. 2d 913 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 250, 188 A.2d 65 (1963). The controlling standard for defining acts likely to impair morals is provided by <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 428 A.2d 322 (1980). \u201cThis court\u2019s opinions pursuant to \u00a7 53-21 make it clear that the deliberate touching of the private parts of a child under the age of sixteen in a sexual and indecent manner is violative of the statute.\u201d Id., 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">In reiterating this standard, the court in <em>Schriver </em>rejected the argument that the judicial gloss <em>o\u00ed Pickering </em>did not exhaustively define the reach of the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 463. The court refused to construe the statute to proscribe conduct that is merely \u201csexually suggestive\u201d; id., 463-64; as it is not \u201cthe type of lewd conduct that \u00a7 53-21 proscribes.\u201d Id., 466. The defendant here would have us follow the <em>Schriver </em>gloss on \u00a7 53-21 so narrowly as to hold that because he touched the victim <em>with his </em>private parts, rather than <em>on her </em>private parts, he did not commit an act likely to impair her morals. This we cannot accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">While the defendant here did not touch the victim\u2019s private parts, his act does constitute the type of \u201clewd conduct\u201d within the reach of \u00a7 53-21. The trial court expressly found that the defendant\u2019s penis touched the victim\u2019s mouth. Such contact falls within the definition of sexual contact under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (3), which includes not only \u201cany contact with the intimate parts of a person not married to the actor\u201d but <em>\u201cany contact of the intimate parts of the actor </em>with a person not married to the actor for the purpose of sexual gratification of the actor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court in <em>Schriver </em>recognized the desirability of reconciling the scope of \u00a7 53-21 with similar provisions of the penal code, and our conclusion that \u00a7 53-21 encompasses the defendant\u2019s conduct is consistent with the general principles of creating a consistent body of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 463 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The import of the <em>Schriver </em>decision was to resist the broadening of the scope of the acts that violate \u00a7 53-21 in order to provide the objective criteria for enforcement necessary to save the statute from unconstitutional vagueness. We hold here that acts likely to impair the morals of a minor include the deliberate touching of a child under sixteen years old with one\u2019s private parts in a sexual and indecent manner. We conclude that this conduct is sufficiently definite and objective so as to provide the required enforcement standards. The trial court correctly concluded that the defendant had com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>mitted an act from which the legislature, by its enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, sought to protect the minor children of the state, and thus properly adjudicated him a delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cINJURY OR risk op INJURY to, OR impairing morals op, children. Any person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured, or its morals likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\"> The defendant was originally charged with the crimes of sexual assault in the first and second degrees and risk of injury to a child. The sexual assault charges were dismissed at trial. An adjudication of delinquency based on the crime of sexual assault in the third degree was subsequently dismissed upon the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\"> For the purposes of prosecutions under General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, the terms \u201cprivate parts\u201d and \u201cintimate parts\u201d are synonymous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 463 n.4, 542 A.2d 686 (1988). General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (8) defines intimate parts as \u201cthe genital area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
