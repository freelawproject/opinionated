Hoback, the Co-Trustees of the Sagacious Sentinel Sycamore Revocable Trust, have appealed the Indiana Board of Tax Review's final determination regarding the assessment of their real property for the 2016 tax year. While the Co-Trustees raise several issues on appeal, the Court consolidates them and restates them as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   I. Whether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the Co-Trustees' annexation and storm water claims; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   II. Whether the Indiana Board erred in upholding the assessment of the Co-Trustees' farmland.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon review, the Court finds in favor of the Co-Trustees with respect to Issue I and in favor of the Assessor with respect to Issue II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the 2016 tax year, the Co-Trustees owned 54.05 acres of land located along a portion of West County Road 650 North in the Town of McCordsville, Hancock County, Indiana. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 99, 141.) They leased 37 acres of the land to a farmer who used no-till practices to cultivate and harvest field corn and soybeans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 27-28, 60.) The remainder of the land was unsuitable for farming and thus remained in its natural state. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 27-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the 2016 tax year, the Hancock County Assessor assigned the property an assessed value of $88,400. The Co-Trustees appealed the assessment, first to the Hancock County Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals and then to the Indiana Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Indiana Board held a hearing on the matter on August 18, 2017. During the hearing, the Co-Trustees claimed their property tax liability was incorrect because the ordinance that purported to annex their farmland to the Town of McCordsville (the \"Town\") was invalid. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 62-63, 181-82.) The Co-Trustees also claimed they did not owe nearly $3,000 in delinquent storm water charges and penalties that resulted from the Town's unauthorized imposition of a tax. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 25, 171-77.) The Co-Trustees further asserted that 1.05 acres of their land should have been assessed as nontillable land because it was incapable of being farmed, and that their overall assessment was too high given their land's actual crop production capacity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 158-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, the Assessor argued that the Co-Trustees' annexation and storm water claims should be dismissed because the Indiana Board lacked the statutory authority to address them. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 148-49, 226-27.) The Assessor also claimed that her assessment should be upheld in its entirety because it comported with Indiana's assessment guidelines for agricultural property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 200-19, 227-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 17, 2018, the Indiana Board issued its final determination that declined to address the Co-Trustees' annexation and storm water claims due to a lack of statutory authority. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 118-20 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 19.) The Indiana Board\n   also determined that while the Co-Trustees had shown that 1.05 acres of their land should have been assessed as nontillable land, they failed to show that their assessment should be changed in any other manner. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 119-20 \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 2, 2018, the Co-Trustees filed a petition for review with the Tax Court. The Tax Court heard oral argument on September 14, 2018. Additional facts will be supplied when necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The party seeking to overturn a final determination of the Indiana Board bears the burden of demonstrating its invalidity.\n    <em>\n     Osolo Twp.

Thus, the Co-Trustees must demonstrate to the Court that the Indiana Board's final determination is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess or short of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations; without observance of the procedure required by law; or unsupported by substantial or reliable evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    IND.

Consequently, \" '[t]he\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    relevant inquiry in determining whether any court has [ ] subject matter jurisdiction is to ask whether the kind of claim which the plaintiff advances falls within the general scope of the authority conferred upon [the] court by the constitution or by statute.' \"\n    <em>\n     Marion Cty.

(\n    <em>\n     Compare,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Pet'rs' Br. at 5-8\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Resp't Br. at 5-6.) (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    Cert. Admin. R. at 62-63.) Thus, the first question the Court must answer is whether the Town's storm water charges are taxes, which may implicate the Court's jurisdiction, or user fees, which cannot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The Storm Water Act allows certain municipalities to adopt ordinances that create special taxing districts comprised of all the territory within their corporate boundaries.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    IND. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 8-1.5-5-1, -4, -5(a)(2) (2018). The special taxing districts collect and dispose of storm water in a manner that protects the public health and welfare and may levy \"special benefit taxes for purposes of storm water collection and disposal.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    I.C. \u00a7 8-1.5-5-5(b). More specifically, the storm water facilities may be financed through \"(1) proceeds of special taxing district bonds of the storm water district; (2) the assumption of liability incurred to construct the storm water system being acquired; (3) service rates; (4) revenue bonds; or (5) any other available funds.\" IND. CODE \u00a7 8-1.5-5-7(a) (2018). The assessment and collection of \"user fees\" from the owners of the district's property may be accomplished by a periodic billing system or by placing a charge on the semiannual property tax statements of the affected property owners.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    I.C. \u00a7 8-1.5-5-7(b) - (c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The Co-Trustees claim the actual language of the Storm Water Act indicates that the Town's storm water charges are taxes because it authorizes the creation of special taxing districts that may collect special benefit taxes to operate and maintain the storm water infrastructure. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pet'rs' Br. at 26-27.) The Assessor, however, construes the statutory language differently, claiming its express delineation of financing methods, particularly \"service rates\" and \"proceeds of special taxing district bonds,\" indicates that the storm water charges are user fees, not taxes. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resp't Br. at 10 (stating that lumping the financing methods together would render the legislature's delineation of those methods meaningless).) The Assessor further maintains that the storm water charges are user fees because they are not derived from an exercise of the taxing power, based on \"standard taxation considerations ... such as taxable income or even property value[,]\" and \"collected and paid along with a resident's other taxes[.]\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resp't Br. at 10-11 (citing\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Fed'n Indep.

Tax Ct. 2014). Here, contrary to the Assessor's argument, the Storm Water Act's delineation of the financing methods does not indicate whether the storm water charges are user fees or taxes because special benefit taxes may take the form of either a uniform assessment based on a property's frontage, for example, or a pro-rata charge based on the benefits received by the property.\n    <em>\n     Martin v.

The certified administrative record indicates that the Town imposed storm water charges on nearly all the real property within its corporate boundaries. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cert. Admin. R. at 85 (excluding only public rights-of-way, wooded properties, and properties with utility towers).) It appears that the owners of that property receive bills for the charges either on a monthly basis with the billing statements for their other Town services or biannually with their property tax bills. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cert. Admin. R. at 83, 87.) While a property owner may request an adjustment to the charge, there is no indication that he can decline to use the service altogether or control the extent to which the service is used. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cert. Admin. R. at 87-88.) Accordingly, the Town's storm water charge is a compulsory charge.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    To the extent the Town's storm water system is statutorily deemed to confer a special benefit on all property currently within, or subsequently added to, the special taxing district, the benefits conferred are not confined to the property itself or the owners of that property.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    I.C. \u00a7 8-1.5-5-5(b). Indeed, improved water quality, avoiding penalties for improper discharge, and creating a mechanism to remove excess water from property and prevent flooding are goals that benefit all the Town's residents and do not necessarily enhance the value of property. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pet'rs' Br. at 22-23 (indicating that the Town is subject to specific EPA and IDEM regulation).)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Here, the Co-Trustees' annexation and storm water claims raise defenses to the collection of a tax.

The Assessor, on the other hand, maintains that the Co-Trustees have not appealed an Indiana Board final determination because the Indiana Board did not address their claims on the merits.

In this case, even though the Indiana Board determined that it lacked the statutory authority to address the Co-Trustees' annexation and storm water claims, it ended the administrative process with respect to those claims and ultimately compelled the Co-Trustees to challenge that determination by filing an appeal with the Tax Court. Consequently, the Co-Trustees have satisfied the final determination requirement as well.

During the Indiana Board hearing, the Co-Trustees claimed that the commercial development of nearby land had destroyed some of their drainage tiles and left their tillable land prone to flooding, which caused its annual yields of soybeans and corn to fall below the State's averages for six of the last eight years. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cert. Admin. R. at 158-61, 166-70.) The Co-Trustees maintained that their assessment should be reduced from $88,400 to approximately $61,860 to account for its decreased productivity. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cert. Admin. R. at 143, 160-61.) To support their position, the Co-Trustees offered a Production Chart for 2008 through 2016 that compared their annual yields of soybeans and corn to the State's average yields and explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    What we have is the soil in 2015 was down 28% from the State, 21% in 2014, 22% in 2013 and the drought year of 2012 it was +32% and in 2011 it was a dry year and we were above the average by 0.14 and in 2010 the property was below the State average in 19.6 and in 2009 which was also seems like an average year we were down by 2% from the average and in 2008 since we have records it was down .344%. If we use a mode[,] we believe approximately we are down 20.6% average per year. If we use an average[,] we are down 11.4%. [S]o our request is that because of the way that the property is set up that with the 8% increase in Crosby [soil type] we would like to have our property reduced down by a total of 11.4 plus the 8% which would be a total of 19.4% in evaluation for assessment which would reduce the assessment on ...

Nonetheless, nothing within the certified administrative record demonstrates that the Co-Trustees' evidence actually converts the decreased crop production capacity into a value or that their valuation method comports with generally accepted appraisal principles. Consequently, the Indiana Board did not err when it determined that the Co-Trustees failed to establish a\n    <em>\n     prima\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     facie\n    </em>\n    case for an assessment reduction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    For the above-stated reasons, the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the Co-Trustees' annexation and storm water claims and AFFIRMS the Indiana Board's final determination with respect to Issue II. The Court, however, must REMAND this matter to the Indiana Board for additional proceedings for the following reasons. The Indiana Board is the finder of fact and consequently must weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of witnesses.\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Stinson v.

Therefore, when litigants present the Indiana Board with claims that it lacks the authority to resolve, such as constitutional challenges, the Indiana Board must still make factual findings regarding those claims to facilitate the Court's subsequent review and resolution of the issues presented.\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Spencer Cty.

In this case, the Indiana Board cannot resolve the issue whether the tax was properly imposed because it lacks the authority to determine the validity of the annexation and storm water ordinances; nonetheless, the Indiana Board must still make factual findings for the Court to use in resolving the matter. Accordingly, the Court now REMANDS the case with instructions for the Indiana Board to first consider whether the Town or any other entity should be joined as a party under Indiana Trial Rule 19. Then, the Indiana Board shall conduct another hearing on the Co-Trustees' annexation and storm water claims, allowing the parties to introduce additional evidence should they so desire, and enter specific findings of fact thereto.
