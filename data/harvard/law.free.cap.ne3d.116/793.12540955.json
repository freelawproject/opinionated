Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Non-parties, Patrick L. Berry, Sr., Donteze Morris, and Michael Yopko (collectively referred to as \"prize winners\"), won prizes in the Ohio lottery. All three prize winners elected to receive their lottery prize winnings in installment payments over time. All three prize winners then proceeded over time to sell, assign, or redirect some or all of their future prize installment payments. In order to do this, title to the future prize installment payments had to be transferred to the persons or entities receiving the payments. After the initial transfer by the prize winners, the same Berry, Morris, and Yopko future prize installment payments were transferred multiple times again. Ultimately, an agreement was made to transfer the same future prize installment payments to Acubens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 30, 2017, Acubens filed in the trial court applications for approval of the transfer of numerous future lottery prize installments payments. The Lottery Commission intervened, and on July 13, 2017, the Lottery Commission filed a brief opposing the applications to transfer. On July 14, 2017, Acubens filed a brief in support of the applications to transfer. On August 10, 2017, the parties filed joint stipulations of fact. According to the joint stipulations, Acubens entered into a Lottery Receivables Purchase and Sale Agreement (\"the agreement\") with two entities, B of I Lottery Receivables LLC I (\"B of I\") and Travilah Road Titling Trust (\"Travilah\") (collectively, \"the transferors\") for the purpose of transferring future prize installment payments from 32 awards from the transferors to Acubens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} According to the joint stipulations, the transferors \"acquired the rights to receive the 32 prize awards from Ohio 'prize winners' as defined in the Ohio Lottery Act.\" (Joint Stip. at 1.) The trial court previously granted 20 of 32 applications to transfer. The Lottery Commission objected to the remaining 12\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   applications, including the applications to transfer the future prize installments from the Berry, Morris, and Yopko awards at issue in the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The parties agreed that \"B of I and Travilah are 'transferors' as defined in R.C. 377[0].10(H) in the [3] transactions presently before the Court.\" (Joint Stip. at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The joint stipulations provided additional details relevant to each of the three prize winners' awards. Berry previously made three transfers, in addition to the retitling transfer from the transferors to Acubens at issue in the present appeal. Berry had no remainder from his award. Yopko previously made three transfers and there was one \"retitling transfer from [B of I] to Acubens on October 26, 2016,\" in addition to the retitling transfer from the transferors to Acubens at issue. (Joint Stip. at 2.) Yopko had a remainder from the original award. Morris previously made three transfers and \"[t]here was a\n   retitling transfer on July 28, 2016,\" in addition to the proposed retitling transfer from the transferors to Acubens. (Joint Stip. at 3.) Morris had a remainder from the original award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 15, 2017, the magistrate filed decisions denying the requests to transfer the Berry, Morris, and Yopko future prize installment payments. On August 29, 2017, Acubens filed objections to the magistrate's August 15, 2017 decisions. On November 16, 2017, the trial court filed decisions overruling the objections to the magistrate's decisions and adopting the magistrate's decisions filed August 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Acubens appeals and assigns the following single assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Trial Court erred as a matter of law when it concluded that all transfers are subject to the restrictions contained in R.C. \u00a7 3770.121.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In its assignment of error, Acubens argues the trial court erred in applying R.C. 3770.121 to bar the transfers at issue. Specifically, Acubens contends the restrictions, pursuant to R.C. 3770.121, on the number of allowable transfers apply only to \"prize winners\" as that term is defined by R.C. 3770.10. The Lottery Commission responds that R.C. 3770.121, when considered in conjunction with Ohio Adm.Code 3770:1-8-01(B)(5), applies to bar the transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Applicable Law and Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} R.C. Chapter 3770 governs the state lottery, including the Lottery Commission. R.C. 3770.03(A) vests the Lottery Commission with authority to promulgate rules regarding subjects delegated to its authority, providing in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The state lottery commission shall promulgate rules under which a statewide lottery may be conducted, which includes, and since the original enactment of this section has included, the authority for the commission to operate video lottery terminal games. * * * The rules shall be promulgated pursuant to Chapter 119. of the Revised Code, except that instant game rules shall be promulgated pursuant to section 111.15 of the Revised Code but are not subject to division (D) of that section.

For purposes of illustration, a prize winner could enter into a transfer agreement with a transferee. That same transferee could then, as a transferor, enter into a transfer agreement with another transferee, including one without any relationship to the prize winner in the original transfer agreement. Such is the case here, as Acubens seeks to acquire the interest of the transferors who were transferees in earlier transfer agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Finally, Ohio Adm.Code 3770:1-8-01(B)(5) provides: \"Partial assignments and/or transfers of lottery prize awards are governed by section 3770.121 of the Revised Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Regarding the Berry, Morris, and Yopko future prize installment payments, the trial court found the proposed transfers were \"forbidden * * * pursuant to R.C. 3770.121.\" (Nov. 16, 2017 Decisions at 11.) The trial court acknowledged Acubens's argument stating that \"Acubens draws a distinction between prize winner and transferor and rightly so, the difference exists.\" (Nov. 16, 2017 Decisions at 8.) The court found, however, that \"[t]his definitional distinction relied upon by Acubens to justify the law not being applicable to them is nothing more than a red herring designed to confuse the issue in this case.\" (Nov. 16, 2017 Decisions at 8.) Instead, the court stated that \"[t]he real issue in this\n   matter is whether the applicable statutes intended for prize winners to be treated differently from transferors for purposes of whether a transfer is appropriate and for purposes of the 3 transfer restriction.\" (Nov. 16, 2017 Decisions at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In resolving this question, the court relied on Ohio Adm.Code 3770:1-8-01(B)(5) and R.C. 3770.121. The court found that, although R.C. 3770.121 was \"unambiguous,\" the Lottery Commission's interpretation of its regulations \"makes it clear that all transfers of lottery prizes are governed by R.C. 3770.121 and not just transfers by prize winners.\" (Nov. 16, 2017 Decisions at 8.) Further, the court stated \"[t]his court believes that the legislature did not anticipate treating the two differently for purposes of transfer.\" (Nov. 16, 2017 Decisions at 8.) The trial court supported its conclusion by stating that \"[a]n interpretation that holds that all transfers of lottery prizes are governed by R.C. 3770.121 is consistent with the spirit of the law and the restrictions placed on transfer which were designed to prevent an undue burden upon the [Lottery Commission] in dealing with transfers.\" (Nov. 16, 2017 Decisions at 9.) As a result, the court found the transfers were \"forbidden\" as \"fourth * * * transfer[s] pursuant to R.C. 3770.121(C).\" (Nov. 16, 2017 Decisions at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Finally, the court held regarding the transfers related to the Morris and Berry's awards, \"even if th[e] proposed transfer[s] would be allowable under R.C. 3770.121(C), the transfer in question would be improper pursuant to R.C. 3770.121(A) because [Morris and Berry's] account[s] lack[ ] the minimum amount of $500,000 required for transfer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Nov. 16, 2017 Decisions at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Here, as stipulated by the parties, the transferors before us are not prize winners but, rather, \" 'transferors' as defined in R.C. 377[0].10(H).\" (Joint Stip. at 1.) The General Assembly's decision to define \"prize winner\" and \"transferor\" separately in R.C. 3770.10 demonstrates its intent for there to be a distinction between the two terms in the statutory sections to which they apply. This distinction is evident, for example, in R.C. 3770.12, which provides conditions for the approval of a lottery prize award \"[i]f the transferor is a prize winner.\" R.C. 3770.12(A) and (B). This example illustrates that, while all prize winners can be transferors, not all transferors need be prize winners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 22} R.C. 3770.121, the statutory provision relied on by the Lottery Commission and trial court to deny the transfers at issue, states that \"[a]ny state lottery commission rules allowing lottery prize awards to be paid in installments also shall allow a\n   <em>\n    prize winner\n   </em>\n   who is being paid a prize award in that manner to transfer all or a portion of the remainder of the prize award, subject to each of the following conditions.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the plain language of R.C. 3770.121 only regulates transfers by prize winners, as that term is defined in R.C. 3770.10, not transfers by transferees, now transferors, in an earlier transfer.\n   <em>\n    Hoffman v.

If R.C. 3770.121 applies to all transferors as suggested by the Lottery Commission, a prize winner could be limited to only one transfer, despite otherwise complying with the provisions of R.C. 3770.121. For example, a prize winner could transfer a portion of his or her award to a transferee. That same transferee could then as a transferor complete two additional transfers of the award. Thus, even if the prize winner is not a party to any subsequent transfers and otherwise in compliance with R.C. 3770.121(A), the prize winner would be prevented by R.C. 3770.121(C) from making additional transfers of the remainder of his or her award. Such a result is incongruous with the intention of the General Assembly as expressed in the plain language of R.C. 3770.121 and would create confusion and uncertainty on the part of prize winners regarding their ability to make subsequent transfers.
