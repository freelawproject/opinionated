For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In June 2008, Sourial was employed as an insurance agent for AAA Insurance when he was approached by Nationwide with an opportunity to join one of its agency programs. Sourial met with Nationwide Sales Manager Brad Bohn who encouraged Sourial to participate in Nationwide's Agency Capital Builder (\"ACB\") program, where he would receive training necessary for him to successfully operate a Nationwide Insurance Agency. According to Sourial, Bohn told him that when he successfully completed the ACB program, Nationwide would sell him an established book of business which would generate approximately $350,000 per year in revenue. Sourial left his position with AAA to join Nationwide's ACB program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Sourial consistently met the ACB program production requirements as measured by Direct Written Premium (\"DWP\"). Sourial eventually became one of the top producing employees in the ACB program for the region and the first to graduate the program. On his graduation, Nationwide paid Sourial compensation in the amount of $75,000. Sourial intended to purchase a book of business and become a member of Nationwide's Replacement Agency Executive (\"RAE\") program. Sourial claims he repeatedly inquired of Bohn and his successor sales manager, Diana Graovac, about an available book of business to purchase. According to Sourial, Bohn falsely represented to him that no existing book of business was available for purchase and that Sourial would have to join the Account Executive (\"AE\") program, rather than the RAE program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Sourial claims various Nationwide vice presidents and sales managers induced him to join the AE program by making false representations regarding his potential for success. In Sourial's affidavit filed in connection with his Civ.R. 56(F) motion, Sourial claims Nationwide management falsely represented the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [M]isrepresentations about the amount of money I would earn, that my pro forma and business plan were legitimate and accurate representations of what Nationwide expected my agency to earn, that Agency Executive Program agents easily meet their production requirements and complete the Program, that I would easily meet my Agency Executive Program production requirements, that if I acquired an existing book of business Nationwide would transfer me into the Replacement Agency Executive Program, that I would own my book of business and the books of business I acquired, and that if I ever left Nationwide, it would offer to purchase my book of business and the books of business I acquired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Aug. 30, 2017 Sourial Aff. at \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Sourial executed the AE agreement in June 2010. Prior to signing the agreement, Sourial had spent several months reviewing the draft agreement as well as developing a pro forma business plan. The AE agreement required Sourial to meet a minimum production plan (\"MPP\"), as measured by DWP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AE agreement also contained the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   It is agreed that no action, suit, proceeding at law or in equity shall be brought under this contract unless it is commenced and process is served within\n   three years after the cause of action for which suit is brought.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (AE Agreement at \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In addition to the contractual limitations period, the AE agreement contained an integration clause as follows: \"The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement supersede all prior oral or written understandings between Agent and Nationwide and constitute the entire agreement between them concerning the subject matter of this Agreement.\" (AE Agreement at \u00b6 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On April 5, 2011, Sourial executed an amended AE agreement containing the following language: \"By signing this Amendment, [Sourial] * * * waives all claims that he/she has or may have against Nationwide * * * as of the date of his/her execution of this Amendment.\" (Amendment to AE Agreement at 1.) The stated consideration for the release was an enhanced bonus schedule as set forth in the amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On May 3, 2011, Sourial received a loan from Nationwide Bank, the proceeds of which Sourial used to purchase an existing book of business. According to Sourial, Graovac subsequently informed him the book of business he purchased was too small to allow him to transition into the RAE program, and the renewal DWP from the newly purchased book of business could not be counted towards his MPP for purposes of the AE program. Sourial claims he was falsely informed that there was not another existing book of business available for purchase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In May 2012, Nationwide put Sourial on the production shortfall list because he had not met his MPP. According to Sourial, in the subsequent months, Nationwide transferred some of his existing book of business to another agent, which caused Sourial to fall further behind his MPP. Realizing his contract was subject to cancellation, on December 3, 2012, Sourial resigned his position with Nationwide. There is no dispute Nationwide subsequently made an early cancellation payment to Sourial of more than $130,000. According to Sourial, however, Nationwide took over his existing book of business worth approximately $1,300,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On June 24, 2016, Sourial filed a complaint alleging the following claims for relief against Nationwide: fraudulent inducement in relation to the Career Builder Contract; fraudulent inducement in relation to the Executive Contract; intentional misrepresentation in relation to the Career Builder Contract and the Executive Contract; breach of the Career Builder Contract; breach of the Executive Contract; breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; promissory estoppel; unjust enrichment; national origin based discrimination; and national origin based harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On January 10, 2017, the trial court granted Nationwide's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the claims for discrimination based on national origin and harassment. In so doing, the trial court noted in its decision that \"in relation to all of [Sourial's] claims, except that for breach of the Executive Contract, Indiana substantive law shall apply. As to procedural law, Ohio law still applies to this matter.\" (Jan. 10, 2017 Decision at 3.) No appeal was taken from the trial court decision granting Nationwide's motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On June 19, 2017, Sourial filed a motion to compel discovery wherein Sourial sought, among other things, production of unredacted copies of the following documents: New Agent Program Scorecards; Production Shortfall Reports; Program Agent Management Reports; and Program Agent Production Status Reports. Sourial\n   claimed the information in these documents provided evidentiary support for his fraud claims. On July 19, 2017, Sourial filed a motion to vacate the case schedule or, in the alternative, enlarge the case schedule 60 days from the date the trial court ruled on Sourial's motion to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On July 28, 2017, Nationwide filed a motion for summary judgment as to Sourial's remaining claims. In support of the motion, Nationwide filed excerpts from the transcript of Sourial's deposition along with a large number of documents identified as exhibits therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 4, 2017, the trial court issued a decision denying Sourial's motion to compel and denying Sourial's motion to enlarge the case schedule. The trial court decision provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   There is not much to say in regards to [Sourial's] motion. In it, [Sourial] asks the Court to issue an order compelling [Nationwide] to supplement numerous discovery responses. After reviewing this matter thoroughly, the Court is not inclined to grant [Sourial's] request. First, it is clear that [Nationwide] has rectified many of the issues that [Sourial] had since the filing of this motion. Second, [Sourial] has stated inadequate grounds upon which the Court would base an order compelling discovery. Since this is so, the Court finds [Sourial's] Motion to Compel to be not well-taken, and is hereby DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Emphasis sic.) (Aug. 4, 2017 Decision at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On August 11, 2017, Sourial filed a combined motion to reconsider the trial court's August 4, 2017 decision denying Sourial's motion to compel and motion for an in camera inspection of the documents Nationwide had either refused to produce or redacted. On that same date, Sourial filed a Civ.R. 56(F) motion for a continuance to permit further discovery essential to Sourial's opposition to Nationwide's motion for summary judgment. Sourial did not, however, file a response to the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On September 6, 2017, the trial court denied Sourial's Civ.R. 56(F) motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Once again [Sourial] asks the Court for more time due to a discovery dispute. In this motion, however, [Sourial] asks for more time due to a discovery dispute that [Sourial] previously lost. The Court is not going to grant [Sourial] any additional time to file a response to [Nationwide's] Motion for Summary Judgment. Due to the fact that [Sourial] has not filed a response to [Nationwide's] Motion for Summary Judgment within the time limit prescribed by rule, the Court will rule upon said motion sans response.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Sept. 6, 2017 Decision at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On September 14, 2017, the trial court issued a decision and judgment entry granting Nationwide's motion for summary judgment as to Sourial's remaining claims. The trial court determined Sourial's claims for breach of contract were barred both by the contractual limitations period and the release. The trial court also determined the existence of a written agreement containing an integration clause and the release barred Sourial's quasi-contract claims for promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment. Finally, the trial court found the release barred Sourial's fraud claims. Accordingly, the trial court determined Nationwide was entitled to a judgment on these claims as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Sourial timely appealed to this court from the following trial court judgments: August 4, 2017 decision and entry denying Sourial's motion to compel and motion to vacate or enlarge the case schedule; September 6, 2017 decision and entry denying Sourial's motion for reconsideration, request for in camera inspection, and Civ.R. 56(F) motion; and the judgment entry issued September 14, 2017 granting Nationwide's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Sourial sets forth the following eleven assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [1.] The trial court erred and abused its discretion by denying Sourial's motion to compel in its entirety and effectively condoning Nationwide's impermissible redaction campaign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [2.] The trial court abused its discretion by failing to compel Nationwide to un-redact and produce vital statistical data reflecting the failure rate of its AE Program agents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [3.] The trial court erred by failing to compel Nationwide to Answer Interrogatory 1, which seeks the identity of person(s) responding to Interrogatories.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [4.] The trial court abused its discretion by failing to compel Nationwide to respond to Interrogatories seeking information pertaining to other program agents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [5.] The trial court abused its discretion by failing to compel Nationwide to provide information pertaining to similar action brought against it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [6.] The trial court abused its discretion in failing to compel Nationwide to respond to Interrogatories seeking information pertaining to its decision not to offer Sourial a position in the RAE Program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [7.] The trial court abused its discretion by failing to compel Nationwide to produce compensation and performance-related documents for Sourial's Sales Managers and VPs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [8.] The trial court abused its discretion by failing to compel Nationwide to produce discovery pertaining to books of business that became available in Sourial's district between January 2010 and December 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [9.] The trial court erred by failing to compel Nationwide to Answer Interrogatories 26, 27, 28, and 29.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [10.] The trial court abused its discretion in denying Sourial's motion to vacate or enlarge the case schedule pending its ruling on Sourial's previously filed motion to compel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [11.] The trial court abused its discretion in denying Sourial's Rule 56(F) motion and entering summary judgment in favor of Nationwide without given [sic] Sourial a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery and obtain the evidence he needs to adequately oppose Nationwide's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

As noted above, the trial court determined Sourial's claims for breach of contract were barred both by the contractual limitations period and the release. The trial court also determined the existence of a written agreement containing an integration clause and the release barred Sourial's quasi-contract claims for promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment. Finally, the trial court found the release barred Sourial's fraud claims. In granting summary judgment for Nationwide, the trial court determined various contractual defenses asserted by Nationwide barred all Sourial's claims for relief as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The parties disagree on whether Sourial's eleventh assignment of error challenges the granting of summary judgment or merely whether the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment for Nationwide without providing Sourial with a full and fair opportunity to conduct discovery.

Under the circumstance, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to allow Sourial to conduct additional discovery to establish his fraud claims that had not yet accrued when he executed the release and where it is clear that such evidence would not have provided a defense to the release.

In this case, Sourial failed to properly support his Civ.R. 56(F) motion.

If the party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the party.\" Sourial did not respond to the motion as required by Civ.R. 56(E). For the reasons stated above, we have determined Nationwide's properly supported motion for summary judgment demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact for trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sourial's Civ.R. 56(F) motion. Sourial's eleventh assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Sourial's Assignments of Error One Through Nine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 60} In assignments of error one through nine, Sourial challenges various aspects of the trial court's rulings on his motion to compel discovery, Sourial's motion for reconsideration of that decision, and Sourial's motion for an in camera inspection of documents. Having determined the trial court did not err by granting summary judgment for Sourial because Sourial's claims against Nationwide were barred as a matter of law, either by the contractual limitations period, the integration clause and/or the release, we find Sourial's assignments of error one through nine do not allege reversible error because the discovery Sourial sought to compel would not have produced evidence negating the contractual defenses asserted by Nationwide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 61} By way of explanation, in Sourial's first, second, fourth, and seventh assignments of error, Sourial contends the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to compel Nationwide to produce unredacted records documenting the performance of other agents in the AE program and any incentives provided to Nationwide managers and vice presidents for recruiting new agents into the program. Sourial asserts these records provide necessary support for his fraud claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even\n   if it were assumed the Nationwide records sought by Sourial contained the evidence Sourial claims, the release encompassed all claims based on facts that existed before he signed the release.

Consequently, our ruling on Sourial's eleventh assignment of error renders moot Sourial's first, second, fourth, and seventh\n   assignments of error pertaining to discovery issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Similarly, in Sourial's sixth and eighth assignments of error, Sourial alleges the trial court abused its discretion in failing to compel Nationwide to respond to interrogatories seeking information about the RAE program and existing books of business available for purchase during Sourial's tenure as an agent in the AE program. Again, even if we were to conclude the Nationwide records sought by Sourial possibly contain evidence to support Sourial's fraud claims, such evidence is not probative of Sourial's allegation that the subsequent release does not encompass those claims. Accordingly, our ruling on Sourial's eleventh assignment of error renders moot Sourial's sixth and eighth assignments of error pertaining to discovery issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 64} In Sourial's ninth assignment of error, he contends the trial court erred by failing to compel Nationwide to answer Interrogatories 26, 27, 28, and 29. According to Sourial, Nationwide objected to these interrogatories because he had exceeded the total number of interrogatories permitted by Civ.R. 33. Though Sourial argues that Nationwide's objection is erroneous and that the trial court abused its discretion by denying Sourial's motion to compel, Sourial's brief to this court does not does explain how he was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to compel a response by Nationwide. Accordingly, our ruling on Sourial's eleventh assignment of error renders moot Sourial's ninth assignment of error relating to his motion to compel certain interrogatory responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 65} In Sourial's third assignment of error, he alleges the trial court erred by failing to compel Nationwide to reveal the identity of the person(s) who responded to his interrogatories, and in Sourial's fifth assignment of error, he alleges the trial court erred by failing to compel Nationwide to provide information pertaining to similar actions brought against it. Sourial has not explained how this discovery would produce evidence in support of his contention that the release does not encompass his fraud claims. Accordingly, we find that our ruling on Sourial's eleventh assignment of error renders moot Sourial's third and fifth assignments of error pertaining to discovery issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sourial's Tenth Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   {\u00b6 66} In Sourial's tenth assignment of error, he argues the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to vacate or enlarge the case schedule pending a ruling on his motion to compel. As we noted in ruling on Sourial's eleventh assignment of error, Sourial waived all of his claims when he executed the release. As a result, the additional time Sourial requested in order to obtain discovery would not have yielded evidence to support a triable issue of fact. Our ruling on Sourial's eleventh assignment of error, therefore, renders moot the alleged trial court error raised in Sourial's tenth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
