Ryan appeals the judgment entered by the Delaware County Common Pleas Court convicting him of forty-four counts of pandering obscenity involving a minor ( R.C. 2907.321(A)(1) ) and thirty-six counts of pandering sexually oriented material involving a minor ( R.C. 2907.322(A)(1) ), and sentencing him to an aggregate term of incarceration of four years. Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On April 26, 2016, an email with attachments was sent from an email address associated with Appellant to the same email address. America Online (AOL) flagged the email because the attachments potentially contained child pornography. AOL forwarded the email to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Upon reviewing the email and attachments, NCMEC forwarded the email to Sergeant Jeff Zech, commander of the Franklin County Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) taskforce. Sgt. Zech opened the file to verify it met the definition of child pornography. Upon so determining, he forwarded the information to Delaware County, where Appellant resided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Det. Jason Campbell of the Delaware County Sheriff's Department searched online databases and determined Appellant lived alone. He performed physical surveillance of Appellant's residence for several days, for six to eight hours at a time. He noted no persons leaving or entering the residence, and determined Appellant was the only person residing there. He checked from his phone or i-pad for unsecured wifi networks accessible from Appellant's residence, and found none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Upon determining Appellant was the sole resident at the address and his wifi network was secured, Det. Campbell drafted a search warrant. Police seized numerous items from Appellant's residence pursuant to the warrant. On a computer and an external hard drive in his home office, they found numerous videos and images of child pornography. Several of the images were located in a user-created file labeled \"Doves\" which was present on the desktop of the Mac computer recovered from Appellant's home office. Additional files containing child pornography were located in the \"pictures\" file on the computer. Analysis of the computer further revealed Google searches physically typed into the computer on numerous dates, including \"underage teen porn,\" \"kiddy teen anal,\" \"forced innocent teen sex,\" \"young teen raped,\" and \"preschool girls in thongs.\" Tr. 333-338. A drawer in the desk where the computer was located contained a butt plug, a twisted dildo, \"boy butter,\" and panties. Pieces of Appellant's mail were also found on the desk, and the photos on the computer included one of Appellant seated at the desk using the computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellant's cell phone was seized from his person. The phone was linked to the email address associated with the file flagged by AOL. Further, a search of the device revealed on the date police executed the search warrant on Appellant's residence, he was searching online for the definition of pandering and for information on how to delete past searches and other internet activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On February 1, 2017, the Delaware County Grand Jury returned an 82-count indictment charging Appellant with pandering obscenity involving a minor and pandering sexually oriented material involving a minor. Prior to trial, Appellant's motion to suppress was overruled, and the State's motion in limine to exclude the testimony of Appellant's expert was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The case proceeded to jury trial. At the beginning of the second day of trial, the parties stipulated the photographs and videos in counts one through eighty satisfied the content requirement of the statute in question and would constitute a violation of said statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellant testified at trial he was rarely home. He testified he had an alarm\n   system but rarely armed it, and many people have the password to disarm it. He further testified he has a spare key hidden outside, and many people know where the key is. He allowed people to access the house when he was not home to do work on the house, to watch his dogs, and to feed his fish. He testified a registered sex offender who lived in his neighborhood had access to the house when Appellant was not home, and he believed this person was responsible for the items found on the computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The state dismissed counts 81 and 82, and the remaining 80 counts were submitted to the jury. Appellant was convicted of all counts and sentenced to four years incarceration on each count, to be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} It is from the December 29, 2017 judgment of conviction and sentence Appellant prosecutes his appeal, assigning as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE AS THE TRIAL COURT ERRONEOUSLY FOUND THAT THERE IS NO EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY WHEN USING A PRIVATE COMPANY FOR EMAIL COMMUNICATION AND THAT A PRIVATE COMPANY IS ALLOWED TO FORWARD EMAIL CONTENT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT A WARRANT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"II.

He argues AOL, as a mandatory reporter of child pornography pursuant to federal law, is a state actor and could not review his emails without a search warrant. He further argues even if AOL is a private actor, the subsequent review of the email attachments by NCMEC and police exceeded the scope of the AOL search, as they reviewed more photographs than AOL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} There are three methods of challenging on appeal a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress. First, an appellant may challenge the trial court's findings of fact. In reviewing a challenge of this nature, an appellate court must determine whether said findings of fact are\n   against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Fanning\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1809976\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/1/19/\">\n    1 Ohio St.3d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20N.E.2d%20583\">\n    437 N.E.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Klein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473054\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/73/486/\">\n    73 Ohio App.3d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20N.E.2d%201141\">\n    597 N.E.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Guysinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1692028\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/86/592/\">\n    86 Ohio App.3d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=621%20N.E.2d%20726\">\n    621 N.E.2d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Second, an appellant may argue the trial court failed to apply the appropriate test or correct law to the findings of fact. In that case, an appellate court can reverse the trial court for committing an error of law.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1692088\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/86/37/\">\n    86 Ohio App.3d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=619%20N.E.2d%201141\">\n    619 N.E.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Finally, assuming the trial court's findings of fact are not against the manifest weight of the evidence and it has properly identified the law to be applied, an appellant may argue the trial court has incorrectly decided the ultimate or final issue raised in the motion to suppress. When reviewing this type of claim, an appellate court must independently determine, without deference to the trial court's conclusion, whether the facts meet the appropriate legal standard in any given case.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellee filed a motion in limine to exclude his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The court held a hearing at which the expert witness testified. Mr. Singleton testified he formed his opinion solely from the summaries provided by Appellee in discovery, as examining the source material itself would have been too time consuming. The court granted the motion in limine, finding the witness failed to perform his own testing in the case and did not avail himself of the opportunity to examine the underlying data. Further, the witness admitted he had not used law enforcement software for eighteen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Appellant did not attempt to call the witness at trial, nor did he proffer his testimony.

Further, his report is vague, pointing only generally to potential problems in the investigation, rather than to specific problems with the analysis of the data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Further, Appellant was able to cross-examine the State's witnesses concerning these potential shortcomings in the investigation as set forth in Singleton's report. Mark Ludlow, the operations analyst from AOL who flagged the original email image, testified on cross-examination he could not affirmatively identify Appellant as the person who was logged into his account when the email was sent, and could not confirm the email originated from Appellant's home address. Tyler Zvolanek, from WOW Internet Cable and Phone, testified on cross-examination he could not testify to whether there was a secure router in Appellant's home. Sgt.

R. 12.1. However, he does not explain who his alibi witness would be, and the record does not demonstrate he had an alibi witness which counsel failed to identify. While Appellant testified he was rarely home, he did not pinpoint where he was on the dates and times the files in question were created. Further, the files were created at all times of the day and night, and on fifteen different days, over a period of years making an alibi defense difficult to present. We find counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a notice of alibi concerning an unidentified alibi witness or witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Appellant also argues counsel was ineffective for failing to compel discovery to allow Mr. Singleton, the expert witness discussed in assignment of error two, to personally examine the evidence rather than the summaries provided in discovery. He argues counsel should have taken steps to ensure Mr. Singleton had access to the actual evidence, and then requested a second voir dire of the witness. He further argues Mr. Singleton prepared a second report stating Appellant's email was used 23 hours a day, suggesting someone else had access to the account, which counsel made no attempt to use at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The record of the motion in limine hearing demonstrates the actual data was available for Mr. Singleton to review through the prosecutor's office. However, he testified he did not have time to examine the data himself. 8/22/17 Tr. 49, 54. Singleton stated he would love to do a full investigation but there was no time. Therefore, the record does not demonstrate a motion to compel and a second hearing would have resulted in the court allowing the witness to testify, as the witness had access to the information, but chose not to do a full investigation due to time restraints. Further, Appellant testified at trial other people had access to his email account, rendering the expert's opinion someone else may have had access to the account cumulative; therefore of limited value. As discussed in the second assignment of error, Appellant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability of a change in the outcome had the witness been permitted to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Appellant next argues counsel was ineffective for failing to request a bill of particulars because of the broad range of dates set forth in the indictment, which impaired his ability to present an alibi defense. The indictment in the instant case sets forth a date range for each file starting with the date it was created and ending on the date the computer or hard drive was seized. Further, each count specifies which file located on the computer or hard drive is associated with that count. The State filed a discovery certification on February 16, 2017. Counsel for Appellant referred to the dates \"stated in discovery\" during a discussion of amending certain charges, suggesting he received information regarding the dates associated with each count in discovery. Tr. 12. Nothing in the trial transcript suggests counsel for Appellant was surprised by the evidence the State presented concerning file creation dates and times. Appellant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability of a change in the outcome had counsel requested a bill of particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Appellant next argues counsel was ineffective for failing to subpoena a registered sex offender who lived in Appellant's neighborhood and had access\n   to Appellant's house. The record does not demonstrate what this witness would testify to if called. Appellant offered testimony the registered sex offender lived near his residence and had full access to the home, thus creating a suggestion he was the person who downloaded the pornographic material on Appellant's devices without actually calling the witness, who likely would have denied doing so on the witness stand. We find no ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to subpoena this witness under the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Finally, Appellant argues the cumulative effect of counsel's errors resulted in prejudice. In that we have found no basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel upon review of each of Appellant's assertions, there can be no cumulative effect.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The only dispute was whether Appellant knowingly created the files containing the prohibited material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 52} As to Count 80, Appellant argues there was no testimony supporting this count. While Sgt. Zech testified in detail to the material charged in most counts of the indictment, he did not testify specifically as to Count 80. However, Count 80 of the indictment charges Appellant with pandering obscenity relating to a file titled Concubina_105.jpeg. This file is located in State's Exhibit 1, a flash drive admitted into evidence at trial, containing the email which triggered the instant investigation. Mark Ludlow, the operations analyst at AOL who flagged the email and authenticated the exhibit, testified he reviewed each of the attachments to this email before he forwarded the email and attachments to NCMEC. He testified each of the attached images, which would include the file charged in Count 80, contained images of child sexual exploitation. Agent Amanda Saxton of ICAC testified she reviewed the images contained in the email to confirm it contained child pornography prior to commencing the criminal investigation. Further, the parties stipulated the material in Count 80 violated R.C. 2907.321(A)(1). We find there was sufficient evidence presented by the State to support the conviction on Count 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 53} As to the remaining counts, Appellant argues he did not download the files with knowledge of the character of the material or performance involved. He argues the State did not present sufficient evidence he was the person who downloaded the material. Although Appellant couches his argument in terms of the mens rea of \"knowingly,\" he is actually arguing failure to prove identity; i.e., the State failed to prove he was the person who downloaded and possessed the material found on his computer and hard drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 54} The State presented evidence all of the material was found downloaded on the computer in Appellant's home, or on the external hard drive in his home. Nine of the images had been emailed from Appellant's email address to his email address. Det. Jason Campbell of the Delaware Sheriff's Department conducted surveillance on the home for several days, and did not see anyone entering or leaving the residence. He further checked for an unsecure wifi connection, and did not find one. He testified in a drawer of the desk where the computer was located in Appellant's home, police found \"boy butter,\" a butt plug, a twisted dildo, and girls' panties, and a photo of the contents of the drawer was admitted into evidence. Further, he testified all of the mail found on the desk was addressed to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Sgt. Jeff Zech testified the circumstantial evidence in the case points to Appellant as the perpetrator. The \"Doves\" file attached to the email flagged by AOL was also located on the desktop of the computer, where it could be seen upon starting the computer, and the images were backed up to the external hard drive. The material was downloaded over a period of years, not in a single incident. Files existed on the computer for six months to a year before the computer was seized. One of the photographs found in the computer was a picture of Appellant sitting at the desk, using the computer. A search of Appellant's phone seized from his person demonstrated at the time police were executing the search warrant on his residence, Appellant was searching the definition of \"pandering\" online, and later the same day he searched for information on how to\n   delete past searches and other internet activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 56} We find the evidence presented by the State was sufficient, if believed by the jury, to find Appellant was the perpetrator of the crimes charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Appellant further argues the judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence because there is reasonable doubt as to who accessed Appellant's computer, there is a possibility the router was used by remote, and there is a likelihood the registered sex offender living in the neighborhood entered the home and committed the crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 58} We find the jury did not lose its way in finding Appellant guilty on all counts. As discussed above, the State presented circumstantial evidence Appellant was the person who downloaded the files found on his computer and sent the email from and to his email address with the images attached. Appellant testified he did not put the material on his computer or send the email with the attached \"Doves\" file, and he believed the sex offender living in the neighborhood was responsible. He testified he was rarely home, and many people had access to his home and computer, including the sex offender living in the neighborhood. The jury rejected Appellant's theories as to how the evidence might have ended up on his computer without his knowledge or participation. We find the jury did not lose its way, in light of all the evidence presented by the State, in finding his testimony to not be credible, and the judgment is not therefore against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The fourth and fifth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 60} In his sixth assignment of error, Appellant argues the court erred in failing to consider his argument the offenses committed on the same day are allied offenses, and thus he could be convicted of only fifteen counts, not eighty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 61} The Ohio Supreme Court clarified the test courts should employ when deciding whether two or more offenses are allied offenses that merge into a single conviction under R.C. 2941.25 in\n   <em>\n    State v.

With respect to the first factor, the court explained two or more offenses are dissimilar within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25(B)\"when the defendant's conduct constitutes offenses involving separate victims or if the harm that results from each offense is separate and identifiable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 62} At the sentencing hearing, counsel for Appellant appeared to argue he could only be convicted of one crime, because it was possible the pictures and videos were all downloaded on a single date:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   But, Your Honor, I think the merger issue is the most significant here. That when you have an indictment with such a broad range of dates. We don't know, I don't think, we don't know how many of these dates overlapped. I mean, I'm looking at some notes I took regarding the indictment. Some of them are a year\n   and a half, I know that's not uncommon in these kinds of cases, but do we know that 15 dates of creation mean that 15 different days these files were downloaded on to Dr. Ryan's computer? Again, looking at it in the abstract, just looking at it from the legal filing, it doesn't appear obvious to me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Now, if the Court has notes and says well no, this witness says he testified beyond a reasonable doubt this image came on this day and this image case on that day, then perhaps the merger argument would be defeated, and the holding of State versus Roth (phonetic) wouldn't apply. But in the absence of some sort of testimony like that, it's certainly possible, and considering - I bring up the rule of lenity, if we can't say otherwise that these were all created on all these different days, then I would ask the Court to consider this as one crime. I know these two statutes, I know you have a Pandering Sexually Oriented Material and Pandering Obscenity, so you can certainly say those are different crimes. But are one of them a lessor [sic] included offense or the other? Perhaps not. But I think the dates of offenses is crucial to this sentencing hearing. And unless there's something in the record that I - obviously I've not seen the trial transcript as of yet - saying these are all on different dates, I would say it's certainly possible that whoever downloaded these - I know the jury said it was Dr. Ryan - but that these crimes occurred on a single date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Sent.
