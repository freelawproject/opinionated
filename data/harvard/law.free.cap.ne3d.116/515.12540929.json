App. 2018),\n   <em>\n    trans. granted\n   </em>\n   , we held that the trial court erred in ruling that Alberto Baiza Rodriguez had waived his right to seek modification of his fixed sentence imposed pursuant to a plea agreement in 2016 for crimes committed in 2015. We based our holding on a 2014 statutory amendment which unambiguously provides that \"[a] person may not waive the right to sentence modification under this section as part of a plea agreement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-38-1-17\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-1-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l) (2014). Our supreme court granted transfer. The court did not hold that our interpretation of the statute was erroneous and affirm the trial court's ruling; instead, the court remanded with instructions to reconsider our holding in light of the legislature's 2018 amendments to Indiana Code Sections 35-38-1-17 and 35-35-1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   [2] We invited the parties to submit supplemental materials, which they did. Rodriguez argues that the 2018 amendments are not intended to apply retroactively, and, even if they were, such an application would unconstitutionally impair his contractual rights under his plea agreement with the State. We agree with Rodriguez. Therefore, we reaffirm our original holding, reverse the trial court's denial of Rodriguez's motion to modify his sentence, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [3] Based on a March 2015 incident, the State charged Rodriguez with several offenses and with being a habitual vehicle substance offender. In January 2016, Rodriguez and the State entered into a written plea agreement in which Rodriguez agreed to plead guilty to all but one of the charges and serve seventy-two months in the Department of Correction on work release, and the State agreed to dismiss the remaining charge and not file additional charges. The trial court accepted the agreement and sentenced Rodriguez accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [4] In January 2017, Rodriguez filed a motion to modify his sentence on the basis of family hardship and asserted that the then-current version of Indiana Code Section 35-38-1-17(e) permitted the trial court to modify his remaining sentence to home detention:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   At any time after:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) a convicted person begins serving the person's sentence; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) the court obtains a report from the department of correction concerning the convicted person's conduct while imprisoned;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   the court may reduce or suspend the sentence and impose a sentence that the court was authorized to impose at the time of sentencing. The court must incorporate its reasons in the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rodriguez asked the trial court to order a report from the work release program and set the matter for hearing, which it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [5] At the hearing, the trial court acknowledged that the work release report was \"very outstanding[,]\" Tr. Vol. 2 at 7, but ultimately it issued an order concluding that it did \"not have the authority to modify the sentence because the court accepted the parties' plea agreement which requires the defendant to serve the sentence in Work Release.\" The court referenced Indiana Code Section 35-35-3-3(e), which states, \"If the court accepts a plea agreement, it shall be bound by its terms.\" The court also quoted the then-current version of Indiana Code Section 35-38-1-17(l) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A person may not waive the right to sentence modification under this section as part of a plea agreement. Any purported waiver of the right to sentence modification under this section in a plea agreement is invalid and unenforceable as against public policy.\n   <em>\n    This subsection does not prohibit the finding of a waiver of the right to sentence modification for any other reason\n   </em>\n   , including failure to comply with the provisions of this section[, which limit the number of times a person may file a petition for sentence modification without the consent of the prosecuting attorney].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Emphasis added.) This provision had been added to the statute in 2014. The court concluded that the italicized phrase \"applies to the specific terms of a plea agreement that the court has accepted[,]\" and thus \"entering into a binding plea agreement waives the right to seek or receive a modification of sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [6] Rodriguez appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in ruling that he had waived his right to seek modification of his sentence. We addressed his argument as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   It is hornbook law that a plea agreement is contractual in nature, binding both the defendant and the State.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    St. Clair v.

Code \u00a7 35-38-1-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), - (j). The legislature also added what is now Section 35-38-1-17(l), which, as mentioned above, provides that \"[a] person may not waive the right to sentence modification under this section as part of a plea agreement\" and that \"[a]ny purported waiver of the right to sentence modification under this section in a plea agreement is invalid and unenforceable as against public policy.\" Section 35-38-1-17(l) also provides that it \"does not prohibit the finding of a waiver of the right to sentence modification for any other reason, including failure to comply with the provisions\" of the statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   In this case, Rodriguez's plea agreement contained a specific reservation of authority for the trial court to modify his sentence, but only in the event that he was incarcerated, which he was not.... The trial court essentially concluded that by entering into a plea agreement with a fixed sentence to be served on work release, Rodriguez waived the right to modification of that sentence. But that is precisely what Section 35-38-1-17(l) prohibits in no uncertain terms as a violation of public policy; it does not distinguish between implicit or explicit waivers, and we may not read such a distinction into the statute.

If that fixed sentence can be modified at any time, or if the negotiated limits on sentencing discretion can be ignored at any time, then the agreement is purely illusory, and the State is not receiving the benefit for which it bargained. The State will be unwilling to enter into plea agreements if they will not be enforced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellee's Br. at 12. We acknowledge the State's concern, but as another panel of this Court stated in response to a similar argument in a recent case,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   the statute says what it says, and we are bound to interpret and apply statutes in a way that fulfills the legislature's intent.

We think that the legislature said so directly in Section 35-38-1-17(l). The State also mentions Section 35-38-1-17(e), which states that a court \"may reduce or suspend [a] sentence and impose a sentence that the court was authorized to impose at the time of sentencing\"; the State contends that \"in a case involving a fixed-sentence plea, the only sentence that the court 'was authorized to impose at the time of sentencing' is the precise sentence provided for in the plea agreement.\" Appellee's Br. at 11. As the\n   <em>\n    Stafford\n   </em>\n   court said, \"[w]e cannot agree with the State's tortured interpretation of the plain statutory language.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325366\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/86/190/#p193\">\n    86 N.E.3d at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [A]s to what sentence the trial court is \"authorized\" to impose at the time of sentencing, that authorization is bound not only by the language of the plea agreement but also by the law.

Therefore, following the enactment of these statutory amendments, the legislature has declared that trial courts are\n   <em>\n    not authorized\n   </em>\n   to impose a sentence that purports to waive the defendant's right to a later modification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325366\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/86/190/#p193\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we believe that Sections 35-35-3-3(e), 35-38-1-17(e), and 35-38-1-17(l) may be harmonized to preserve a defendant's right to modification of a fixed sentence imposed under a plea agreement.... If the legislature disagrees with our interpretation of Section 35-38-1-17(l), then it may clarify the statute accordingly.

Although this Court previously stated that Rodriguez was not incarcerated as a result of his plea, a 72-month term of incarceration at the IDOC is contemplated in the plea, and as the Court noted, the plea discusses a modification. Thus, the modification statute was invoked in Rodriguez's agreement, and by \"knowingly\" entering his plea, Rodriguez executed his plea agreement with the understanding that the plain language of I.C. \u00a7 35-38-1-17 gave him a right to petition the court for a sentence modification.
