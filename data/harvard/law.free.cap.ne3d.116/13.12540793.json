Before the case was tried initially to the clerk-magistrate, it could have requested that the case be transferred out of the small claims session and onto the regular civil docket. G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 24. Rule 4(a) of the Uniform Small Claims Rules (2009). See Perlin &amp; Connors,\n     <em>\n      supra\n     </em>\n     at \u00a7 15.36. We have consistently held that a defendant who fails to take that step has no right later to obtain review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to replace the appellate rights it voluntarily relinquished by going forward under the small claims procedure; put another way, the transfer option is, for G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, purposes, an adequate alternative remedy.

Peck Excavating, Inc. (DRPE), appeals from a judgment of a single justice of this court denying its petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. We affirm.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      <em>\n       Background\n      </em>\n      . The dispute between DRPE and the respondent, Jose Machado, involves certain work that Machado performed on a construction site in Middleborough. DRPE was a subcontractor on the project. The parties agree that Machado performed the work, but they disagree as to whether DRPE had actually ever hired Machado to do it and, consequently, whether Machado was entitled to be paid for it. When both DRPE and the general contractor refused to pay him, Machado commenced a small claims action against DRPE in the District Court. The case proceeded from beginning to end under\n     the small claims procedure. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 21 - 25. See also Uniform Small Claims Rules (2009).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      At the initial trial before a clerk-magistrate, the clerk-magistrate found in favor of Machado. DRPE then claimed a right to a trial by jury, as it was entitled to do. The jury found in favor of Machado for the maximum amount permitted in small claims actions, $ 7,000, which, with costs and prejudgment interest added, resulted in a judgment for Machado in excess of $ 8,000. DRPE thereafter filed a motion for remittitur and, as it was entitled to do, a request for the judge to report the case to the Appellate Division of the District Court, both of which the judge denied. DRPE then filed a notice of appeal, purporting to appeal to the Appellate Division from various rulings that were made at trial, from the denial of the posttrial motion for remittitur, and from the denial of the request for a report of the case to the Appellate Division. DRPE represents to us (albeit without any support in the record) that a second District Court judge informed DRPE's counsel that it had no right to appeal at that point.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      DRPE next filed its G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition in the county court, in which it argued, among other things, that the first District Court judge erred in denying its request for a report to the Appellate Division, and that the second judge erroneously denied its right to appeal to the Appellate Division. DRPE alleged in its petition that it had no remedy other than to seek relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The single justice summarily denied the petition.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      <em>\n       Analysis\n      </em>\n      . In its appeal to this court, DRPE fails to address the very limited issue that is properly before us, namely whether the single justice erred -- more specifically, whether the single justice was required to employ this court's extraordinary power of general superintendence with the case in this posture. DRPE's brief makes no mention of the single justice's ruling, except for one sentence in its statement of the procedural history of the case in which it acknowledges that the single justice denied the petition. The brief focuses entirely on what DRPE alleges were an assortment of errors by the District Court judges in the proceedings below. Nowhere does DRPE assert in its brief, let alone offer\n     adequate appellate argument, see Mass. R. A. P. 16(a)(4), as amended,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20Mass.%20921\">\n       367 Mass. 921\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (1975), that it had no means to remedy those errors other than through a petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      The omission is significant because, as we shall explain, DRPE had an adequate, well-established alternative remedy, and the single justice therefore correctly determined that general superintendence relief from this court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, was unwarranted in these circumstances. See\n      <em>\n       McMenimen\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Passatempo\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5684120\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/452/178/#p185\">\n       452 Mass. 178\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 185,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=892%20N.E.2d%20287\">\n       892 N.E.2d 287\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2008) (\"It is principally for this reason -- the availability of adequate alternative remedies -- that single justices of this court routinely deny petitions under G.

So, for example, after a small claims case is tried in the District Court before a judge or a jury, the losing litigant has no right to appeal to the Appellate Division. A party may ask the judge to exercise his or her discretion to report the matter to the Appellate Division if the judge believes that questions of law within the case require appellate review, but \"[n]o party ... shall be entitled to a report.\" G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 23. See generally M.G. Perlin &amp; J.M. Connors, Civil Procedure in the Massachusetts District Court \u00a7\u00a7 15.87, 15.88 (5th ed. 2018) (Perlin &amp; Connors).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      Further, to the extent DRPE is claiming that it was entitled to appeal to the Appellate Division from the District Court judge's denial of its request to report the matter to the Appellate Division, it was nevertheless not entitled to relief under\n     G.

It could have resolved that claim through appropriate steps in the District Court and, if necessary, by filing a second notice of appeal (on the limited question whether it had a right to appeal) if the judge or the District Court clerk's office failed to accept or process its first notice of appeal.
