Whether the trial court erred in striking Harkins' response materials as untimely filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   II. Whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Westmeyer, Niklas, Angie, and Janet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [3] The parties involved in this case are relatives, with the exception of Niklas. Harkins and Westmeyer are siblings. Angie is Harkins' and Westmeyer's cousin. Angie's mother, Janet, is Harkins' and Westmeyer's aunt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [4] In April 2012, Harkins moved in with his and Westmeyer's parents, James and Cheryl Harkins (the \"Parents\"). While living in the Parents' home, Harkins obtained access to the Parents' personal financial records. Harkins subsequently moved out of the Parents' home and into an apartment (\"the Apartment\") located in Aurora, Indiana. Niklas was Harkins' landlord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Harkins' ex-wife, Dawn Harkins (\"Dawn\"), had a key to the Apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [5] Using the Parents' financial information, Harkins (1) forged checks on the Parents' accounts; (2) cashed the checks and deposited the proceeds into bank accounts in Harkins' name; (3) fraudulently added himself as an authorized user on the Parents' existing credit accounts; (4) rerouted the Parents' credit card statements to the Apartment; and (5) made unauthorized credit card purchases in excess of $37,000 on the Parents' credit cards. Harkins also stole and pawned multiple pieces of the Parents' jewelry. Harkins sold many of the items he purchased with the Parents' credit cards \"for gambling funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Harkins v.

Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [6] Harkins was arrested on June 3, 2014. After Harkins' arrest, Harkins authorized Dawn to enter the Apartment and to retrieve personal items belonging to Harkins' and Dawn's son. On June 4, 2014, Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet accompanied Dawn to the Apartment. It is undisputed that Dawn unlocked the Apartment with her key and granted Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet access to the Apartment. Harkins contends that Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet removed and disposed of valuable items of Harkins' personal property. Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet maintain that they removed only personal property items and furniture that belonged to the Parents or to other family members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [7] On August 6, 2014, the State charged Harkins with various offenses and with being a habitual offender. After a jury trial, Harkins was convicted of five counts of forgery, Class C felonies; two counts of identity deception, Class D felonies; two counts of credit card fraud, Class D felonies; one count of deception, a Class A misdemeanor; and of being a habitual offender. Harkins was sentenced to a twenty-two-year term in the Department of Correction and is presently incarcerated in the Miami Correctional Facility in Bunker Hill, Indiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [8] On October 9, 2015, Harkins filed a pro se suit for damages against Westmeyer, Angie, Janet, and Niklas. In Count I, which Harkins titled \"[w]rongful/[f]raudulent conversion,\" Harkins alleged that Westmeyer: (1) enlisted Niklas' assistance to gain entry to the Apartment; (2) recruited Janet and Angie; (3) removed and transported Harkins' personal property to a local Goodwill donation site; and (4) maliciously and intentionally deprived Harkins of his property without communicating the disposition of the items. Appellee Westmeyer's App. Vol. II pp. 22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [9] In Count II, Harkins alleged that Westmeyer drove his truck or directed his truck to be driven to a location at which the keys and keyless entry remote were locked inside. Harkins sought damages for the costs of replacing and repairing \"a window [that] was ... broken to gain access into the truck.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [10] In Count III, Harkins alleged that, despite Niklas' knowledge that Niklas' tenant, Harkins, was incarcerated, Niklas exercised unauthorized control over Harkins' property and acted \"willfully, intentionally and negligently\" in \"opening or making accessible the apartment\" to Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet, without providing notice to Harkins as required by law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [11] In Count IV, Harkins alleged that Westmeyer \"acted with the specific and\n   purposeful intentions to inflict emotional distress\" when Westmeyer removed Harkins' personal property and \"acted with malicious intent to cause [Harkins] to suffer emotionally ... on the belief that [Harkins] had wronged their parents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [12] In Count V, Harkins alleged that Janet and Angie aided Westmeyer in exercising unauthorized control over his property \"with the intent to forever deprive\" Harkins thereof.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Westmeyer\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [13] On March 2, 2016, Westmeyer served Harkins with requests for admissions (\"RFAs\"), which included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   15. Shannon Westmeyer did not remove any of your personal property from your apartment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   16. Any property that Shannon Westmeyer removed from your apartment did not belong to you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellee Westmeyer's App. Vol. II pp. 3-4. Harkins did not respond to the RFAs. Westmeyer also served Harkins with interrogatories. In Harkins' answers to Westmeyer's interrogatories, Harkins admitted that, after his arrest, Harkins granted Dawn permission to enter the Apartment and to retrieve items belonging to their son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [14] On June 2, 2016, Westmeyer, by counsel, filed a motion for summary judgment. On July 18, 2016, the trial court granted Harkins \"an extension of 45 days from the date of th[e] order to respond to [ ]Westmeyer's Motion for Summary Judgment\"; accordingly, Harkins' response to Westmeyer's motion for summary judgment was due on September 1, 2016. On September 6, 2016, Harkins filed his response in opposition to Westmeyer's motion for summary judgment, including Harkins' own affidavit, a subpoena request regarding Dawn, and Harkins' designation of evidence (collectively, \"response materials\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Harkins also designated the appellees' answers to his complaint, the appellees' affidavits, and the other documents filed by Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Angie's Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [15] On July 5, 2016, Angie filed a motion for summary judgment. In support, Angie designated an affidavit and incorporated all materials designated by Westmeyer in support of Westmeyer's motion for summary judgment. Harkins moved for additional time in which to respond. On September 6, 2016, the trial court granted Harkins an additional thirty days from the date of its order to respond to Angie's motion for summary judgment; accordingly, Harkins' response to Angie's motion for summary judgment was due on October 6, 2016. Harkins did not file a response to Angie's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Janet's Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [16] On June 24, 2016, Janet filed a motion for summary judgment and designated an affidavit in support. Harkins filed a motion for additional time to respond. On September 6, 2016, the trial court granted Harkins an additional thirty days to respond; accordingly, Harkins' response to Janet's motion for summary judgment was due on October 6, 2016. Harkins did not file a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Niklas' Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [17] On October 20, 2016, Niklas filed a motion for summary judgment. Niklas designated Harkins' responses to Westmeyer's\n   RFAs as well as all materials designated by Westmeyer, Janet, and Angie. Harkins filed a motion for additional time to respond. On November 29, 2016, the trial court granted Harkins an additional thirty days to respond; accordingly, Harkins' responsive filing was due on December 29, 2016. Harkins did not file a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Summary Judgment Hearings and Rulings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [18] On October 7, 2016, the trial court conducted a hearing on the motions for summary judgment filed by Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet. Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet moved, pursuant to Indiana Trial Rule 56(C), to strike, as untimely, Harkins' response materials to Westmeyer's motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motion and ordered Harkins' response materials and other filings stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [19] On December 12, 2016, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet. In its order, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   * * * * * Ind.

On February 13, 2017, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Niklas on virtually identical grounds as the trial court cited regarding the motions for summary judgment filed by Westmeyer, Janet, and Angie. Harkins now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [21] Harkins appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of Westmeyer, Angie, Janet, and Niklas.

A remittance slip was attached and properly filled out by Harkins requesting first class postage be applied to the mail and charged against his inmate trust account. A security signal was called at appox [sic] 1500hrs on Tuesday September 6, 2016 and the library was then cleared of all personnel. This triggered a chain of events causing Offender Harkins's mail amongst others to be left unintentionally in a postal mailbox that went unnoticed until Thursday September 22, 2016.

Specifically, Harkins argues that, applying the Rule 6(E) three-day extension to the September 1, 2016 deadline, Harkins' responsive deadline was Sunday, September 4, 2016; the following day, September 5, 2016, was the Labor Day holiday; and, therefore, Harkins' response materials were timely filed on September 6, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Rule 6(A).

This small difference in language is important. For example,\n   <em>\n    McDillon\n   </em>\n   cites\n   <em>\n    Baker v. Sihsmann,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1384964\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind-app/161/260/\">\n    161 Ind.App. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20N.E.2d%20386\">\n    315 N.E.2d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (1974), to demonstrate allowance of the three-day extension when the response period began \"the day after\n   <em>\n    receipt\n   </em>\n   of the summons.\"\n   <em>\n    McDillon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8989222\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/841/1148/#p1151\">\n    841 N.E.2d at 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    McDillon\n   </em>\n   also cites\n   <em>\n    Yaksich v.

App. 1982) as an example, which allowed the three-day extension when the period was triggered \"after\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   of the order.\"\n   <em>\n    McDillon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8989222\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/841/1148/#p1151\">\n    841 N.E.2d at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). These examples are consistent with the\n   <em>\n    McDillon\n   </em>\n   court's conclusion that Rule 6(E) applies when the deadline to respond is triggered by service or notice to a party and not, as here, when the deadline is triggered by the date of an order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [35] Stated differently, there are essentially two requirements for the three-day extension to apply. First, the time period for a filing must be triggered by service of a paper. Second, service to the individual must be completed by mail. In this case, while Harkins was in fact served by mail, the first requirement is not met. The order granting Harkins' motion for extension of time granted Harkins \"an extension of 45 days\n   <em>\n    from the date of this order\n   </em>\n   to respond to Defendant Shannon Westmeyer's Motion for Summary Judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant's App. p. 27 (emphasis added). Harkins' forty-five-day extension period was not a prescribed period after\n   <em>\n    service\n   </em>\n   but, rather, was a period that was merely \"triggered by\" the entry of the trial court's order extending Harkins' time to respond to Westmeyer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McDillon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8989222\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/841/1148/#p1151\">\n    841 N.E.2d at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   [36] Guided by\n   <em>\n    McDillon\n   </em>\n   's explicit holding, we conclude that the forty-five-day enlargement period does not receive the benefit of Rule 6(E) because the period was merely triggered by the trial court's entry of the enlargement order. A finding otherwise would afford\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   court orders the benefit of Rule 6(E), which would contravene\n   the\n   <em>\n    McDillon\n   </em>\n   court's explicit holding that Rule 6(E) properly applies only to extend the commencement of deadlines that are triggered by service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [37] For these reasons, we find that the automatic three-day extension pursuant to Rule 6(E) does not apply to extend Harkins' deadline from September 1, 2016. The trial court, therefore, did not err in deeming Harkins' September 6, 2016 response materials to be untimely filed and ordering Harkins' response materials stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

We begin with Harkins' claims of tortious conversion and intentional infliction of emotional distress as to Westmeyer. Harkins contends that Westmeyer exercised unauthorized control of Harkins' property and, thereby, caused Harkins to suffer emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [39] Tortious conversion is appropriating another's personal property for the tortfeasor's own use and benefit, in exclusion and defiance of the owner's rights, and under an inconsistent claim of title.\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

Harkins never responded to Westmeyer's RFAs, and they were deemed admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [44] Additionally, to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Westmeyer committed conversion, Westmeyer designated an affidavit in which she averred that: (1) she removed only \"paperwork ... that rightfully belonged to\" the Parents, including \"bank statements, credit card statement, and tax returns\"; \"[a] printer/scanner/fax machine contain[ing] sensitive information concerning\" the Parents because \"Janet Harkins, who was there with [Westmeyer], identified it as one that [Janet] personally gave to\" the Parents; and \"a piece of art work\" that Harkins had offered to give Westmeyer before the above-mentioned events; and (2) Westmeyer did not drive Harkins' 2001 Ford F-150 pickup truck or lock the truck keys inside the pickup truck. Westmeyer's App. pp. 73-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   [45] Further, as to Harkins' claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, which was predicated upon the alleged tortious conversion of Harkins' personal property, Westmeyer averred that, after Harkins was arrested for defrauding the Parents, Westmeyer merely retrieved and returned to the Parents items that the Parents owned and/or purchased. This is not outrageous conduct that would support an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   [46] By Harkins' failure to respond to Westmeyer's RFAs, the matters asserted in those RFAs were deemed admitted and conclusively established.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11493690\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/720/1/#p6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Harkins, thereby, admitted that Westmeyer did not remove Harkins' personal property from the Apartment. As to Westmeyer, all issues dispositive of Harkins' conversion claim and the related emotional distress claim are conclusively established by operation of Trial Rule 36, and no issues remain to be litigated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [47] Westmeyer established the absence of any genuine issues of material fact as to whether she committed tortious conversion or intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Appellee Angie's Br. p. 13. Angie averred that she delivered all of the items that she removed from the Apartment to the Parents and that Angie retained none of the items. Angie also denied that she drove Harkins' truck, locked his\n   truck keys inside, or removed Harkins' paperwork, office equipment, or artwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   [50] As to Harkins' claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, Angie designated an affidavit in which Angie averred that, after Harkins was arrested for defrauding the Parents, Angie retrieved and returned to the Parents items from the Apartment that the Parents owned and/or purchased. This is not outrageous conduct that would support an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   [51] After Angie designated evidence to support her claim that no genuine issues of material fact existed regarding Harkins' claims of tortious conversion and intentional infliction of emotional distress, the burden shifted to Harkins to present contrary evidence showing an issue for the trial court. Harkins, however, failed to respond to Angie's motion for summary judgment and has not carried his burden. Accordingly, Angie is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   [52] Because Harkins failed to demonstrate that genuine issues of material fact existed with regard to his claims of conversion and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Angie, and Angie showed that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in Angie's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Janet\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   [53] Next, Harkins argues that genuine issues of material fact precluded entry of summary judgment in favor of Janet on his claims of tortious conversion and infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   [54] In support of her motion for summary judgment, Janet designated her affidavit in which she averred that she \"did not remove or retain any items taken from [Harkins'] apartment\" and \"only assist[ed] ... in the sorting and recovery of property that Janet understood was not owned by Harkins.\" Appellee Janet's Br. p. 21; Janet's App. Vol. II p. 48. After Janet designated evidence to support her argument that no genuine issues of material fact existed and that Janet is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the burden shifted to Harkins to present contrary evidence showing an issue for the trial court. Harkins failed to respond to Janet's motion for summary judgment and has not carried his burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   [55] For reasons stated above as to Angie, we conclude that Harkins failed to demonstrate that genuine issues of material fact existed with regard to his claims of conversion and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Janet and that Janet has demonstrated she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The trial court did not err in entering summary judgment in Janet's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. Niklas\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   [56] Harkins argues that genuine issues of material fact precluded entry of summary judgment in Niklas' favor. In Harkins' complaint, Harkins alleged that Niklas: (1) acted with deliberate indifference and culpable negligence in allowing Westmeyer, Angie, Janet, and Dawn to enter the Apartment, without notice to Harkins; and (2) lacked authority to grant anyone access to Harkins' Apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   [57] In Niklas' designated motion for summary judgment materials, Niklas averred that he did not unlock the Apartment; and that Dawn unlocked the Apartment with her own key. Niklas also designated Harkins' answers to Westmeyer's interrogatories, in which Harkins admitted that he granted Dawn permission to enter the Apartment after his arrest. Niklas' App. Vol. II p. 59. The burden then shifted to Harkins to present contrary evidence showing an issue for the trial court; however,\n   Harkins failed to respond to Niklas' motion for summary judgment. Harkins failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that genuine issues of material fact existed with regard to Niklas' role in the removal of items from the Apartment; and, thus, Niklas has demonstrated that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Niklas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   [58] No genuine issues of material fact exist as to Harkins' claims of conversion and infliction of emotional distress against Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet. Nor do any genuine issues of material fact exist regarding Harkins' claims that Niklas acted with deliberate indifference and culpable negligence in facilitating the entry of Westmeyer, Angie, and Janet into the Apartment. We conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that Westmeyer, Angie, Janet, and Niklas were entitled to judgment as a matter of law and in granting summary judgment in their favor.
