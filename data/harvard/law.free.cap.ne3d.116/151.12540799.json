This cause originated in this court on the filing of a complaint for writs of mandamus and prohibition involving an expedited election matter. On review of the complaint, it is evident that this case was filed more than 90 days prior to the next election and thus is not an expedited election case. However, the case shall still proceed pursuant to the schedule set forth in S.Ct.Prac.R. 12.08.\n    </p>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
