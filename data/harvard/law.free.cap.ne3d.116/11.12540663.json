We reviewed the appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, because that statute as it existed at the time of his offense required us to review every case \"in which the defendant was tried on an indictment for murder in the first degree and was convicted of murder either in the first or second degree.\"\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n  G.

Although, technically speaking, the indictment had not changed in the meantime, the Commonwealth was barred by double jeopardy principles from retrying Beauchamp for murder in the first degree, where Beauchamp \"effectively was acquitted of that charge when the jury found him\n  guilty of murder in the second degree\" at his first trial in 1973.\n  <em>\n   Commonwealth\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Acevedo\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783409\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/435/\">\n   446 Mass. 435\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 451 n.20,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=845%20N.E.2d%20274\">\n   845 N.E.2d 274\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2006). At the outset of the retrial, the Commonwealth confirmed that it no longer was pressing the indictment insofar as it charged murder in the first degree, and that it would try the defendant only for murder in the second degree. The trial proceeded on that basis, and the jury found Beauchamp guilty of murder in the second degree.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  Beauchamp appealed again. Both before and after his appeal was decided, this court considered the question whether the appeal should be entered in this court and heard by us in the first instance pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as it existed prior to the amendment in 1979, as was done with his first appeal (see note 2,\n  <em>\n   supra\n  </em>\n  ), or whether the appeal should be entered in the Appeals Court and decided there in the first instance. We decided that the latter course was correct. As we explained in our order denying Beauchamp's motion to reconsider the denial of his application for further appellate review, \"[t]he defendant having been retried on only so much of the indictment as charged murder in the second degree, his case was no longer a capital case within the meaning of [ \u00a7 33E ], either before or after the statute's amendment.\" In other words, because it was abundantly clear at the retrial that the Commonwealth was going forward on only so much of the indictment as charged murder in the second degree -- indeed, the Commonwealth was precluded from pursuing a charge of murder in the first degree -- the defendant was no longer being \"tried on an indictment for murder in the first degree\" within the meaning of the statute. The case therefore remained in the Appeals Court and was decided there. The Appeals Court affirmed his conviction, and, as stated, we denied his application for further appellate review.

L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition. Each time his claim has been rejected. Beauchamp is simply not entitled to further review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, of an issue that he has already raised, and which has already been resolved, in the course of his direct appeal and in subsequent proceedings.\n  <em>\n   Votta\n  </em>\n  v.\n  <em>\n   Police Dep't of Billerica\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"985764,985822\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/444/1001/\">\n   444 Mass. 1001\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , 1001,\n  <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=826%20N.E.2d%20199\">\n   826 N.E.2d 199\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (2005) (\"Our general superintendence power under G.

Our practice, which we followed in the 1997 appeal, has been to apply the statute as it existed prior to the amendment to cases in which the defendant has been tried for murder in the first degree and convicted of murder in the second degree for an offense that was committed before the amendment.
