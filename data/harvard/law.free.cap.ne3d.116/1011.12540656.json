Nov. 1, 2017), from an order of the circuit court denying the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint or, alternatively, to stay the lower court proceedings pending mandatory arbitration. The appeal stems from a complaint filed by the plaintiff, June M. Ward, in which she alleged that the defendants, J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons, LLC d/b/a Hilliard Lyons (Hilliard Lyons), and Michael Barnett, were negligent in the management of her individual retirement account (IRA). The appeal centers on the issue of whether the parties' contract concerning the management of the IRA included an agreement to arbitrate disputes stemming from the contract. The defendants filed the motion seeking the dismissal or stay, alleging that their agreement required arbitration of the dispute. The circuit court, however, denied the defendants' request, holding that, under Kentucky law, the parties' agreement did not include an enforceable arbitration provision. The defendants now appeal from this interlocutory order. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Hilliard Lyons is a Kentucky corporation engaged in the business of providing its customers investment management services, including the management of IRAs. It has a branch office in Marion, Illinois. In the spring of 2015, the plaintiff's husband, Archie Ward, came to Hilliard Lyons' Marion office and met with Barnett to open separate IRA accounts for himself and the plaintiff. Barnett provided Ward with two sets of documents, one set for Ward and one set for the plaintiff, in connection with opening the IRA accounts. The sets of documents included an account application and an \"Account Terms of Service.\" Incorporated into the account application were (1) an individual retirement custodial account agreement and (2) disclosure statements. Therefore, the account application, individual retirement custodial account agreement, and the disclosure statements were all part of a single, 14-page document. A line for the account holder's signature appears on page four of this document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Account Terms of Service is a separate document and has no space for the account holder's signature or initials. In an affidavit attached to the defendants' motion to dismiss or stay, Barnett testified that after his meeting with Ward, he subsequently spoke with the plaintiff over the telephone and confirmed that she had received both of these documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 On June 3, 2015, the plaintiff completed and signed the account application. Hilliard Lyons subsequently opened an IRA account on her behalf, and the defendants began managing the account. On December 6, 2016, the plaintiff filed her complaint against the defendants alleging that they were negligent and breached their fiduciary duties in managing the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 The defendants subsequently filed the motion to dismiss or stay, which is the subject matter of the present appeal. In their motion, the defendants maintained that their agreement with the plaintiff included a provision that required them to arbitrate disputes. In her response, the plaintiff denied that she agreed to arbitrate any disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 As explained above, the only document that the plaintiff signed was page 4 of the 14-page account application. The first four pages of the account application required the plaintiff to answer various financial-related questions on topics that included income, net worth, investment goals, beneficiary designations, and other account-related matters. Immediately above the plaintiff's signature at the bottom of page four is the following: \"The undersigned hereby accepts the Hilliard Lyons Retirement Account Custodial Agreement.\" Following the plaintiff's signature, pages five through eight of the document set out the terms of the \"INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT CUSTODIAL ACCOUNT AGREEMENT.\" The terms of the retirement custodial account agreement do not include any reference to arbitration. Pages 9 through 14 of the account application include a \"DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\" and a \"FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\" Again, neither of these disclosures mentions arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 The defendants' argument that the plaintiff agreed to arbitrate is based on an acknowledgement on the account application, above the plaintiff's signature, that reads as follows: \"By signing this application, I acknowledge that I understand and have received a copy of the Account Terms of Service, which, in Sections 13 and 14, require arbitration to resolve disputes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 As stated above, the Account Terms of Service is a separate four-page document that Barnett furnished to the plaintiff along with the account application. The plaintiff's signature does not appear on this document, as the document itself does not have any lines for signatures. At the outset, the language of the Account Terms of Service states that Hilliard Lyons agreed to open and maintain \"one or more investment accounts\" and \"[i]n exchange, you [the plaintiff] agree[d] to the following terms of service.\" It then further states, \"We wish this could be shorter, but many of these terms are prescribed by law. You should read and agree to them in addition to the terms of service specific to the account(s) you are opening.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 10 As referenced in the acknowledgement above the plaintiff's signature on the account application, paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Account Terms of Service require arbitration as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"13. ARBITRATION GENERALLY: When you open an account with us, any disputes between you and us will be settled by arbitration rather than by going to court. Here is how arbitration in our industry works:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (a) You and we give up the right to sue each other in court, including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the Code of Arbitration Procedure for Customer Disputes of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA; below, the code is referred to as 'FINRA's Code').\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (b) We are incorporating FINRA's Code and any future amendments to it into these Terms of Service as if they were set out in full. See\n   <em>\n    www.finra.org/ArbitrationAndMediation\n   </em>\n   for an overview of FINRA's Code and arbitration process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (c) FINRA's Code requires a party to bring a claim for arbitration within six years after the event giving rise to the dispute occurred. In some cases, a claim not eligible for arbitration can be brought in court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (d) You can choose an all-public panel or a majority-public panel of arbitrators. (A 'majority public' panel will have one arbitrator who participates in the financial services industry, one non-industry chairperson, and one non-industry arbitrator.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (e) Your and our ability to obtain documents, to get statements from witnesses, and to conduct other discovery is more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (f) Arbitrators do not have to explain the reasons for their award unless you and we submit to them a joint request for an 'explained' decision at least 20 calendar days before the first scheduled hearing date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (g) Arbitration awards are final and binding. Courts will normally enforce them. Your and our ability to have a court reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   14. MANDATORY ARBITRATION: You agree to arbitrate all controversies that may arise between us and our agents, representatives, affiliates, or employees on the one hand and you on the other hand concerning any transaction or the construction, performance, or breach of any agreement between us, whenever that transaction or agreement was or is entered into. Arbitration will be conducted before FINRA under FINRA's Code. The arbitrators' award will be final, and a party can enter judgment on the award in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11 The circuit court conducted a hearing on the defendants' motion to dismiss or stay, and on March 7, 2018, it denied the motion. Applying Kentucky contract law, the court concluded that the Account Terms of Service was not incorporated into the parties' agreement by reference. The court stated: \"The Application language drafted by Defendant Hilliard Lyons fails to show that Plaintiff assented to be bound by the Account Terms of Service, including the arbitration clause. Furthermore, it fails to incorporate by reference the Account Terms of Service into the Account Application.\" The court emphasized that the account application did not include language that the plaintiff \"actually assents\" to the Account Terms of Service but, instead, \"merely acknowledges receipt of the terms.\" The circuit court held that, under Kentucky law, assent to be bound by the terms of an agreement must be express, and simply acknowledging the receipt of the document does not constitute assent to be bound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 The circuit court also held that the Account Terms of Service, as a stand-alone document, violated Kentucky's statute of frauds because it was not signed by the plaintiff and could not be performed within one year. The court found that the clear intent of the parties was that \"the agreement or investment and brokerage services would not, and could not, be completed within one year.\" Therefore, the court concluded that it must be signed in order to be enforceable as a standalone agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 The defendants now appeal from the circuit court's interlocutory order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 A. Appellate Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 This appeal is brought pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 307(a)(1) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017), which allows for the appeal of an interlocutory order that grants, modifies, refuses, dissolves, or refuses to dissolve an injunction. The supreme court has held that \"[a]n order of the circuit court to compel or stay arbitration is injunctive in nature and subject to interlocutory appeal under paragraph (a)(1) of [ Rule 307 ].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Salsitz v.

In the present case, the parties agree that their dispute concerning whether there is an agreement to arbitrate is controlled by Kentucky contract law. The individual retirement custodial account agreement attached to the account application (pages five through eight) states: the agreement \"is subject to all applicable federal and state laws and regulations. If it is necessary to apply any state law to interpret and administer this agreement, the law of our domicile will govern.\" Because Hilliard Lyons is a Kentucky corporation, the circuit court applied Kentucky law in determining whether the parties had an agreement to arbitrate. On appeal, neither party takes issue with this aspect of the circuit court's decision. Accordingly, we will also apply Kentucky law as it relates to the validity of the purported agreement to arbitrate. See\n   <em>\n    B.H. Smith, Inc. v.

Therefore, like the court in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , we first begin our analysis with Kentucky's statute of frauds. KRS 371.010(7) sets out the state's statute of frauds as follows: \"No action shall be brought to charge any person * * * [u]pon any agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof * * * unless the promise, contract, agreement, representation, assurance, or ratification,\n   or some memorandum or note thereof, be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or by his authorized agent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ky.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20371.010\">\n    Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 371.010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7) (West 2017). \"[W]hen it was contemplated by the parties that the contract would not, and could not, be performed within the year, even though it was\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   of performance within that time, it comes within the inhibition of the Statute.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Williamson v. Stafford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2823456\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ky/301/59/\">\n    301 Ky. 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20S.W.2d%20859\">\n    190 S.W.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (1945).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 34 In the present case, Hilliard Lyons argues that the statute of frauds does not apply because either party could terminate the agreement at any time. We believe, however, that the\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning directly applies to the agreement at issue in this case. Here, the account application that the plaintiff signed expressly stated that the agreement's \"time horizon\" was 5 to 10 years. The application stated that the plaintiff's primary objective in investing with the defendants was \"Growth and Income,\" which the defendants themselves defined as balancing the plaintiff's investments' \"\n   <em>\n    long-term\n   </em>\n   growth and income.\" (Emphasis added.) We agree with the plaintiff that the parties \"clearly contemplated a term of account management that extended beyond one year.\" Therefore, Kentucky's statute of frauds applies to the parties' agreement in this case; it must be in writing and signed by the plaintiff in order for its provisions to be enforceable against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 35 Having determined that Kentucky's statute of frauds applies to the parties' agreement, we note that the only document signed by the plaintiff is the account application, which does not include the arbitration provisions at issue. Like the court in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , however, we will analyze the account application to determine whether the arbitration clauses are incorporated into the signed document by reference. The language contained in the account application must clearly show that the plaintiff had knowledge of and assented to the arbitration clauses. In addition, pursuant to KRS 446.060, the incorporation by reference language must be above the plaintiff's signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 36 The plaintiff's signature is on the account application below the following acknowledgment: \"By signing this application, I acknowledge that I understand and have received a copy of the Account Terms of Service, which, in Sections 13 and 14, require arbitration to resolve disputes.\" The plaintiff argues that this acknowledgment is substantially similar to the acknowledgment in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   and that the acknowledgment does not function as an affirmation of\n   <em>\n    assent\n   </em>\n   to the Account Terms of Service. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 37 The language of the acknowledgement in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   was merely that the students had read both pages of the enrollment agreement. In the present case, the acknowledgement states that the plaintiff received the Account Terms of Service and that she also\n   <em>\n    understood\n   </em>\n   the document. In\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , nothing in the decision reveals the specific language that was used on the reverse side of the enrollment agreement except a general reference to the existence of an arbitration clause on the reverse side of the document. In the present case, however, the record before us includes the specific language of the Account Terms of Service that the plaintiff \"understood\" prior to signing. Therefore, it is necessary to turn to the language of the Account Terms of Service to determine what exactly the plaintiff acknowledged that she \"understood\" prior to signing the account application. This is necessary because, under Kentucky law, a contract must be interpreted as a whole with no one part read in isolation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Cantrell Supply, Inc. v.

Ct. App. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 38 Turning to the language of the Account Terms of Service, we note that paragraph 14 states, \"You\n   <em>\n    agree\n   </em>\n   to arbitrate all controversies that may arise between us * * *.\" (Emphasis added.) By signing the account application, therefore, the plaintiff acknowledged that she understood that she was agreeing to arbitrate. This language is vastly different from the meager acknowledgement that the students initialed in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , which merely indicated that they read both sides of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 39 Looking further at the language of the Account Terms of Service, we note that at the very beginning of the document, it specifically states that Hilliard Lyons agreed to open and maintain \"one or more investment accounts.\" Importantly, it plainly states, \"In exchange, you\n   <em>\n    agree\n   </em>\n   to the following terms of service.\" (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, by signing the account application, the plaintiff acknowledged that she understood that she was agreeing to the Account Terms of Service in exchange for Hilliard Lyons opening and managing the IRA account on her behalf. She acknowledged her understanding that this was a benefit of the bargain. The plaintiff, therefore, acknowledged much more than the students in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   when she placed her signature on the account application. When the documents are read together, the plaintiff acknowledged her assent to the arbitration clauses contained within the Account Terms of Service; she acknowledged that she understood this prior to signing the account application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 40 This conclusion is further bolstered by the language in the acknowledgment above the plaintiff's signature that specifically referenced the arbitration clauses by their specific paragraph numbers with the added statement that they \"require arbitration to resolve disputes.\" See\n   <em>\n    Dakota Foundry, Inc. v. Tromley Industrial Holdings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276182\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/891/1088/#p1100\">\n    891 F.Supp.2d 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1100 (D.S.D. 2012) (stating that \"a common thread through cases recognizing the ability to incorporate by reference certain provisions is language that directs the offeree to the source of that provision\").

As is the case here, the signature in\n   <em>\n    Janiga\n   </em>\n   appeared below the acknowledgment that the person signing had read and understood the specific arbitration clause contained in a separate, unsigned document entitled \"Client Agreement.\" The court found that this acknowledgment was sufficient to establish an agreement to arbitrate; the plaintiff's signature objectively demonstrated his \"assent\" to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3711068\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/735/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 46 Here, the facts are similar to those in\n   <em>\n    Janiga\n   </em>\n   , not to those in\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiff does not dispute that she signed the account application and that above her signature she acknowledged receiving a copy of and, most importantly,\n   <em>\n    understanding\n   </em>\n   the Account Terms of Service, including the expressly referenced arbitration provisions contained in that document. Accordingly, reading the documents as a whole, the plaintiff acknowledged that, prior to signing the account application, she understood that the defendants were agreeing to open and manage her IRA account in exchange for her agreement to, among other things, arbitrate disputes stemming from the management of the\n   account. Although nothing in the record indicates that the Account Terms of Service was physically attached to the account application, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Janiga\n   </em>\n   , this fact does not change our analysis because physical attachment is not required in order for a separate document to be incorporated by reference.

See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Management Computer Controls, Inc. v.

Cir. 2008) (same). What is important to our analysis is that the plaintiff acknowledged that she understood the Account Terms of Service, which, in turn, expressly stated that arbitration was part of the consideration for the agreement, and she understood that she was agreeing to arbitrate disputes before she signed the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 48 When the acknowledgement above the plaintiff's signature is read in conjunction with the language of the Account Terms of Service, it is clear that the documents as a whole reveal the intent of the parties to be bound to the arbitration provisions contained in paragraphs 13 and 14 in the Account Terms of Service. As a result, the circuit court erred in holding that the parties' agreement did not incorporate the arbitration clauses by reference. See also\n   <em>\n    Lenz v.

Statute of Frauds\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 50 In the proceedings below, the circuit court held that the Account Terms of Service could not be enforced as a stand-alone agreement under Kentucky's statute of frauds because it was not signed by the plaintiff. However, for the reasons stated above, we hold that the account application, which was signed by the plaintiff, sufficiently incorporated the Account Terms of Service into the parties' agreement by reference. Therefore, the circuit court's conclusion that the Account Terms of Service must be separately signed by the plaintiff under Kentucky's statute of frauds is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 51 Where the signature of the party to be charged is made or adopted with reference to an unsigned writing, the signed and unsigned writings together may constitute a memorandum. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 132 cmt. c (1981); see also 11 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 30.25 (4th ed. 1999) (\"When a writing refers to another document, that other document, or the portion to which reference is made, becomes constructively a part of the writing, and in that respect the two form a single instrument. The incorporated matter is to be interpreted as part of the writing.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 52 Accordingly, in the present case, the Account Terms of Service is not a stand-alone agreement but is part of the entire written agreement signed by the plaintiff. Enforcing the arbitration provision in the Account Terms of Service does not violate Kentucky's statute of frauds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 53 F. Whether the Federal Arbitration Act or Kentucky's Uniform Arbitration Act Applies to the Proceedings on Remand\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 54 In the proceedings below, the parties disagreed concerning the application of the Federal Arbitration Act to the controversy. The defendants argued that the contract at issue involved interstate commerce and is therefore subject to the Federal Arbitration Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2012) ).

The plaintiff, however, argued that the arbitration provision was governed solely by Kentucky's Uniform Arbitration Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ky.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20417.045\">\n    Ky.

Ann. \u00a7 417.045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2017) ), as opposed to the Federal Arbitration Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 55 As we have explained, the circuit court held that, under Kentucky law, the parties did not have an agreement to arbitrate their dispute. The circuit court, therefore, concluded that it did not need to decide the issue of whether the Federal Arbitration Act preempted the Kentucky Uniform Arbitration Act. On appeal, the defendants request that we address this issue and determine whether the Federal Arbitration Act or the Kentucky Uniform Arbitration Act applies to the proceedings on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 56 However, we agree with the plaintiff that our review of the circuit court's decision in this case should be limited to the issues the circuit court addressed and decided.

Our task in this interlocutory appeal is to determine whether the parties have a valid and enforceable agreement to arbitrate under Kentucky's contract formation principles. We have done so and now remand for further proceedings. We will not usurp the circuit court's function on remand by addressing matters on appeal that should be addressed by the circuit court in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 57 The plaintiff filed a motion requesting that we strike that portion of the defendants' brief that raised this issue.

Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Portions of the Defendants' Brief That Raise New Arguments on Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 59 In their brief, in addition to the incorporation by reference doctrine, the defendants also argue that the plaintiff manifested her assent to the Account Terms of Service by opening the IRA account after reading the document.

The plaintiff argues in her motion to strike that the defendants' argument based on\n   <em>\n    Energy Home\n   </em>\n   is a new theory that cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. The plaintiff also requested leave to respond to the merits of the argument should we deny her motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 61 As noted above, however, we hold that the account application that the plaintiff\n   signed incorporated the Account Terms of Service by reference such that the documents are to be construed as one contract. We need not address the defendants' alternative argument that the plaintiff indicated her acceptance of the Account Terms of Service by her actions. Accordingly, we deny the plaintiff's motion to strike that portion of the defendants' brief as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 62 III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 63 For the foregoing reasons, we deny the plaintiff's motion to strike portions of the defendants' brief; we reverse the circuit court's order denying the defendants' motion to dismiss or stay; and we remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 64 Reversed and remanded; motion denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Justices Welch and Moore concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
