The complaint set forth a cause of action for false imprisonment, as well as alleged civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligence,\n   malicious prosecution, and/or abuse of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 10, 2016, ODRC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Civ.R. 12(B)(1), and for failure to state a claim for relief under Civ.R. 12(B)(6). On March 23, 2016, appellant filed a memorandum contra ODRC's motion to dismiss. On April 15, 2016, the Court of Claims filed a partial entry of dismissal in which it dismissed appellant's civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On January 24, 2017, ODRC filed a motion for summary judgment. Also on that date, appellant filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to his claim for false imprisonment. Both parties subsequently filed responses to the respective summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 5} By decision filed March 22, 2017, the Court of Claims granted summary judgment in favor of ODRC and denied appellant's motion for partial summary judgment. The decision of the Court of Claims was journalized by judgment entry filed on that same date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On appeal, appellant sets forth the following four assignments of error for this court's review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [I.] The Ohio Court of Claims erred when it found that Appellee-Defendant's general denials to Appellant-Plaintiff's Requests for Admissions were sufficient under Civ.R. 36.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [II.] The Ohio Court of Claims erred when it found that the Affidavit of Attorney Brian K. Duncan was insufficient as the same was permissible under the business records exception.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [III.] The Ohio Court of Claims erred when it ruled in favor of Appellee-Defendant with respect to Appellant-Plaintiff when it found that Appellee-Defendant was operating under a facially valid judgment or order as the Court of Appeals had previously determined that Appellant-Plaintiff was held past his lawful sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [IV.] The Ohio Court of Claims erred when it held that Appellant-Plaintiff's causes of action for negligence, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and malicious prosecution in violation of constitutional rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   were based upon the decisions and result of Appellant-Plaintiff's claim for false imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In accordance with Civ.R. 56(C), \"summary judgment is proper when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Hapgood v.

Appellant argues ODRC failed to sufficiently answer two of his seven requests for admissions; specifically, appellant contends ODRC failed to properly respond to requests for admissions Nos. 3 and 4 by answering those requests with a general denial. According to appellant, ODRC's general denials were insufficient under Civ.R. 36(A), thereby resulting in an admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In support of his motion for partial summary judgment, appellant attached as\n   an exhibit a copy of ODRC's responses to his requests for admissions. Appellant's requests for admissions Nos. 3 and 4, as well as the corresponding responses, state as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. Admit that Defendant, via its agents, representatives, and/or otherwise, wrongfully confined Plaintiff intentionally without lawful privilege and against his consent within a limited area in prison from November 26, 2012, through September 17, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    RESPONSE\n   </em>\n   : Denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   4.

Furthermore, the requests for admission that plaintiff seeks does not include such statements of fact as to require a qualification of defendant's denial. Plaintiff also had the opportunity to move for an order with regard to the admissions pursuant to Civ.R. 36(A)(3), but did not. Accordingly, the court finds defendant's general denials sufficient.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Decision at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Civ.R. 36(A)(2) states in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   If objection is made, the reasons therefor shall be stated. The answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify his or her answer, or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, the party shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. * * * A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; the party may, subject to the provisions of Civ.R. 37(C), deny the matter or set forth reasons why the party cannot admit or deny it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In asserting that ODRC's general denials resulted in an admission, appellant relies on\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Or, as alternatively stated by one of the authorities cited in\n   <em>\n    Leichman,\n   </em>\n   the purpose of requests for admissions is to \"expedite trials and to eliminate the need for proof when matters are not legitimately contested,\" as opposed to use as \"a 'gotcha' device.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Mary v.

Here, the Court of Claims noted appellant had the opportunity to make such a motion but failed to do so. Under the circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion by the Court of Claims with respect to its ruling as to the sufficiency of ODRC's answers to the requests for admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant's first assignment of error is not well-taken and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Under the second assignment of error, appellant asserts the Court of Claims erred in finding the affidavit of his attorney to be improper. Appellant argues the affidavit was permissible under Evid.R. 803(6), the business records exception to the hearsay rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 18} By way of background, in support of his motion for partial summary judgment, appellant submitted the affidavit of his counsel, Brian K. Duncan, who averred it was part of his regular practice to keep a case file for each client and that he had \"personal knowledge of the facts set forth below based upon my review of the case file, and public records.\" Among other averments in his affidavit, Duncan stated that appellant was confined in prison from July 31, 2008 until September 17, 2014, and that appellee \"intentionally confined [appellant] after his lawful term of confinement expired.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The Court of Claims found the affidavit of appellant's counsel was not proper under Civ.R. 56(E), holding in part: \"Although plaintiff's counsel states in his affidavit that he has personal knowledge of his averments, it is clear that his statements are based upon information and belief rather than personal knowledge. Nearly all of the statements in the affidavit relay information learned through his client or refer to the admissions discussed previously.\" (Decision at 8.) The Court of Claims further noted that \"by submitting his affidavit, counsel is presenting himself as a witness in this case.\" (Decision at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Civ.R. 56(E) states in part: \"Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavit.\" Thus, \" Civ.R. 56(E) requires that affidavits supporting\n   motions for summary judgment be made on personal knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonacorsi v.

Evid.R. 602 states in part: \"A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the witness' own testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In the present case, the record supports the Court of Claims' observation that most of the statements in the attorney's affidavit appear to concern information related by appellant to his counsel, i.e., statements involving matters within the personal knowledge of appellant and made by his attorney on information and belief, rather than on personal knowledge. The affidavit also includes averments that contain legal conclusions, e.g., stating that ODRC \"intentionally confined [appellant] after his lawful term of confinement expired.\" As also noted by the Court of Claims, the affidavit presents a potential witness advocate concern under Prof.Cond.R. 3.7 (which, in general, precludes an attorney from both representing a party and testifying as to a contested issue). Based on the record presented, we find no abuse of discretion by the Court of Claims in striking the affidavit of counsel for appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Accordingly, the second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Under the third assignment of error, appellant contends the Court of Claims erred in finding ODRC was operating under a facially valid judgment, and in holding that appellant's stated term had not expired at the time he was granted his release on a writ of habeas corpus. Appellant challenges the finding of the Court of Claims that ODRC had the privilege to confine him until it received an entry from the Marion County Court of Common Pleas ordering his release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 25} By way of background, in 2008, appellant entered guilty pleas in three separate cases in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Specifically, in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-07-498250-A (\"case No. CR-07-498250\"), appellant\n   entered a guilty plea to one count of aggravated robbery, with two firearm specifications. On July 17, 2008, the trial court filed an entry of conviction and sentence in that case, stating in part: \"The court imposes a prison sentence * * * of 4 year(s). 1 year as to firearm specification to run prior to and consecutive to 3 years on base charge of Count 1 for a total of 4 years.

No. CR-08-507594-A (\"case No. CR-08-507594\"), appellant entered a guilty plea to one count of receiving stolen property.

The sentencing court's statements that \"total of 5 years\" sentence in case CR-08-510974, which included firearm specifications, was to run\n   <em>\n    concurrently\n   </em>\n   to the \"total of 4 years\" sentence in case CR-07-498250, which included another firearm specification, suggest a possibility that the sentencing court imposed those specifications concurrently, contrary to the statutory requirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (Emphasis sic.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Thus, while recognizing that \" R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a) requires [appellant] to serve the two firearm specifications consecutively to each other, for a total aggregate term of seven years,\" the court in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   was \"unable to completely disregard the [trial] court's statements in its sentencing entries that seem to impose an order contradicting the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Noting that \"[a] sentencing court speaks only through its journal entries,\" the court found it could not \"rely on the notes provided by the Bureau of Sentence Computation, referring to a conversation with the sentencing court's bailiff in resolving the ambiguity,\" and that \"the record does not reflect any journal entries modifying the sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The reviewing court determined that \"this matter must be remanded to the habeas court to resolve the ambiguity present,\" and \"[i]f the habeas court finds that the sentence imposed on [appellant] was a total aggregate term of five years in prison, in contradiction to the statute, and the term has expired, the habeas petition must be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Following remand, the Marion County Court of Common Pleas issued a judgment on September 17, 2014, granting appellant's request for a writ of habeas corpus and ordering his immediate release. In its decision, the trial court, in reviewing the three sentencing entries issued by the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, held in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The entries contain language that the sentences in each case are concurrent. However, R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a) requires that the firearm specification sentences be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the underlying sentence. If the firearm specifications are served consecutively, as required by law, the total sentence would be seven years in prison. However, if all three sentences are to be served concurrently with each other, including the firearm specifications, then the total sentence would be five years in prison, which would be the sentence from Case No. 08-510974-A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Previously, this Court ruled that the sentences imposed pursuant to the firearm specifications are to be served consecutively as a matter of law and, thus, the total sentence is seven years. However, on August 25, 2014, the Third District Court of Appeals reversed this Court's earlier decision and remanded the case for further proceedings. The Third District Court of Appeals held that there was an ambiguity in the sentence and that this Court should resolve the ambiguity by allowing a review of the complete docket of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas and the sentencing transcript.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   By agreement of the parties, the Petitioner's Exhibit 1 and Respondent's Exhibits 1-17 were introduced into evidence and made a part of the record. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Neither party requested to present any additional evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   This Court is required to follow the decision issued by the Third District Court of Appeals. Therefore, since there are no further sentencing entries, the Petitioner's total sentence is five years in prison, as all three sentences must be served concurrently with each other in accordance with the language of the sentencing entries, in spite of the requirements of R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Appellant subsequently filed the instant action in the Court of Claims, seeking damages for false imprisonment. In its motion for summary judgment, ODRC argued appellant was legally confined pursuant to facially valid sentencing orders despite the fact those sentencing orders were ambiguous. In its decision granting summary judgment in favor of ODRC and denying appellant's motion for partial summary judgment, the Court of Claims noted appellant \"does not contend that the sentencing entries are invalid\" but, rather, that ODRC \"erred to properly calculate the expiration date of his sentence and sua sponte extended his sentence beyond the language of the sentencing entries.\" The Court of Claims, after considering the statutory provisions of R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a) pertaining to the imposition of consecutive sentences, held in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   This statute requires that firearm specifications must be served consecutively and prior to any prison term for the underlying felony. As analyzed by the Marion Court of Common Pleas, [appellant] was required to serve four years for his firearm specifications prior to his three-year base charge sentence in case number 07-498250-A pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a). Therefore, the court finds that [ODRC] did not err when it calculated [appellant's] sentence release date to be November 22, 2014, inclusive of earned jail-time credit of 234 days. Even though [appellant's] writ was eventually granted in contravention of the statute, at the time of [appellant's] release, his stated term had not yet expired. Accordingly, [ODRC] still had privilege to confine [appellant] until it received the entry granting the writ and ordering his release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (Decision at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Pursuant to the provisions of R.C. 2743.02(A)(1), \"the state may be held liable for the false imprisonment of its prisoners.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

Specifically, the Court of Claims agreed with the trial court's observation that, pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(1)(a), the sentences for the firearm specifications were required to be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the underling sentence, thus resulting in a seven-year sentence. The Court of Claims reasoned that, even though appellant was eventually granted habeas relief, his stated term had not yet expired at the time of his release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Appellant contends the Court of Claims erred in finding ODRC was operating under a facially valid judgment in holding him past his lawful sentence. According to appellant, the sentencing entries indicated all sentences were ordered to be served concurrently, and that the entries imposed a total prison term of five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In support, appellant cites to language in the\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   decision, in which the Third District Court of Appeals reviewed appellant's appeal of the trial court's decision denying his petition for habeas corpus. As set forth above, the court in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   remanded the matter to the trial court \"to resolve the ambiguity present by this situation as to whether the sentencing court acted contrary to statute and imposed a total aggregate sentence term of five years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In a concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Young,\n   </em>\n   Judge Rogers, while agreeing with the majority's decision to reverse the habeas court's decision, concluded he would reverse and order the immediate release of appellant from confinement. The concurring opinion disagreed with the majority's view as to any ambiguity in the sentencing entries, stating in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The majority asserts that the journal entries are ambiguous and, \"[b]ased on what we have before us, we are unable to resolve the ambiguity.\" * * * It appears that the majority requires more in the record to prove that the court intended to incorrectly sentence Young beyond the plain, unambiguous language of the sentencing entries. * * * Here, the only journalized entries on record unambiguously state that Young's sentences were to run concurrently to one another. There is nothing that otherwise creates ambiguity in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Thus, in contrast to the majority's conclusion, the concurrence determined \"there is no ambiguity in the sentences, even though they are clearly in contravention of the law. Young's sentence expired after five years, and the State has failed to provide any evidence that it has the authority to continue his detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. Further, noting that the sentences at issue \"were not appealed by the state or modified by the trial court,\" and that\n   \"each stands as a final order of the court,\" the concurrence concluded that ODRC had \"no authority to modify those orders and must comply with them as written.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Based on this court's de novo review, we agree with the concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   that no ambiguity is presented by the sentencing entries, i.e., all three sentencing entries indicate the sentences were to run concurrently to one another. Arguably, to the extent there is an ambiguity presented, it would be with respect to application of the statutory language to the concurrent sentences imposed. As noted by the concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , however, the state did not appeal those sentences, nor were the sentences modified by the trial court and, therefore, \"each stands as a final order of the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Further, accepting the sentencing court in Cuyahoga County erred in ordering the sentences to be served concurrently, we conclude ODRC had no authority to disregard facially valid entries, which all provided for concurrent sentences and which imposed a total aggregate sentence of five years. Stated otherwise, ODRC lacks authority to interpret or correct an unambiguous sentencing entry even if it believes the sentence is erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
