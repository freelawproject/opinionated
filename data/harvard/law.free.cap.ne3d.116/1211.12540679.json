Since then, Tyree has filed numerous postconviction motions in the trial court as well as various applications and petitions in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See, e.g.,\n      <em>\n       Tyree\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308694\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/1013/\">\n       469 Mass. 1013\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20N.E.3d%201053\">\n       16 N.E.3d 1053\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2014). In his most recent G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition, Tyree asked the court to compel a judge in the trial court to act on then-pending motions for postconviction relief. In particular, Tyree wanted the judge to address what he describes as a \"military jurisdictional matter.\"\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      Tyree filed his G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition on September 24, 2018. The trial court judge acted on, and denied, the postconviction motions, including the \"military jurisdictional matter,\" on November 5, 2018. The single justice denied the G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition on November 8, 2018.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      Because the trial court judge has acted on Tyree's postconviction motions, his request for relief -- asking the court to compel the judge to act -- is moot. See\n      <em>\n       Rasten\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Northeastern Univ\n      </em>\n      .,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285248,285250\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/1003/\">\n       432 Mass. 1003\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1003,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=731%20N.E.2d%201074\">\n       731 N.E.2d 1074\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2000), cert. denied,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9790402,9790664,9790536,9790125,9789998,9790799,9791088,9790257,9789904,9790958,9789651,9789781,9789365,9791221,9789528\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/1168/\">\n       531 U.S. 1168\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20S.%20Ct.%201133\">\n       121 S.Ct. 1133\n      </extracted-citation>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20998\">\n       148 L.Ed.2d 998\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2001). In his filings in this court, Tyree acknowledges as much not by seeking relief from the single justice's denial of the G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition,\n     but by seeking review of, and relief from, the trial court judge's rulings on the postconviction motions. The proper avenue for Tyree to seek such relief is by filing an application with a single justice of the county court for leave to appeal pursuant to the gatekeeper provision of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as he has done in the past. It is not through a memorandum pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Mass.%201301\">\n       434 Mass. 1301\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2001), or through a motion in the full court to allow an appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as he is attempting here.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      <em>\n       Judgment affirmed\n      </em>\n      .\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
