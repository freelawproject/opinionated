(\"Unifund\"), appeal the judgment of the Ashtabula County Court of Common Pleas granting in part appellee, Lisa R. Piaser's, motion for class certification on her counterclaim for violations of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"). At issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in partially granting Ms. Piaser's motion. For the reasons that follow, the judgment is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On October 15, 2009, Unifund filed a complaint against Ms. Piaser in the Ashtabula County Municipal Court to collect an alleged credit card debt. Unifund alleged that Providian National Bank was the original creditor and that the account had been assigned to it. The account was open from April to June 2000. The complaint alleged that the charge-off balance in 2001 was $267 and that, with interest, the amount due is now $684.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In her first amended answer and counterclaim, Ms. Piaser denied the material allegations of the complaint, including that she owed any amount under the account. She also asserted individual and class counterclaims for violations of the FDCPA, the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\"CSPA\"), and various common law claims. Ms. Piaser alleged Unifund is a debt collector under the FDCPA and is in the business of acquiring and collecting defaulted consumer credit card debt. She alleged Unifund violated the FDCPA, at 15 U.S.C. 1692e, by making false and misleading representations in lawsuits and demanding payment. Ms. Piaser prayed for damages and injunctive relief. Upon assertion of her counterclaims, the municipal court transferred the case to the Common Pleas Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 1, 2010, Unifund filed a motion for summary judgment on Ms. Piaser's counterclaims. On June 28, 2013, the trial court granted the motion in Unifund's favor on Ms. Piaser's common law claims, leaving only her counterclaims for violations of the FDCPA and the CSPA. In its entry, the court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} [Unifund] contends that R.C. 1319.12 [regarding the collection of assigned debts] does not apply because it was not acting as a collection agency, but was pursuing collection of the debt against [Ms. Piaser] on its own behalf,\n   as the purchaser of the obligation. If true, this could be correct as to [Ms. Piaser]. [Ms. Piaser] claims that [Unifund] cannot show that it received a valid assignment of her claimed credit card obligation to Providian National Bank. The Court finds that, on the state of the record, there remains an issue of fact as to this contention.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On December 14, 2014, Ms. Piaser filed a motion seeking to certify her counterclaims as a class action and Unifund filed a brief in opposition. She also filed a motion for sanctions due to Unifund's alleged failure to comply with the court's September 4, 2014 discovery order requiring Unifund to produce documents related to the ownership of Ms. Piaser's account. Unifund filed a brief in opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In her motion for class certification, Ms. Piaser requested the court certify two classes, which she referred to as the \"Incompetence Class\" and the \"Time-Bar Class.\" Since the court ultimately granted her motion to certify only as to the Incompetence Class, our analysis is confined to that class. Ms. Piaser has also filed an appeal of the trial court's denial of her motion to certify the Time-Bar Class. That appeal is also pending and will be addressed in a separate opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Ms. Piaser's proposed common class criteria for each member of the Incompetence Class (hereafter \"the class\") are that each member is (1) an individual; (2) against whom Unifund filed a lawsuit in Ohio; (3) to collect a debt related to a credit card; and (4) that the suit was filed on or after December 23, 2008 and thus with a one year look back period. Ms. Piaser also included the following additional class criteria: \"At the time of filing of the lawsuit, an entity other than [Unifund] held the right, in whole or part, to receive the money that was sought to be collected through the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In her brief in support of her motion to certify, Ms. Piaser argued that Unifund does not own her account due to the lack of an assignment from the account's owner, Unifund Portfolio E, L.L.C. (\"Portfolio E\"), but, rather, was merely a debt collector. In support, she pointed out that in Unifund's answer to the counterclaim, it admitted it merely \"manages the collection of distressed consumer receivables.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Ms. Piaser further argued that the accounts of the purported class members are owned by several limited liability companies that are affiliated with Unifund, which it refers to as \"Special Purpose Vehicles\" (\"SPVs\"). Unifund's vice-president, Jeffrey Shaffer, testified in deposition that the \"special purpose\" of the SPVs is to purchase defaulted credit card accounts from creditors. Mr. Shaffer said that the SPVs purchase the accounts and Unifund is the \"servicer\" on these accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Further, Scott Walther, another Unifund vice-president, testified as to how defaulted accounts are purchased. He said Unifund acquires portfolios of defaulted credit card accounts with funds invested by one or more of the SPVs. He said that when the SPV(s) contribute funds for the purchase of a portfolio of defaulted accounts from a creditor, this is considered an investment. When Unifund purchases a portfolio of defaulted accounts, the accounts in the purchased portfolio are transferred to the balance sheets of the investing SPVs by a process that Unifund refers to as \"marking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Mr. Walther said that when a payment comes in on an account, either in collection proceedings or in a later sale of the account, the proceeds are placed into a trust account. The funds are then split between Unifund and the SPV (as a return\n   on its investment) and the SPV pays a collection fee to Unifund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In this case, the SPV that invested the funds to purchase Ms. Piaser's account was Portfolio E. After the acquisition of this account, Unifund transferred or \"marked\" it to Portfolio E, and thereafter any funds collected on Ms. Piaser's account would have been given to Portfolio E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Ms. Piaser argued that Unifund's act of \"marking\" or transferring the accounts it purchased to the SPVs (whose funds were used to purchase them) resulted in a transfer of ownership of the account to the SPV. As a result, she argued that before Unifund could sue her, Unifund was required, but failed, to obtain an assignment of the account from Portfolio E that complied with R.C. 1319.12. She said Unifund failed to produce in discovery any assignment from Portfolio E of Ms. Piaser's account. She argued that because her account was never assigned to Unifund, its allegation in the complaint that it was entitled to sue on her account in its own name was a misrepresentation and, thus, a violation of the FDCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In a separate motion for sanctions, Ms. Piaser argued she has been unable to determine the exact interest Unifund transferred by way of \"marking\" her account to Portfolio E. She said this is due to Unifund's failure to comply with the court's prior discovery order requiring it to provide documents aimed at determining the interest Portfolio E received as a result of Unifund marking Ms. Piaser's account to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Unifund filed a brief in opposition to Ms. Piaser's motion to certify, arguing that it, i.e., Unifund, owns and holds title to Ms. Piaser's account and that, as a result, Unifund was not required to obtain an assignment in order to sue her on the account. In support, Unifund attached a bill of sale showing it purchased Ms. Piaser's account from Providian; however, the bill of sale from Providian to Unifund sheds no light on what interest, if any, was acquired by Portfolio E in the account as a result of Unifund's later transfer or marking the account to Portfolio E in exchange for Unifund's use of its funds to purchase the account. Unifund argued that marking an account has nothing to do with who holds title to the account. Instead, marking simply designates which SPV will receive a portion of collected funds from the account as a return on the funds the SPV invested to purchase the portfolio containing the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 17} On December 6, 2016, the trial court entered judgment partially granting Ms. Piaser's motion for class certification. However, the court found Ms. Piaser's definition of the class to be overbroad and modified it to read as follows (with the court's additional language in bold): \"At the time of filing of the lawsuit, an entity other than [Unifund] held the right, in whole or part, to receive the money that was sought to be collected through the lawsuit,\n   <strong>\n    and [Unifund] did not meet the FDCPA requirements to lawfully file suit to collect the debt in its own name.\"\n   </strong>\n   (Emphasis in original.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The court also granted in part Ms. Piaser's motion for sanctions. Unifund argued that, because it did not consider Portfolio E as the owner of Ms. Piaser's account, in its view, it was not required to produce the documents listed in the court's discovery order. The court rejected Unifund's interpretation of the court's order, and found that the issue of Portfolio E's ownership interest in Ms. Piaser's account was the \"crux\" of this case and again ordered Unifund to turn over the requested documents within 45 days. These included (1) the servicing agreement Unifund entered into with Portfolio E, (2) the\n   <em>\n    accounting documents demonstrating Portfolio E's interest in Ms. Piaser's account\n   </em>\n   , and the (3)\n   <em>\n    transfer documents showing the rights of the parties during the initial investment and during the \"marking\" process\n   </em>\n   . After both parties appealed in part the court's class-certification judgment, the trial court entered a stay of proceedings pending further order and the record does not show whether Unifund has complied with the court's discovery order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Unifund appeals the trial court's judgment, asserting the following for its sole assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 20} \"The trial court abused its discretion by granting Ms. Piaser's motion to certify an incompetence class.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 21} As a preliminary matter, the trial court's judgment was a final order because it was an order that determined whether the action may be maintained as a class action. R.C. 2505.02(B)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On appeal, the parties essentially repeat the arguments they made below. Ms. Piaser argues that, as a result of Unifund's practice of marking, the SPVs that invested in the purchase of the defaulted accounts have a right to the collection proceeds, with Unifund receiving a collection service fee. She argues the relationship between Unifund and the SPVs makes the SPVs the owners of the accounts and Unifund a debt collector subject to the FDCPA. She argues Unifund's practice of filing suit in its own name without obtaining an assignment from the SPVs in compliance with R.C. 1319.12 when one or more of the SPVs own the accounts violates the FDCPA by using false or misleading representations in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In opposition, Unifund argues that it is the owner of the account and, thus, was not required to have an assignment in order to sue on the account. Unifund argues that, although Ms. Piaser's account was marked to Portfolio E, that did not make this SPV the owner of the account because, in Unifund's view, marking is not the same as transferring title to the account. Unifund argues that marking the account simply designates which SPV will receive the revenue from the account as a return on the funds the SPV invested to purchase the account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that \"[a] trial judge has broad discretion in determining whether a class action may be maintained and that determination will not be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Marks v.

The district court dismissed the complaint, but, on appeal, the Sixth District reversed. The court held the mortgage debtor's allegation that the law firm filed the foreclosure action claiming ownership of the mortgage by the bank before it received the transfer-of-ownership documents was sufficient to state a claim for material misrepresentation under the FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692e ), even if state law permitted the client to anticipate that it would become the title-holder after the foreclosure action was initiated, but before it became final.

Unifund faults the trial court for not making a \"rigorous analysis\" concerning whether Portfolio E or Unifund owns Ms. Piaser's account. However,\n   <em>\n    Unifund cannot fairly make this argument because it failed to comply with the trial court's discovery order to produce documents pertinent to this issue\n   </em>\n   . While Unifund's principals provided testimony supporting Ms. Piaser's position, without Unifund's compliance with the court-ordered document production, the trial court was unable to determine at the certification stage whether the marking process resulted in the transfer of ownership to Portfolio E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Unifund acknowledges the trial court found in its judgment that Ms. Piaser is a member of the class because her account was marked to an SPV like those of other class members and that whether that proves to be a FDCPA violation is an unresolved question for the trier of fact that survived summary judgment. However,\n   Unifund argues Ms. Piaser was required to prove Unifund does not own the account in order to be a member of the class. Again, Unifund's argument is disingenuous because it hindered Ms. Piaser in making such showing by failing to comply with the court's order that it produce its documents that bear on this issue. After Unifund complies with the court's discovery order, the issue will be decided at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 56}\n   <strong>\n    NUMEROSITY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Unifund does not dispute the court's finding that the class identified by Ms. Piaser is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.
