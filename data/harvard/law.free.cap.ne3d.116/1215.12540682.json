Tavares, appeals from a judgment of a single justice of this court denying his petition pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. We affirm.</p><p id=\"p-9\">Tavares was convicted by a jury \"of possessing counterfeit currency, uttering a counterfeit note, and larceny by false pretenses of property not exceeding $ 250 in value.\" <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Tavares</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074740\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/87/471/#p471\">87 Mass. App. Ct. 471</extracted-citation>, 471, <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20N.E.3d%201167\">31 N.E.3d 1167</extracted-citation> (2015). The Appeals Court affirmed his convictions, <em>id</em>. at 475, <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20N.E.3d%201167\">31 N.E.3d 1167</extracted-citation>, and this court denied further appellate review, <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Tavares</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=472%20Mass.%201106\">472 Mass. 1106</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20N.E.3d%2031\">36 N.E.3d 31</extracted-citation> (2015). Years later, Tavares filed a petition in the county court, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking relief from the convictions. He alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal, and that his convictions were wrongful in myriad aspects. The single justice denied the petition without a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-10\">The single justice correctly denied relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, because there are adequate alternative routes available to Tavares to seek and obtain review of his claims. See, e.g., <em>Norris</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3731379\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/447/1007/#p1007\">447 Mass. 1007</extracted-citation>, 1007, <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=849%20N.E.2d%20819\">849 N.E.2d 819</extracted-citation> (2006) ; <em>Maza</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1027941\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/423/1006/#p1006\">423 Mass. 1006</extracted-citation>, 1006, <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=667%20N.E.2d%201146\">667 N.E.2d 1146</extracted-citation> (1996). The errors raised in the petition either were or could have been raised in his direct appeal from his convictions in the Appeals Court. See <em>Tavares</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074740\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/87/471/#p471\">87 Mass. App. Ct. at 471</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20N.E.3d%201167\">31 N.E.3d 1167</extracted-citation>. See <em>Doyle</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362400\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/1002/#p1003\">472 Mass. 1002</extracted-citation>, 1003, <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.3d%201256\">32 N.E.3d 1256</extracted-citation> (2015). The fact that he did not receive relief does not render the ordinary appellate process inadequate for purposes of G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. See <em>Saade</em> v. <em>Price</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536925\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/108/469/#p1024\">480 Mass. 1024</extracted-citation>, 1024, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536925\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/108/469/#p1024\">108 N.E.3d 469</extracted-citation> (2018) ; <em>Votta</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993870\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/1013/#p1013\">435 Mass. 1013</extracted-citation>, 1013, <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=760%20N.E.2d%20733\">760 N.E.2d 733</extracted-citation> (2002). Tavares also may raise challenges to his convictions, including his claims concerning the constitutional effectiveness of counsel, jury instructions, and violation of his right against double jeopardy because the same evidence or conduct formed the basis for multiple convictions, by filing a motion for postconviction relief in the District Court, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, as appearing in <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20Mass.%201501\">435 Mass. 1501</extracted-citation> (2001), and by appealing from any adverse ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Sabree</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548992\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/1124/#p1007\">479 Mass. 1006</extracted-citation>, 1007, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548992\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/1124/#p1007\">91 N.E.3d 1124</extracted-citation> (2018) ; <em>Souza</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802969,6803003\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/1016/\">473 Mass. 1016</extracted-citation>, 1016, <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20N.E.3d%20157\">50 N.E.3d 157</extracted-citation> (2015) ; <em>Doyle</em>, <em>supra</em> at 1002-1003, <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=32%20N.E.3d%201256\">32 N.E.3d 1256</extracted-citation>.

The single justice neither erred nor abused his discretion in denying the petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-15\">The single justice also denied Tavares's motion for appointment of counsel. Tavares alleges no abuse of discretion or other error by the single justice in denying the requested relief.</p><p id=\"p-16\">Tavares's claim that double jeopardy principles excuse him from pursuing the alternative remedy provided by Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 is unfounded. With exceptions not relevant here, a defendant who prevails on direct appeal or through allowance of a motion for a new trial is placed \"under continuing jeopardy during the pendency of the prosecution, rather than ... at risk of double jeopardy.\" <em>Commonwealth</em> v. <em>Resende</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12462664\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/476/141/#p146\">476 Mass. 141</extracted-citation>, 146-147, <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20N.E.3d%201148\">65 N.E.3d 1148</extracted-citation> (2017).
