Williams, an African-American man, was charged with possession of a class B substance with the intent to distribute pursuant to G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). During jury selection, over the defendant's objection, the judge excused for cause a prospective juror who stated that she believed that \"the system is rigged against young African American males.\" The defendant subsequently was convicted and now appeals, claiming that the judge abused his discretion in dismissing the prospective juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Our jurisprudence regarding how to assess beliefs or opinions expressed by prospective jurors during voir dire has been less than clear. Accordingly, we take this opportunity to set forth the factors that a judge should consider when a prospective juror discloses a belief or opinion based on his or her world view. We conclude that although the voir dire was incomplete, it did not prejudice this defendant. Thus, we affirm the conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . During jury selection, the judge asked questions of the entire venire, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[Y]ou've been read a copy of the complaint which charges [the defendant], which is just an allegation, that he possessed [a] class B controlled substance, cocaine, with the intent to distribute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Is there anything about the subject matter or your views about the subject matter that would affect your ability to be fair and impartial in deciding the case?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prospective juror no. 15 (prospective juror), among other potential jurors, answered in the affirmative. Subsequently, the judge and the prospective juror had the following exchange at sidebar:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Q\n   </em>\n   .: \"I believe you might have answered a question affirmatively. Was that a -- a hardship question?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE CLERK : \"No.... It was on fair and impartial ...

Step over there for a minute.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When the prospective juror stepped away from the sidebar, the Commonwealth requested that she be excused for cause and the following discussion ensued between the judge and the parties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE PROSECUTOR : \"I ask that she be excused for cause.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE JUDGE : \"Okay. What do you say?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL : \"Judge, I'm objecting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"I mean there -- there's -- the drug -- the issues regarding the mass incarceration of young African American males has been all over the news. Everybody has read about it. This is -- she has a little more information, but she did say she could be impartial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"And by the way, he's not a juvenile. He's an adult.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE JUDGE : \"Yeah. But he's a youthful looking guy, and she says she's going to have trouble. She hesitated quite a bit,\n   Counsel, and I -- I -- I find on the record that she really struggled with it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"She said I'll try to and then that --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"I'm going to let her go for cause. I think -- \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The judge thereafter excused the prospective juror for cause. By the end of jury selection, the Commonwealth and the defendant each had one remaining peremptory challenge. Ultimately, the jury found the defendant guilty. We granted the defendant's application for direct appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues on appeal that it was error to dismiss the prospective juror for cause because neither her work experience nor her belief that the criminal justice system is unfair to African-American men rendered her unfit to serve, and further that the dismissal was prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We agree that holding particular beliefs about how African-American men are treated in the criminal justice system should not be automatically disqualifying. See\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12320810\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/170/182/#p187\">\n    170 A.3d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187 (D.C. 2017). However, that is not what happened here. The judge undertook to determine whether, given her opinion about the criminal justice system, the prospective juror could nevertheless be an\n   impartial juror in the trial of an African-American man. However, the voir dire ultimately was incomplete because the judge did not inquire further to determine whether, given the prospective juror's beliefs based on her life experiences, she nevertheless could fairly evaluate the evidence and follow the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Instead, the judge decided that the prospective juror was not able to be impartial because she expressed uncertainty about being able to \"put aside\" her beliefs and experiences and because she acknowledged that she would look at the case \"differently\" due to her experiences. As discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , a judge in this situation should focus not on a prospective juror's ability to put aside his or her beliefs formed as a result of life experiences, but rather on whether that juror, given his or her life experiences and resulting beliefs, is able to listen to the evidence and apply the law as provided by the judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A judge's discretion in this realm, although broad, is rooted in determining a prospective juror's impartiality based on the juror's answers in a sufficiently thorough voir dire. Because the voir dire of the prospective juror here did not address whether she could\n   fairly evaluate the evidence and apply the law given her belief regarding the justice system, the judge's assessment of her ability to be a fair and impartial juror was incomplete. However, because we conclude that the defendant was not prejudiced as a result, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Standard\n   </em>\n   . A criminal defendant is entitled to a trial by an impartial jury pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.

That is, each juror must be \"impartial as to the persons involved and unprejudiced and uncommitted as to the defendant['s] guilt or past misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ricard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"302641\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/355/509/#p512\">\n    355 Mass. 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=246%20N.E.2d%20433\">\n    246 N.E.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969). General Laws c. 234A, \u00a7 67A, addresses the situation when a prospective juror indicates that he or she may not be able to be impartial, stating in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"To determine whether a juror stands indifferent in the case, if it appears that, as a result of the impact of considerations which may cause a decision to be made in whole or in part upon issues extraneous to the case, including, but not limited to, community attitudes, possible exposure to potentially prejudicial material or possible preconceived opinions toward the credibility of certain classes of persons, the juror may not stand indifferent, the court shall, or the parties or their attorneys may, with the permission and under the direction of the court, examine the juror specifically with respect to such considerations, attitudes, exposure, opinions or any other matters which may cause a decision to be made in whole or in part upon issues extraneous to the issues in the case.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Thus, if it appears that a juror might not stand indifferent, the judge must hold an individual voir dire, the scope of which is within the judge's sound discretion.

A judge should not assume that a prospective juror is unable to be impartial merely because he or she expressed uncertainty about being able to put aside his or her firmly held beliefs. Instead, an otherwise qualified prospective juror should only be excused for cause if, given his or her experiences and resulting beliefs, the judge concludes that the prospective juror is unable to fairly evaluate the evidence presented and properly apply the law.

And I know from that experience that there are times, with the benefit of additional thought and the wisdom of hindsight, in which a judge will recognize that a discussion with a juror could have been handled more artfully. We have no template for such questioning; nor would it make sense to attempt to create one because there are so many different ways that prospective jurors may share their concerns about the risk of possible bias. Addressing such concerns is necessarily improvisational, and therefore often imperfect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   It is with the benefit of this trial court experience that I examine whether the judge abused his discretion in excusing this prospective juror for cause, recognizing that we \"afford a trial judge a large degree of discretion in the jury selection process.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vann Long\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823709\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/419/798/#p802\">\n    419 Mass. 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=647%20N.E.2d%201162\">\n    647 N.E.2d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Every prospective juror brings his or her opinions, beliefs, and life experience to the court house when asked to perform juror service.

Opinions about the proper balance between the needs of\n   law enforcement and the protection of civil liberties in a criminal case, about defensive medicine in a medical malpractice case, or about the prevalence of racism in a discrimination case, for instance, could provide reason for further individual questioning. And while we do not expect people to transform into blank slates upon taking a seat in the jury box, dismissal for cause is appropriate where the judge, after evaluating a prospective juror's responses to voir dire questions, reasonably concludes that a belief or opinion will cloud that juror's ability fairly to evaluate the evidence and follow the court's instructions.

Under such circumstances, it was certainly appropriate for the judge to explore through individual voir dire whether this juror would, in fact, be fair and impartial. See G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 67A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   I infer from the judge's questions that he wanted to be assured that the juror would decide the case based solely on the evidence, and that her fact finding would not be unfairly influenced by her opinion and life experience. The judge began his questioning by asking whether the prospective juror felt that she might have a bias in the case. When the juror answered in the affirmative and expressed her view that \"the system is rigged against young African American males,\" the judge proceeded to ask whether her belief might interfere with her ability to be fair and impartial. \"I don't think so,\" the juror responded. The judge followed up on this response, asking whether the juror thought she would be able to \"put aside that opinion and bias.\" When the juror told the judge that she did not think she could \"put it aside\" and that her belief was \"the lens that [she] view[ed] the world through,\" the judge informed the juror that she was \"going to have to be able to put that out of [her] mind and look at only the evidence.\" It is not clear from this instruction whether the judge -- who properly emphasized the importance of looking only at the evidence -- was directing the juror to set aside any preconceived notions that may affect her ability fairly to consider the evidence in\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case or to set aside the \"lens\" through which she viewed the world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   While asking a juror to set aside preexisting opinions regarding a particular case or set of circumstances is proper, see\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548629\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/90/722/#p819\">\n    478 Mass. at 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548629\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/90/722/#p819\">\n    90 N.E.3d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , I agree with the court that it would be improper to instruct a juror to set aside his or her life experiences or beliefs more broadly.

A juror certainly may not be excused for cause solely because he or she believes that the criminal justice system disfavors African-American defendants.
