Rule 2:21 (2). The rule does not apply here, because a final judgment has entered in the summary process case in the Housing Court. See\n      <em>\n       Carrington\n      </em>\n      v.\n      <em>\n       Commonwealth\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802953\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/1015/#p1015\">\n       473 Mass. 1015\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , 1015,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20N.E.3d%20746\">\n       41 N.E.3d 746\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (2015). Regardless, Briscoe's filings make it abundantly clear that she had avenues available to her to pursue relief from the Housing Court orders and judgment other than by means of the petitions that she filed in this court. To the extent she alleged that the underlying orders and judgment contain mistakes or were based on a lack of jurisdiction, she could have filed a motion pursuant to Rule 11(b) of the Uniform Summary Process Rules (1980) and Mass.
