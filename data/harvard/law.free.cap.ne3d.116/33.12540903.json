We affirm.</p><p id=\"p-8\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"34\" href=\"#p34\" id=\"p34\">*34</a>The petitions Briscoe filed in the county court center on her claim that the Housing Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction in the summary process matter because the subject rental property was held in trust for her. In denying Briscoe relief, the single justice observed, among other things, that she failed to demonstrate the absence of an adequate alternative remedy. It is on that basis that we affirm the single justice's judgment.</p><p id=\"p-9\">The case is now before us on Briscoe's memorandum and appendix pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended, <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=434%20Mass.%201301\">434 Mass. 1301</extracted-citation> (2001), which requires a party challenging an interlocutory ruling of the trial court to \"set forth the reasons why review of the trial court decision cannot adequately be obtained on appeal from any final adverse judgment in the trial court or by other available means.\" S.J.C. Rule 2:21 (2). The rule does not apply here, because a final judgment has entered in the summary process case in the Housing Court. See <em>Carrington</em> v. <em>Commonwealth</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802953\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/1015/#p1015\">473 Mass. 1015</extracted-citation>, 1015, <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20N.E.3d%20746\">41 N.E.3d 746</extracted-citation> (2015). Regardless, Briscoe's filings make it abundantly clear that she had avenues available to her to pursue relief from the Housing Court orders and judgment other than by means of the petitions that she filed in this court. To the extent she alleged that the underlying orders and judgment contain mistakes or were based on a lack of jurisdiction, she could have filed a motion pursuant to Rule 11(b) of the Uniform Summary Process Rules (1980) and Mass. R. Civ. P. 60, <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20828\">365 Mass. 828</extracted-citation> (1974), and, if necessary, appealed from any adverse ruling on such a motion.

She also could have obtained review of the orders and judgment through the ordinary process of a direct appeal.
