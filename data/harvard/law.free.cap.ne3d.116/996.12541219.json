Defendant argues that the circuit should have permitted him to withdraw his guilty plea because plea counsel failed to advise him of shoeprint evidence prior to the plea, and plea counsel labored under a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   conflict of interest. Defendant also argues that the matter should be remanded for new postplea proceedings in strict compliance with Illinois Supreme Court Rule 604(d) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Defendant, along with four co-defendants, was charged with two counts of first degree murder ( 720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)(2), (a)(3) (West 2008) ) for causing the death of John Rosales by shooting Rosales with a handgun. Defendant and the four co-defendants were also charged with home invasion (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-11(a)(3), (a)(5) ) and armed robbery (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 18-2(a) ). Defendant alone was charged with an additional count of home invasion (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-11(a)(5) ). Assistant Public Defenders Edward Jaquays and Gabriel Guzman were appointed to represent defendant. Jaquays worked part\n   time as a public defender and part time in private practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 Defendant filed a motion to suppress statements that he made to the police. The trial court denied the motion. During several pretrial hearings, including the hearing on the motion to suppress, Nicole Moore was one of the assistant state's attorneys who appeared on behalf of the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 The matter proceeded to a stipulated bench trial. The court found defendant guilty of first degree murder and sentenced defendant to 70 years' imprisonment. On appeal, we reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    People v.

On the day a jury trial was set to commence, one of the assistant state's attorneys informed the court that Nicole Moore was an associate in Jaquays's private law office at that time. The assistant state's attorney asked that defendant waive the conflict on the record. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"THE COURT: [Defendant], would you approach, sir? Would you approach with your attorney over here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * * I think that is a point that we should consider both for your sake and for Mr. Jaquays' sake.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   It's my understanding, [defendant], obviously I wasn't involved in the first trial, that one of the prosecutors on that trial was a lady, a female attorney named Nicole Moore. She was a prosecutor on the matter. And Miss Moore is now an associate with Mr. Jaquays; do you understand that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: And what the prosecutor is asking you is does that bother you in any way, shape or form that-I understand that Mr. Jaquays is representing you as a Public Defender, is that right, sir?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [JAQUAYS]: Yes, Judge, I am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: And that she is part of his private law office, which is separate and apart, but we still would like to put on the record that you don't have any problem with that if you don't; is that all right with you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I mean not really.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: Stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: He never talked to me about none of this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: Mr. Jaquays, here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to ask you to speak about this situation to [defendant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Defendant], nobody wants to put you in a situation where you are uncomfortable, at least of all Mr. Jaquays, so I'm going to give you a few minutes to speak about that situation that [the prosecutor] has brought up to you and explain to you what's going on here and take that minute. Go ahead. Take whatever time you want.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 7 When the parties went back on the record, the court asked defendant if he still had any concerns. Defendant replied: \"No, I'm fine. He explained to me the situation.\" The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"THE COURT: I'm going to phrase it this way, the fact that Miss Moore at some point I guess, like I said I wasn't involved in this case at that point, was one of the co-prosecutors in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   MR. JAQUAYS: That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [ASSISTANT STATE'S ATTORNEY]: She was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: And she is now part of his private law office; that gives you no concern, sir, you are comfortable?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: Yeah, I'm all right.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 8 The parties selected a jury. The next day, before opening statements, the parties advised the court that they had reached a plea agreement. Defendant agreed to plead guilty to first degree murder in exchange for a sentence of 25 years' imprisonment. The State agreed to amend the indictment to remove the allegation that defendant shot the victim with a handgun so that a mandatory 25-year firearm enhancement would not apply. The State gave the following factual basis for the plea:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"On April 1st of 2008, at approximately midnight, Naperville, Will County, Illinois, John Rosales was in his residence. He had a few friends there with him, including Eric Smith. At that time two individuals forced in the front door and made demand of money. During that time Eric Smith was struck with an object and John Rosales was struck with an object by those two men who forced their way in. That injury to John Rosales caused him to bleed profusely, and moments later after he left the residence Mr. Rosales died as a result of those injuries. This all occurred in Will County, Illinois.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Subsequently, a man by the name of Justin Harper was interviewed. He did give officers a statement stating that this defendant, along with a codefendant, had come to his residence prior to the forced entry into John Rosales's residence and asked to borrow a weapon. They also indicated to Mr. Harper what they intended to do. Based on that, Mr. Harper gave that statement to the investigators in this case, and this defendant was charged with murder.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court asked defendant if he agreed that the State would be able to present such evidence, and defendant said yes. After admonishing defendant, the court accepted his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 9 Approximately two weeks later, defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Defendant's motion alleged that his plea counsel operated under a conflict of interest and provided ineffective assistance. After conducting a preliminary\n   <em>\n    Krankel\n   </em>\n   inquiry, the court denied defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On appeal, we reversed and remanded for a new\n   <em>\n    Krankel\n   </em>\n   hearing before a different judge without the State's adversarial participation.\n   <em>\n    People v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   , No. 3-14-0417 (2016) (unpublished minute order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 10 On remand, the court held a new\n   <em>\n    Krankel\n   </em>\n   inquiry and appointed a Michelle Hansen to represent defendant in his postplea proceedings. Hansen, on behalf of defendant, filed an amended motion to withdraw guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 11 A hearing was held on the amended motion. Daren Jackson testified that defendant was his sister's child's father. Daren stated that he was in the courtroom on the day that defendant pled guilty. Daren was sitting near the counsel bench. Daren overheard the state's attorney and defense counsel discussing defendant's case. The state's attorney said he had a witness who would testify that she tested footprints, and the footprints did not match defendant. The state's attorney told defense counsel that he wanted to let him know that because he did not put it in his report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 12 Defendant testified that on the day his second trial was set to commence, his attorneys' investigator informed him that the State had offered him 35 years' imprisonment. Defendant rejected the offer and said he wanted to go to trial. Defendant's attorneys negotiated with the prosecutors for about an hour. The State's offer went\n   down, but defendant told his attorneys that he did not want to plead guilty. Defendant's attorneys told him that if he did not take the State's offer, he would spend the rest of his life in jail. Defendant testified that his attorneys never showed him or discussed with him any laboratory results concerning shoeprints or gunshot residue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 13 Defendant testified that the court asked him a series of questions prior to his guilty plea. When the court asked him if he was pleading freely and voluntarily, defendant initially told the court that he was forced. The court then rephrased the question. Defendant just stood there for a few minutes. The judge then looked at defense counsel and the prosecutor. The court said the jury would come in. Defendant \"said something to [his] lawyer on the side.\" Defendant could not remember everything, but said he eventually \"pleaded out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 14 Defendant testified that when he answered the court's questions during the plea colloquy, he did so out of fear. Defendant said that he never really wanted to plead guilty. Defendant stated: \"I wanted to go to trial and Jaquays and Guzman guaranteed a conviction. They told me if I don't take this time, I am getting the rest of my life in jail. I was forced.\" Defendant believed that \"[n]obody was going to fight for [him]\" if he went to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 15 Guzman testified that he and Jaquays were appointed to represent defendant on a first degree murder charge. Jaquays was the first chair attorney. Guzman worked at the public defender's office at that time. Eventually, the matter was set for a jury trial. Guzman and Jaquays selected a jury, and the trial was set to commence the next day. The morning the trial was to begin, Jaquays negotiated a plea agreement with the State in which the State agreed to a sentence of 25 years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 16 That same morning, the prosecutor informed Guzman that the evidence technician who was going to testify regarding ballistics was also going to testify that a shoe imprint that was taken at the crime scene did not match defendant. Guzman and Jaquays had not previously received written reports concerning that information. Guzman believed that he and Jaquays discussed the matter in front of defendant, but Guzman did not recall ever taking defendant aside and explaining what the prosecutor had told them. Guzman testified that he would have used the shoeprint evidence at trial, but he did not believe it carried much weight. Guzman stated that the alleged facts of the case were that there were multiple people inside the victim's residence, including four codefendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 17 Guzman did not recall anything unusual about defendant's plea. Guzman noted that defendant did not answer all of the court's questions immediately, but did so eventually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 18 Guzman testified that Moore formerly worked for the state's attorney's office. Before defendant's first trial, Moore represented the State during the proceedings on the motion to suppress defendant's statements to the police. Guzman did not inform defendant that Moore subsequently became an employee of Jaquays. Guzman did not believe that Jaquays informed defendant either. The State informed the court that Moore worked for Jaquays. Guzman and Jaquays then discussed the matter with defendant off the record, and defendant decided to proceed with Jaquays and Guzman as counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 19 Guzman testified that he never threatened defendant that he would get life imprisonment if he did not plead guilty. Guzman told defendant that if he was found guilty following trial, he would likely receive the same sentence he received\n   following the first trial, which was 70 years' imprisonment. Guzman believed that Jaquays \"did tell [defendant] in different manners and different words that [he was] going to do the rest of [his] life.\" Guzman stated that Jaquays said this because defendant was likely to receive a sentence so long that it would exceed his life expectancy. Guzman stated that Jaquays did not threaten defendant. Rather, Jaquays explained that a long prison sentence was a risk of going forward with a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 20 The court denied the motion to withdraw guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 21 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 22 I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 23 Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw guilty plea because he received ineffective assistance of plea counsel. Specifically, defendant contends that that plea counsel \"failed to explain exculpatory shoe print evidence to defendant prior to his pleading guilty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 24 We review challenges to guilty pleas based on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Contrary to defendant's argument on appeal, the shoeprint evidence would not have lent \"crucial weight to his defense that he was not involved in the offense.\" The shoeprint would have only shown that someone else's shoeprint was found on the door to the victim's residence. This was not inconsistent with the State's theory of the offense. When giving the factual basis for defendant's plea, the prosecutor stated that two individuals forced their way into the victim's residence. Presumably, the State would have argued that the shoeprint belonged to a codefendant. Guzman testified that he did not believe the shoeprint evidence carried much weight because there were multiple people inside the victim's residence, including four codefendants. Because the shoeprint evidence would have been of very little significance at a trial, there is no reasonable probability that defendant would have not pleaded guilty and insisted on going to trial if counsel had explained the shoeprint evidence to him prior to his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 27 II. Conflict of Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 28 Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because Jaquays labored under a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   conflict of interest, and defendant never validly waived the\n   conflict. The parties agree that Jaquays labored under a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   conflict of interest in that Moore, a former assistant state's attorney who represented the State during the pretrial proceedings prior to defendant's stipulated bench trial, worked for Jaquays's private law office at the time of the plea. However, the parties dispute whether defendant validly waived this conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 29 \"The fundamental right to effective assistance of counsel requires that defendants be afforded counsel who is free of conflicting interests.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.

For example, \"form\" can mean (1) \"[t]he outer shape, structure, or configuration of something, as distinguished from its substance or matter\"; (2) \"[a] model; a sample; an example\"; (3) \"[t]he customary method of drafting legal documents, usu[ally] with fixed words, phrases, and sentences\"; or (4) \"[a] legal document with blank spaces to be filled in by the drafter.\" Black's Law Dictionary 767 (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 44 We believe that the first definition best fits the meaning of the word \"form\" as used in Rule 604(d). Stated another way, we believe that the directive \"[t]he certificate of counsel shall\n   <em>\n    be in the following form\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ( Ill. S. Ct. R. 604(d) (eff. Mar. 8, 2016) ) meant that the certificate shall be in the general format of the preprinted certificate, not that the certificate was required to track the word-for-word language of the preprinted certificate. Notably, Rule 604(d) did not say that \"the certificate shall\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   the following\n   form\" or \"the certificate shall use the following wording verbatim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 45 Our interpretation of the version of Rule 604(d) in effect at the time of defendant's postplea proceedings is consistent with the current version of Rule 604(d). The rule has been amended such that the phrase \"[t]he certificate of counsel shall be in the following form\" has been removed. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 604(d) (eff. July 1, 2017).

Rather, we look to the record only to note the readily-apparent fact that no sentencing hearing was held. In this situation, it would be a far greater waste of judicial resources to remand this matter to the trial court for counsel to certify that she reviewed a transcript that does not exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 52 CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b6 53 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 54 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Justices McDade and O'Brien concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
