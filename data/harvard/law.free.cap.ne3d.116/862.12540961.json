For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In February 2017, Carty, a Navy veteran, was charged in Case No. CR-17-613832-A with the following two counts: Count 1 charged him with operating a vehicle while under the influence (\"OVI\"), with a specification that Carty has been convicted or pled guilty to five or more equivalent offenses within the previous 20 years; and Count 2 charged Carty with failure to comply. These charges arose from a traffic stop in Berea, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} While out on bail, Carty was arrested by North Royalton Police after he failed field sobriety tests administered during a traffic stop on May 4, 2017. Subsequently, Carty was charged in Case No. CR-17-617208-A with two counts. Count 1 charged him with OVI, which carried a furthermore specification stating that he had a prior OVI conviction; and Count 2 charged him with failure to comply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Trial for CR-17-613832-A was set for May 17, 2017. On May 10, 2017, a hearing was held where the state put on the record its plea offer. In exchange for a guilty plea to Count 1, a third-degree felony OVI, the state would nolle Count 2. The state also notified the court that Carty received another OVI a few days prior to that hearing. The court continued the matter to May 17, 2017, so that defense counsel could determine if the cases could be combined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At the outset of the hearing on May 17, 2017, defense counsel stated that a probation officer had advised Carty the day before that he could apply to Veterans Treatment Court. Defense counsel then requested that the matter be transferred to veterans court. The state objected because it was the day of trial. The trial court denied Carty's request, and the matter proceeded to a plea hearing. The trial court conducted its Crim.R. 11 colloquy, accepted Carty's guilty plea, and found him guilty of OVI as charged in the indictment. The trial court nolled Count 2. The court then referred Carty for a presentence investigation report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court reconvened in August 2017, at which time it addressed both of Carty's cases. At the hearing, Carty entered a no contest plea in CR-17-617208-A. Carty was assigned the public defender's office to represent him in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Carty was represented by different counsel in CR-17-613832-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} As the trial court conducted its Crim.R. 11 colloquy with regard to Case No. CR-17-617208-A, the court had an off-the-record discussion with the attorneys involved. The court then returned to the record and stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court took a recess to review the penalties for the charges of which the defendant has been indicted in Case Number 617208 and 613832 * * * and has conducted research on the potential penalties in light of the indictment in each case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   So based on that, I am going to re-plea the defendant in Case Number 613832 to ensure that he has been properly advised of all of the penalties involved prior to him pleading guilty. And then in 617208, my understanding is he's going to enter a plea of no contest. So I will re-plea him in 613832 and plea him in 617208 and then go to sentencing. So I will take the pleas prior to the sentencing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Defense counsel in each case did not object, and the trial court proceeded with its Crim.R. 11 colloquy. The state then outlined the potential penalty involved in pleading guilty to Count 1 (third-degree felony OVI, with the added specification) in CR-17-613832-A. The state explained that the sentence was 60 days up to 36 months, plus one, two, three, four, or five years of prison to be served prior and consecutive to any of the third-degree penalties or fourth-degree penalties. With regard to CR-17-617208-A, the stated explained that the penalty for Count 1 (third-degree felony OVI, with a furthermore clause) was 60 days up to 36 months and 6 to 18 months on Count 2 (failure to comply), which must be served consecutive to any other penalty. The trial court informed Carty of the fines associated with both cases. The trial court accepted Carty's pleas and found him guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court then sentenced Carty in both cases to a total of seven years in prison. In CR-17-613832-A, the trial court sentenced Carty to two years on Count 1, to be served consecutive to the two-year sentence on the specification, for a total of four years in prison. The court ordered that the sentence in that case be served consecutive to the sentence in CR-17-617208-A. In CR-17-617208-A, the trial court sentenced Carty to two years in prison on Count 1 and one year in prison on Count 2, to be served consecutively, for an aggregate of three years in prison. The trial court also ordered Carty to pay a $2,000 fine and imposed a 15-year driver's license suspension in each case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Carty now appeals, raising the following three assignments of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court violated [Carty's] federal and state constitutional rights to due process of law and Crim.R. 11 when it accepted [Carty's] pleas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Carty] was deprived of his federal and state constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court erred in denying [Carty's] motion to transfer his case to Veterans Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Pleas\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In the first assignment of error, Carty argues the court violated his constitutional rights and Crim.R. 11 when it accepted his pleas. Carty claims the trial court did not strictly comply with its duties under Crim.R. 11 at the August 3, 2017\n   hearing and the court's actions at that hearing rendered his plea in CR-17-613832-A invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} When a defendant enters a plea in a criminal case, the plea must be knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. \"Failure on any of those points renders enforcement of the plea unconstitutional under both the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

With regard to that case, Carty was incorrectly advised of his possible sentence at his May 2017 plea hearing. The trial court realized the error at the August 2017 hearing and conducted a new plea. The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court took a recess to review the penalties for the charges of which the defendant has been indicted in Case Number 617208 and 613832 * * * and has conducted research on the potential penalties in light of the indictment in each case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   So based on that, I am going to re-plea the defendant in Case Number 613832 to ensure that he has been properly advised of all of the penalties involved prior to him pleading guilty. * * * So I will re-plea him in 613832[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Defense counsel did not object, and the trial court proceeded with its Crim.R. 11 colloquy. The court advised Carty of the potential penalty involved in pleading guilty to Count 1 (third-degree felony OVI, with the added specification) in CR-17-613832-A. The court stated the sentence was \"60 days of prison up to 36 months that must be run consecutive to Count 2.\" As a result, we find the trial court sufficiently advised Carty of his possible sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Carty additionally claims the court did not inform him of the effects of pleading no contest in CR-17-617208-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   He contends that no showing of prejudice was required to invalidate his plea because the trial court completely failed to advise him that a no contest plea is not an admission of guilt, but rather an admission of truth of the facts alleged in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 27} \" Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(b) requires that a defendant be informed of and understand the effect of a no contest or guilty plea; it does not require a 'rote recitation' of the language of Crim.R. 11(B)(2).\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, with respect to a defendant's right to be informed of and understand the effect of a no contest or guilty plea - unlike other nonconstitutional aspects of Crim.R. 11(C)(2) - \"it is presumed that a defendant who has entered a no contest or guilty plea without asserting actual innocence understands the effects of his or her plea.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%201297603\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In the instant case, while the trial court did not recite the language of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(b), the court did inform Carty of the nature of the charges, the potential penalties he faced and the constitutional rights he was giving up by pleading no contest to the charge in the indictment, including his right to a jury or bench trial, his right to continued representation by counsel through trial, his right to compel witness testimony on his behalf, his right to confront and cross-examine any witnesses that would be called to testify against him and his right not to testify at his trial if he chose not to do so. The trial court further advised Carty that by entering his no contest plea, he was giving up his right to have \"the State prove [him] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial.\" Carty stated that he understood the offenses to which he was pleading no contest and all the rights he was waiving by pleading no contest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Based on the foregoing, the record reflects that Carty was both advised of the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"essence\" of his no contest plea, i.e., that he was permitting the trial court to find him guilty without the opportunity to present a defense, and the negative effects of his no contest plea, i.e., that \"he could be found guilty without going through a trial and that he would be waiving all of his Constitutional trial rights.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Musleh\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, Carty who was represented by counsel at the plea hearing, did not assert his innocence at the plea hearing and there is nothing in the record that suggests that Carty was confused or did not understand that his no contest plea was an admission of the truth of the facts alleged in the indictment. There has been no showing that Carty suffered any prejudice as a result of the trial court's failure to fully comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(b). Where, as here, \"a defendant enters a guilty or no contest plea without asserting actual innocence, a defendant is presumed to understand the effect of the plea such that a trial court's failure to inform the defendant of the effect of his plea is presumed not to be prejudicial.\"\n   <em>\n    Musleh\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Therefore, considering the presumption that applies and the totality of the circumstances, we find that the trial court at least partially complied with the \"effect-of-plea\" requirement under Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(b).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Accordingly, the first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In the second assignment of error, Carty argues defense counsel in CR-17-613832-A was ineffective for: (1) not withdrawing representation after Carty was arrested for another OVI in a municipality where defense counsel serves as assistant prosecutor; (2) \"encouraging\" Carty to plea even though he misadvised Carty that the maximum sentence he could get was \"36 months\"; and (3) not moving the trial court to waive the fines and not filing an affidavit of indigence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Carty must demonstrate that: (1) counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) he was prejudiced by that performance.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

As there is no evidence to suggest a \"reasonable probability\" that the trial court would have found Carty indigent and unable to pay the fine, we cannot say that Carty received ineffective assistance of counsel on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Accordingly, the second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Veterans Treatment Court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In the third assignment of error, Carty argues that the trial court should have granted his motion to transfer his case to Veterans Treatment Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Loc.R. 30.3 of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, General Division states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (A) Purpose. The Veterans Treatment Court is established for defendants * * * who served in the United States Armed Forces. Hereafter, defendant(s) refers to such individuals. The Veterans Treatment Court is committed to providing community services that seek to develop self-sufficiency, reduce recidivism, promote public safety, and provide alternatives to incarceration. To accomplish these purposes, the Veterans Treatment Court will utilize the shared military experience of other veterans to assist these defendants. The Veterans Treatment Court will work closely with the Veterans Administration (VA) and other agencies to accomplish these purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (C) Eligibility. A defendant is eligible for transfer to the Veterans Treatment Court when charged with a felony described in paragraph (D), provided the defendant presents evidence of military service with military form DD 214.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (D) Permitted Felonies. Any felony offense for which a defendant may receive a sentence of community control sanctions (CCS) makes that defendant eligible to transfer to the Veterans Treatment Court, subject to the approval of the Veterans Treatment Court Judge. * * * At any point after arraignment, a defendant\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   be referred to the Veterans Treatment Court, but when a defendant is convicted of or pleads to a felony of the first or second degree, or of the third degree that is subject to high tier sentencing under R.C. 2929.14(A)(3), the assigned Judge shall sentence the defendant before transfer to the Veterans Treatment Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (F) Procedure for Admission. A defendant must enter into a Participation Agreement with the Veterans Treatment Court; must undergo a clinical and administrative assessment to determine eligibility; and must be approved by the Veterans Treatment Court Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (G) Effective of Transfer. When a case is transferred to the Veterans Treatment Court, the Veterans Treatment Court Judge shall acquire full jurisdiction over that transferred case. If a defendant is found ineligible or is not approved for Veterans Treatment Court, the transfer shall not be completed and the case shall be returned to the docket of the original assigned Judge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 42} As an initial matter, we note that the case law in this area is sparse. It is\n   well known that veterans, such as Carty, often suffer from mental illness and substance abuse problems as a result of their experiences serving in the armed forces. Indeed, \"[i]t is an unfortunate truth that many veterans return to civilian life with significant physical and mental traumas that often contribute to their involvement in the criminal justice system.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio v. Dunne\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100460,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-3323\">\n    2014-Ohio-3323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203778311\">\n    2014 WL 3778311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10 (Frank D. Celebrezze, Jr. J., concurring). The goal of Veterans Treatment Court is for veterans to have law-abiding lives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 43} In the instant case, a review of the record reveals that at the hearing on May 17, 2017, defense counsel in CR-17-613832-A stated that the day before, a probation officer advised Carty that he could apply to Veterans Treatment Court. Defense counsel then requested that the matter be transferred to veterans court. The state objected because it was the day of trial. The trial court denied Carty's request, and the matter proceeded to a plea hearing. At the August hearing, the issue of transfer was not brought to the court's attention by either party. The trial court then proceeded with the plea hearing in CR-17-617208-A and replea in CR-17-613832-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 44} While we are most supportive of the purposes of the Veterans Treatment Court, the local rule does not provide for a mandatory transfer. Carty has lengthy record of alcohol-related offenses, which includes several OVI's and he was subject to mandatory prison time. Thus, based on the foregoing, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion when it denied Carty's request for a transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Accordingly, the third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   MELODY J. STEWART, J., and KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, J., CONCUR\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
