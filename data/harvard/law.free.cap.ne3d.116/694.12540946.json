(\"MRI\"), appeals the trial court's judgment in favor of defendant-appellee/cross-appellant, West Oaks Mall FL, L.L.C. For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a determination of attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} MRI is an Ohio-based software company that provides real estate investment and management software. West Oaks owns a mall in Ocoee, Florida, and is a subsidiary of Moonbeam Capital Investments (collectively referred to as \"West Oaks\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2013, West Oaks approached MRI about transitioning its software from its then-current program, QuickBooks, to another management software because West Oaks needed a program that could keep pace with its expanding business. According to West Oaks, it relied on MRI's representations that the software could meet the company's needs; West Oaks was intending to expand the use of real estate software to its other properties. West Oaks required a web-based system, as opposed to a Windows-based system, because it had different users located throughout the United States that would need to access the system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In March 2013, West Oaks entered into a one-year contract with MRI, effective April 1, 2013. The \"Agreement\" consisted of eight documents drafted by MRI. The Agreement also included a three-week\n   express implementation plan, for which West Oaks paid an additional $8,800. But, according to West Oaks, MRI's software was not implemented within three weeks or anytime thereafter. West Oaks continued to use QuickBooks while attempting to implement MRI's software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} West Oaks notified MRI of the problems it was having with its software and requested MRI's assistance multiple times. West Oaks ceased paying its invoices to MRI in July 2013. At that point West Oaks had already paid $23,000 to MRI. In January 2014, MRI sent notice to West Oaks, terminating the contract and accelerating the payments that were due, which totaled $94,432.45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} West Oaks purchased a new software system in January 2014, which it had up and running in three days. In 2015, MRI filed suit against West Oaks alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The case proceeded to a bench trial. Prior to trial, the court granted discovery sanctions in favor of West Oaks and against MRI due to MRI's failure to timely produce discovery documents. After trial, the court issued comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law with judgment in favor of West Oaks on all claims, but provided that each party would bear its own costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} MRI filed a timely notice of appeal, and West Oaks filed a notice of cross-appeal.

Accordingly, following a bench trial, a reviewing court will generally uphold a trial court's judgment as long as the manifest weight of the evidence supports it-that is, as long as \"some\" competent and credible evidence supports it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     No error in interpreting Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} As an initial matter, we note that MRI chose to argue its first two assignments of error together, stating they are \"two sides of the same coin.\" Whether that is the case, the appellate rules state that this court \"may disregard an assignment of error presented for review if the party raising it fails to identify in the record the error on which the assignment of error is based or fails to argue the assignment separately in the brief, as required under App.R. 16(A).\" App.R. 12(A)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because cases should be decided on their merits, however, we will address MRI's first and second assignments of error. Counsel is cautioned that, in the future, the failure to separately argue assignments of error may result in this court declining to address assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In the first and second assignments of error, MRI contends that the trial court erred in interpreting the Agreement in West Oaks' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 15} At trial, West Oaks argued that MRI failed to perform in accordance with the Agreement in the following ways: (1) MRI failed to implement the software in three weeks; (2) MRI did not implement the required \"commercial management\n   and accounts payable solutions in the web platform\"; (3) MRI failed to meet the functional specifications\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the software; and (4) MRI failed to provide software support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Express implementation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The trial court found that MRI failed to complete the express implementation within three weeks or anytime thereafter. The trial court noted that MRI did not even begin the implementation process until four weeks after the effective date of the Agreement and caused further delays. MRI does not contest this finding on appeal; we find that the trial court's findings were supported by competent and credible evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. MRI received actual or constructive notice of \"Errors\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} West Oaks argued and the trial court found that MRI failed to provide a software system in the web platform. The trial court specifically found that MRI was required to \"implement the Commercial Management, Accounts Payable and General Ledger solutions in the Web platform as part of the * * * Express Implementation * * * and failed to do so.\" The trial court also found that the software was essentially unusable for West Oaks' purposes and MRI failed to provide adequate support to fix the software problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Under the parties' agreement, MRI warranted that the software would be free from \"Errors,\" which is defined in the Agreement as \"a material failure of a hosted MRI Software to conform to its Functional Specifications that is reported by Client to and replicable by MRI.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} MRI claims that there were no \"Errors\" within the term of the parties' agreement because West Oaks failed to give proper notice to MRI of any error in the functional specifications, as required by the Agreement. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Pursuant to the Agreement, notices were required to be \"delivered by hand, by overnight courier, or by certified mail, return receipt requested.\" The trial court found that West Oaks emailed MRI about the problems it was having with the software on July 6, July 18, and August 20, 2013, and sent notice via first class mail on September 16, October 22, and November 18, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In response to West Oaks' July 18, 2013 email, MRI assigned a client experience manager to devise a \"game plan\" to address West Oaks' issues with the software. On July 22, 2013, representatives from West Oaks and MRI conducted an online video conference to address West Oaks' issues, but the problems were not resolved. On August 20, 2013, MRI's senior officers and executives were copied on internal emails referencing West Oaks' complaints and the parties conducted a conference call during which West Oaks outlined their ongoing problems with the software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} \"Under Ohio law, failure to comply with a contractual notice provision may be harmless if actual or constructive notice is nonetheless accomplished.\"\n   <em>\n    Simplifi Health Benefit Mgt., L.L.C. v.

Whether those representations were made or not, however, is not germane to the issue of functional specifications. On this point, the parties appear to agree. In other words, the trial court based its findings on evidence other than the alleged pre-contractual representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The trial court in this case did not err in considering parol evidence to interpret the meaning of the contract. Siminyuk's testimony offered the trial court clarification for the terms \"dynamic and flexible reporting\" with regard to the report generation capabilities that MRI's software was to provide to West Oaks. Siminyuk's testimony also explained what \"command of sales data\" meant with respect to the accounting capabilities MRI's software was to offer. Because the contract was ambiguous as to these terms, the trial court did not err in considering evidence outside the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Failure to provide software support\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 31} At trial, West Oaks contended that MRI failed to provide adequate software support. West Oaks' information technologist, Sergey Siminyuk, was designated to lead the implementation process on behalf of the company and work in conjunction with MRI. As mentioned, West Oaks had problems with the software from the onset, but increased the number of licenses on the software from 150 to 600 based on MRI's representation that a more sophisticated division of its company would supervise its account. West Oaks also extended its contract with MRI from one year to five years, based on pricing incentives and MRI's assurances that the implementation issues would be quickly resolved. The problems with the software continued, however, and resulted in: West Oaks sending incorrect statements to tenants, losing a national tenant, opening at least 25 support cases with MRI,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   an inability to bill its tenants or pay invoices out of MRI's software system, and the necessity to use Windows-based, rather than web-based, workarounds, which resulted in lost productivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In light of the above, the trial court's finding that MRI failed to perform its contractual obligations was supported by competent, credible evidence and was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Accordingly, the first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Unjust Enrichment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In the third assignment of error, MRI claims that the trial court erred in failing to find unjust enrichment. In order to succeed on a claim for unjust enrichment, MRI was required to show: (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   a benefit conferred by a plaintiff upon a defendant; (2) knowledge by the defendant of the benefit; and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances where it would be unjust to do so without payment.\n   <em>\n    Just Like Us Family Enrichment Ctr. v.
