Appellant argues it is entitled to enforce a clause in the addendum to the pipeline right of way agreement which said Appellee \"shall be responsible for all other taxes, charges, and market enhancements charged to the flow of gas or liquids from the [named] well pad.\" Appellant believes the court applied the\n   merger by deed doctrine and contends an exception to the doctrine applies; specifically, Appellant asserts the clause was independent and collateral to the right of way agreement. Appellant concludes the conveyance to Gulfport did not extinguish its right to enforce the clause as Appellant reserved the mineral rights. If this argument succeeds, Appellant contests the trial court's alternative holding and asserts Appellee's subsequent release of the right of way cannot eliminate its obligations to Appellant under the disputed clause. As we conclude Appellant's conveyance of the property eliminated its right to enforce the disputed clause in the right of way agreement, we need not reach the alternative argument on the release. The trial court's judgment is hereby affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The sole member of Appellant Hills and Hollers, LLC is Scott Stronz. He entered into a lease with Gulfport Energy Corporation in 2011 over a 78.54 tract (and a smaller tract). He conveyed the property to Appellant in 2014. Five wells drawing from a pooled unit were located at the Stronz well pad which was on Appellant's property. Appellee Ohio Gathering Company, LLC was a midstream company who gathered gas (and liquids) from the wells, compressed it, and transported it to processing facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fees for the service were charged to the producer-lessee (Gulfport) who decreased the royalty to the lessor (Appellant) as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 27, 2015, Appellant executed a right of way agreement granting Appellee a pipeline right of way and an easement over the 78.54 acre tract. The recorded right of way agreement provided the grantee with the right \"at any time to abandon and terminate all or any part of the right-of-way and easement rights granted herein, by filing a release of a same in the county records.\" The grant was binding on the grantor and grantee and \"shall inure to the benefit of their respective heirs, executors, personal representatives, successors and assigns.\" The grantor agreed all consideration due for the right of way and easement had been received, except to the extent any consideration was due upon completion of construction. The agreement said the grantor's failure to comply with any covenant shall not be construed as a breach until the grantee gives written notice and the grantor fails to cure within 30 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The recorded right of way agreement also said the grantee can elect to record the agreement or a memorandum of the agreement. The recorded right of way contained an integration clause (providing no other statements can add to or change the terms of the agreement, which was the entire agreement) and concluded by stating: \"This Right of Way Agreement is made further subject to the terms and provisions contained in that certain unrecorded Addendum by and between GRANTOR and GRANTEE herein, executed of even date herewith.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} This incorporated addendum to the recorded right of way agreement was\n   executed at the same time and specifically reiterated it \"is made a part of\" the right of way agreement. The heading directed it was not to be recorded. The addendum provided for payments of $36,000 for the grant of the right of way and $144,000 as damages for the construction and installation of the initial pipeline (with an estimated total footage of 2,400 feet). The location was defined by two attached exhibits. An additional payment of $180,000 was required before construction of a second pipeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} A numbered list of \"Special Conditions\" in the addendum obligated Appellee to pay $20,000 for a temporary work area and $20,000 for use of an access road; set forth obligations concerning ditches, markers, clearing, grading, reseeding, cleaning, and installing through crops; and prohibited fishing, hunting, and most above-ground appurtenances. Among the special conditions was the following clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   13.\n   <em>\n    Real Estate Taxes and Other Expenses\n   </em>\n   . Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all real estate taxes assessed against Owner's Property. If the applicable taxing authorities increase the taxable value of improvements upon the real estate as a result of the installation of the Pipelines, Grantee agrees to reimburse Owner for the amount of such increase directly attributable to the Pipelines and/or the Easements.\n   <strong>\n    Grantee shall be responsible for all other taxes, charges and market enhancements charged to the flow of gas or liquids from the Scott well pad or Stronz well pad.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Emphasis added) (hereinafter: the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Appellee paid $220,000 to Appellant for the initial pipeline (the sum of $144,000, $36,000, $20,000, and $20,000). Stronz said this pipeline was constructed after Appellant's sale of surface to Gulfport. He said the \"Stronz well pad\" began production before the execution of the March 27, 2015 right of way agreement. The \"Scott well pad\" was not built, and a second pipeline was not constructed under the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 15, 2015, approximately 80 days after executing the right of way agreement, Appellant executed a limited warranty deed conveying to Gulfport the 78.54 acre parcel (and a 27.64 acre parcel) for $800,000. After excepting all previously conveyed coal and mining rights, Appellant's deed to Gulfport provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   EXCEPTING AND RESERVING to the GRANTOR herein by this conveyance, all rights to the oil and gas below the surface of the subject land.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   UNDER AND SUBJECT to any and all exceptions, reservations, restrictions, easements, rights of way, highways, estates, covenants and conditions apparent on the premises or shown by instruments of record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} A purchase and sale agreement was executed the same day, providing for Appellant's sale and Gulfport's purchase of \"the surface estate of the property, subject to the terms and condition set forth in this Agreement.\" It then specified the conveyance of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   the Property, together with all privileges, easements, rights of way and other appurtenant rights relating to the Property, and any existing structures or improvements located on the Property,\n   <em>\n    excluding and reserving to [Appellant] any and all oil, gas, and mineral rights in the Property\n   </em>\n   but specifically including all riparian rights running or otherwise associated with the Property.\n   <em>\n    [Appellant] also reserves and retains the right to receive all sums payable to \"Owner\" with respect to the first and second pipeline damage payment under that certain\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Easement Agreement\n   </em>\n   , between Hills and Hollers Farm, LLC (as \"Owner) and Ohio Gathering Company, L.L.C. (as \"Grantee\") dated as of February 27, 2015. (Emphasis added.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   An integration clause stated the document constituted the entire agreement, and a \"No Merger\" clause provided: \"All warranties, representations, obligations, covenants and agreements contained herein shall survive the Closing and shall not be merged with any instruments delivered by Seller to Buyer at the Closing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On March 16, 2016, Appellant provided written notice to Appellee claiming breach of the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause in the addendum to the right of way agreement. Appellant alleged, \"hundreds of thousands of dollars have been withheld from the royalty stream\" which were \"taxes, charges and market enhancements charged to the flow of gas or liquids\" from the pertinent well pad that were the responsibility of Appellee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 13, 2016, Appellee recorded a release of the right of way agreement, declaring it was releasing its rights in the agreement to the named grantor, \"Gulfport Energy Corporation, successor in interest to Hills and Hollers Farm, LLC.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant filed a complaint against Appellee in October 2016 and an amended complaint on December 21, 2016, setting forth five causes of action: declaratory judgment, breach of the right of way agreement, accounting, fraud in the inducement, and quiet title. The allegations in Appellant's complaint retained on appeal focus on Appellant's desire to enforce the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause in the addendum to the right of way agreement. Appellant alleged the clause was a personal covenant which prohibited Appellee from billing (Gulfport) for its services (gathering, compressing, transporting, etc.) charged to the flow of gas from the pertinent well pad; it was Gulfport, as the producer, who was actually billed by Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellee filed an answer raising affirmative defenses, including: lack of standing as Appellant no longer owned the property subject to the right of way; lack of consideration as Appellant no longer owned the surface and the agreement was made due to Appellant's ownership of the surface; waiver by selling the property and failing to reserve the right to enforce the disputed provisions of the right of way; any real property covenants running with the land could only be enforced by the owner of the property subject to the right of way; and the right of way agreement allowed for Appellee to file a release, which Appellee did file. (The answer also claimed Appellee did not deduct from Appellant's royalties as Appellee was not the lessee and the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause did not obligate Appellee to \"reimburse\" Appellant for deductions by Gulfport.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On June 9, 2017, Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, presenting three arguments: (1) Appellant does not own the property and thus cannot enforce the provisions in the right of way; (2) Appellant misinterprets the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause in an overly broad manner which would lead to an absurd result; and (3) the May 27, 2015 right of\n   way was released on June 13, 2016, as permitted by its terms, which relieved Appellee of any further obligations under said right of way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} As for the first argument, Appellee alleged Appellant had no standing or right to enforce the terms of the right of way agreement after Appellant conveyed the property subject to the right of way to Gulfport. Appellee pointed to the purpose of the right of way agreement as expressed in the granting clause and concluded the agreement was based on Appellant's ownership of the surface and only encumbered the surface estate. Appellee urged the right of way was unconcerned with mineral rights and Appellant's retention of the mineral rights upon the sale of the property to Gulfport did not maintain continuing rights under the terms of the right of way agreement. Appellee argued the limited warranty deed to Gulfport excepted and reserved only the minerals and made the conveyance subject to easements and rights of way without reserving rights under the 2015 right of way. Appellee concluded the lack of ownership of the burdened parcel plus the lack of an affirmative reservation of rights under the right of way resulted in a lack of standing to enforce the provisions in the right of way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant's September 12, 2017 response argued its claims were not extinguished by its conveyance of the property to Gulfport as the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause was an independent and collateral covenant from the primary object of the right of way agreement. Besides noting Appellant retained mineral rights in the deed to Gulfport, Appellant also relied on the purchase and sale agreement executed with the deed, noting it contained a \"no merger\" clause and retained the right to any pipeline damage payment due from Appellee (which Appellant acknowledged referred to the $180,000 which could be due under the 2015 right of way agreement if a second pipeline was constructed thereunder). Appellant urged the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause was not dependent upon its ownership of the surface and was designed to preserve the value of the mineral estate. Appellant argued an independent and collateral covenant does not run with the land and is thus excepted from the merger by deed doctrine. Appellant concluded: \"In light of the fact that the nature of the Paragraph 13 Covenant is independent and collateral to the 2015 H &amp; H Right of Way, that covenant was not merged into the ROW and not merged into the Limited Warranty Deed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant believed Appellee was relying on a merger doctrine and was under the impression Appellee was arguing: the recorded right of way should be considered without the addendum; the recorded deed to Gulfport should be considered without the purchase and sale agreement; and/or the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause for the addendum to the right of way agreement merged into the deed to Gulfport. However, Appellee's summary judgment reply explained how the Gulfport purchase and sale agreement was not disclosed to it in discovery until August 2017. Appellee stated the newly-revealed purchase and sale agreement buttressed its position on Appellant losing the right to enforce the clause as Appellant clearly reserved the right to any future payment for a second pipeline but did not contractually retain the right to enforce any other obligation in the right of way agreement. Appellee emphasized its motion\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   contend: the incorporated addendum merged into the recorded right of way; the purchase and sale agreement (with its no merger clause) merged into the recorded deed to Gulfport; or the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause merged into a deed to a different party. Appellee urged the doctrine of merger by deed had no relevance\n   and thus an exception to the doctrine for independent and collateral covenants had no relevance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In support of its second summary judgment argument, Appellee argued the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause did not require it to reimburse Appellant for Gulfport's deductions from royalty payments under the Appellant's lease with Gulfport. Appellee said: the right of way agreement contained an integration clause; the parties' intent cannot be ascertained by parol evidence of what Stronz demanded; a signed receipt evidenced payment of the consideration, which was separately set forth; the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause is the last sentence of paragraph 13 and must be read in context; the pertinent clause did not use the word \"reimburse\" as did the prior sentence in the same paragraph, which dealt with any real estate tax increase directly attributable to the pipeline; the pertinent clause did not refer to a lease or royalties; it functioned as a redundancy so the easement grantor would not incur additional costs as a result of the pipeline activities on the property; the contracting parties could not amend a lease with a non-party; and there was no evidence the Stronz well pad flowed into a pipeline built under the 2015 right of way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant responded by stating communications demonstrated the clause was bargained for, as opposed to mistakenly included, after initially being rejected by Appellee when offered by Appellant during negotiations. Appellant also cited to communications suggesting that upon Appellant's notice of breach, an employee of Appellee read the language of the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause consistent with Appellant's interpretation. Appellee replied this parol evidence cannot be used to show intent if the language is unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Concerning the third argument in its summary judgment motion, Appellee noted the right of way agreement gave it the unfettered right to terminate the right of way and easement rights granted to it by filing a release and the agreement contained no survival provision extending any provision beyond termination and release. Appellee recorded a release on June 13, 2016, surrendering its rights to Gulfport as the owner of the property and the successor to Appellant. Appellant's response argued the release could not extinguish the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause as there was nothing in the nature of the clause making its continuing efficacy dependent upon the existence of the right of way agreement. Appellant relied on the same reasoning it used to support the argument that it could still enforce the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause after the sale, i.e., it was an independent and collateral covenant as an exception to the merger by deed doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} At a hearing on the summary judgment motion, Appellant continued to characterize Appellee's argument (about the effect of Appellant's deed transferring the property to Gulfport) as an argument on merger by deed (or merger by other recordation). (Tr. 17). Appellant urged the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause had nothing to do with the surface and was an independent collateral covenant. (Tr. 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In an October 2, 2017 judgment entry, the trial court granted Appellee's motion for summary judgment. The court held: the last sentence in paragraph 13 was not personal to Appellant and was not an independent and collateral covenant; Appellant had no standing to enforce this sentence because Appellant conveyed the property subject to the right of way without reserving any interest in the disputed clause; the right of way agreement was fully released by the release recorded on\n   June 13, 2016; and Appellant lacking standing to assert the five causes of action. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    GENERAL LAW: SUMMARY JUDGMENT, STANDING, EASEMENTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Summary judgment can be granted when there remains no genuine issues of material fact and reasonable minds can only conclude the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

As Appellee emphasizes, the cases Appellant relies upon involve the question of whether a promise made to the buyer in the contract merged into and was eliminated by the buyer's deed where the deed did not repeat the promise. However, Appellee did not argue any obligation in a contract merged into a recorded document, and the trial court did not find the principle applicable either. Whether a party can enforce a provision in their own contract after they accepted a deed lacking the disputed provision is not the same issue as whether a party to a contract encumbering the surface of the estate by a pipeline right of way and easement can still enforce a certain provision therein after selling the property burdened by the easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Appellant relies on the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause in the unrecorded addendum to the recorded right of way agreement, which reads: \"Grantee shall be responsible for all other taxes, charges and market enhancements charged to the flow of gas or liquids from the Scott well pad or Stronz well pad.\" Although the recorded right of way agreement contained an integration clause (providing no other statements can add to or change the terms of the agreement), it then provided: \"This Right of Way Agreement is made further subject to the terms and provisions contained in that certain unrecorded Addendum by and between GRANTOR and GRANTEE herein, executed of even date herewith.\" The recorded right of way agreement specifically incorporated the unrecorded and contemporaneously executed addendum, and the addendum recited it was a part of the right of way agreement. The documents were one contract. The parties agree this did not result in\n   merger by deed (or merger by recordation of the right of way agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Contrary to Appellant's suggestion, Appellee's argument (that Appellant no longer had the right to enforce the right of way agreement due to the sale of the burdened land) did not implicitly equate to an argument that the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause in the addendum ceased to exist by the recordation of the right of way which conveyed an easement for a pipeline. Likewise, Appellee does not implicitly argue the application of the merger by deed doctrine or suggest the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause of the addendum merged into the recorded limited warranty deed (wherein Appellant conveyed the property to Gulfport while reserving mineral rights). Such a merger by deed argument would be nonsensical as the addendum (executed by Appellant and Appellee) is not the contract culminating in the deed to Gulfport. An evaluation of merger by deed can arise in a case where the purchase and sale agreement for realty is alleged to have merged into the subsequently recorded deed conveying\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   property. Here, the recorded deed to Gulfport was executed on June 15, 2015, and the purchase sale and agreement of that same date specifically contained a \"no merger\" clause, stating its terms would \"survive the Closing and shall not be merged with any instruments delivered by Seller to Buyer at the Closing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellee does not argue to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 43} In sum, the addendum was part of the right of way agreement. No one suggested it was erased by being merged into the recorded right of way agreement (or into a subsequent deed conveying the property to another party). As the doctrine of merger by deed was not argued or applied in this case, the exceptions to the doctrine are inapplicable. Appellant's argument is based upon an inapplicable merger by deed doctrine and its exceptions. Although there may exist support for Appellant's underlying position, it is not our function to comb the case law, combine various principles, and construct an overriding argument for an appellant based on the particular facts existing in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Still, the ultimate question is whether the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause in a right of way agreement was enforceable against Appellee by Appellant after Appellant's sale of the property to Gulfport. Appellee states Appellant conveyed the servient estate encumbered by the right of way and easement and thus lost the right to enforce Appellee's continuing obligations under the right of way agreement (contractually retaining only the right to any payment for a second pipeline). Appellee contends the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause was a term of the right of way agreement running with the servient estate, which was the surface conveyed\n   by Appellant to Gulfport. Appellee therefore concludes Appellant lacks standing to enforce the terms of the right of way agreement, which included its addendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 45} As aforementioned, Appellant does not dispute the pipeline right of way and easement were intended to run with the servient estate. Within its argument against the merger by deed doctrine, Appellant states the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause was an independent and collateral covenant benefitting Appellant regardless of continued ownership of the land burdened by the pipeline (and regardless of any future release). Appellant observes that although it conveyed to Gulfport the property subject to the right of way and easement, Appellant retained mineral rights and the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause deals with the gas and liquids flowing from the Stronz well pad, which includes Appellant's minerals. We note Appellant does not specify an argument that the clause \"ran with\" the mineral estate, which it retained upon conveying the property burdened by the right of way agreement to Gulfport. The clause in the pipeline easement wherein the grantee took responsibility for future charges dealt with severed minerals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schlabach v.

The right of way agreement was not dependent upon ownership of the mineral estate, but ownership of the surface estate was imperative. Appellant does not convincingly explain why the burdens of the easement would remain with the servient estate but the alleged continuing benefit would not under the circumstances of this case. The conveyance of a pipeline easement (and the flow of gas into a pipeline) was commercial as opposed to personal. The disputed clause was one of the continuing terms of the right of way and easement. It was an uncertain and future obligation for the grantee to take responsibility for several items that may be charged (or allegedly reimburse for such charges) when particular substances are moved from the surface of the servient estate by the easement grantee. According to Appellant's own position, it was a future benefit provided to the servient estate owner as a result of the creation of the servitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Appellant suggests the clause, which was executed in an agreement for a right of way and easement at the time Appellant owned both the surface and the minerals, benefitted his personal mineral rights even though the easement payments were the result of his surface ownership. However, later acts by the property owner (severance and retention of the minerals upon sale of the servient estate) would not convert the clause to a personal contract entitling the former property owner to a benefit for life without any of the burdens of the pipeline right of way and easement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Energytec, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085088,3669364\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/215/\">\n    739 F.3d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225 (5th Cir.2013) (\"The possibility that covenants will expire by the force of events is no definitional obstacle to calling them covenants running with the land.\"). Thus, our analysis does not change due to the possibility the former owner's acts before\n   sale may eliminate the benefit of the clause to a new property owner, such as: if the clause means what Appellant says, but the new owner obtained no interest in the reserved minerals (although, the new owner here was also the lessee.) In\n   <em>\n    Energytec\n   </em>\n   , the fact the defendant could abandon the pipeline to avoid a covenant to pay transportation fees did not mean the covenant did not run with the land.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085088,3669364\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/215/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (distinguishing its prior case involving allocation of environmental contamination costs which were equated with an encumbrance, but located in a state which does not consider a covenant involving encumbrances as running with the land).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 48} In the same paragraph as the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause is an obligation for the property owner to be responsible for real estate taxes and for the grantee to reimburse the owner for any future increase attributable to the pipelines. These obligations will inure to the benefit of the servient estate owner's successors and assigns. A covenant for the grantee to be responsible for certain future taxes and charges to the flow of gas would likewise inure to the benefit of the grantor's successors and assigns. The disputed clause must be read in context; it is contained in the same numbered special condition as the real estate clause and refers to the preceding sentences on real estate taxes as it uses the phrase \"other taxes.\" The disputed clause is more akin to a future real estate tax obligation (attributable to the pipeline) than to an agreement to pay the purchase price at closing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Both the burdens from and the continuing obligations in the right of way agreement (which includes the terms of its addendum) flow with the property burdened by the right of way and easement. Appellant sold the property and conveyed the terms of the right of way agreement to Gulfport, e.g., \"Seller agrees to purchase from Seller the Property, together with all privileges, easements, rights of way and other appurtenant rights related to the Property * * *.\" With the exception of any payment for a second pipeline, no rights contained in the right of way agreement were retained in the sale. Appellant thus lost the right to enforce paragraph 13 and its \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Where the grantee of a pipeline right of way and easement takes on an obligation in the agreement forming the servitude to be responsible for certain future taxes and charges incurred at the surface, this clause is inherent in the servitude created. At least, it is a dependent clause which is an incident of the easement as it was a continuing obligation that was part of the right of way agreement and was dependent upon the ownership of the property burdened by the agreement. In any case, the clause is no longer a right enforceable by Appellant after the sale of the servient estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Lastly, we note a decision was not made on the precise meaning of the clause (e.g., what charges to whom, the lack of language on \"reimbursement\" for charges imposed by another party, whether the clause bound Appellee in what it charged to Gulfport who then charged Appellant, and whether the flow referred only to the substances entering the new pipeline). The parties did not brief these issues as the trial court did not reach them. We\n   reviewed whether the clause was still enforceable by Appellant assuming arguendo it meant what Appellant claimed it meant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 52} We also note Appellant's position on appeal appears to be all or nothing. That is, Appellant does not alternatively argue it could recover for a breach occurring in the 80 days between the execution of the right of way agreement and the sale of the property to Gulfport. Although Appellant's complaint suggests Appellee first breached the clause in February 2015, this is impossible as the agreement containing the clause was not executed until March 27, 2015. The sale to Gulfport occurred on June 15, 2015, and the first pipeline under the 2015 right of way was constructed thereafter. Apparently, Stronz entered an earlier right of way agreement with Appellee for a smaller pipeline in 2013. An unsupported statement in Appellant's response to the summary judgment motion mentioned gas from the Stronz well pad entered the pipeline installed under the earlier agreement. However, factual statements in the opposition to summary judgment must be supported by summary judgment evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 53} At deposition, Stronz believed: production at the Stronz well pad began at an unknown time in 2015 before the March 27, 2015 right of way agreement was signed; the first royalty payment would have been issued by Gulfport 90 days after production began and may have been issued in May 2015; and Gulfport did not make deductions from the initial royalty payments. Notably, Appellant's opposition to summary judgment did not cite these portions of the deposition and attached only certain other pages in an appendix to its response to summary judgment. The non-movant must cite the trial court to the evidence showing a genuine issue. In any event, this testimony does not allege a breach regarding the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause occurred prior to the Gulfport sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Statements (apparently summarizing royalties and deductions) were attached to the complaint. Appellee's answer denied the averments in the paragraphs of the complaint citing to these statements and only generally admitted production from the Stronz well pad began sometime in 2015. The statements were not identified at deposition or otherwise incorporated into summary judgment evidence by an affidavit for instance (and some contain text so small as to be unreadable). Furthermore, they were not relied upon in responding to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 55} In sum, the disputed clause was not enforceable by Appellant for alleged breaches after the sale to Gulfport, there is no argument concerning the time before the sale, and there was no summary judgment evidence showing a breach of the clause in the 80 days between the execution of the pipeline right of way agreement and the sale of the property to Gulfport. Appellant's first assignment of error is overruled, and the trial court's decision granting summary judgment is therefore affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR TWO: RELEASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Appellant's second assignment of error contends:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \"The Trial Court Erred By Granting Summary Judgment To Defendant On The Basis That Defendant's Unilateral Execution and Recording of a Release of the Pipeline ROW Granted By Plaintiff to Defendant, Which Was Undisputedly A Reaction To Plaintiff's Tender Of A Notice of Breach To Defendant, Was Effective To Excuse Defendant Of Any Legal Obligations To Plaintiff Arising From The Claimed Breach By Defendant Of The Paragraph 13 Covenant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 57} The recorded release stated Appellee \"hereby releases relinquishes and surrenders to the hereinafter named grantor, grantor's heirs, successors and assigns, all of the right, title and interest of Ohio Gathering Company, L.L.C., in and to that certain Right-of-Way Agreement granted in [description.]\" It named the grantor as \"Gulfport Energy Corporation, successor in interest to Hills and Hollers Farm, LLC.\" Allowing a future release, the recorded right of way agreement provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    GRANTEE shall also have the right\n   </em>\n   to change the location of an installed pipeline and this right-of-way and easement as may be necessary or advisable from any condition or event beyond its control * * *\n   <em>\n    and at any time to abandon and terminate all or any part of the right-of-way and easement rights granted herein, by filing a release of a same in the county records.\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Appellee argues: the release was permissible under the express terms of the right of way agreement; there was no survival provision in the agreement to save any continuing or future obligations in the agreement from a release; and all of its further obligations ceased when the release was recorded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garlick v.

Appellant does not dispute Appellee's ability to release the right of way and easement under its express terms. Instead, Appellant argues Appellee is unable to unilaterally release the \"charges to the flow of gas\" clause because it is an independent and collateral covenant and thus its continuing efficacy is not dependent on the continuing existence of the 2015 right of way agreement. As Appellee points out, Appellant solely relies on the arguments made in the first assignment of error, setting forth no additional law as to the release and stating the second assignment of error \"incorporates by reference the argument and law set forth above in support of its First Assignment of Error as if fully rewritten.\" Appellee responds this argument \"is no more compelling the second time around.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 59} The trial court made an alternate holding that the right of way agreement was fully released by Appellee's June 13, 2016 recording of a release.
