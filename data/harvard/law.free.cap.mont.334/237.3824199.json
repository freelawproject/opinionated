Cotter</author>\n<p id=\"AT\">delivered the Opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b61 Plaintiffs Montanans For Justice: Vote No On CI-98, Not In Montana: Citizens Against CI-97, and Property Owners Against 1-154 (collectively \u201cOpponents\u201d) comprise three political ballot committees who brought suit against the three Defendant political ballot committees: Citizens Right To Recall Montana, Protect Our Homes Montana, and Stop Over Spending Montana. Opponents also sued Trevis Butcher, the treasurer of the Defendant political ballot committees, and Montanans in Action, a Montana corporation for which Butcher is executive director. Defendant political ballot committees, Montanans in Action, and Trevis Butcher will be referred to collectively as \u201cProponents.\u201d Additionally, Opponents sued the State of Montana through Attorney General Mike McGrath and Secretary of State Brad Johnson (hereinafter \u201cthe State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b62 Opponents brought this action in the Montana Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, alleging that Proponents, in their attempt to get two constitutional initiatives and one statutory initiative on the ballot for November 2006, engaged in signature gathering practices that violated applicable state law. After an expedited hearing, the District Court held that the signature gathering process was permeated by fraud and procedural non-compliance. The court invalidated the signatures obtained by specific signature gatherers, and invalidated the Secretary of State\u2019s certifications of CI-97, CI-98, and 1-154. Proponents appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\u00b63 Proponents raise three issues on appeal. A restatement of those issues is:</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\u00b64 1. Was Opponents\u2019 claim barred by laches?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\u00b65 2. Did the District Court violate Proponents\u2019 due process rights when it expedited the hearing and denied more time for discovery?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">\u00b66 3. Did the District Court err when it determined that the signature gathering process was permeated by a pervasive and general pattern and practice of fraud and procedural non-compliance?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">\u00b67 This case involves an attempt by Proponents to place two constitutional initiatives and one statutory initiative on the November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>2006 ballot. CI-97 is a proposed constitutional initiative imposing limits on the spending and taxation authority of the State of Montana. CI-98 is a proposed constitutional initiative revising the process for removing judges and justices from office. 1-154 is a proposed statutory initiative revising the legal definition of a government \u201ctaking\u201d as it relates to property ownership and eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b68 Proponent committees were formed for the purpose of promoting these initiatives, while Opponent committees were formed once the promotion began, in order to oppose them.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b69 Montana citizens have the constitutional right to enact laws by initiative. Mont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 4. The Legislature has established specific procedural requirements to safeguard the integrity and fairness of the initiative process. See \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-101 through -504, MCA. One such requirement is that proponents of an initiative, whether statutory or constitutional, must gather a specific percentage of voter signatures to qualify their initiative for the ballot. Sections 13-27-204 and -207,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MCA. Currently, under these statutes, to qualify a statutory initiative, 22,308 signatures from 34 legislative districts must be gathered. To qualify a constitutional initiative for the ballot, a petitioner must gather 44,615 signatures from 40 legislative districts.</p>\n<p id=\"AZb\">\u00b610 A \u201csignature gatherer\u201d is defined as \u201can individual who collects signatures on a petition for the purpose of an initiative, a referendum, or the calling of a constitutional convention.\u201d Section 13-27-111(4), MCA (as amended, 2003). Such signature gatherers must submit a standard form affidavit attesting that: (1) he or she \u201cgathered or assisted in gathering\u201d the signatures on the petition; and (2) he or she believes the signatures on the petition are those of genuine Montana voters living at the addresses entered by the petition signer; and that \u201cthe signers knew the contents of the petition before signing the petition.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 13-27-302, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b611 Proponents began collecting signatures throughout the state of Montana in March 2006 and collected them until June 23, 2006, the date on which all gathered signatures had to be submitted to county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>election administrators for certification. Proponents utilized some Montana citizens to collect signatures but relied primarily on paid out-of-state signature gatherers to obtain the overwhelming majority of the signatures submitted. The uncontradicted evidence established that Proponents paid over $633,000.00 to out-of-state signature gatherers who collected signatures for these three initiatives. Individual signature gatherers were paid between fifty-cents and $2.50 per signature per initiative.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b612 Proponents submitted their signed petitions to the county election administrators, who in turn certified them and submitted them to the Secretary of State\u2019s office. The Secretary of State ultimately certified 47,905 signatures for CI-97, 49,956 signatures for CI-98, and 27,748 signatures for 1-154. Because each initiative garnered more than the required number of signatures (see \u00b6 9), these ballot initiatives were certified to the Governor on or around July 21, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b613 On August 16, 2006, Opponents filed their Complaint alleging that Proponents\u2019 signature gatherers violated the statutory requirements governing ballot issue petitions by obtaining signatures in a deceptive manner and by falsely swearing to the contents on the signature gatherers\u2019 form affidavits. On August24,2006, the Secretary of State\u2019s office certified ballots containing all three ballot initiatives back to the county election administrators for preparation and printing of ballots for the elections. Also on August 24, Opponents moved for an expedited hearing on their Complaint. On August 28,2006, the District Court granted the motion to expedite, and set the hearing for September 8,2006. In this Order, the court also instructed Opponents to properly serve Proponents with the Complaint. The Proponents were served with the Complaint that same day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8N\">\u00b614 The State accepted service of the Complaint on August 17, 2006. It filed its Answer to the Complaint on August 30, 2006, but took no position as to the truth of the allegations raised by the Opponents. The case was assigned to the Honorable Kenneth R. Neill of the Montana Eighth Judicial District. Pursuant to notice, Judge Neill held a conference on the record on September 5, 2006, which counsel for all parties attended either in person or by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b615 During the conference, the court and the parties settled upon the date and time for perpetuation depositions of three of Opponents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>witnesses. Also, the court inquired whether any of the parties had a problem with the scheduled hearing date. Proponents\u2019 attorney stated, \u201cWe do have some problems, not so much with the date, although we would like to see it moved so that we would have more time for some discovery.\u201d However, due to the District Court\u2019s schedule and the urgency to resolve this case at the earliest date before the November election, the District Court denied Proponents\u2019 suggestion that the hearing be moved. The court concluded its conference by requesting that the parties submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Opponents submitted both a pre-hearing brief and their proposed findings and conclusions on September 8, 2006. Proponents declined to submit either. Moreover, Proponents did not file an Answer to Opponents\u2019 Complaint, nor did they file any pre-trial motions for discovery or extension of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b616 On September 7, 2006, the day before the scheduled hearing, counsel for the Proponents filed a one-sentence motion for substitution of judge. As a result, Judge Neill requested that Honorable Dirk Sandefur assume jurisdiction. Judge Sandefur accepted jurisdiction on September 8, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b617 The case proceeded to trial on September 8, 2006, before Judge Sandefur, sitting without a jury. Before trial began, Intervenors Cox, Hanks and Cooper appeared by counsel and requested leave to intervene in the proceedings. Their motion was granted without objection. Trial then commenced. Opponents called three witnesses to testify in person. They also presented three perpetuation depositions, as well as excerpts from the testimony of a signature gatherer given at a hearing before the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The State called two witnesses, and two of the Intervenors testified on their own behalf. The Proponents called one witness, Trevis Butcher. At the close of the one-day trial, Judge Sandefur took the matter under advisement. On September 13,2006, the court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Invalidating Certification of CI-97, CI-98, and 1-154. Proponents filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b618 We note that while Intervenors participated in the hearing and cosigned Appellants\u2019/Proponents\u2019 Brief filed with this Court, they did not file a notice of appeal. The only such notice was filed by Proponents. M. R. App. P. 4(b), provides that if two or more parties desire to appeal from a district court judgment, they may either file a joint notice of appeal, or may join together after filing separate timely notices of appeal. As Intervenors did neither, they are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b619 Proponents argue that the District Court\u2019s findings are not supported by the evidence and that the court incorrectly interpreted and applied the applicable law. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the court made a mistake. <em>Petitioners I-549 v. Missoula Irrigation, </em>2005 MT 100, \u00b6 8, 326 Mont. 527, \u00b6 8, 111 P.3d 664, \u00b6 8 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether its interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Petitioners 1-549, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\n<em>ISSUE ONE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u00b621 <em>Was Opponents\u2019 claim barred by laches ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\u00b622 The first issue before us is whether the Opponents\u2019 claim was barred by laches. Proponents maintain that Opponents knew they would be challenging the initiative signature gathering process in the weeks before they filed suit, but negligently delayed asserting their rights until August 16, 2006. They claim that the doctrine of laches should be applied so as to bar Opponents\u2019 challenge to the ballot certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">\u00b623  Laches is an equitable doctrine by which a court denies relief to a claimant who has unreasonably delayed or been negligent in asserting the claim, when the delay or negligence has prejudiced the party against whom relief is sought. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>879 (Bryan A. Gamer ed., 7th ed., West 1999). See also <em>Cole v. State ex rel. Brown, </em>2002 MT 32, \u00b6 24, 308 Mont. 265, \u00b6 24, 42 P.3d 760, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\u00b624  Proponents\u2019 laches\u2019 argument is flawed for two reasons. First, laches is an affirmative defense. As such, under M. R. Civ. P. 8:(c), Proponents were required to raise it in their Answer to the Opponents\u2019 Complaint in District Court. Rule 8(c) states in relevant part, \u201cIn pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively ... laches ... and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\u201d However, Proponents did not file an Answer to the Opponents\u2019 Complaint. We have held previously that a defense of laches, not raised in the answer, cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Deist v. Wachholz, </em>208 Mont. 207, 227, 678 P.2d 188, 198 (1984). We note further that at no time during the District Court proceedings did Proponents argue that Opponents\u2019 claim was barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>by laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b625  Even if Proponents\u2019 laches argument was not procedurally barred, the doctrine simply does not apply here. The doctrine of laches applies where there has been such delay as to render enforcement of the asserted right inequitable. <em>In re Marriage of Deist, </em>2003 MT 263, \u00b6 17, 317 Mont. 427, \u00b6 17, 77 P.3d 525, \u00b6 17. In <em>Castillo v. Franks, </em>213 Mont. 232, 690 P.2d 425 (1984), we said that \u201c[t]he purpose of laches is to discourage stale demands by the court refusing to interfere where there has been gross laches in prosecuting rights, or where long acquiescence in assertion of adverse rights has occurred.\u201d <em>Castillo, </em>213 Mont. at 241, 690 P.2d at 429. Thus, the doctrine is aimed at foreclosing \u201cstale\u201d claims, or those asserted after a protracted period of seeming assent. <em>Accord Cole, \u00b6 </em>24 (Plaintiffs\u2019 claim, brought nine years after the term limits initiative, CI-64, became effective and presumptively valid, was barred by laches.). Here, it is undisputed that Opponents brought their claim within thirty (30) days after the ballot issues were certified, as required by \u00a7 3-5-302(6), MCA. In light of the fact that they complied with the statute\u2019s narrow 30-day window for filing suit, it cannot reasonably be argued that Opponents waited until their claims had grown stale before asserting them. Therefore, we conclude that Opponents\u2019 claims are not barred by the equitable doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>ISSUE TWO</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b626 <em>Did the District Court violate Proponents\u2019 due process rights when it expedited the hearing and denied more time for discovery?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b627 Proponents contend the District Court violated their due process rights because the court denied Proponents\u2019 \u201cmotion to delay trial to allow for discovery.\u201d As a result, Proponents claim they were \u201cunable to conduct meaningful investigation or any discovery and were not on notice of many of the claims and evidence presented at the hearing.\u201d This, they argue, subjected them to \u201ctrial by ambush.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">\u00b628 Opponents invite us to ignore the due process claim because Proponents raised it for the first time on appeal. We agree the record contains neither a motion for a continuance, nor a memorandum or affidavit(s) articulating what discovery Proponents would have conducted had the court allowed more time. Rather, Proponents premise their contention that they preserved this claim for appeal purposes solely on counsel\u2019s response to the District Court\u2019s inquiry during the September 5,2006 scheduling conference about the date set for trial. In response to the court\u2019s question, Proponents commented, \u2018We do have some problems, not so much with the date, although we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>would like to see it moved so that we would have more time for some discovery.\u201d A protracted discussion followed regarding the scheduling of three perpetuation depositions. Opponents scheduled the depositions at a time Proponents\u2019 counsel requested, but then during the scheduling conference, Proponents\u2019 counsel said he \u201cpreferred] certainly another time.\u201d Notwithstanding Proponents\u2019 failure to move to continue the hearing date, the court considered the comments regarding postponement, but declined to accept them, saying, \u201cI think the time constraints are such that we need to have this on [September 8, 2006.]\u201d Because the District Court arguably construed Proponents\u2019 comments disfavoring the September 8,2006 trial date as a request to postpone the hearing, we will address the merits of Proponents\u2019 due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b629 We therefore turn to the question of whether the court\u2019s denial of more time impinged Proponents\u2019 due process rights. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution at Article II, \u00a7 17, provide that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The guarantee of due process has both a procedural and a substantive component. <em>Elgin v. Board of County Com\u2019rs, </em>2002 MT 115, \u00b6 14, 310 Mont. 1, \u00b6 14, 48 P.3d 39, \u00b6 14. Generally, substantive due process analysis applies when state action is alleged to unreasonably restrict an individual\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Elgin, </em>2002 MT 115, 310 Mont. 1, 48 P.3d 39, and <em>Newville v. State Dept. of Family Services, </em>267 Mont. 237, 883 P.2d 793 (1994). Here, Proponents contend the District Court\u2019s denial of their motion to delay trial left them with inadequate time to prepare their case. Proponents\u2019 complaint is procedural in nature, and therefore constitutes a procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">\u00b630  Under both federal and state jurisprudence the requirements for procedural due process are (1) notice, and (2) opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case. <em>See Jones v. </em>Flowers,_ U.S._, 126 S.Ct. 1708, 1712, and <em>Matter of Klos, </em>284 Mont. 197, 205, 943 P.2d 1277, 1281, both citing <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 313, 70 S.Ct. 652, 656-57 (1950). As such, \u201cthe process due in any given case varies according to the factual circumstances of the case, the nature of the interests at stake and the risk of making an erroneous decision.\u201d <em>McDermott v. McDonald, </em>2001 MT 89, \u00b6 10, 305 Mont. 166, \u00b6 10, 24 P.3d 200, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted). Otherwise stated, due process requirements of notice and a meaningful hearing are \u201cflexible\u201d and are adapted by the courts to meet the procedural protections demanded by the specific situation. <em>Geil v. Missoula Irr. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number><em>Dist., </em>2002 MT 269, \u00b6 58, 312 Mont. 320, \u00b6 58, 59 P.3d 398, \u00b6 58 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b631 Both Montana law and the truncated timeline available for resolving preelection initiative challenges require relatively rapid action by the parties and the courts between the time an initiative qualifies for the ballot-typically in mid-July-and the date on which voters cast ballots in the first week of November. Allegations of deceptive election practices must therefore be raised, proven, and if necessary remedied, within a narrow window of time. A person or group challenging the validity of a qualified ballot initiative must file suit within 30 days of the date the initiative is certified. Section 3-5-302(6), MCA. Thereafter, \u201c[a] preelection challenge to the procedure by which an initiative or referendum qualified for the ballot... shall be given priority by the courts.\u201d Mont. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 7(2). Moreover, \u201c[t]he sufficiency of the initiative petition shall not be questioned after the election is held.\u201d Mont. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 4(3). In sum, the law requires that challenges to an initiative be raised, addressed, and resolved in accelerated fashion. Against this backdrop, we consider Proponents\u2019 objections concerning notice and the expedited hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b632 Proponents\u2019 sole claim regarding the District Court\u2019s failure to meet the due process notice requirement centers upon their contention that they had \u201cno notice\u201d Opponents would offer evidence regarding \u201cfraudulent addresses by over 40 signature gatherers.\u201d We cannot agree. Opponents\u2019 Complaint, in a section entitled \u201cDefendants Engaged in a Statewide Pattern of Deceptive Practices in the Gathering of Signatures,\u201d clearly alleged that \u201cprofessional signature gatherers were encouraged to lie and generally engage in a pattern of devious and deceptive practices, including <em>routinely providing false addresses on affidavits ...\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) However, Proponents contend that without the additional benefit of a pre-trial order and full discovery they \u201cwere primed for a surprise attack\u201d when Opponents contested the validity of \u201cover 40 of the signature gatherers\u2019 addresses as a basis to prove pervasive fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b633  We conclude that Opponents\u2019 Complaint was sufficiently specific to put Proponents on notice that Opponents contested the validity of addresses listed by paid signature gatherers on affidavits filed with county election officials. Further, Proponents\u2019 witness, Butcher, acknowledged under oath that the Secretary of State\u2019s Elections Specialist phoned him during the signature gathering cycle, occurring between March and July, to notify Butcher of complaints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>received related to address falsification on paid signature gatherers\u2019 affidavits. Therefore, Proponents were aware that the addresses of the signature gatherers would be an issue in advance of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b634 It is most significant, however, that these signature gatherers were contacted, hired and paid by Proponents. Thus, any information as to their true addresses was within the exclusive knowledge of Proponents, and not Opponents. Proponents do not explain how, under these circumstances, discovery from Opponents regarding signature gatherers\u2019 addresses would have been of any assistance whatsoever. We therefore must reject the contention that Proponents were prejudiced by the denial of a longer period of notice or discovery regarding the addresses of their own paid signature gatherers.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b635 Proponents raise no other contentions regarding notice. We therefore turn to the bulk of Proponents\u2019 argument in which they protest the condensed timeframe for pre-trial discovery as an unconstitutional restriction on their opportunity for meaningful participation in the September 8, 2006 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b636 Proponents posit the District Court denied them a meaningful hearing because the court compelled them to proceed without adequate time for discovery. Proponents contend the abridged timeframe allocated for trial preparation left them without <em>any </em>opportunity to conduct discovery. We disagree. The record shows that Proponents failed to utilize the time allocated by the court to conduct whatever discovery time allowed, or to avail themselves of the procedural remedies available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b637 Proponents rely on <em>Wilson v. Dept. of Public Service </em>Reg., for the proposition that a \u201cmeaningful hearing can not [sic] be had when a party is made to proceed without the ability to discover the evidence and allegation to be advanced against them.\u201d 260 Mont. 167, 858 P.2d 368 (1993). We note at the outset that <em>Wilson </em>was an appeal from a Public Service Commission (PSC) proceeding and not an appeal regarding a ballot initiative. Therefore, there was no legal or circumstantial requirement for expediency in <em>Wilson-a </em>distinction of significant consequence. That said, we did conclude that appellants in <em>Wilson </em>were denied discovery in violation of their due process rights. 260 Mont. at 172, 858 P.2d at 371. However, denial of the Wilsons\u2019 discovery motion was not the sole basis for our determination. Rather, we relied on cumulative circumstances to conclude that fundamental fairness and due process of law were denied. Specifically, the <em>decision appealed from </em>contained \u201cno specification of the orders, rules or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>statutes which the Wilsons [were] alleged to have violated[,]\u201d the Wilsons were not \u201cafforded adequate, timely notice of the persons who [would] testify\u201d nor did they know the \u201cnature of the evidence\u201d that would be presented in support of the PSC\u2019s revocation of their \u201cvaluable property right\u201d in a transportation certificate. <em>Wilson, </em>260 Mont. at 172, 858 P.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b638 The circumstances underpinning the due process violation in <em>Wilson </em>are not present here. First, we disagree that the District Court\u2019s decision to expedite proceedings equated to denial of a motion for discovery as occurred in <em>Wilson. </em>Nothing prevented Proponents from utilizing the eleven days available to them to conduct discovery. Yet, Proponents conducted no discovery. Second, the District Court\u2019s decision from which Proponents now appeal clearly articulates which statutes Proponents ostensibly violated. Third, we previously determined that, unlike the Wilsons, Proponents were afforded adequate notice of the allegations against them, and had within their knowledge information with which to refute Opponents\u2019 allegations of address falsification. Finally, we agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that as a matter of law, Proponents \u201chave no political or legal right to vote\u201d on the initiatives at issue here \u201cuntil Proponents have duly qualified them for the ballot in the manner provided by law, free from the taint of fraud.\u201d Whereas it was determined Wilsons had an extant property right in their transportation certificate, here Proponents\u2019 \u201cright\u201d to vote on the initiatives cannot, even arguably, vest as a right to \u201clife, liberty, or property,\u201d subject to due process requirements, until this Court determines whether Proponents legally qualified the initiatives for the November 2006 Montana ballot. Mont. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 7(1); \u00a7 7-5-132(3)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b639 Regardless of <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>applicability, Proponents\u2019 due process claim rings hollow in light of the multiple respects in which they did not avail themselves of either the time they had or their recourse to the rules of civil procedure. Specifically, Proponents did not answer Opponents\u2019 Complaint, request any discovery, move for a continuance, take any depositions, or file a pre-trial brief. Proponents did not attend the three depositions conducted by Opponents (though they were scheduled to accommodate the schedule of Proponents\u2019 counsel), nor did they file proposed findings of facts or conclusions of law, despite the District Court\u2019s request for both from the parties. At the end of the September 5, 2006 scheduling conference, Proponents acquiesced without objection in the court\u2019s proposed schedule, and indicated they would not make any pre-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>\u00b640 Proponents\u2019 efforts at trial were similarly incomplete. They declined to make an opening statement or a closing argument. They opted not to cross-examine Opponents\u2019 main witness, Jacqueline Boyle. And, most significantly, their attorney did not object as multiple hearsay statements damaging to Proponents\u2019 case came into evidence through the witnesses who testified. Under the same time constraints, Opponents conducted three depositions, filed the pre-trial brief and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law suggested by the court, and then fully participated at trial, making appropriate arguments and objections as the rules of evidence allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b641  We conclude that any deprivation of a meaningful hearing here was more the construct of Proponents\u2019 own failure to act than it was a function of the District Court\u2019s denial of more time for trial preparation. Opponents timely brought their claims. The District Court was then required by law to expedite the proceedings. Simply put, the District Court proceeded as required by law. We therefore determine that under the circumstances, Proponents received both adequate notice of the allegations against them and an opportunity to participate in a meaningful hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\n<em>ISSUE THREE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b642 <em>Did the District Court err when it determined that the signature gathering process was permeated by a pervasive and general pattern and practice of fraud and procedural non-compliance?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b643 The District Court conducted a one-day hearing on September 8, 2006, during which Opponents called three witnesses, the State called two, Intervenors called two, and Proponents called one. In addition, Opponents introduced three perpetuation depositions, multiple affidavits, the testimony of one signature gatherer given at a hearing before the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and numerous spread sheets, signature lists and calculations. Proponents introduced into evidence three certification affidavits signed by one of their signature gatherers and a fourth affidavit signed by a second signature gatherer.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b644 On September 13,2006 the court issued a detailed 46-page Order setting forth its analysis and rationale. The court found that three significant defects occurred: (1) Proponents\u2019 out-of-state signature gatherers routinely attested that they personally gathered or assisted in gathering signatures that, in fact, were gathered by other persons outside of their presence and without direct assistance from them; (2) Proponents\u2019 out-of-state signature gatherers used false addresses on their certification affidavits; and (3) at least some of these same signature gatherers employed a deceitful \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactic. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>review each of these conclusions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Certification Based on the Language \u201cAssisted In\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b645 The District Court found that, under the totality of the circumstances, it was more probable than not that the out-of-state signature gatherers executed certification affidavits attesting that they personally gathered or assisted in gathering signatures that someone else actually gathered outside of their presence without any direct assistance from them. As further addressed below, the District Court received substantial evidence as to the vast number of signatures attested to by several of Proponents\u2019 paid out-of-state signature gatherers. This evidence established that the signers were located in various cities and counties throughout the state and that the attesting signature gatherer could not have possibly been present when many persons signed their petitions. Proponents did not rebut or refute this evidence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b646 Instead, Proponents argue on appeal that to give meaning to the words \u201cassisted in\u201d as used in \u00a7 13-27-302, MCA, an affiant need not be present at the time the petition was signed. They also maintain that Montana law has a lax standard for signature gatherer certification, vis-a-vis other states, as it does not expressly require the gatherer to attest that the signatures were received in his or her presence. Compare Oregon\u2019s statute, for example-\u201cThe circulator shall certify on each signature sheet that the individuals signed the sheet in the presence of the circulator ....\u201d Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 249.740(4). Relying on <em>United Labor Committee of Mo. v. Kirkpatrick, </em>572 S.W.2d 449 (Mo. 1978), Proponents further contend that because the Secretary of State certified the signatures, these signatures were verified and should not be invalidated by a technical deficiency, negligence or misconduct of a third party, i.e., the signature gatherer.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b647 Opponents counter that it is well established that the signer of an affidavit must have personal knowledge of the information contained in the affidavit. <em>McDermott v. Carie, LLC, </em>2005 MT 293, \u00b6 26, 329 Mont. 295, \u00b6 26, 124 P.3d 168, \u00b6 26. They maintain that for a petition gatherer to sign the affidavit required in \u00a7 13-27-302, MCA, he or she must have a belief based on personal knowledge that the petition signers knew the contents of the petition before signing it. They assert that the District Court correctly determined that the affiant had to be present dining the signing in order to meet this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u00b648 Relevant to our analysis of this issue as well as the issues below are the definition of \u201csignature gatherer\u201d and the required contents of the affidavit for certifying signatures. Section 13-27-111(4), MCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>(2005), defines \u201csignature gatherer\u201d as \u201can individual who collects signatures on a petition for the purpose of an initiative, a referendum, or the calling of a constitutional convention.\u201d Section 13-27-302, MCA (2005), sets forth the following requirements for the affidavit that must be attached to each sheet or section of signatures submitted to the county official:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">I, (name of person who is the signature gatherer), swear that I gathered or assisted in gathering the signatures on the petition to which this affidavit is attached on the stated dates, that I believe the signatures on the petition are genuine, are the signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be, and are the signatures of Montana electors who are registered at the address or have the telephone number following the person\u2019s signature, and that the signers knew the contents of the petition before signing the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">(date on which the first signature was gathered)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">(Signature of petition signature gatherer)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">(Address of petition signature gatherer)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\u00b649 Notably, these statutes were revised by the 2003 Legislature. Prior to the 2003 revisions, \u00a7 13-27-111(4), MCA (2001), provided that a \u201csignature gatherer\u201d was \u201can individual who collects or intends to collect signatures on a petition for the purpose of an initiative, a referendum, or the calling of a constitutional convention.\u201d Moreover, the 2001 version of \u00a7 13-27-302, MCA, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">I, (name of person who circulated this petition), swear that I circulated or assisted in circulating the petition to which this affidavit is attached, that I believe the signatures on the petition are genuine, are the signatures of the persons whose names they purport to be, and are the signatures of Montana electors who are registered at the address or have the telephone number following the person\u2019s signature, and that the signers knew the contents of the petition before signing the petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">(Signature of petition circulator)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">(Address of petition circulator)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">According to the 2003 legislative history, the committee members discussing the then-proposed revisions indicated that the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>the revisions was to make the process \u201cmore accountable.\u201d House Committee on State Administration, 2003 Reg. Sess. (Jan. 21, 2003). \u00b650 The evidence established that Proponents hired and paid up to 43 out-of-state signature gatherers. The signatures gathered by five of these signature gatherers constituted more than half of the total signatures garnered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These gatherers were Larry Shumacher, Grace Meyer, Ron Cook, Eric Rittberg, and Marvin King. These persons were paid on a per-signature basis. Schumacher was paid $84,103.30 for gathering signatures in five Montana counties; Meyer was paid $70,170.94 for collecting signatures in six Montana counties; Cook received $69,214.78 for his signature gathering efforts in six counties; and Rittberg was paid $18,155.68 for unspecified county petition drive efforts. No evidence was presented as to the amount Proponents paid King but evidence revealed that he swore to 41,761 signatures. Additionally, it was shown that he attested to signatures gathered from at least eight Montana counties, as geographically dispersed as Glacier, Gallatin, Yellowstone and Valley Counties. King submitted by affidavit approximately 15,000 signatures obtained during one two-week period. The District Court observed that he would have had to secure approximately one signature every minute during that period to reach this total.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b651 Given that the claimed signatures were gathered from far-flung areas of the state, it is evident that King was not present when many of these signatures were obtained. Proponents maintain that they obtained signatures from traveling Montanans (e.g., Bozeman residents visiting Billings signed a Billings\u2019 petition). While it is feasible that this occurred on occasion, Proponents proffered no evidence to support this claim. Moreover, it strains credulity to conclude that this occurred often enough to explain the thousands of signatures obtained from distant towns and cities by a single signature gatherer.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b652 To determine whether Proponents\u2019 signature gatherers complied with the statutory requirements, we must read \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-111(4) and 13-27-302, MCA, together. As indicated above the \u201csignature gatherer,\u201d i.e., the person who collected the signatures, must swear under oath that he or she \u201cgathered or assisted in gathering the signatures on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>petition to which this affidavit is attached on the stated dates.\u201d It is undisputed that some of Proponents\u2019 signature gatherers attested to signatures that were obtained by other persons outside of the presence of the attesting affiant. The question is whether those certifications are lawful under the \u201cassisted in\u201d language of the affidavit. Proponents, of course, are advocating a broad construction of the phrase while Opponents offer a more narrow construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b653 We construe statutes as they are written. <em>Ravalli County v. Erickson, </em>2004 MT 35, \u00b6 11, 320 Mont. 31, \u00b6 11, 85 P.3d 772, \u00b6 11. We must neither insert what has been omitted nor omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. The term \u201cassisted\u201d is not defined in the statute; therefore, we look to its common dictionary meaning. <em>Ravalli County, </em>\u00b6 13. \u201cAssisted\u201d is defined as: (1) to give aid or support; (2) to be present, as at a conference; (3) an act of giving aid; help. <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>109 (4th Edition, Houghton Mifflin Company 2004). We have previously recognized the term \u201cassistant\u201d to mean \u201cone who stands by and aids or helps another.\u201d <em>State v. Ayers, </em>112 Mont. 120, 126, 113 P.2d 785, 788 (1941). Because the definition of both \u201cassisted\u201d and \u201cassistant\u201d could arguably contemplate one\u2019s presence or absence, we must look more closely at the context of the statute and its 2003 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b654 As indicated above, the 2003 Legislature changed the definition of \u201csignature gatherer\u201d from the individual who \u201ccollects or intends to collect\u201d signatures to the \u201cindividual who collects\u201d signatures. Section 13-27-111(4), MCA (2001 and 2003). This was done, according to the legislative history, to provide \u201cmore accountability\u201d to the signature gathering process. See \u00b6 49. Similarly, the Legislature revised the certification affidavit to require that the \u201csignature gatherer\u201d rather than the person who \u201ccirculated the petition\u201d sign the affidavit, and that the affiant swear that he or she \u201cgathered or assisted in gathering\u201d as opposed to \u201ccirculated or assisted in circulating the petition.\u201d Section 13-27-302, MCA (2001 and 2003). Again, these changes reflect the Legislature\u2019s interest in restricting rather than broadening the category of persons who could sign the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b655 While we acknowledge that the affidavit first requires the person who collected the signature to sign the affidavit but then has the affiant swear that he or she either gathered \u201cor assisted in gathering\u201d the signatures, there is no internal inconsistency. Reading the amended statutes together and giving full effect to both, it is easy to contemplate a team of signature gatherers working together, side-by-side, assisting one another in obtaining signatures, explaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>contents of the initiative or referendum, determining whether a potential signer is qualified, and advising the signers as to the information required. Under this simple scenario, either signature gatherer could attest to the signatures gathered and lawfully sign the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b656 Additionally, the affidavit provides that the affiant may submit signatures if he or she \u201cbelieves,\u201d the \u201csigners knew the contents of the petition before signing the petition.\u201d Section 13-27-302, MCA. While this language arguably imposes a lesser standard than the \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d standard argued by Opponents, it does not change our analysis or our conclusion. As we determined above, a reading of both statutes together mandates the presence of the affiant at the time a signature is gathered. Additionally, affiant must still swear to the validity of the contents of the affidavit. This would require his or her \u201cbelief\u2019 to have a reasonable foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b657  As did the District Court, we conclude that the revised language of both statutes contemplates something more than mere oversight of the process by a geographically remote affiant. As a result, we conclude that in order to lawfully swear under oath, with personal knowledge, that the affiant \u201cgathered or assisted in gathering\u201d signatures, and to swear that affiant believes that the signatures are genuine and the signers knew the contents of the petition before signing it, the affiant must be present at the time the petition is signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b658 Again, Proponents presented no evidence to refute or rebut Opponents\u2019 evidence that the five most prolific signature gatherers swore to signatures obtained outside of their presence. The strength of Opponents\u2019 argument is further bolstered by the sheer numbers of signatures submitted by these five signature gatherers and the physical impossibility that they could have been present at the time each of these signatures was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b659  We conclude that the District Court did not err when it found that Shumacher, Cook, Meyer, Rittberg, and King executed affidavits submitting signatures that were gathered outside of their presence. As a result, they could not lawfully attest to the contents of the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap2\">\u00b660 We cannot overstress our limited role as interpreters of the statutes. It is axiomatic that when interpreting a statute, we seek to implement the objectives the Legislature sought to achieve, and if the legislative intent can be determined from the plain language of the statute, the plain language controls. <em>City of Billings v. Gonzales, </em>2006 MT 24, \u00b6 8, 331 Mont. 71, \u00b6 8, 128 P.3d 1014, \u00b6 8 (internal citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>omitted). When the legislative intent cannot be readily derived from the plain language, we review the legislative history and abide by the intentions reflected therein. <em>Denial of App. For Iss. Of Beer I Wine Lic., </em>267 Mont. 298, 303, 883 Mont. 833, 836 (1994). If the Legislature actually contemplated remote signature gathering, or mere \u201ccirculation\u201d by the affiant-without more-there would have been no reason for the 2003 statutory amendments. In sum, we must apply the law as written and amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">False or Fictitious Addresses</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b661 The District Court found that all 43 of Proponents\u2019 out-of-state paid signature gatherers gave false or fictitious addresses in their certification affidavits submitted under \u00a7 13-27-302, MCA. An element of the evidence supporting this finding was a spreadsheet prepared by one of Opponents\u2019 witnesses which set forth the names and the claimed addresses of each of Proponents\u2019 signature gatherers. Boyle testified that, using an on-line data search engine, she attempted to confirm each address but was unable to do so. She stated that some of the provided addresses were hotels, retail stores or shopping centers; some were apartment complexes or personal residences at which the signature gatherer was not listed as a resident, and some addresses simply did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b662 Additionally, the District Court relied on the testimony of one of Proponents\u2019 professional petition signature gatherers, Robert Colby, who testified at a hearing before the Oklahoma Supreme Court in a similar case. Colby stated under oath in that proceeding that it was a common practice for signature gatherers to use false or fictitious addresses in an effort to conceal personal information, avoid harassment, and \u201cleave no trail.\u201d He admitted to having used a fictitious address while working for Proponents in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b663 Butcher, testifying as the sole witness for Proponents, did not refute this evidence. He did testify that he had instructed one of the out-of-state signature gatherers, Marvin King, to use Butcher\u2019s sister\u2019s home address in Billings, though the circulator was not going to stay there. Butcher stated that King could have used his sister\u2019s address as a central drop-off or pick-up location during the petition drive, but presented no evidence that King ever used the address for such purposes. Moreover, evidence was presented that at one point during the petition drive, a Billings police officer stopped at Butcher\u2019s sister\u2019s house looking for King. Butcher\u2019s sister told him that she did not know who King was and that he was not living there.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b664 Proponents argue on appeal that the District Court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>narrowly defining \u201caddress\u201d to mean a signature gatherer\u2019s residence as opposed to a place where the signature gatherer could be reached if necessary. Relying on <em>Munson v. Bay State Dredging &amp; Contracting Co., </em>50 N.E.2d 633, 636 (Mass. 1943) and <em>In re Protest of Brooks, </em>801 N.E.2d 514 (Ohio 2003), Proponents maintain that use of a temporary address, such as a hotel, satisfies the address requirement, as does any address at which the signature gatherer can be reached or where a message can be left. Proponents also argue that had they known that the 43 addresses were going to be contested, they could have verified \u201ca great deal... if not all of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b665 Opponents counter that the use of false addresses by out-of-state signature gatherers was just one example of the deceptive behavior utilized by Proponents\u2019 paid assistants. They maintain that the District Court, based on unrefuted evidence, correctly determined that the out-of-state signature gatherers attested knowingly to false addresses, i.e., addresses that were not their residences, places of business, or locations at which they could be contacted. Opponents cite <em>Kemp v. Monroe County Bd. Of Elections, </em>493 N.Y.S.2d 529 (N.Y.Sup. 1985) (overruled on other grounds by <em>Kemp v. Monroe County Bd. of Elections, </em>113 A.D.2d 1019 (N.Y. App. Div. 4th Dep\u2019t. 1985)), for the proposition that incorrect addresses on election petitions should result in invalidation of such petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b666 Opponents also assert, as discussed above, that Proponents had adequate notice that the address issue would be presented at the hearing. They maintain that as the employer of these paid out-of-state signature gatherers, Proponents should have been able to readily verify addresses and contact information as well as present some of their signature gatherers as witnesses at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b667 To resolve this issue, we must once again read the revised versions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-111(4) and 13-27-302, MCA, together. Under these statutes, the \u201csignature gatherer\u201d must sign the affidavit and provide his or her address. Presumably, the purpose of the address requirement is to provide a mechanism by which affiants may be contacted by county elections officials or the Secretary of State during the certification process. The term \u201caddress\u201d is not defined in the statutes; therefore, as we have done in the past, we use its common dictionary meaning. See \u00b6 53. \u201cAddress\u201d means \u201cthe place or the name of the place where a person, organization, or the like is located or may be reached.\u201d <em>Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.0.1), </em>Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b668 The District Court did not state in its Order that the address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>provided by the affiant must be his or her residence. In fact, the court expressly concluded that the office address provided by one of the signature gatherers was acceptable. Therefore, Proponents\u2019 contention that the District Court erroneously imposed a residence address requirement is incorrect. However, it does appear that the District Court rejected as unacceptable a hotel address or the address of other temporary quarters where a gatherer may have stayed during the signature drive. Under <em>Brooks, </em>this was arguably error. As argued by Proponents and noted in <em>Brooks, </em>such a location may satisfy the address requirement, provided the signature gatherer can actually be reached there directly or through a message. <em>Brooks, </em>\u00b6 26. The fact remains, however, that there was no proof that this requirement of Broofe-accessibility to the gatherer at the listed address-was satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b669 The rules of statutory construction require the language of a statute to be construed according to its plain meaning. <em>Ravalli County, </em>\u00b6 11. Using the ordinary everyday meaning of the words in \u00a7 13-27-302, MCA, affiants are required to provide addresses of the places where they can be reached or contacted. Substantial evidence was presented that affiants in this case did not do so but rather provided bogus or false addresses. Proponents did not refute or rebut this evidence and offered no countering testimony. The District Court, relying on the only evidence presented, concluded that the affidavits completed by these 43 signature gatherers contained false information, and as a result were tainted with illegality. <em>McDermott v. Carie, </em>\u00b6 26 (An affidavit is legally defective unless \u201c[t]he maker [has] personal knowledge of the information contained in the statement and ... swear[s] to its validity.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b670 While we do not conclude that the statute necessarily requires an affiant to provide a residential address, we do conclude that the purpose of the address requirement in the statute is the provision of a legitimate contact point so that when questions regarding the petitions arise, the person who gathered those signatures can be reached. Otherwise, the questions go unanswered, and no one-not the County, the State, or the opponents of an initiative-is able to ascertain whether there has been compliance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b671  Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that a signature gatherer must provide an address on the affidavit where he or she can be contacted throughout the collection and certification process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b672  The right of Montanans to change our constitution by initiative is a unique right granted by Article II, Section 2 of the 1972 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Montana Constitution. It is our judicial duty to preserve this right wherever possible and to decline to interfere unless it appears to be absolutely essential. <em>State ex rel. Montanans v. Waltermire, </em>231 Mont. 406, 412, 757 P.2d 746, 750 (1988). In this regard, it has long been established that initiative petitions signed and filed in accordance with applicable law are presumptively valid. <em>In re State Question No. 138, </em>244 P. 801, 803 (Okla. 1926). However, that presumption of validity may be rebutted and overcome by affirmative proof of willful fraud or procedural non-compliance. <em>State Question No. 138, </em>244 P. at 804. Once evidence is presented to rebut the presumption of validity, it is incumbent upon on the party endorsing the validity of the signatures-in this case the Proponents-to come forward with evidence to rebut or counter the damaging evidence. In the case before us, Proponents offered nothing to rebut or counter the evidence presented by Opponents that the addresses provided on the affidavits were false.</p>\n<p id=\"AcN\">\u00b673 Given that Proponents were in the best position to refute Opponents\u2019 evidence of false affidavits and bogus addresses, and their failure to do so, the District Court did not err in accepting the unrefuted evidence presented and finding that false or fictitious addresses were provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Bait and Switch</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b674 Lastly, the District Court found that it was more probable than not that a significantly large percentage of the paid, out-of-state signature gatherers working for the Proponents employed a \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactic to induce people who knowingly signed one petition to unknowingly sign the other two. The District Court relied upon six affidavits and three perpetuation depositions of petition signers who attested that they were personally misled by a signature gatherer into signing all three initiatives when they intended to sign only one. Most of these affiants also stated that they heard other signature gatherers misleading persons into signing all three petitions by claiming that, because the circulator had no carbon paper, the signer needed to sign the one petition three times. In addition to this evidence, another affiant testified that a signature gatherer had tried this tactic on her but before signing the other petitions she realized that they were different and she refused to sign them. Furthermore, a witness from the Secretary of State\u2019s Office testified that his office received complaints that this tactic was being used, and a witness working to oppose CI-97 also received reports that Proponents\u2019 signature gatherers were doing this.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b675 In contrast, two of the three Intervenors testified at the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>that they had not been subject to such a \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactic, nor had they seen signature gatherers employing such a tactic. The third Intervenor submitted an affidavit proclaiming the same. Butcher did not refute Opponents\u2019 evidence; rather, he conceded that the tactic had been used, but only for a short time.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b676 Proponents argue on appeal that the evidence presented at the hearing was insufficient to support a finding that use of the \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactic was pervasive. They cite the testimony of the Intervenors and that of a few of Opponents\u2019 witnesses who had \u201cheard about\u201d the tactic but had not personally observed it. The problem is they ignore the substantial hearsay evidence heard by the court without objection from Proponents, to the effect that this tactic was in fact being widely used, and that the Secretary of State had received multiple complaints to the same effect.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is axiomatic that a district court is free to consider hearsay testimony if there is no objection to its admission into evidence. <em>State v. Vandersloot, </em>2003 MT 179, \u00b6 27, 316 Mont. 405, \u00b6 27, 73 P.3d 174, \u00b6 27. Thus, the court had before it far more evidence of the use of the \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactic than Proponents are willing to concede on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">\u00b677 The question we must answer is whether the court\u2019s finding of pervasive use of the tactic is supported by substantial evidence. See \u00b6 19. As we note above, Opponents presented evidence of the use of this practice through testimony from two witnesses, the affidavits of seven witnesses, and the perpetuation depositions of three others. They offered the testimony of Alan Miller from the Secretary of State\u2019s office regarding the complaints that office received regarding the practice. Finally, they established through county lists of votes that an inordinately large percentage of voters signed not one but all three petitions. For example, 60.64% of Lake County petition signers signed all three petitions; 64.97% of Cascade signers and 66.9% of Flathead County signers did the same. In response, Proponents offered no evidence, nor did they object to or attempt to discredit the evidence offered by Opponents.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b678 It is the province of the District Court to weigh the evidence and resolve any conflicts between the positions of the parties. It is well established that this Court will not second-guess the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>determination regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony. Moreover, we review a district court\u2019s findings to determine whether substantial evidence supports those findings, <em>not contrary findings. Denton v. First Interstate Bank of Commerce, </em>2006 MT 193, \u00b6 43, 333 Mont. 169, \u00b6 43, 142 P.3d 797, \u00b6 43 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b679  While \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d cannot be definitively quantified, we have previously stated that \u201c[substantial evidence is the amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>2000 MT 67, \u00b6 20,299 Mont. 78, \u00b6 20, 996 P.2d 389, \u00b6 20. Once Opponents established that Proponents\u2019 signature gatherers were engaging in deceptive practices, it became Proponents\u2019 burden to produce evidence to the contrary. Section 26-1-401, MCA. They failed to do so. Therefore, we conclude that the District Comb\u2019s finding and conclusion that Proponent\u2019s signature gatherers\u2019 deceptive actions were pervasive was based on substantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Invalidation of Signatures</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b680 The District Court ultimately concluded that these three unlawful practices- certification of signatures that were not signed in the presence of the affiant, false addresses, and bait and switch tactics-resulted in legally defective certification affidavits and constituted a \u201cpervasive and general pattern and practice of fraud and conscious circumvention of procedural safeguards,\u201d in violation of state laws relating to qualification of an initiative on the ballot. As it was impossible to precisely identify which certified signatures were untainted by Proponents\u2019 signature gatherers\u2019 various deceptive practices, the District Court invalidated all signatures gathered by all of Proponents\u2019 out-of-state paid workers. As a result the Secretary of State\u2019s certifications of CI-97, CI-98, and 1-154 were likewise invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b681 Proponents maintain that the District Court erred by grouping all out-of-state signature gatherers together and invalidating all of their signatures. Without supporting authority, they assert that the signatures of each signature gatherer should have been contested on an individual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b682 Opponents submit that the District Court correctly invalidated the certified signatures gathered by the paid out-of-state signature gatherers based on substantial, unrefuted evidence of the pervasive illegalities and deceptive practices established at the hearing, and the impossibility of distinguishing which signatures were gathered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>accordance with the statutory requirements and which were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b683  As did the District Court, we conclude that the filing of a false affidavit by a signature gatherer is \u201cmore than a technicality\u201d in that it destroys the primary procedural safeguard for ensuring the integrity of the signature gathering process. The Maine Supreme Court, addressing a similar situation, recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">[I]t is evident that the circulator\u2019s role in a citizens\u2019 initiative is pivotal. Indeed, the integrity of the initiative and referendum process in many ways hinges on the trustworthiness and veracity of the circulator. In reviewing the signatures gathered by the circulators, the Secretary [of State] has the ability to verify... that a signing voter is actually registered and therefore permitted to vote. In contrast, the Secretary has no way, without engaging in a separate investigation, to verify that a signing voter actually signed the petition. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">In addition to obtaining truthful information from the circulator, the oath is intended to assure that the circulator is impressed with the seriousness of his or her obligation to honesty ... and to assure that the person taking the oath is clearly identified should questions arise regarding particular signatures. ... As early as 1917, we held that verification of the signatures and the subsequent oath taken by the circulator is an \u201cindispensable accompaniment of a valid petition,\u201d and, accordingly, that the invalidation of signatures lacking this prerequisite is necessary to preserve the integrity of the initiative and referendum process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APk\"><em>Taxpayers Action Network v. Sec. of State, </em>795 A.2d 75, 80 (Me. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"AvE\">\u00b684 Other courts have also invalidated signatures upon a finding that the signature gatherers did not comply with the applicable statutory requirements. See <em>State Question No. 138, </em>244 P. at 804 (invalidating signatures collected by persons other than the affiant); <em>Weisberger v. Cohen, </em>22 N.Y.S.2d 1011, 1012 (N.Y. 1940) (the only sure way to prevent fraud is to invalidate all signatures tainted by fraud); <em>In Matter of Lombardi v. State Board of Elections, </em>54 A.D.2d 532, (N.Y. App. Div. 3rd Dep\u2019t., 1976) (court invalidates two entire sheets of signatures when they were \u201cpermeated with fraud\u201d); and <em>Citizens Committee v. DC Bd. Of Elections, </em>860 A.2d 813, 818 (D.C. 2004) (\u201cIn cases of proven false signing of affidavits, the Board thus has undeniable authority to strike whole petition sheets associated with that impropriety.\u201d). Additionally, the Secretary of State may reject any petition that does not meet the statutory requirements. Section 13-27-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>307, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b685  Some will argue that use of a \u201cbait and switch\u201d tactic does not warrant the invalidation of the signatures on the \u201cbait\u201d petition, as many persons arguably signed it voluntarily and knowingly. Others may claim that invalidating signatures due to the use of false addresses by 43 signature gatherers is excessive, and an elevation of form over substance. However, it bears emphasis that we are not deciding this case based solely on a conclusion that one or the other event occurred in isolation. As did the District Court, we consider here the totality of the circumstances of the claims before us, as well as the totality of the unrefuted evidence presented by Opponents without substantial objection from Proponents. Taking account of all the evidence, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it invalidated the signatures of Proponents\u2019 out-of-state signature gatherers that were obtained in a manner that did not comply with Montana statutes and were tainted by or associated with deceptive practices and misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b686 We acknowledge that many voters feel strongly that they should have the opportunity to vote on one or more of these initiatives, and that these people will feel disenfranchised by our decision. This is extremely regrettable. The fact remains, however, that if the initiative process is to remain viable and retain its integrity, those invoking it must comply with the laws passed by our Legislature. We can neither excuse nor overlook violations of these laws, for to do so here would confer free reign for others to do so in other matters. We must enforce the law as written and as the Legislature intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b687 County administrators are instructed not to count the votes for CI-97, CI-98 and 1-154 to the extent that this is technically feasible. If the votes must be counted, they will have no force or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\u00b688 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Invalidating Certification of CI-98, CI-97, and 1-154.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS, NELSON, LEAPHART and DISTRICT JUDGE MIZNER, sitting for JUSTICE RICE and DISTRICT JUDGE HONZEL, sitting for JUSTICE WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\"> Section 13-27-207, MCA (2005), was revised by federal district court order in <em>Montana Public Interest Research Group v.
