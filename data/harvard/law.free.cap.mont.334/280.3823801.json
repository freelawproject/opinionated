We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court properly adjudicated A.S. as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in terminating S.B.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">\u00b66 A.S. was born on September 4,2001, to S.B., the mother, and S.S., the father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When A.S. was about three months old, the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) removed A.S. from her parents\u2019 care when it concluded that S.B. and S.S. were cooking methamphetamine (meth) in the room across from AS.\u2019s bedroom. As a result, both S.B. and S.S. were charged with drug offenses and DPHHS was given temporary legal custody of A.S. After S.B. successfully completed her treatment plan, DPHHS returned A.S. to her care and the District Court granted DPHHS\u2019s motion to dismiss the Petition for Temporary Legal Custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">\u00b67 On October 10, 2002, DPHHS filed a second Petition for Emergency Protective Services, Adjudication as a Youth in Need of Care and Temporary Legal Custody of A.S. This second petition was based upon an October 9,2002 referral from the Missouri River Drug Task Force. Law enforcement officers from the task force had conducted a probationary search of S.B.\u2019s residence and discovered bindles of meth in the bedroom, a digital scale, empty paper bindles, paper used to make bindles, and 3.2 grams of meth on S.B.\u2019s person. A.S., who was only thirteen months old, was at home with S.B. at the time of the search. Officers arrested S.B. and charged her with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Criminal Possession of Dangerous Drugs with Intent to Distribute. Consequently, at the time DPHHS filed for temporary legal custody of A.S., S.B. was in the Gallatin County Detention Center and S.S. was incarcerated at the Montana State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b68 The District Court entered an Order for Immediate Protection, appointed an attorney for S.B. and a guardian ad litem for A.S. The court also scheduled a show cause hearing for October 22, 2002. According to a report prepared by the guardian ad litem, S.B. admitted that she had been using meth for about six weeks prior to her arrest. She also admitted that she intended to use the drugs the officers found in her possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b69 The court record reflects that at the October 22, 2002 show cause hearing, S.B. stipulated that there was probable cause for the court to leave the emergency petition in place. Hence, the court entered an order in which it found that there was probable cause to believe that A.S. was abused or neglected or in danger of being abused or neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"A0g\">\u00b610 Even though the court scheduled an adjudicatory hearing for January 8, 2003, the next hearing actually occurred on November 26, 2002. Because this hearing was labeled as a \u201cdispositional\u201d hearing, the judge inquired of the parties if there had been \u201csome agreement regarding the adjudicatory nature in this matter.\u201d Counsel for DPHHS responded that there had been and that she had a treatment plan for the court\u2019s consideration. Neither S.B. nor her counsel objected. The judge asked S.B.\u2019s counsel if he had an opportunity to review the treatment plan with S.B. and counsel responded that he had. Counsel also stated that S.B. admitted that she had been using meth prior to her arrest. The judge subsequently approved the treatment plan and S.B. signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b611 On November 29, 2002, the District Court filed an Order of Adjudication and Disposition, wherein it adjudicated A.S. as a youth in need of care; awarded DPHHS temporary legal custody of A.S. for six months; and scheduled a review hearing for January 8, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b612 By the time of the January 8, 2003 review hearing, S.B. had completed a chemical dependency evaluation and was awaiting inpatient treatment and sentencing in her criminal case. Because of the uncertainty of S.B.\u2019s situation, the review hearing was postponed several times and DPHHS continued to have temporary legal custody of A.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u00b613 On March 6, 2003, DPHHS reported that S.B. was in treatment at the Montana Chemical Dependency Center (MCDC). S.B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>subsequently completed her treatment at MCDC and returned to the Park County Recovery House.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b614 On May 30, 2003, S.B. appeared with counsel and explained that she received a suspended sentence for her recent drug conviction. She stated that she had completed inpatient chemical dependency treatment; that she was participating in outpatient treatment; and that she had been sober for eight months. DPHHS requested that the court extend its temporary legal custody of A.S. and approve an amended treatment plan for S.B. S.B. objected to the portion of the amended treatment plan that required her to participate in hair analysis drug tests, arguing that she was concerned about their reliability. The court extended DPHHS\u2019s temporary legal custody of A.S. and approved the treatment plan with certain modifications, but did not specifically authorize hair analysis testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b615 At the next review hearing on July 25, 2003, DPHHS reported that S.B. was doing well with her treatment plan and recommended that the court extend temporary legal custody for six months. DPHHS also recommended that A.S. spend two and one-half days each week with S.B. with a gradual increase in time until A.S. was with S.B. full time. The parties and the court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b616 In mid-September 2003, S.B.\u2019s urinalysis field tests preliminarily tested positive for drugs. The tests were sent off for confirmation and came back negative for the presence of drugs. Even though S.B.\u2019s tests tested negative a second time, DPHHS suspended S.B.\u2019s unsupervised visits with A.S. until the District Court could review the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b617 At a hearing held on September 26,2003, DPHHS requested that S.B. undergo drug testing in the form of hair analysis, contending that S.B. had a history of using masking agents to manipulate urinalysis testing. S.B. again objected to the hair analysis tests. The court determined that since S.B. denied using drugs and since she objected to hair analysis testing, other testing methods, such as a patch, could be used. The court also ordered that S.B. be allowed to resume the unsupervised visits with A.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u00b618 On October 9,2003, a Highway Patrol Officer pulled S.B. over for speeding. After S.B. consented to a search, the officer found a syringe and over $300.00 in cash in S.B.\u2019s purse. Although S.B. denied using meth that day, she admitted to the officer that she had used meth a couple of days prior to the stop and that she was on her way to a bar where she might be tempted to purchase meth.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\u00b619 The following day, S.B.\u2019s probation and parole officer conducted a search of S.B.\u2019s residence and found a substance used to cleanse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>hair of any toxins so that the individual could pass a hair analysis test. After the officer found two syringes in S.B.\u2019s purse, S.B. admitted that she had used meth. The officer arrested S.B. for violating her probation. Upon her release, S.B. was allowed to remain in the Recovery House. However, in November 2003, S.B. was terminated from services at Recovery House for breaking the rules by staying out all night.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b620 On November 6, 2003, DPHHS filed a Motion for Permanency Hearing as required by \u00a7 41-3-455, MCA. Shortly thereafter, the guardian ad litem filed a report recommending that the court consider terminating S.B.\u2019s parental rights to A.S. because of S.B.\u2019s relapse and her arrest for probation violations. The District Court conducted a review hearing on November 14, 2003. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court ordered that S.B.\u2019s visits with A.S. be supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"A2-\">\u00b621 During November and December of 2003, S.B. wore a series of patches used to test for the presence of drugs. At least two of these patches tested positive for meth while two others showed signs of being tampered with, thus, the integrity of the results of those two tests was compromised. As a result of S.B.\u2019s positive tests and her admissions of recent drug use, DPHHS filed a petition to terminate S.B.\u2019s parental rights to A.S. on January 23, 2004. At the time the termination petition was filed, A.S. had been in foster care just over 15 months. The District Court conducted a hearing on the petition on March 12 and 30, 2004. After receiving testimony from S.B., her social worker, and others involved in her treatment plan, the District Court terminated S.B.\u2019s parental rights to A.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b622 In its April 1, 2004 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Terminating Parental Rights, the District Court found that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship would likely result in continued abuse or neglect and that dismissing DPHHS\u2019s petition would create a substantial risk of harm to A.S. or would be a detriment to A.S.\u2019s physical or psychological well-being. The court concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that S.B. had not complied with the treatment plan and that the conduct or condition rendering S.B. unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b623 S.B. did not file a Notice of Appeal until October 17, 2005, more than one and a half years after the District Court issued its order. However, because counsel for DPHHS did not file a Notice of Entry of Judgment until November 7, 2005, DPHHS considered S.B.\u2019s appeal to be timely since the time for filing a Notice of Appeal does not begin to run until the losing party is served with Notice of Entry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Judgment. <em>See In re T.H., </em>2005 MT 237, \u00b6 16, 328 Mont. 428, \u00b6 16, 121 P.3d 541, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b624 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights to determine whether the lower court abused its discretion. <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of C.J.K., </em>2005 MT 67, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 289, \u00b6 13, 109 P.3d 232, \u00b6 13 (citing In <em>re J.V., </em>2003 MT 68, \u00b6 7, 314 Mont. 487, \u00b6 7, 67 P.3d 242, \u00b6 7). The test for an abuse of discretion is \u201cwhether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d C.J.K., \u00b6 13 (quoting <em>In re K.C.H., </em>2003 MT 125, \u00b6 11, 316 Mont. 13, \u00b6 11, 68 P.3d 788, \u00b6 11). However, because a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, it must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>C.J.K., </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>J.V., </em>\u00b6 7). To satisfy the relevant statutory requirements for terminating a parent-child relationship, a district court must make specific factual findings and we review those findings to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. C.J.K., \u00b6 13. We also review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly. <em>C.J.K., </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>J.V.,\\1).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\u00b625  In determining whether to terminate parental rights, the district court is bound to give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child, thus the best interests of the child are of paramount concern and take precedence over the parental rights. <em>C.J.K., </em>\u00b6 14 (citing \u00a7 41-3-609(3), MCA). In addition, the party seeking to terminate parental rights must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory requirements for termination have been met. <em>C.J.K., </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>J.V., 18).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\u00b626 <em>Whether the District Court properly adjudicated A. S. as a youth in need of care.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\u00b627 The District Court had scheduled an adjudicatory hearing for January 8, 2003. While it is not apparent from the record how it occurred, instead of waiting for the January 2003 hearing, the parties appeared before the court on November 26,2002. Because this hearing was labeled as a \u201cdispositional\u201d hearing, the judge expressed his confusion since there could be no disposition prior to adjudication and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the ajudicatory hearing had not yet occurred. The judge inquired of the parties if there had been \u201csome agreement regarding the adjudicatory nature in this matter.\u201d Counsel for DPHHS responded that there had been and that she had a treatment plan for the court\u2019s consideration. None of the other attorneys present disagreed with counsel\u2019s representation to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b628 At the time of the November 2002 hearing, S.B. was incarcerated as a result of her recent arrest for a drug-related offense. The judge asked S.B.\u2019s counsel if he had an opportunity to review the treatment plan with S.B. and counsel responded that he had and that S.B. wished to complete the treatment plan. Prior to approving the treatment plan, the judge specifically questioned S.B. as to whether she had an opportunity to review it and whether she had any questions. The court recalled that A.S. had already been removed from S.B.\u2019s care once before because S.B. and S.S. were cooking meth in the home. While that case had come to a successful resolution for S.B., S.B. was now before the court again in the very same position. The judge asked S.B. what she had learned in the year since she last appeared before him. S.B. admitted that she was addicted to meth, that she was in need of treatment, and that her addiction had created a very unfair situation for A.S. The court subsequently approved the treatment plan and S.B. signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b629 S.B. now contends that although she agreed to a treatment plan, she never admitted that A.S. met the legal definition of a \u201cyouth in need of care,\u201d nor did she stipulate that A.S. was in need of care. S.B. admits that she did stipulate to a temporary extension of the treatment plan until a hearing could occur wherein S.B. could argue for placement of A.S. with her. The State asserts on the other hand that the District Court properly adjudicated A.S. as a youth in need of care based upon S.B.\u2019s own admissions that she was addicted to meth and in need of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b630 To adjudicate a child as a youth in need of care, DPHHS must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the child has suffered from abuse or neglect by a parent. Section 41-3-102(3), MCA. The abuse may be actual physical or psychological harm to a child or substantial risk of physical or psychological harm to a child by acts or omissions of a person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare. Section 41-3-102(7), MCA. Parents in such proceedings may stipulate that their child meets the definition of a \u201cyouth in need of care\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence without waiving any factual dispute to the allegations. Section 41-3-434(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>\u00b631 The District Court\u2019s Order following the November 2002 hearing stated that S.B. stipulated that A.S. met the definition of a youth in need of care by a preponderance of the evidence and that the court questioned S.B. on her understanding of the stipulation and ramifications of that decision. However, a review of the record indicates that S.B. did not so stipulate and the court did not question her about her understanding of the stipulation and ramifications of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b632 Rather than allowing counsel for DPHHS to speak for S.B. and state that there had been an agreement regarding adjudication, the District Court should have specifically inquired of S.B. or her counsel whether S.B. stipulated to finding A.S. a youth in need of care. Nevertheless, in this case, it was appropriate for the court to find A.S. a youth in need of care based upon S.B.\u2019s own admissions, which she made in the presence of her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b633 As we stated earlier in this Opinion, because a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest, it must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>C.J.K., </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>J.V., </em>\u00b6 7). In addition, \u201c[flundamental fairness and due process require that a parent not be placed at an unfair disadvantage during the termination proceedings.\u201d <em>In re A.N.W., </em>2006 MT 42, \u00b6 34, 331 Mont. 208, \u00b6 34, 130 P.3d 619, \u00b6 34 (citing <em>In re A.S., </em>2004 MT 62, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 268, \u00b6 12, 87 P.3d 408, \u00b6 12; <em>Matter of A.S.A, </em>258 Mont. 194, 198, 852 P.2d 127, 129 (1993); <em>In re A.R., </em>2004 MT 22, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 340, \u00b6 11, 83 P.3d 1287, \u00b6 11). However, we have also stated that \u201c[a]s a practical matter... pre-termination hearings entitle the parent to less process than the actual termination proceedings.\u201d <em>A.N.W., </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b634  Based on the facts in this case, we cannot conclude that S.B. was placed at an unfair disadvantage during the termination proceedings. S.B. was represented by counsel at all stages of the proceedings. She had an opportunity to speak on her own behalf at the adjudicatory hearing and she testified at that time that the representations her counsel made on her behalf at that hearing were accurate. S.B. admitted that she was addicted to meth, that she needed treatment, and that her addiction impacted A.S. unfairly. It was undisputed that S.B. was incarcerated on a felony drug charge awaiting disposition and that A.S.\u2019s father was in prison for a drug conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b635 Neither S.B. nor her counsel objected to the statements made by counsel for DPHHS that there had been an agreement regarding the adjudication in this matter. Moreover, as the State points out in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>brief on appeal, S.B.\u2019s acquiescence in A.S.\u2019s adjudication is further demonstrated by the fact that the adjudication is referenced in almost every court document leading up to the termination hearing. However, in the almost 16 months between the adjudicatory hearing and the termination hearing, S.B. never objected or even indicated to the court that there were any irregularities in the adjudicatory proceeding. It was not until she filed her brief on appeal that she brought up this issue. We have repeatedly stated that \u201cwe will not fault a district court for failing to address statutory deficiencies that are not brought to its attention during the proceedings because doing so would encourage litigants, to withhold objections rather than raise the issues appropriately in the district court.\u201d <em>A.N.</em>W., \u00b6 41 (citing <em>In re </em>T.E., 2002 MT 195, \u00b6 23, 311 Mont. 148, \u00b6 23, 54 P.3d 38, \u00b6 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b636 Indeed, it was an additional 19 months from the time of the termination hearing until S.B. filed her Notice of Appeal. While we stated previously in this Opinion that we, nevertheless, had to consider S.B.\u2019s appeal to be timely, <em>see </em>\u00b6 24, the fact remains that a considerable amount of time passed before the appeal was filed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">Section 41-3-604(1), MCA, entitled \u201c[w]hen petition to terminate parental rights required\u201d presumes that if a child has been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months, it is in the best interests of the child to terminate parental rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\"><em>A.N.</em>W., \u00b6 54. Here, almost 16 months passed between the adjudicatory hearing and the termination hearing, and an additional 19 months passed between the termination hearing and the filing of the Notice of Appeal, a total of 35 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\u00b637  To reverse the District Court\u2019s termination order and remand for further proceedings now, as the dissent wishes to do, would simply be a matter of prolonging the inevitable based upon the requirements of \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA. The best interests of the child are of paramount concern and must take precedence over the parental rights. C.J.K., \u00b6 14 (citing \u00a7 41-3-609(3), MCA). We cannot conclude that it would be in A.S.\u2019s best interests to prolong this matter when much of the delay was caused because S.B. relapsed time and again and failed to put her child\u2019s needs above her desire to indulge her addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\u00b638 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court properly adjudicated A.S. as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u00b639 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u00b640 S.B. contends that the District Court made several errors in its findings of fact because it attributed certain testimony to the wrong witnesses; it picked out only negative aspects of the testimony; and it ignored testimony in support of reuniting S.B. with A.S. The State contends that although the court did erroneously attribute pieces of information to one witness rather than to another, the underlying facts are amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b641 The facts presented at the termination hearing established that although S.B. was moving towards successful completion of her treatment plan, she began using meth again and, as a result of her decision to use, S.B. was terminated from her treatment program and had to move out of the recovery house where she resided. Consequently, instead of the time she spent with A.S. being increased, S.B.\u2019s time with her daughter was scaled back.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b642 S.B. was also arrested for numerous drug-related probation violations and drug-related offenses. Once she was released from jail, S.B. continued to use meth and she did not seek the services available to her. At the termination hearing, S.B. admitted that she did not successfully complete her treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b643 Even discarding the findings of which S.B. complains, there is still overwhelming evidence (including S.B.\u2019s own admissions) that S.B was actively using meth and other dangerous drugs up until the time of the termination hearing. For example, S.B. argues that the District Comb should not have allowed testimony regarding the results of patch tests because there is no demonstrated accuracy of this type of testing. However, although S.B. did object to hair analysis tests, she never objected to the use of patch tests and she agreed in her amended treatment plan to submit to this type of testing. As the State points out in its brief on appeal, if S.B. was concerned about the accuracy of patch tests, the time to raise the concern was during the hearing regarding her amended treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u00b644  While it is true that the court attributed certain testimony regarding S.B.\u2019s drug use to the wrong witnesses, the fact remains that testimony by reliable witnesses regarding S.B.\u2019s continued drug use was elicited at the termination hearing. And, contrary to S.B.\u2019s contention that the lower court disregarded the positive testimony provided about her at the termination hearing, the court\u2019s findings of fact do highlight the things S.B. did well, such as her successful completion of inpatient treatment. Unfortunately, despite all of S.B.\u2019s accomplishments and her periods of sobriety, the record reflects that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>S.B. continued to use meth and other dangerous drugs up to the time of the termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b645 Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s ultimate finding that dismissing DPHHS\u2019s petition to terminate S.B.\u2019s parental rights would create a substantial risk of harm to A.S. or would be a detriment to A.S.\u2019s physical or psychological well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b646 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in terminating S.B.\u2019s parental rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b647 A district cotut may terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care; an appropriate court-approved treatment plan has not been complied with or has been unsuccessful; and the conduct or condition rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable period of time.

We must consider \u201cexcessive use of intoxicating liquor or of a narcotic or dangerous drug that affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child.\u201d Section 41-3-609(2)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b649 S.B. contends that the record is clear that she maintained her sobriety from November 26,2002, to October 8,2003, and that the only remaining issue on September 26, 2003, was that she needed to arrange for daycare and show DPHHS her budget which she had been working on with her treatment provider. S.B. admits, however, that in October and November 2003, she began to relapse. She argues that, rather than provide her with support services, DPHHS opted to terminate her parental rights based on these relapses and the fact that A.S. had been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months. S.B. claims that the termination of her parental rights was not justified because DPHHS did not prove that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b650 The State asserts that despite S.B.\u2019s successful completion of some aspects of the treatment plan, S.B. did not successfully complete the treatment plan because she continued to use meth and, as a result of her meth addiction, S.B. was facing new criminal charges and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>numerous probation violations. In fact, her probation officer testified that S.B.\u2019s violations were increasing rather than decreasing. In addition, S.B. failed to steadily maintain employment and, at the time of the termination hearing, S.B. was not employed and had no plan in place for supporting her daughter or herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b651  This court will not reweigh conflicting evidence or substitute its judgment regarding the strength of the evidence for that of the district court. <em>In re A.F., </em>2003 MT 254, \u00b6 24, 317 Mont. 367, \u00b6 24, 77 P.3d 266, \u00b6 24 <em>(citing In re M.T., </em>2002 MT 174, \u00b6 29, 310 Mont. 506, \u00b6 29, 51 P.3d 1141, \u00b6 29; <em>In re E.K., </em>2001 MT 279, \u00b6 43, 307 Mont. 328, \u00b6 43, 37 P.3d 690, \u00b6 43). Moreover, pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, \u201c[i]f a child has been in foster care under the physical custody of the state for 15 months of the most recent 22 months, the best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by termination of parental rights.\u201d By the time of the termination hearing, A.S. had been in foster care for more than 17 months, but rather than make every effort to maintain her sobriety so that she could once again parent her child, the number of S.B.\u2019s relapses increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b652  We hold that the District Court correctly concluded that the conduct or condition rendering S.B. unfit to parent A.S. was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. S.B. had been given every opportunity to maintain her sobriety, but despite all of the resources available to her, her addiction to meth was stronger than her desire to maintain her sobriety and parent her child. Under these circumstances, it was incumbent upon the District Court to consider the best interests of the child and the court correctly concluded that termination of S.B.\u2019s parental rights to A.S. was in A.S.\u2019s best interests. \u00b653 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-15\"> This appeal involves the termination of only S.B.\u2019s parental rights to A.S.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b314-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b654 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s Opinion on Issue 1.1 would hold that no adjudication occurred in this case, either via an adjudicatory hearing or a stipulation by the mother that the child was a youth in need of care. Moreover, since the termination order reflects this omission in that it does not contain the finding required by \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(i), MCA-namely, that the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care-I would reverse that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\u00b655 In cases involving petitions to terminate parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, <em>\u201ca </em>district court cannot obtain jurisdictional authority to award [DPHHS] permanent legal custody absent such proper adjudication pursuant to the hearing mandated by \u00a7 41-3-404, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>MCA [recodified as \u00a7 41-3-437, MCA].\u201d <em>In re </em>F.M., 2002 MT 180, \u00b6 29, 311 Mont. 35, \u00b6 29, 53 P.3d 368, \u00b6 29 (citing <em>In re Custody of M.W., </em>2001 MT 78, \u00b6 46, 305 Mont. 80, \u00b6 46, 23 P.3d 206, \u00b6 46, and <em>Matter of M.J.W., </em>1998 MT 142, \u00b6 11, 289 Mont. 232, \u00b6 11, 961 P.2d 105, \u00b6 11). A statutory exception to the requirement for an adjudicatory hearing exists, of course, pursuant to which a parent may stipulate that \u201cthe child meets the definition of a youth in need of care by the preponderance of the evidence^]\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-434(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b656 In the present case, the Court admits quite candidly that the sole basis for the adjudication stated by the District Court simply does not exist on this record. Specifically, the District Court\u2019s Order of Adjudication states that the child\u2019s mother \u201cstipulated that the youth met the definition of a \u2018youth in need of care\u2019 by the preponderance of the evidence. The Court questioned the youth\u2019s mother on her understanding of the stipulation and the ramifications of their [sic] decision[,]\u201d and, thereupon, adjudicated the child as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b657 As a matter of record, no such stipulation by the mother occurred and the District Court did not question the mother on her understanding of the purported stipulation and its ramifications. Indeed, the entirety of the record on this subject is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">THE COURT: I note that this matter is set for a dispositional hearing. Has there been some agreement regarding the adjudicatory nature in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">[DEPUTY COUNTY ATTORNEY]: Yes, Your Honor. I have a treatment plan here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">THE COURT: Very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">[DEPUTY COUNTY ATTORNEY]: May I approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">THE COURT: You may. [Mother\u2019s counsel], have you had an opportunity to review this treatment plan with S.B.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD2\">[MOTHER\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Neither the mother nor her counsel stipulated to anything relating to the State\u2019s burden to prove the child was a youth in need of care by a preponderance of the evidence, and the District Court-not surprisingly-had no conversation with the mother about the nonexistent stipulation. Moreover, the deputy county attorneys reference to a treatment plan-in response to the District Court\u2019s inquiry about \u201csome agreement regarding the adjudicatory nature in this matter\u201d-in no way satisfies the requirement for a stipulation regarding youth in need of care status or, in the alternative, an adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u00b658 The statutes relating to termination pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(1)\u00a9, MCA, are clear in their requirement for either a stipulation or an adjudicatory hearing. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-3-434(1) and -437, MCA. Our jurisprudence is equally clear. We consistently have held that the adjudication of a child as a youth in need of care is a threshold requirement, without which a person\u2019s parental rights may not be terminated under \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA. <em>See, e.g., In re </em>M.B., 2004 MT 304, \u00b6 16, 323 Mont. 468, \u00b6 16, 100 P.3d 1006, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted); <em>In re </em>B.N.Y., 2003 MT 241, \u00b6 22, 317 Mont. 291, \u00b6 22, 77 P.3d 189, \u00b6 22 (citations omitted); <em>In re </em>M.O., 2003 MT 4, \u00b6 12, 314 Mont. 13, \u00b6 12, 62 P.3d 265, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). We also have held that a district court must adequately address each applicable statutory requirement before terminating an individual\u2019s parental rights. <em>In re </em>B.B., 2006 MT 66, \u00b6 18, 331 Mont. 407, \u00b6 18, 133 P.3d 215, \u00b6 18 (citations omitted). Similarly, we have admonished that child abuse and neglect cases must be conducted in strict compliance with relevant statutes. <em>See Inquiry into M.M., </em>274 Mont. 166, 174, 906 P.2d 675, 680 (1995); <em>Matter of F.H., </em>266 Mont. 36, 40, 878 P.2d 890, 893 (1994). The Court is apparently willing to overlook both the statutes and our jurisprudence. I am not.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b659 We also have held, many times, that proceedings involving the termination of parental rights must meet the due process requirements guaranteed by the Montana and United States Constitutions. Stated differently, a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child represents a fundamental liberty interest and, consequently, fundamentally fair procedures must apply at all stages in proceedings to terminate parental rights. <em>See, e.g., In re A.N.W., </em>2006 MT 42, \u00b6 34, 331 Mont. 208, \u00b6 34, 130 P.3d 619, \u00b6 34 (citations omitted); <em>In re V.F.A, </em>2005 MT 76, \u00b6 6, 326 Mont. 383, \u00b6 6, 109 P.3d 749, \u00b6 6 (citation omitted); <em>In reA.S., </em>2004 MT 62, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 268, \u00b6 12, 87 P.3d 408, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted); <em>In re B.N.Y., </em>\u00b6 21 (citation omitted). Again, the Court apparently is willing to disregard our jurisprudence, and this mother\u2019s constitutional rights. I am not.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b660 Stating a parent is entitled, as a practical matter, to less due process at pre-termination hearings than at actual termination proceedings, the Court concludes S.B. was not placed at an unfair disadvantage because she was represented by counsel and did not object at the purported adjudicatory hearing. The Court points to no case, however, in which we have held that a parent must assert that an adjudication has not occurred-let alone that the district court has not made a finding regarding adjudication in the termination order-to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>preserve the issue for appeal. Indeed, in a termination proceeding under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, it is the petitioner\u2019s burden to establish by clear and convincing evidence-not the parent\u2019s burden to establish a lack of evidence-that the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care. See <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of D.T., </em>2002 MT 232, \u00b6 10, 311 Mont. 463, \u00b6 10, 56 P.3d 859, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted). Moreover, the primary reason that we decline to address issues raised for the first time on appeal is that it is unfair to fault the trial court on an issue it never had the opportunity to consider. <em>See, e.g., Kallowat v. State, </em>2004 MT 152, \u00b6 12, 321 Mont. 501, \u00b6 12, 92 P.3d 1176, \u00b6 12 (citation omitted). The District Court\u2019s termination order recites the statutory requirement for a finding that the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care, but does not contain such a finding. These circumstances suggest, at least, that the District Court had the opportunity to consider whether an adjudication occurred and determined-correctly, in my view-that the required finding was not supported by the record. For these reasons, I would conclude our rule regarding issues raised for the first time on appeal does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">\u00b661 As its primary justification for the decision it reaches here, the Court sets forth the mother\u2019s admissions-about her addiction, the impacts of her addiction on her child, and her need for treatment-as well as the undisputed facts that the mother was incarcerated awaiting disposition on a felony drug charge and the father was in prison for a drug conviction. It is true these matters are of record. It also is true that none of these matters relate to an adjudication that the child is a youth in need of care. Indeed, the mother did not <em>testify </em>to the referenced matters; her statements came during a discussion with the District Court about the treatment plan, a discussion that should have occurred <em>after </em>either a stipulation or an adjudication based on the preponderance of the evidence presented that the child is a youth in need of care. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-3-434(2) and -443(1), MCA; <em>In re B.N.Y., </em>\u00b6 24. Nor does the fact that the mother was incarcerated at the time of the <em>dispositional </em>hearing excuse the utter lack of an <em>adjudicatory </em>hearing-or stipulation-required for a youth in need of care determination. Finally, the father\u2019s imprisonment has no bearing on whether the child was adjudicated as a youth in need of care with respect to the mother. <em>See In re Custody of M.W., </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">\u00b662 The simple facts remain: no stipulation, no adjudicatory hearing and no proof from the State that the child was a youth in need of care. Thus, the entire basis upon which the District Court purportedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>adjudicated the child as a youth in need of care, set forth above, is a fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b663 Setting forth \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-604(1) and -609(3), MCA, and language from our prior cases, the Court also reasons that termination is in A.S.\u2019s best interests and, given the time factors outlined in \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA, reversing and remanding would \u201cprolong!] the inevitable.\u201d I recently urged-unsuccessfully-that our recognition of a district court\u2019s obligation to give paramount consideration to the child\u2019s best interests was not appropriately invoked as a <em>post hoc </em>rationalization for a petitioner\u2019s failure to present, and a court\u2019s failure to receive, evidence at a termination hearing. <em>See In re A.T., </em>2006 MT 35, \u00b6 31, 331 Mont. 155, \u00b6 31, 130 P.3d 1249, \u00b6 31 (Gray, C.J., dissenting). Similarly, here, I do not believe our recognition of a district court\u2019s consideration of the child\u2019s best interests \u201cerases\u201d the due process violation that occurred when S.B.\u2019s parental rights were terminated under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, without a prior adjudication of the child as a youth in need of care or a finding in the termination order that the child was so adjudicated. Nor do I agree with the Court\u2019s statement that reversing and remanding in this case would \u201cprolong the inevitable,\u201d as such \u201cends justifies the means\u201d reasoning-taken to its logical extent-could eventually vitiate all due process rights afforded to parents by Montana statutes and our cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b664 I am saddened by the Court\u2019s facile resolution of this case. I had thought we were moving toward consistently implementing the principles set out so often and so clearly in our jurisprudence. Apparently I was wrong. Ordinarily, I do not mind being wrong. I do mind here. If this Court will not hold district courts and county attorneys to the requirements so clearly spelled out by the Montana Legislature, who will? What -will become of a parent\u2019s supposed constitutional liberty interest in the care and custody of her child? And, finally and most importantly, what will become of Montana\u2019s children whose best interests might be served by reunification with their parents absent this Court\u2019s benign neglect and disregard for statutorily required procedures?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b665 I would reverse the District Court on the adjudication issue and also reverse the termination order on the grounds that it did not rest upon a valid adjudication of the child as a youth in need of care. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
