Nelson</author>\n<p id=\"AlN\">delivered the Opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">\u00b61 James and Ida Stanley (\u201cthe Stanleys\u201d) filed suit against Lillian Lemire (\u201cLemire\u201d) in the Cascade County Justice Court, seeking possession of the real property on which Lemire was residing plus unpaid \u201crent,\u201d costs of the suit, and attorney fees. Following a jury trial, the Justice Court entered judgment in favor of the Stanleys except on their claim for unpaid \u201crent,\u201d and this judgment was affirmed by the District Court for the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County, on all issues except the award of fees and costs. Lemire now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">\u00b63 1. Does this Court have jurisdiction over Lemire\u2019s appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in its determination that the Justice Court retained subject matter jurisdiction over the Stanleys\u2019 action against Lemire after she asserted a claim of title to the real property in dispute?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in affirming the Justice Court\u2019s determination that the Stanleys were entitled to an award of attorney fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND I. The \u201cRental Contract\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">\u00b66 This case arises out of a dispute involving real property located at 1701 13th Avenue South in Great Falls, Montana (\u201cthe subject property\u2019). In 1997, Marlene Sorum sold this property to the Stanleys, allegedly with the understanding that Lemire (Ms. Sorum\u2019s mother) would be able to live there as long as she wished or for life. However, this understanding was not recorded as part of a deed or contract for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b67 On February 2, 1997, Lemire and the Stanleys entered into a written agreement titled \u201cRENTAL CONTRACT.\u201d The agreement provided, in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">The contract entered into below is between Joe and Ida Stanley here after called agent and Lillian Lemire here after called tenant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">In consideration of the use and occupancy of the premises as herein specified we mutually agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">Address or property 1701-13 Th. [sic] Ave. So. Great Falls MT. Tenant agrees to rent the subject premises for $100.00 per month payable in advance on the fifth day of each month and every month there after.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">Pets will be allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">Tenant will be responsible for the utilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">No more than one person may reside in this house, that person being Lillian Lemire. The tenant shall not transfer her interest in and to this agreement, nor shall the tenant assign or sublet the said premises or any part there of in her absence or otherwise permit others to occupy the premises at any time during this agreement. If tenant violates the provisions of this paragraph the agent may immediately take possession of said premises and in the event of litigation, may sue and evict any person or persons occupying said premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">It is expressly understood and agreed that the owner of said premises, or said agent will not be liable for any damages or injury of any kind to tenant or her family, or of her or her family\u2019s property from what ever cause arising from the occupancy of said premises by tenant and or her family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-12\">It is also understood agent will maintain premises in a condition considered safe for the tenant to occupy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-13\">It is also understood that the term of this agreement is for as long as Lillian Lemire wishes to reside at said premises or until her death. If Lillian wishes to terminate said agreement she is required to give a 30 day notice to vacate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-14\">In the event Joe or Ida Stanley for whatever reason no longer act as owner or agent of this property this agreement will in its entirety be honored by the new owner or agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-15\">It is also understood that the tenant may continue to reside at the premises now and in the future as she has resided in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZT\">Thereafter, the Stanleys each signed under the heading \u201cOwner/agent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and Lemire signed under the heading \u201cTenant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">II. The First Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b68 The parties apparently maintained an amicable relationship for the first few years. Then, in August 2001, the Stanleys began holding Lemire\u2019s monthly checks (in other words, they did not timely present the checks for payment). Eventually, they did present the checks for payment; however, the bank did not honor any that were over six months old ($800 worth). The Stanleys then attempted to terminate the Rental Contract and regain possession of the subject property on the ground that Lemire had failed to pay rent. On December 24,2002, they filed suit against Lemire in the Cascade County Justice Court (Cause No. J202V3186). For clarification, this is <em>not </em>the case presently before us on appeal. Rather, as explained below, the appeal before us is from a <em>second </em>lawsuit, which the Stanleys filed in the Cascade Comity Justice Court in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u00b69 In the first lawsuit (\u201cSuit #1\u201d), the Justice Court ruled in favor of the Stanleys, and an appeal was taken to the District Court (Cause No. BDV-03-368) for a trial de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notably, the District Court observed in its Amended Order that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">neither of the parties have come to Court with clean hands. The Plaintiffs admit that they held the checks tendered by the Defendant in an attempt to evict her. In fact, they still want her evicted and are requesting damages. The Defendant, for her part, initially refused to re-issue the dishonored checks deeming it the Plaintiffs\u2019 problem since she had tendered the checks as required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax1\">\u00b610 That said, the court denied the Stanleys\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted Lemire\u2019s motion for summary judgment, \u201cfind[ing] that a valid rental contract exists between the parties and that the Defendant performed her obligations under the contract.\u201d Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">[t]he Plaintiffs\u2019 actions in retaining the proffered rent checks in an attempt to evict the Defendant amounted to a breach of the contract on the part of the Plaintiffs. The Defendant shall be allowed to continue rental of the premises under the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>rental contract entered into by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">At the same time, the Court finds that the Defendant shall pay to the Plaintiffs the amount of $800.00, plus interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the time she was notified that the bank would not honor her checks, to cover the stale checks that were not honored by the bank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Neither party appealed this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">III. The Second Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b611 The Stanleys initiated their second lawsuit against Lemire (\u201cSuit #2,\u201d the case now before us) in the Cascade County Justice Court (Cause No. J204V0232) on January 22, 2004. The Complaint for Possession alleged that Lemire had \u201cbreached the rental agreement by withholding part of rent monies\u201d totaling, as of that date, $40. The Stanleys sought possession of the premises, unpaid rent, costs of the suit, and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b612 A \u201cvoluminous flurry of filings\u201d (as the Justice Court characterized them) ensued. Of those, the following trace the evolution of Lemire\u2019s characterization of her interest in the subject property from that of a lessee to that of a life tenant, which is an essential element in resolving Lemire\u2019s claim on appeal that the Justice Court lacked jurisdiction over the Stanleys\u2019 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u00b613 First, on January 30, 2004, Lemire filed a motion to dismiss in which she characterized her relationship with the Stanleys as a \u201clandlord-tenant arrangement[].\u201d She asserted that she \u201chas a <em>lease </em>of the subject premises for the rest of her natural life\u201d (emphasis added) and that she had reduced her monthly payments by $20 per month \u201cto reflect the reduced value of the leasehold estate\u201d (a reference to damage to a picnic table and a storage shed on the subject property, allegedly caused by Mr. Stanley following the termination of Suit #1). She construed the Stanleys\u2019 complaint, which cited no statutory provisions, as stating an action under the law of unlawful detainer (\u00a7 70-27-108, MCA) and then argued that such an action could not be maintained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">The law of unlawful detainer, however, is not applicable in this case because Ms. Lemire\u2019s lease is a residential lease government [sic] by Title 70 Chapter 24 of the Montana Code Annotated [The Montana Residential Landlord and Tenant Act of 1977], and because Ms. Lemire\u2019s lease is for life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">\u00b614 A week later, Lemire filed an Answer, Counterclaims, and Demand for Jury Trial. In conformance with her motion to dismiss, she referred to the parties\u2019 contract as a \u201clease agreement\u201d and to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>subject property as \u201cthe leased premises\u201d and \u201cher leasehold estate.\u201d She also asserted, in the Introduction section of this document, that she had filed her motion to dismiss \u201cbased on this Court\u2019s lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim for unlawful detainer.\u201d Yet, only M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted) is mentioned in her motion to dismiss, and neither M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) (lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter) nor the words \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d is mentioned at all. Furthermore, she did not identify (in her answer) the grounds on which she had allegedly challenged the Justice Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b615 The Stanleys filed a response to Lemire\u2019s motion to dismiss on February 11,2004. Among other things, they argued that Lemire \u201cmay be trying to mislead the court into believing that Defendant has a life estate\u201d-a prescient interpretation of her argument, given that Lemire had not yet explicitly characterized her interest as such. The Stanleys continued: \u201cIn truth, Defendant has a written lease, which expires upon the termination of the contract. As set forth above, Montana Law allows for the termination of a rental agreement when rent is unpaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">\u00b616 Next in the progression, Lemire filed her Amended Answer and Counterclaims. As before, she referred to the subject property as having been \u201cleased to her.\u201d In addition, she used the terms \u201cleasehold estate\u201d and \u201cleased premises\u201d repeatedly, referred to the $100 monthly payments as \u201crent,\u201d and alleged that she \u201chas valid a [sic] rental agreement with [the Stanleys] . . . for the remainder of her natural life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b617 On March 31, 2004, Lemire filed a document titled Defendant\u2019s Combined Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion to Set Trial Date, and Motion for Pretrial Conference. She asserted that a pretrial conference should be held to address, among other things, \u201cjurisdictional matters related to Ms. Lemire\u2019s counterclaims.\u201d She continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">A Justice of the Peace does not have jurisdiction over claims for malicious prosecution, over actions for damages from the taking, detaining, or injuring <em>personal </em>property in excess of $7,000.00, and over claims arising out of a contract in excess of $7,000.00. Mont. Code Aim. \u00a7 3-10-301(1). Ms. Lemire\u2019s counterclaims rest, in part, on breach of contract, damages for conversion <em>ofpersonal </em>property to which she claims title, and malicious prosecution. [Citation to Amended Answer.] Whether or not this Court has jurisdiction to decide on these claims has not yet been determined. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>\u00b618 The Justice Court addressed these arguments in its April 3,2004 Order Setting Jury Trial, in which it also denied Lemire\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court determined that the Stanleys\u2019 suit was \u201can action for possession under \u00a7 70-24-427\u201d and that the court, therefore, had jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 3-10-302, MCA, which provides that \u201c[t]he justices\u2019 courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the district courts within their respective counties ... in actions brought under Title 70, chapter 24.\u201d The court dismissed without prejudice Lemire\u2019s malicious prosecution counterclaim as beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction (see \u00a7 3-10-301(l)(c), MCA; Montana Justice and City Court Rules of Civil Procedure 7C(1)); however, with respect to Lemire\u2019s assertion that her counterclaims exceeded the $7,000jurisdictional limitation imposed by \u00a7 3-10-301, MCA, the court rejected this valuation of her counterclaims as not \u201chav[ing] any basis in reality.\u201d The court observed that \u201c[t]his is a suit over $40 in rent, a homemade wooden picnic table and a shed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A89-\">\u00b619 On April 30, 2004, Lemire filed a Motion to Stay, and Memorandum in Support. Noting that the Justice Court had denied her motion to dismiss, dismissed her malicious prosecution counterclaim, and rej ected her \u201cadditional jurisdictional concerns,\u201d she informed the court that she had refiled her counterclaim for malicious prosecution in the District Court (Cause No. CDV-04-401) and had requested that the District Court \u201cequitably determin[e] her interests in the premises as a life tenant.\u201d Accordingly, she asserted, \u201c[t]his matter should be halted, and certified for submission to the Clerk of the District Court.\u201d She explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">A Justice Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to determine matters involving title to and possession of real property. Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-31-101(1). In such matters, the Justice must suspend all further proceedings in the action and certify the pleadings from his docket to the clerk of the district court of the county. Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-31-102(1). In her Answer, Ms. Lemire raises counterclaims for trespass, conversion based on alleged intrusions and destructions of parts of the premises. [Citation to Amended Answer.] To sustain her claims, Ms. Lemire will rely on alternative legal theories, among them that she holds a freehold fife estate under the Rental Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiVl\">Therefore, based on the court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over questions involving the title to or possession of real property, she concluded, \u201cthis Court is precluded from fully adjudicating the matters before it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b620 Significantly, this is the first instance in all of the foregoing filings that Lemire <em>explicitly </em>raised the possibility that her interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>subject property was something other than that of a lessee-namely, that \u201cthe Rental Agreement was intended to create a <em>life estate </em>in [her] favor\u201d (emphasis added). Seizing on this fact, the Stanleys filed a response in which they pointed out that Lemire\u2019s answer and amended answer did \u201cnot state a defense or a counterclaim for a life estate in the property.\u201d Thus, the Stanleys suggested, Lemire had waived the life estate issue by not \u201cproperly\u201d raising it earlier in the proceedings. Lemire contested this assertion, arguing in her reply that her pleadings-particularly her references to the subject property in her amended answer as a \u201cleasehold estate\u2019-should be construed liberally to have properly raised a question of title to the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b621 On May 10, 2004, the Justice Court denied Lemire\u2019s motion to stay. Acknowledging that it does not have jurisdiction to decide a question of title to real property, the court concluded that the issue of whether Lemire had an ownership interest in the subject property was not before the court because she had not raised it in a timely manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHn\">[Sections 3-10-301(l)(b) and 25-31-102] required the Defendant to raise the issue of a question of title to real property in the vertified [sicl answer. Defendant has failed to do so. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">Counsel is correct that jurisdiction cannot be granted to the Court where it is precluded by statute. However, this Court <em>has jurisdiction over the issues that have been properly and timely raised. </em>Plaintiff has initiated an action under the Montana Residential Landlord Tenant Act, which is within the jurisdiction of this Court. Defendant\u2019s ANSWER and AMENDED ANSWER raised no issues (at least legitimate issues) that are beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. Defendant NOW wants to raise an issue that involves a question of title to real property that is beyond the jurisdiction of this Court. Unfortunately for Defendant, that ship has sailed. Defendant could have timely raised such an issue, but Defendant did not. Both \u00a7 3-10-301[(l)](b) and \u00a7 25-31-102 require Defendant to raise this issue in the verified answer. By failing to do so, Defendant has effectively waived this claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b622 Finally, on May 12, 2004, the case went to a jury, which found in favor of the Stanleys on their complaint for possession, but awarded no money damages. The jury also dismissed Lemire\u2019s two remaining counterclaims for breach of agreement and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. (As for her other counterclaims, two were dismissed pretrial and three more were dismissed pursuant to a directed verdict at the close of testimony.) In its judgment, dated May 23, 2004, the Justice Court ordered that \u201c[the Stanleys] [are] granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>possession of the premises\u201d and that \u201c[Lemire] shall peacefully vacate the premises ... by May 30, 2004\u201d (emphasis omitted). Lemire was also required to pay $268.00 for the costs of the jury, and the Stanleys were awarded attorney fees in the amount of $2,594.25 and costs of $60.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b623 Lemire timely appealed to the District Court, which on August 26, 2005, affirmed the judgment of the Justice Court on all issues except the issue of attorney fees and costs. The District Court\u2019s reasoning is discussed below in the relevant contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">GENERAL STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b624 The Justice Court was a court of record at the time Suit #2 was tried. Accordingly, on Lemire\u2019s appeal from the Justice Court, the District Court functioned effectively as an intermediate appellate court. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303 and 3-10-115, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u00b625  Acting within its appellate capacity, a district court is not in a position to make findings of fact or discretionary trial court rulings. Rather, the court is \u201cconfined to review of the record and questions of law.\u201d Section 3-10-115(1), MCA. As does this Court in appeals, the district court reviews any factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard, any discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion, and both legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact under the de novo standard. <em>See State v. Seaman, </em>2005 MT 307, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 429, \u00b6 10, 124 P.3d 1137, \u00b6 10 (\u201cIn an appeal from a justice court established as a court of record, the district court functions as an appellate corut and the appeal is confined to a review of the record and questions of law. . . . [B]oth the District Court and this Court review the Justice Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions for correctness.\u201d); <em>City of Billings v. Costa, </em>2006 MT 181, \u00b6 7, 333 Mont. 84, \u00b6 7, 140 P.3d 1070, \u00b6 7 (\u201cAs did the District Court, we review a trial court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion based on a finding of particularized suspicion to determine whether that finding is clearly erroneous and whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u00b626 Consequently, a district court\u2019s review on an appeal from a lower court of record is no broader than this Court\u2019s review of a lower court judgment. Accordingly, we review the case as if the appeal had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>originally been filed in this Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We examine the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision, reviewing the trial court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard, its discretionary rulings for abuse of discretion, and its legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact under the de novo standard. <em>Solem v.

Our ultimate determination is whether the district court, in its review of the trial court\u2019s decision, reached the correct conclusions under the appropriate standards of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b627 In the case at hand, the appropriate standards of review are identified where applicable in the context of the issues discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b628 <em>1. Does this Court have jurisdiction overLemire\u2019s appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">\u00b629 As a threshold matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over Lemire\u2019s appeal. As explained below, the facts bearing on this issue implicate both this Court\u2019s jurisdiction and the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over this case. <em>Cf. City of Billings v.

Accordingly, we will proceed, <em>sua sponte, </em>to address the question of our jurisdiction over Lemire\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b633 The precise jurisdictional issues before us arise out of the sequence and timing of the Justice Court\u2019s entry of judgment vis-a-vis the Stanleys\u2019 post-trial motion for attorney fees, and the District Court\u2019s order remanding the case to the Justice Court \u201cto hear and decide the reasonable amount of fees and costs to be awarded.\u201d With respect to the former, the Stanleys\u2019 action against Lemire proceeded to a jury trial on May 12, 2004. That same day, as noted in the facts above, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Stanleys on their complaint for possession, but awarded no money damages, and also dismissed Lemire\u2019s two remaining counterclaims. The following day (May 13, 2004), the Stanleys filed their motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b634 Pursuant to the Montana Justice and City Court Rules of Civil Procedure (Title 25, Chapter 23, MCA; hereinafter, \u201cM. J. C. C. R. Civ. P.\u201d) and the Montana Uniform Rules for the Justice and City Courts (Title 25, Chapter 24, MCA; hereinafter, \u201cM. U. R. J. C. C.\u201d),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lemire had a set time period in which to respond to the Stanley\u2019s motion. Specifically, M. J. C. C. R. Civ. P. 9B provides that \u201c[a]ny party opposing a motion must do so in writing within 10 days of service.\u201d However, M. U. R. J. C. C. 21(b), provides that \u201c[w]hen the period of time prescribed or allowed is ten days or less, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded.\u201d Furthermore, M. J. C. C. R. Civ. P. 6A provides that \u201cthe day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins to rim may not be included.\u201d Thus, given that the Stanleys\u2019 motion was filed on Thursday, May 13, 2004, Lemire had until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Thursday, May 27, 2004, to respond thereto.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b635 Notwithstanding, the Justice Court entered judgment on May 24, 2004-three days prior to the expiration of Lemire\u2019s response period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is not clear whether the court miscalculated the deadline for her response, assumed that Lemire would not be responding to the Stanleys\u2019 motion, or concluded that she had implicitly waived such a response by filing her notice of appeal on May 18, 2004. In any event, because the Justice Court entered its judgment while one of the parties still had time under the Rules to respond to a pending motion, we must determine whether, under the jurisdictional provisions set forth below, that judgment is one from which a party may take an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b636 Section 3-5-303, MCA (2003) vests the district courts with appellate jurisdiction \u201cin cases arising in justices\u2019 courts and other courts of limited jurisdiction in their respective districts as may be prescribed by law and consistent with the constitution.\u201d Correspondingly, \u00a7 3-10-115(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] party may appeal to district court a <em>judgment </em>or order from a justice\u2019s court established as a court of record\u201d (emphasis added). Title 25, Chapter 33, MCA, in turn, sets forth a number of procedures governing appeals to district courts from justices\u2019 courts. Section 25-33-101, MCA, provides that \u201c[a] <em>judgment </em>or order in a civil action, except when expressly made final by this code, may be reviewed as prescribed in this chapter and not otherwise\u201d (emphasis added), and \u00a7 25-33-102, MCA, provides that \u201c[a]ny party dissatisfied with <em>the judgment rendered </em>in a civil action in a... justice\u2019s court may appeal therefrom to the district court of the county at any time within 30 days after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>rendition of the judgment\u201d (emphasis added). Lastly, M. R. Civ. P. 54(a) defines a \u201cjudgment\u201d as \u201cthe final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b637 Here, the judgment rendered by the Justice Court on May 24, 2004, disposed of all pending motions and thus constituted a \u201cfinal determination of the rights of the parties.\u201d However, it was rendered prematurely \u2014 before the expiration of Lemire\u2019s time to respond to the Stanleys\u2019 motion for attorney fees. In this regard, it is necessary to clarify the difference between a \u201cvoid\u201d judgment and a judgment which is merely \u201cvoidable.\u201d As the Sixth Circuit recently observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">\u201cCertain procedural irregularities, not amounting to lack of jurisdiction over the person or subject matter, are sometimes characterized as making a judgment \u2018voidable\u2019. This means that these judgments may be set aside upon a <em>timely </em>application in the same proceedings as a matter of judicial discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"><em>Days Inns Worldwide, Inc. v. Patel, </em>445 F.3d 899, 907 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Abbott v. Howard, </em>451 N.W.2d 597, 599 (Mich.App. 1990)). Consistent with this principle, the court concluded that \u201cdisregarding response times set forth in the local civil rules and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ... rendered the instant judgment merely <em>voidable </em>as to appellant.\u201d <em>Days Inns Worldwide, </em>445 F.3d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\u00b638 Likewise, in the case at hand, the Justice Court\u2019s entry of judgment on May 24, 2004-though it was entered prematurely and thereby impinged upon Lemire\u2019s right to respond to the Stanleys\u2019 motion-was at that point merely voidable. Lemire could have filed a timely motion to vacate the judgment and permit her the proper time to respond. Specifically, M. J. C. C. R. Civ. P. 22A provides that \u201c[a] judge may, on such terms as may be just and on the payment of costs, reheve a party from any judgment taken against the party by mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d However, the Rule further provides that \u201cthe application for relief must be made within 30 days after entry of the judgment and upon an affidavit showing good cause for it.\u201d Such was not the case here. Rather than filing a motion for relief under M. J. C. C. R. Civ. P. 22A, Lemire instead filed an amended notice of appeal. Notably, she did so on May 25,2004 (the day after the Justice Court entered judgment), which was still within the ten-day period prescribed by M. J. C. C. R. Civ. P. 9B and 6A and M. U. R. J. C. C. 21(b) for her to respond to the Stanleys\u2019 motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\u00b639 This fact distinguishes the case at hand from <em>State v. Bonamarte, </em>2006 MT 291, 334 Mont. 376, 147 P.3d 220, where we determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>the appeal to the district court was premature and that the district court, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to consider it. After a jury found Bonamarte guilty of partner or family member assault, the Bozeman Municipal Court imposed a one-year sentence with all but thirty days suspended and ordered Bonamarte to pay fines and costs. In addition, the court ordered \u201cconditional restitution-Bonamarte would be required to pay restitution only if the State requested it within sixty days and the court held a hearing.\u201d <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 2. The State made such a request within the sixty-day period; however, by the time it did so, Bonamarte had already filed his notice of appeal. Thus, the municipal court transferred the record to the district court, which purported to affirm the judgment and sentence but remand the issue of restitution \u201c \u2018for a determination of the total amount to be paid.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\u00b640 On Bonamarte\u2019s appeal to this Court, we observed that his sentence appeared to be \u201cunresolved\u201d and, therefore, that we needed to address whether we had jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 5. Noting that an appeal may be taken by a defendant \u201c \u2018only from a final judgment of conviction and orders after judgment,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 6 (quoting \u00a7 46-20-104(1), MCA), and that in order for a judgment and order to constitute a final judgment of conviction, it must impose a \u201cfinal sentence,\u201d <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 6, we concluded that no final judgment of conviction yet existed, <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 8. We explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">The Municipal Court\u2019s sentencing order imposed restitution on Bonamarte only if the State requested it within sixty days of the order and the court held a hearing on costs. The State requested restitution within sixty days and noted that Bonamarte could request a hearing. Bonamarte appealed his conviction, however, two days before the State had requested restitution and before the Municipal Court could hold the required hearing. The fact that Bonamarte\u2019s sentence was pending at the time of his appeal to the District Court prevented Bonamarte from appealing a \u201cfinal judgment of conviction\u201d under \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA. Thus, Bonamarte\u2019s appeal to the District Court was premature, and the District Court had no jurisdiction to consider the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aen\"><em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 7. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal without prejudice. <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b641 The case at hand is a variation on <em>Bonamarte. </em>When the Justice Court entered judgment prematurely, Lemire could have filed a motion for relief under M. J. C. C. R. Civ. P. 22A. Thus, her position at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>point was analogous to the State\u2019s position at the time the conditional restitution order was entered by the municipal court in Bonamarte-both parties had the ability, within an allotted period of time, to effect further proceedings in the trial court or allow the judgment already entered to become final by failing to take appropriate action. But unlike the State, which actually filed a timely request for restitution in <em>Bonamarte, </em>Lemire, as explained above, filed neither a response to the Stanleys\u2019 motion for attorney fees nor a motion for relief from the Justice Court\u2019s premature entry of judgment. Rather, her only action in this regard was to amend her notice of appeal. Thus, unlike the situation in Bonamarte, nothing in the Justice Court appears to be \u201cunresolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b642 Accordingly, because the judgment rendered by the Justice Court disposed of all pending motions and thus constituted a final determination of the rights of the parties, and furthermore because Lemire did not file a timely motion for relief from the judgment alerting the Justice Court to the fact that her right to respond to the Stanleys\u2019 motion for attorney fees had been infringed, we therefore conclude that the Justice Court\u2019s judgment is an appealable judgment. Concomitantly, we also conclude that the District Court, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3-5-303 and 3-10-115(1), MCA, had jurisdiction over Lemire\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b643 With respect to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the appeal, we first note that the source of our jurisdiction is Article VII, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution. Of specific relevance to the issue at hand, Article VII, Section 2(1) vests this Court with appellate jurisdiction and Article VII, Section 2(3) authorizes us to make rules governing appellate procedure. (Such rules of procedure are \u201csubject to disapproval by the legislature in either of the two sessions following promulgation.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 2(3).) Pursuant to this constitutional authority, we have adopted the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure, which govern appeals to this Court from Montana district courts. <em>See In re B.P., </em>2000 MT 39, \u00b6 15, 298 Mont. 287, \u00b6 15, 995 P.2d 982, \u00b6 15. In particular, M. R. App. P. 1(b)(1) provides that \u201c[i]n civil cases a party aggrieved may appeal from ... a final judgment entered in an action or special proceeding commenced in a district court, or brought into a district court from another court or administrative body\u201d (paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u00b644 The form of the judgment entered by a district court acting as an intermediate appellate court, in turn, is defined by statute. Specifically, a district court reviewing the judgment of a justice\u2019s court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>of record may \u201caffirm, reverse, or amend any appealed order or judgment and may direct the proper order or judgment to be entered or direct that a new trial or further proceeding be had in the court from which the appeal was taken.\u201d Section 3-10-115(3), MCA. (The same is true on appeal from a municipal court judgment or order. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-6-110(3), MCA.) Furthermore, \u00a7 25-33-302, MCA, provides that \u201c[w]hen a judgment is reversed or set aside on a question of law arising in the justice\u2019s or city corurt, the district court must either try the case anew or render a judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b645 Here, the District Court affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s judgment \u201con all issues ... except on the issue of fees and costs.\u201d With respect to the latter, the court concluded that \u201ca hearing on attorneys fees and costs is appropriate\u201d; therefore, the court ordered that \u201c[t]he case is remanded for the Justice Court to hear and decide the reasonable amount of fees and costs to be awarded and to determine the date when the Plaintiffs may re-take possession.\u201d Thus, since the District Court affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s judgment in part, reversed the judgment in part, and itself \u201crender[ed] a judgment\u201d \u201cdirecting] that a . . . further proceeding be had\u201d in the Justice Court, its order on appeal constitutes a \u201cjudgment\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7\u00a7 3-10-115(3) and 25-33-302, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b646 However, as we explained in <em>B.P.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">Rule 1(b)(1), M.R.App.P., expressly provides that an appeal may be taken from a <em>final </em>judgment entered in a district court action. A <em>final </em>judgment is one which constitutes a final determination of the rights of the parties; any judgment, order or decree leaving matters undetermined is interlocutory in nature and not a final judgment for purposes of appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">B.P., \u00b6 15 (emphases added). Accordingly, if a judgment which does not constitute a <em>final </em>determination of the rights and obligations of the parties in the action or proceeding is nevertheless appealed, both the district court and this Court are without jurisdiction over that appeal. The appellate process folds, no decision on the merits may be issued, and the case returns to the last court which had jurisdiction for that court to enter a final judgment. <em>See </em>B.P., \u00b6 15; <em>City of Billings v. Costa, </em>2006 MT 181, \u00b6 9, 333 Mont. 84, \u00b6 9, 140 P.3d 1070, \u00b6 9; <em>Bonamarte, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">\u00b647 In the case at hand, we must determine what effect, if any, the court\u2019s remand order had on the <em>finality </em>of its judgment. We recently addressed this same question-though under the applicable <em>criminal </em>statutes-in <em>Costa. </em>The district court, on Costa\u2019s appeal from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Billings Municipal Court, had entered judgment affirming the denial of Costa\u2019s motion to suppress and remanding to the municipal court \u201cfor \u2018imposition of sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Costa, </em>\u00b6 6. This remand order suggested that the municipal court had not entered a \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d since a judgment in a criminal case is not \u201cfinal\u201d if sentence has not yet been imposed. <em>Costa, </em>\u00b6 10. Thus, we observed, the district court\u2019s order, combined with Costa\u2019s appeal to this Court, raised \u201cjurisdictional issues\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\">If the District Court\u2019s order containing the remand is not a \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d this Court lacks jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Rule 1(d), M.R.App.P.; Section 46-20-104(1), MCA; <em>Reeder, </em>\u00b6 7 (citations omitted); <em>State v. Diesen, </em>1998 MT 163, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 290 Mont. 55, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, 964 P.2d 712, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 (citations omitted). By the same token, without a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d \u2014 including sentencing-in the Municipal Court, Costa\u2019s appeal to the District Court would have been premature and the District Court-as well as this Court-would lack jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5(b)(2), U.M.C.R.App.; \u00a7 46-20-104(1), MCA; \u00a7 46-1-202(11), <em>MCA.-,Diesen, </em>\u00b6 3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><em>Costa, </em>\u00b6 9. As it turned out, however, our review of the record disclosed that the municipal court had, in fact, sentenced Costa before she appealed to the district court. <em>Costa, </em>\u00b6 10. On this basis, we stated that the district court\u2019s order remanding for imposition of sentence was \u201cboth unnecessary and a nullity\u201d and had \u201cno effect on the \u2018final judgment\u2019 status\u201d of the municipal court\u2019s judgment or the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>Costa, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10,16. Accordingly, we concluded that the district court had jurisdiction over Costa\u2019s appeal to that court, <em>Costa, </em>\u00b6 10, and that we, likewise, had jurisdiction over Costa\u2019s appeal to this Court, <em>Costa, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u00b648 Similarly, in the case at hand, we observe that the District Court\u2019s remand order was not due to any failure on the Justice Court\u2019s part to make \u201ca final determination of the rights of the parties\u201d (unlike the situation we perceived at the outset of <em>Costa, </em>where the remand order implied that the municipal court had not yet imposed sentence on Costa, and unlike the situation in <em>Bonamarte, </em>where the restitution portion of Bonamarte\u2019s sentence in fact had not been resolved at the time of his appeal to the district court). Indeed, as explained above, the judgment rendered by the Justice Court disposed of all pending motions and thus constituted a final determination of the rights of the parties. Likewise, the District Court\u2019s judgment constituted a final determination of the issues presented to it on appeal; in other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the court left no matters undetermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b649 As we did in <em>Costa, </em>therefore, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s remand order had no effect on the appealable status of the Justice Court\u2019s judgment or on the \u201cfinal\u201d status of the District Court\u2019s judgment. Accordingly, pursuant to M. R. App. P. 1(b)(1), this Court has jurisdiction over Lemire\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">\u00b650 <em>2. Did the District Court err in its determination that the Justice Court retained subject matter jurisdiction over the Stanleys\u2019 action against Lemire after she asserted a claim of title to the subject property ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b651 Lemire challenges the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Justice Court had subject matter jurisdiction over Suit #2. She first argues at great length that she in fact holds a life estate in the subject property and that the Justice Court, therefore, \u201c[did] not have subject matter jurisdiction because the controversy involves questions of title to and possession of real property.\u201d Yet, not only is this issue not properly before us, given that it was not actually litigated at the trial level, it also is irrelevant. As outlined below, the question we must decide is not whether Lemire, in fact, has a life estate but, rather, whether her assertion of such was procedurally barred and, if <em>not </em>barred, whether it deprived the Justice Court of subject matter jurisdiction over the Stanleys\u2019 cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u00b652 Jurisdiction is conferred on the courts only by the Constitution or statutes adopted pursuant to the Constitution. <em>State v. Osborne, </em>2005 MT 264, \u00b6 12, 329 Mont. 95, \u00b6 12, 124 P.3d 1085, \u00b6 12 (citing <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. District Court of Eighteenth Judicial Dist., </em>147 Mont. 263, 266, 410 P.2d 933, 935 (1966)). A court\u2019s determination as to its jurisdiction is a conclusion of law, which is reviewed de novo to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>In re Marriage of Christian, </em>1999 MT 189, \u00b6 6, 295 Mont. 352, \u00b6 6, 983 P.2d 966, \u00b6 6; <em>Koke v.

The Legislature has done so in a number of statutes, four of which bear on the issue of whether the Justice Court had subject matter jurisdiction in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u00b654 First, \u00a7 3-10-302, MCA (2003), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">The justices\u2019 courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the district courts within their respective counties in actions of forcible entry and unlawful detainer and <em>in actions brought under Title 70, chapter 24 </em>[emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The Justice Court determined that \u201cthis action is an action for possession under \u00a7 70-24-427\u201d and that it therefore had jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 3-10-302. The District Court agreed with this determination, as do we given the grounds for relief stated in the Stanleys\u2019 complaint. <em>See </em>\u00a7 70-24-427(1), MCA (recognizing as a landlord\u2019s remedy after termination of a rental agreement \u201ca claim for possession and for rent\u201d-the precise relief requested in the Stanleys\u2019 complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u00b655 Next, \u00a7 25-31-101(1), MCA (2003), which is one of a number of statutes that govern procedure in the justices\u2019 courts, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">The parties to an action in a justice\u2019s court <em>cannot give evidence </em>upon any question which involves the title or possession of real property ..., nor can any issue presenting such question <em>be tried </em>by such court; provided that, in cases of forcible entry and unlawful detainer of which justices\u2019 courts have jurisdiction, any evidence otherwise competent may be given, and any question properly involved therein may be determined [emphases added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa2\">\u00b656  It is evident from this language that the Legislature has determined that questions of title to real property shall not be decided by the justices\u2019 courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, \u00a7 25-31-101(1) explicitly <em>prohibits </em>a justice court from even hearing evidence on this subject. Thus, a plaintiff clearly could not file an action in a justice court to quiet title to real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u00b657  Probably for this reason, Lemire now argues (contrary to her original theory) that the Stanleys\u2019 action was <em>not </em>brought under Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>70, Chapter 24, MCA, but, rather, was an action to quiet title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">The \u201cRental Contract\u201d, despite its denomination, conveys a life estate in the Life Tenant [Lemire]. Therefore, Grantors\u2019 [the Stanleys\u2019] action should have been brought as one for quiet title pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 70-28-101 et. seq.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The District Court, however, observed that the Stanleys had \u201cpled that there was a rental agreement, that the agreement was breached and how the agreement was breached\u201d-an assessment of the record with which we agree. Indeed, during the early stages of the Justice Court proceedings, as the District Court aptly noted, \u201c[Lemire] went out of her way to stress that landlord/tenant law did apply [to her situation with the Stanleys].\u201d Given these considerations, we reject her current characterization of the Stanleys\u2019 cause of action as one to quiet title. To the contrary, the Stanleys\u2019 pleadings establish that their action was brought under \u00a7 70-24-427, MCA, and the Justice Court, therefore, had subject matter jurisdiction over this case at its outset.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u00b658 Lemire points out that \u201clack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised by motion or <em>sua sponte </em>at any time\u201d (citing M. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3)). Presumably, this is meant to suggest that her assertion of an ownership interest in the subject property divested the Justice Court of its jurisdiction over the case. However, while the question of a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction may indeed be raised at any time, Lemire\u2019s argument overlooks an antecedent issue. The Justice Court acknowledged that Lemire\u2019s assertion of title to the subject property could have divested it of jurisdiction, <em>had she raised the issue in a proper and timely manner; </em>however, because she did not do so, the court determined that the action before it did not involve a question of title. The District Court reached the same conclusion. The pertinent question, therefore, is whether the Justice Court and the District Court correctly determined that the jurisdictional and procedural statutes applicable to justices\u2019 courts mandate that a question of title to property be raised at a particular time or be deemed waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">\u00b659 Determinative of this question are \u00a7\u00a7 3-10-301(l)(b) and 25-31-102(1), MCA (2003). The former provides that the justices\u2019 courts have civil jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">in actions for damages not exceeding $7,000, exclusive of court costs,... for injury to real property when no issue is <em>raised by the verified answer of the defendant </em>involving the title to or possession of the real property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Section 3-10-301(l)(b), MCA (emphasis added). Likewise, the latter statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>If it appears <em>from, the answer of the defendant, </em>verified by his oath, that the determination of the action will <em>necessarily involve </em>the question of title or possession to real property ..., the justice <em>must </em>suspend all further proceedings in the action and certify the pleadings and, if any of the pleadings are oral, a transcript of the same from his docket to the clerk of the district court of the county. ... When the action is certified to the district court, <em>upon the answer of the defendant, </em>he must file an undertaking, to be approved by the justice, to the effect that he will pay all costs that may be awarded against him on the trial in the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4T\">Section 25-31-102(1), MCA (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b660 Based on these provisions, the District Court reasoned that \u201cthe Justice Court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case because Lemire failed to raise her claim of a dispute over an estate in real property in a timely fashion.\u201d From this, it appears that the District Court-like the Justice Court-deemed Lemire\u2019s question of title waived for purposes of Suit #2. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b661 Sections 3-10-301(l)(b) and 25-31-102(1) require a defendant to raise a question of title to real property in her answer. To be sure, neither of these statutes explicitly threaten waiver if a defendant fails to do so; nevertheless, the statutory scheme suggests that waiver is indeed the result of such an omission. Unlike \u00a7\u00a7 3-10-301(l)(b) and 25-31-102(1), which refer to the defendant\u2019s \u201canswer,\u201d \u00a7 25-31-102(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">If it appears <em>at any point in the proceedings </em>in a justice\u2019s court that the determination of the action will involve the question of the state\u2019s liability to make a payment of money, the justice shall sever that issue and dismiss the action as to it. If the issue is not severable, the justice shall dismiss the entire action.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\u00b662 The difference between subsections (1) and (2) of \u00a7 25-31-102 is informative and shows an intent to treat the two issues addressed therein differently. The former refers to \u201cthe answer of the defendant,\u201d whereas the latter refers to \u201cany point in the proceedings.\u201d Certainly, if the Legislature intended that a defendant be able to raise a question of title to real property \u201cat any point in the proceedings in a justice\u2019s court,\u201d it could have-and would have-said so, as it did for questions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>the state\u2019s liability to make a payment of money. Instead, the Legislature referred to a defendant\u2019s \u201canswer\u201d as the time for ascertaining whether the determination of the action in the justice court will necessarily involve the question of title to or possession of real property.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b663  Accordingly, we conclude that Lemire\u2019s question of title-i.e., her claim of a life estate in the subject property-had to be raised in her answer (or in her timely amended answer) and that if she failed to do so, the question was waived for purposes of Suit #2.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b664 In this regard, Lemire insists that she \u201cpreserved the issue of the nature of her interest in the premises\u201d by alerting the Justice Court in a number of motions to its lack of subject matter jurisdiction and by means of factual allegations in her motion to dismiss, her answer, and other motions. As to the former, she points out that in her motion to dismiss she \u201cadvis[ed] the court \u2018that Ms. Lemire\u2019s lease is for life\u2019 \u201d and that in her reply supporting said motion she \u201cadvised the Justice Court again that \u2018the Plaintiffs granted Ms. Lemire a lease for the remainder of her life.\u2019 \u201d She implies that these references were sufficient to notify the court that a question of title to the subject property was necessarily involved in the parties\u2019 dispute. As to the factual allegations, she asserts that \u201c[u]nder Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 25-31-102, it suffices if subject matter jurisdiction appears to be lacking from the facts stated\u201d and that \u201c[e]ven if the facts underlying her challenge of subject matter jurisdiction have not been artfully pled, those facts, including the instrument governing the parties\u2019 relationship, were brought to the Courts\u2019 attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b665 Presented with similar arguments, the District Court concluded that Lemire did <em>not </em>raise the question of title to the subject property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>in her answer or amended answer. After reviewing these documents, the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">[T]he Court fails to see where Lemire claimed an interest in the premises beyond that of a tenant. In her brief supporting her motion to dismiss, she clearly states that \u201c[t]he law of unlawful detainer, however, is not applicable in this case because Ms. Lemire\u2019s lease is a residential lease government (sic) by Title 70 Chapter 24 of the Montana Code Annotated, and because Ms. Lemire\u2019s lease is a lease for life.\u201d [Citation.] In her answers, she simply describes the term of the lease as one for life, not a life estate. [Second alteration in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b666 We agree with the District Court\u2019s assessment and, thus, reject Lemire\u2019s wholly unrealistic characterizations of her motion to dismiss, answer, and amended answer. Given that she argued throughout the early stages of the Justice Court proceedings that the Stanleys\u2019 cause of action was governed by landlord-tenant law, the District Court properly rejected her later claim that her use of the terms \u201cleasehold estate\u201d and \u201clease for life\u201d in her motion to dismiss, answer, and amended answer should have \u201calert[ed]\u201d the court to a question of title.</p>\n<p id=\"A17\">\u00b667  Thus, in summation, the Justice Court had subject matter jurisdiction over the Stanleys\u2019 cause of action at the outset of the proceedings. Lemire\u2019s claim of title to the subject property would have divested the court of jurisdiction had she timely asserted it. However, \u00a7\u00a7 3-10-301(l)(b) and 25-31-102(1), MCA (2003), require that a question of title to or possession of real property be raised in the defendant\u2019s answer or be deemed waived. Lemire failed to do so. Thus, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that she waived the issue was correct, and we therefore affirm the court on this issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ag4\">\u00b668 <em>3. Did the District Court err in affirming the Justice Court\u2019s determination that the Stanleys were entitled to an award of attorney fees?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b669 The Justice Court awarded the Stanleys attorney fees in the amount of $2,594.25 and costs of $60.00. On her appeal to the District Court, Lemire challenged this award on three grounds: first, the jury had been instructed that under Title 70, Chapter 24, MCA, it could award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party, but it did not do so; second, because the jury did not award the Stanleys any monetary damages (namely, the $40.00 in unpaid rent), they were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>a \u201cprevailing part/\u2019; and third, the Justice Court ruled on the Stanleys\u2019 motion for attorney fees before Lemire\u2019s allotted time to respond to the motion had lapsed and without conducting a hearing. She also disputed the Stanleys\u2019 contention that a party\u2019s right to an award of attorney fees is a question of law for the court and not a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b670 The District Court agreed with the Stanleys that the decision to award attorney fees is the province of the judge, not the jury. However, the court determined that a hearing on attorney fees and costs \u201cis appropriate.\u201d (The basis for this determination is not stated explicitly in the court\u2019s order, but it appears to derive from the court\u2019s immediately preceding observation: \u201cLemire argues that the Justice Court ruled on fees and costs before her time to object expired.\u201d) Accordingly, the court ordered that \u201c[t]he case is remanded for the Justice Court to hear and decide the reasonable amount of fees and costs to be awarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b671 On appeal to this Court, Lemire asserts that the District Court erred in affirming the Justice Court\u2019s determination that the Stanleys were entitled to an award of attorney fees. In support of this position, she reiterates essentially the same contentions she advanced in the District Court: first, even if the award of attorney fees is a question of law, \u201cthe [Stanleys] did not fully recover the relief sought, and are therefore not the prevailing part/\u2019; and second, \u201cbefore [Lemire\u2019s] response time had lapsed, the Justice Court granted [the Stanleys\u2019] Motion and awarded attorney fees . . . without gathering further evidence or conducting a hearing, based on unverified, unsigned invoices of [the Stanleys\u2019] counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\u00b672  The general rule in Montana is that absent a statutory or contractual provision, attorney fees are not recoverable. <em>National Cas. Co. v. American Bankers, </em>2001 MT 28, \u00b6 27, 304 Mont. 163, \u00b6 27, 19 P.3d 223, \u00b6 27; <em>accord Hoven v. Amrine, </em>224 Mont. 15, 17, 727 P.2d 533, 534 (1986) (\u201cAttorney fees are allowed when they are provided for by statute or contractual provision.\u201d). Here, an award of attorney fees was authorized by statute-specifically, \u00a7 70-24-442(1), MCA, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">In an action on a rental agreement or arising under this chapter, reasonable attorney fees, together with costs and necessary disbursements, may be awarded to the prevailing party notwithstanding an agreement to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u00b673 By virtue of the word \u201cmay,\u201d an award of attorney fees pursuant to this statute is discretionary. We review discretionary rulings for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>National Cas. Co., </em>\u00b6 27. However, the preliminary-issue of whether or not a party is <em>entitled </em>to recover attorney fees under the relevant statutory or contractual provision is strictly a question of law. Thus, we review a lower court\u2019s conclusions of law pertaining to the recovery of attorney fees to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Ass\u2019n, </em>2006 MT 67, \u00b6 14, 331 Mont. 421, \u00b6 14, 133 P.3d 190, \u00b6 14; <em>accord National Cas. Co., </em>\u00b6 27 (\u201c[A] district court\u2019s underlying determination that legal authority exists for an award of attorney fees is a conclusion of law which we review to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b674 As noted above, \u00a7 70-24-442(1) authorizes an award of \u201creasonable\u201d attorney fees to the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d Subsection (2), in turn, clarifies that \u201c[a]s used in this section, \u2018prevailing party means the party in whose favor final judgment is rendered.\u201d Section 70-24-442(2), MCA. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether the Stanleys were the \u201cprevailing party\u201d and whether the award was \u201creasonable,\u201d as contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b675  With respect to reasonableness, we have stated that \u201cfor attorney fees to be awarded by a trial court, there must be some type of proof of amount and reasonableness introduced into the record by counsel.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Mease, </em>2004 MT 59, \u00b6 58, 320 Mont. 229, \u00b6 58, 92 P.3d 1148, \u00b6 58. Apparently because the Justice Court had ruled on the Stanleys\u2019 motion for attorney fees before Lemire\u2019s time to respond had expired, the District Court remanded the case precisely for the purpose of \u201chear[ing] and decid[ing] the reasonable amount of fees and costs to be awarded.\u201d However, while this disposition was otherwise correct under our case law, we conclude that the District Court erred in affirming the Justice Court\u2019s determination that the Stanleys were <em>entitled </em>to an award of attorney fees in the first place; thus, a remand to that court for a hearing on reasonableness is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b676 As the plain language of \u00a7 70-24-442(2) makes clear, the \u201cprevailing party\u201d for purposes of an award of reasonable attorney fees under the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act is \u201cthe party in whose favor final judgment is rendered.\u201d In the case at hand, the jury\u2019s verdict form and the Justice Court\u2019s judgment reflect that the jury found in favor of the Stanleys on their complaint for possession and on Lemire\u2019s counterclaims for breach of agreement and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. However, the Stanleys\u2019 complaint also sought \u201cdamages for lost rent,\u201d and the jury found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>favor of Lemire on this claim, awarding \u201cthe amount of $0.\u201d Thus, as Lemire maintains, there is no one \u201cparty in whose favor final judgment [was] rendered\u201d in the case at hand. Or, stated alternatively, the Stanleys and Lemire both had separate final judgments rendered in their favor, though on different claims for relief set forth in the Stanleys\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u00b677 Accordingly, because each party prevailed on different issues, neither party was entitled to an award of attorney fees under \u00a7 70-24-442, MCA. <em>See Winters v. Winters, </em>2004 MT 82, \u00b6 59, 320 Mont. 459, \u00b6 59, 87 P.3d 1005, \u00b6 59 (observing that a contractual provision awarding attorney fees to the prevailing party is not effective when each party prevailed on different issues (citing <em>In re Marriage of Pfennigs, </em>1999 MT 250, \u00b6 42, 296 Mont. 242, \u00b6 42, 989 P.2d 327, \u00b6 42)); <em>cf Empire Development Co. v. Johnson, </em>236 Mont. 433, 441, 770 P.2d 525, 530 (1989) (\u201c[W]here the parties have mutually breached the same contract, the District Court did not err by refusing to grant either party attorney fees.\u201d). We therefore reverse the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b678  The judgment rendered by the Justice Court was an appealable judgment as contemplated by \u00a7 3-10-115(1), MCA, and the District Court, therefore, had jurisdiction over Lemire\u2019s appeal. Likewise, the District Court\u2019s judgment constituted a final determination of the issues presented to it on appeal, leaving no matters undetermined, and this Court, therefore, has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to M. R. App. P. 1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u00b679  The District Court correctly affirmed the Justice Court\u2019s determinations that it initially had subject matter jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 dispute and that it was not divested of jurisdiction by virtue of Lemire\u2019s belated claim of title to the subject property. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3-10-301(l)(b) and 25-31-102(1), MCA (2003), Lemire waived this issue for purposes of the Justice Court proceedings in Suit #2.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\u00b680  The District Court, however, erred in affirming the Justice Court\u2019s determination that the Stanleys were entitled to an award of attorney fees. Because both the Stanleys and Lemire were \u201cprevailing part[ies]\u201d in Suit #2, the Stanleys were not entitled to such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"AFr\">\u00b681 Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\"> As of July 1, 2003, appeals from a justice\u2019s court <em>established as a court of </em>record-which, the Cascade County Justice Court now is-are \u201cconfined to review of the record and questions of law.\u201d Section 3-10-115(1), MCA (2003), and the Compiler\u2019s Comments thereto; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 25-33-301(3), MCA (2003), and the Compiler\u2019s Comments thereto.

However, such a determination is not necessary to resolve the jurisdictional issue before us because, as described below, the Justice Court entered its judgment prior to the expiration of the 10-day period to which Lemire was entitled irrespective of whether the Stanleys served their motion by mail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\"> Actually, the Justice Court\u2019s judgment is stamped as filed on May 23, 2004. However, May 23, 2004, was a Sunday. Thus, because judicial business may not be transacted on Sundays, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-10-102, l-l-216(l)(a), and 3-1-302(1), MCA, the judgment is deemed filed on Monday, May 24, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b531-9\"> The historical basis for limiting the jurisdiction of the justices\u2019 courts on such questions has been explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">Historically, the essential reason for excluding from the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace cases concerning real estate was that the justice of the peace was not learned in the law, and was not, therefore, competent to deal with questions of title often of difficult and intricate nature. Also, the court of the justice of the peace was not a court of record.... The obvious purpose of the statute setting up the municipal court and defining its jurisdiction is that of providing a tribunal for the speedy disposition of a large number of small causes. And the trial of cases involving an issue as to title, with attendant difficult and complicated questions of real property law, would act as a clog upon the calendar of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3Z\"><em>Schwartz v. Murphy, </em>112 F.2d 24, 28 (D.C. Cir. 1940) (citations omitted); <em>accord Stephens v. Hammersley, </em>550 P.2d 1268, 1270 (Alaska 1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[8]\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">8 Section 25-31-102(2) implements \u00a7 3-10-301(2), which provides that \u201c[\u00a1\u00a1Justices\u2019 courts do not have jurisdiction in civil actions that might result in a judgment against the state for the payment of money.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\"> Focusing exclusively on the defendant\u2019s answer may result in unintended consequences, since the justices\u2019 courts may not always be able to determine whether an action necessarily involves a question of title to real property from this document. Certainly there are cases in which a genuine dispute as to title is latent at this early stage of the proceedings and only develops or becomes apparent as the case progresses. Likewise, there are cases in which it appears from the defendant\u2019s answer that the determination of the action necessarily involves a question of title, but such question ultimately turns out not to be determinative. Under the statutory scheme, therefore, some cases will be dismissed, though there is no genuine issue as to title, simply because it appears from the defendant\u2019s answer that there is. Conversely, there will be cases in which the court will retain jurisdiction-no issue as to title appearing in the defendant\u2019s answer \u2014 only to discover further down the road that such an issue is necessarily involved after all. <em>See Schwartz v. Murphy, </em>112 F.2d 24, 28-29 (D.C. Cir. 1940) (discussing the pitfalls of \u201cthe declaration test\u201d vis-\u00e1-vis \u201cthe issue test\u201d). That said, the statutory scheme is what it is, and failure to raise a question of title to real property in the defendant\u2019s answer constitutes a waiver of that question for purposes of the instant justice court proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\"> This conclusion moots the Stanleys\u2019 discussion of whether res judicata barred Lemire from pursuing the question of title to the subject property in Suit #2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
