We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by establishing child support at less than the amount legally presumed correct under the Montana Child Support Guidelines?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by refusing to order child support retroactive to the date the parties originally agreed to recalculate temporary child support?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">\u00b65 On October 29, 2002, the District Court entered a final decree of dissolution ending Rachel and Gerardo Midence\u2019s marriage. Rachel and Gerardo\u2019s two children were eleven and nine years old. During the marriage, Rachel was a stay-at-home mother. She had earned an art history degree prior to the birth of their children. At the time of the dissolution decree, both parties agreed that Rachel would primarily care for the children, and Gerardo would provide child support. Gerardo, an oncologist, was leaving his current employment at the time of the dissolution and looking for new employment. Based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>annual salary of approximately $266,252 at his current practice, Gerardo would have been required to pay $2,994 per month in child support according to the Montana Child Support Guidelines (Guidelines). Because he had not yet found new employment, the parties agreed to temporary child support of $2,500 per month. Their agreement provided that this amount \u201cshall be revised upon [Gerardo] securing [new] employment.\u201d Gerardo secured new employment in December 2002. He did not start working until February 2003, although he received a draw from his new employer in January 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"AVG\">\u00b66 In October of 2003, Rachel petitioned the court to enforce provisions of the decree, as well as to modify child support payments pursuant to their agreement. She requested the modified child support be retroactive to December of 2002, when Gerardo secured new employment. The District Court held a hearing on October 29, 2004, regarding recalculation of child support. The parties disputed Gerardo\u2019s level of income. The District Court found Gerardo\u2019s income to be $314,555.64. Rachel does not appeal this finding. Using this level of income, the District Court found that Gerardo\u2019s child support obligation for the two minor children would be $3,723 per month under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b67 Gerardo was in Chapter 13 bankruptcy at the time of the hearing. He was in the process of having his payment plan approved by the bankruptcy court. As a result of the bankruptcy, Gerardo\u2019s disposable income after paying personal living expenses, which include child support, goes to pay his unsecured non-priority creditors. At the conclusion of the plan, Gerardo will be discharged in full from his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b68 At the hearing, Rachel testified that she lived better during the marriage than after the dissolution, and more importantly, the children had more money and opportunities during the marriage. However, she did not provide any details about the children\u2019s standard of living dining the marriage. Rachel further testified that she wished to rely on child support as proof to a lending institution that she had steady income in order to secure a home loan. Since the dissolution, Rachel had not been employed, and she had not engaged in any educational retraining. Rachel partly based her request for more child support on the fact that, since Gerardo had to pay his disposable income to creditors, he would be discharged from creditor debt regardless of what he paid, the money should go toward his children rather than the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b69 With regard to the children\u2019s needs, Rachel testified during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>deposition in November 2003 that it cost her $3,618.70 per month to meet the needs of both her and the two children. The District Court attributed one-third of these costs to Rachel and the other two-thirds to the children, leaving $2,412.47 per month to meet the children\u2019s needs. Rachel offered evidence at the October 2004 hearing that it cost her $2,753.24 to meet the needs of her and the two children. Using the same formula as with the deposition testimony, the District Court found that $1,835.50 per month was necessary to meet the needs of the children. Since either $2,412.47 or $1,835.50 would be much less than the $3,723 per month calculated pursuant to the Guidelines, the District Court found by clear and convincing evidence that following the Guidelines would be unjust to Gerardo and result in a windfall for Rachel. Essentially, it would amount to a tax-free maintenance award for Rachel, which would be especially unfair in light of the fact that she dropped her claim to amend the maintenance provision of the dissolution decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b610 The District Court concluded that the amount of $2,990 per month, offered by Gerardo in an offer of judgment filed before the hearing, would be a reasonable child support award. In reaching this conclusion, the District Court noted that Rachel provided no evidence regarding the type of lifestyle enjoyed by the children prior to the dissolution, and that $2,990 per month would be between $578 and $1,155 more than the children\u2019s monthly needs as documented by Rachel. The court further recognized that Gerardo had obligations to his children as well as his creditors, and thus her argument about receiving Gerardo\u2019s disposable income was not persuasive. The District Court also rejected Rachel\u2019s request to make the child support increase retroactive to the beginning of Gerardo\u2019s new job. The District Court determined that such retroactive application would be unjust because Gerardo had more than adequately taken care of the needs of the two children during the previous two years. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b611 In child support modification cases, this Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Martinich-Buhl, </em>2002 MT 224, \u00b6 12, 311 Mont. 375, \u00b6 12, 56 P.3d 317, \u00b6 12. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Marriage of Martinich-Buhl, </em>\u00b6 12. Where a court modifies child support pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, its determinations regarding substantial and continuing changed circumstances and unconscionability are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>discretionary. Thus, we review those determinations for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Jarussi, </em>1998 MT 272, \u00b6 7, 291 Mont. 371, \u00b6 7, 968 P.2d 720, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b612 ISSUE 1: Did the District Court err by establishing child support at less than the amount legally presumed correct under the Montana Child Support Guidelines?</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b613  Before modifying child support, \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, requires a finding of substantial and continuing changed circumstances that make the terms of the original support award unconscionable. <em>Marriage ofJarussi, </em>\u00b6 7. Changed circumstances and unconscionability are distinct factors which must be independently addressed. <em>Marriage of Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 7 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Clyatt, </em>267 Mont. 119, 123, 882 P.2d 503, 506 (1994)). If a court finds that substantial and continuing changed circumstances surrounding the child support obligation exist, the court must then make a determination regarding unconscionability. <em>Marriage of Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 7 (citing <em>Marriage of Clyatt, </em>267 Mont. at 123-24, 882 P.2d at 506). In order to demonstrate changed circumstances, a party must provide specific evidence of changed economic circumstances or actual increased need. <em>In re Marriage of Rummer, </em>2002 MT 168, \u00b6 18, 310 Mont. 470, \u00b6 18, 51 P.3d 513, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Pearson, </em>1998 MT 236, \u00b6 44, 291 Mont. 101, \u00b6 44, 965 P.2d 268, \u00b6 44). Without specific evidence of changed economic circumstances or actual increased need, the change in a party\u2019s income is not a sufficient basis to warrant modification of the decree or to support a conclusion that there was a change in circumstances so substantial as to render the original decree unconscionable. <em>In re Marriage of Gingerich, </em>269 Mont. 161, 165, 887 P.2d 714, 716 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b614 District courts must follow statutory criteria and the Guidelines when ordering or modifying child support. <em>Marriage of Martinich-Buhl, </em>\u00b6 19. Section 40-4-204(3)(a), MCA, requires a district court to apply the Guidelines \u201cunless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the application of the standards and guidelines is unjust to the child or to any of the parties or that it is inappropriate in that particular case.\u201d If the district court makes such a finding of unjustness, \u201cit shall state its reasons for that finding,\u201d including \u201ca statement of the amount of support that would have ordinarily been ordered under the guidelines.\u201d Section 40-4-204(3)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u00b615 Admin. R. M. 37.62.102(1) states that the \u201cguidelines create a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>presumption of the adequacy and reasonableness of child support awards. However, every case must be determined on its own merits and circumstances and the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that a child\u2019s needs are or are not being met.\u201d If a variance from the guidelines is requested by one of the parties, the variance \u201cmust take into account the best interests of the child.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.62.102(2).</p>\n<p id=\"AFX\">\u00b616 In this case, the parties agreed to a variance in the stipulated parenting plan and order, which the court incorporated into the final decree of dissolution. This variance was based on the fact Gerardo\u2019s employment was going to change. The parties agreed that the child support order \u201cshall be revised\u201d when Gerardo found new employment. When Rachel petitioned the court to revise the child support to the amount the Guidelines suggested based on Gerardo\u2019s new salary, the court varied from the Guidelines and revised the amount of support by raising it $490 per month. The District Court found by clear and convincing evidence that the application of the Guidelines would be unjust to Gerardo. It concluded that although the circumstance of Gerardo\u2019s higher salary was substantial and continuing, the higher salary was not a sufficient basis to support a conclusion that there was a change in circumstances so substantial as to render the original decree unconscionable. Rachel failed to provide specific evidence of changed economic circumstances or actual increased need for the additional child support. In her deposition and trial testimony, the court found Rachel was actually receiving an amount greater than the children\u2019s needs. However, pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement to revise the support award, and Gerardo\u2019s offer to increase support to $2,990 a month, the court awarded $2,990 per month in child support. The court took into consideration the fact that the children\u2019s needs were being met, and stated its reasons why it found Rachel\u2019s request to be unjust. Namely, the court found that the requested increase in support would amount to a tax-free maintenance award for Rachel. Thus, the District Court\u2019s finding that the current award lacked unconscionability was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b617 In its decision, the District Court relied on <em>Marriage of Jarussi </em>and \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, using the changed circumstances and unconscionability factors. Rachel argues that neither <em>Marriage of Jarussi </em>or \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA, applies because the original award of child support was a temporary amount based on the parties\u2019 agreement to revise it when Gerardo obtained new employment. Rachel relies on <em>Stoneman v. Drollinger, </em>2000 MT 274, 302 Mont. 107, 14 P.3d 12, for the proposition that a court can revise a temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>order of child support without proof of substantial and continuing changed circumstances that render the original award unconscionable as required -under \u00a7 40-4-208, MCA. In this case, the child support was awarded pursuant to a stipulated parenting plan and order and incorporated into the final decree, which the parties relied upon for two years. It was not a temporary order.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b618  Rachel argues the parties\u2019 agreement to revise child support constitutes a written agreement pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(2)(b)(ii), MCA. She further attempts to distinguish <em>Marriage of Jarussi </em>on the basis that the Jarussis\u2019 agreement was to <em>review </em>child support, unlike the Midences\u2019 agreement to <em>revise </em>child support. <em>See Marriage of Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 13. The court recognized this distinction. In <em>Marriage of Jarussi, </em>this Court determined that an agreement to review an award does not equate to written consent to modify the award. <em>Marriage of Jarussi, </em>\u00b6 13. Based on this statement, the District Court concluded, and we agree, that an agreement to revise child support is not an agreement that the amount should be so large as to be unjust. Even when the parties agree to modify child support, but do not agree to the amount, the statutory criteria and the Guidelines are still applicable in determining whether a variance should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b619 ISSUE 2: Did the District Court err by refusing to order child support retroactive to the date the parties originally agreed to recalculate temporary child support?</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b620 Rachel argues that, since she and Gerardo agreed to revise child support upon Gerardo securing employment, the increase in child support should be made retroactive to the beginning of Gerardo\u2019s new employment. She again contends that such a retroactive award would only harm Gerardo\u2019s creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b621  In refusing to order retroactive child support, the District Court found that Gerardo had more than adequately taken care of the needs of the children during the previous two years. In fact, the District Court found that the original amount of $2,500 per month was more than necessary to meet the needs of the children under both of the monthly expense calculations provided by Rachel. Given these facts, it was within the discretion of the District Court to refuse to order retroactive child support. <em>See Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u00b622 We affirm the child support established by the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
