Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and later entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>judgment against Thompson for misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (DUI). Thompson appeals the denial of his motion to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b62 The issue is whether the District Court erred in finding that particularized suspicion justified an investigative stop of Thompson\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b63 At 1:35 a.m. on January 14, 2004, Lewis and Clark County Deputy Sheriff Kevin Wright observed a vehicle traveling west on Mill Road. Wright saw the vehicle swerve off the right side of the narrow two-lane road three times before it turned right onto Green Meadow Drive. When turning onto Green Meadow Drive, the vehicle made a wide turn, crossing over the centerline and into the oncoming lane of traffic. After correcting, the driver-later identified as Thompson-continued to swerve in his own driving lane. Wright saw the left front and rear tires of Thompson\u2019s vehicle ride the centerline on Green Meadow Drive, after which the vehicle swerved off the right side of the road. Suspecting the driver might be intoxicated, Wright initiated a traffic stop. He arrested Thompson and charged him with DUI in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA, and DUI per se in violation of \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b64 Thompson was tried in the Lewis and Clark County Justice Court, where he was convicted of DUI and acquitted of DUI per se. He appealed to the District Court, where he moved to suppress all evidence on grounds that Wright did not have reasonable suspicion to stop his vehicle. After an evidentiary hearing at which both Wright and Thompson testified, the District Court denied Thompson\u2019s motion. Thompson later pled guilty to DUI in the District Court, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence seized in an investigatory stop to determine whether the court\u2019s finding that the officer had particularized suspicion to justify the investigatory stop is clearly erroneous, and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Schulke, </em>2005 MT 77, \u00b6 10, 326 Mont. 390, \u00b6 10, 109 P.3d 744, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in concluding particularized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>suspicion justified an investigative stop of Thompson\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b67 A peace officer may stop a person or a vehicle when circumstances create a particularized suspicion that the person or a person within the vehicle is committing an offense. Section 46-5-401(1), MCA. To establish sufficient facts to form a particularized suspicion of wrongdoing to justify an investigative stop, the prosecution must show both (1) objective data from which an experienced officer could make certain inferences; and (2) a resulting suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle in question is or has been engaged in wrongdoing. Whether a particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigative stop. <em>Schulke, </em>\u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b68 Thompson states Wright did not observe him speeding, driving erratically, or causing an accident or near accident. He also points out that Wright did not cite him for any driving offenses other than DUI. Consequently, Thompson contends Wright did not have reasonable suspicion to justify a stop. Thompson compares this case to <em>State v. Lafferty, </em>291 Mont. 157, 967 P.2d 363 (1998), and <em>Morris v. State, </em>2001 MT 13, 304 Mont. 114, 18 P.3d 1003. His comparisons are misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"ANM\"><em>\u00b69 Lafferty </em>involved three subissues regarding particularized suspicion and the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. The first subissue related to our three-factor test for evaluating a citizen informant\u2019s information with regard to a possible drunk driver, as set forth in <em>State v. Pratt, </em>286 Mont. 156, 951 P.2d 37 (1997). <em>See Lafferty, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-12. That matter is not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b610 The second subissue in <em>Lafferty </em>concerned the officer\u2019s observations and whether the driving at issue was either illegal or indicative of impairment. The district court determined that crossing a fog line constituted a traffic violation under \u00a7 61-8-328, MCA (1995). We disagreed, concluding that crossing onto and barely over the fog line did not violate the statute. <em>Lafferty, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-18. That matter also is not at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b611 Finally, we addressed in <em>Lafferty </em>whether the driving was \u201cerratic!], or all over the road, crossing the center line and the fog line, [or] weaving in and out of traffic\u201d so as to constitute a basis for particularized suspicion under <em>Hulse v. State, Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 39, 289 Mont. 94, \u00b6 39, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 39. <em>Lafferty, </em>\u00b6 16. Based on the officer\u2019s testimony, we determined it was not, concluded that-under the totality of the circumstances-the officer did not have facts supporting a particularized suspicion that Lafferty was committing an offense, and reversed the district court\u2019s denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>motion to suppress. <em>Lafferty, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b612 In the present case, unlike <em>Lafferty, </em>the officer\u2019s observations established a statutory violation. Crossing the center line of Green Meadow Drive constitutes a traffic violation under \u00a7 61-8-321, MCA, and a violation of traffic laws provides particularized suspicion to stop. <em>See Schulke, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted). Finally, here-unlike in <em>Lafferty </em>\u2014 Wright testified that, based on his training and experience and the driving abnormalities he observed, he suspected the driver was intoxicated. <em>Lafferty </em>is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b613 In <em>Morris, </em>the City of Great Falls appealed from a district court order denying its motion to alter or amend a judgment granting a petition for revocation of the suspension of a driver\u2019s license, which was based on the court\u2019s determination that insufficient particularized suspicion existed for the traffic stop. Because we were reviewing the denial of a motion to alter or amend a judgment, the standard of review was different than that in the present case. <em>See Morris, </em>\u00b6 4. In addition, <em>Morris </em>was factually different from the present case in that, there, the City\u2019s evidence was that the vehicle merely \u201cdrifted\u201d a foot or so across a lane line and across the fog fine at the edge of the roadway, but did not cross the centerline of the road. The record did not contain testimony that Morris was speeding or driving erratically. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 10. Here, the officer testified that Thompson\u2019s vehicle made a wide turn, crossing over the centerline into the oncoming lane of traffic. The officer also testified that, after overcorrecting, Thompson continued to swerve in his own driving lane, rode the centerline and swerved off the right side of the road. According to the officer, this driving led him to suspect that Thompson might be intoxicated. <em>Morris </em>does not support Thompson\u2019s argument here.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b614 In his reply brief, and for the first time, Thompson challenges several of the District Court\u2019s findings, stating, \u201cthe District Court\u2019s findings are supported by evidence in the form of Deputy Wright\u2019s testimony, however they are not based upon reasonable inferences from objective data.\u201d We do not address legal theories raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 23(c); <em>State v. Sattler, </em>1998 MT 57, \u00b6 47, 288 Mont. 79, \u00b6 47, 956 P.2d 54, \u00b6 47 (citations omitted). For that reason, we decline to discuss those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b615 This case is comparable to <em>State v. Steen, </em>2004 MT 343,324 Mont. 272, 102 P.3d 1251. In <em>Steen, </em>a Bozeman police officer observed a pickup making a wide left turn into the far lane of a one-way street, a violation of \u00a7 61-8-333(l)(b), MCA (2001). The officer then observed the truck straddling both lanes as it continued down the one-way street. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>On the basis of those observations, the officer made an investigative stop which ultimately led him to charge the driver with DUI. We affirmed the determinations of both the justice court and the district court that the evidence presented was enough for the officer to suspect the driver had engaged in wrongdoing, which was sufficient to justify the investigative stop. <em>Steen, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b616  Here, Officer Wright observed Thompson making a wide right turn onto Green Meadow Drive and crossing into the oncoming lane of traffic, a violation of \u00a7 61-8-333(1), MCA. That observation constituted objective data from which an experienced officer could infer that the occupant of the vehicle was engaged in wrongdoing. We hold that, together with Wright\u2019s other observations of Thompson\u2019s driving, Wright had enough evidence to suspect that Thompson had engaged in wrongdoing, which was sufficient to justify the investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"AgF\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
