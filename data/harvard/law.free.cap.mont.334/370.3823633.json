Karlson (Karlson). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in determining the boundary line between the parties\u2019 properties?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">\u00b64 Clyde and Myrtle Norman (Normans) owned a parcel of real property on the east lakeshore of Flathead Lake, being a part or portion of Government Lot 4, Section 16, Township 24 North, Range 19 West, Lake County, Montana. In December 1971, Clyde Norman marked off a proposed division of the property into two parcels, a northern parcel and southern parcel, for the purpose of granting the southern parcel to their daughter and son-in-law, Gladys and Ludvik Rosich. A road surveyor, Ludvik prepared a survey of the divided lots using a third order ground survey method (i.e., transit, Dietzger, and steel tape). However, because Ludvik was not a registered land surveyor, the survey was signed off on June 4, 1973, by Gordon Sorenson, a registered land surveyor. The completed survey, denominated as Certificate of Survey H-2131, and a deed conveying the southern parcel to Gladys and Ludvik was recorded on November 9, 1973. The northern parcel was retained by the Normans, who transferred the parcel to other family members. The parcel was ultimately transferred to Karlson.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">\u00b65 Rosich remains the owner of the southern parcel. A dispute arose between Karlson and Rosich regarding the location of the common property line between their respective properties, and, as a result, Karlson filed an action requesting the District Court to declare and adjudicate the correct and proper location of the boundary fine between the two tracts of land pursuant to the Montana Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, \u00a7 27-8-101, et seq., MCA. Karlson asserted that the boundary line was properly identified by the survey prepared by surveyor Jane Eby (Eby survey). Rosich denied that the Eby survey correctly identified the dividing line and filed a counterclaim asserting the boundary line was properly shown on the survey prepared by surveyor Greg Marengo (Marengo survey).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u00b66 The case was tried before the District Court without a jury. On February 1,2005, the court entered judgment in favor of Karlson. The court found that the property had been divided pursuant to a family transfer exemption under the Subdivision and Platting Act, and declared the true and correct property line was as depicted by the Eby survey. Rosich filed a motion to amend and supplement the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and to alter or amend the order, which Karlson opposed and the District Court denied. Rosich appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u00b67 \u201cDeclaratory relief is an equitable remedy.\u201d <em>Oregon ex rel. Dept. of Transp. v.

We note that, in 'undertaking this issue, it appears<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the District Court applied the 2003 version of the Act. Although we ultimately determine herein that the 2003 version of the Act is not applicable to this division, we nonetheless initially undertake consideration of the District Court\u2019s analysis under the 2003 statutes, in order to address other pertinent issues raised in its order and to provide guidance upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u00b610 If the property division here was not exempted and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>subject to the Act\u2019s review and regulation, then the survey standards to be applied would be those provided by \u00a7 76-3-402, MCA (2003), entitled \u201cSurvey and platting requirements for subdivided lands.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the other hand, if the property division qualified as an exemption under the Act, then the survey would be governed by \u00a7 76-3-401, MCA (2003), entitled \u201cSurvey requirements for lands other than subdivisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b611 In addressing the exemption issue, the District Court concluded the Normans\u2019 division of the property was \u201cfor the benefit of their children\u201d and, therefore, was \u201ca division of land not considered a subdivision under \u00a7 76-3-207(l)(a), MCA.\u201d However, this statute provides that \u201cdivisions made outside of platted subdivisions for the purpose of relocating common boundary lines between adjoining properties\u201d are \u201cnot subdivisions under this chapter.\u201d The problem here is apparent: although the District Court concluded that the division qualified for a family exemption, it nonetheless cited the provision governing a common boundary exemption. This division could not have qualified as a common boundary relocation, because the land divided was wholly owned by the Normans \u2014 there was no common boundary line between multiple owners at the time of the division that could have been relocated. Thus, the exemption provided under \u00a7 76-3-207(l)(a), MCA (2003), could not have been applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"ARp\">\u00b612 The District Court may have intended to refer to \u00a7 76-3-207(l)(b), MCA (2003), which provides an exemption from subdivision review for divisions made \u201cfor the purpose of a single gift or sale in each county to each member of the landowner\u2019s immediate family.\u201d This supposition arises from the District Court\u2019s finding that the Normans\u2019 division was for the benefit of their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b613 However, even if this Court\u2019s conjecture is correct, and the District Court intended to rely on \u00a7 76-3-207(l)(b), MCA (2003), in concluding that the division was exempted under the Act by virtue of a family transfer, the court\u2019s order was unclear about the surveying criteria it was applying to the division. The District Court concluded that \u201cthis is not a subdivision under \u00a7 76-3-207(l)(a) M.C.A., so \u00a7 76-3-402 M.C.A., does not apply,\u201d but nonetheless found that the Eby survey, which it ruled was the correct survey, \u201cutilized, conformed to, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>adhered to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management instructions\u201d \u2014 the criteria required by \u00a7 76-3-402, MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b614 Though we raise the above-referenced concerns to assist in analyzing the matter upon remand, the greater question is which version of the Act is applicable herein. Obviously, before questions about the Act, its exemptions, and the proper survey criteria can be taken up, the applicable version of the Act must be determined. The issue here involves an element of time, that is, the intention when the property was originally divided. \u201cThe object of all rules for the establishment of boundaries is to ascertain the actual location of the boundary as made <em>at the time.\u201d Rogers Bros. Coal Co. v. Roberts, </em>287 S.W. 725, 726 (Ky. App. 1926) (emphasis added). \u201cAs to boundary disputes, the primary purpose is to track the footsteps of the original surveyor, to locate the survey as it was intended to be located on the ground by him.\u201d <em>State v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, </em>228 A.2d 587, 595 (Del. Super. 1967) (citing <em>Moore v. Campbell, </em>254 S.W.2d 1018, 1024 (Tex. Civ. App. 1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b615 Thus, the law governing survey criteria at the time of the transaction must be applied. \u201c[Courts] have long held that parties to a conveyance have a right to rely upon the law as it was at that time.\u201d <em>Ark. Presbytery of Cumberland v. Hudson, </em>40 S.W.3d 301, 310 (Ark. 2001), <em>cert denied, </em>534 U.S. 945, 122 S. Ct. 329 (2001); <em>see generally </em>23 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Deeds </em>\u00a7 9 (2002) (a court evaluates a conveyance \u201c[f]rom the standpoint of time, the law in effect at the time of the execution of a deed governs its validity and interpretation\u201d). The Supreme Court of Missouri has held that \u201c[i]n determining the meaning of the provisions of the deed, we \u2018must be governed by the law in force at the time it was made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leeper v. Leeper, </em>147 S.W.2d 660, 662 (Mo. 1941) (quoting <em>Frame v. Humphreys, </em>64 S.W. 116, 119 (Mo. 1901)). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Nebraska has held that \u201cthe general rule is that: \u2018[f]rom the standpoint of time the law in effect at the time of the execution of a deed governs its validity and interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dell v. City of Lincoln, </em>102 N.W.2d 62, 68 (Neb. 1960) (citation omitted). We have stated, about contracts generally, that \u201c[t]he laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract, and where it is to be performed, enter into and form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms.\u201d <em>City of Philipsburg v. Porter, </em>121 Mont. 188, 193, 190 P.2d 676, 678 (1948) (citations omitted). Section 70-1-513, MCA, provides that \u201c[g]rants are to be interpreted in like manner with contracts . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b616  The District Court found that the deed and survey exhibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>dividing the Normans\u2019 property were \u201cfiled for record in the office of the Lake County Clerk and Recorder on November 9,1973.\u201d As such, the District Court should have looked to the law in effect at that time, not in 2003. We note that the transfer here was recorded after the enactment of the 1973 Montana Subdivision and Platting Act, which was effective October 1,1973, and made applicable to \u201call division of real property made after June 30,1973, into lots, tracts, or parcels any of which is ten (10) acres or less in size.\u201d Laws of Montana (1973), ch. 500, \u00a7 4. Thus, questions regarding exemptions and survey criteria under the Act must be resolved pursuant to the status of the Act at that time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b617 We conclude the District Court\u2019s order is flawed because of internal inconsistencies and the application of the wrong version of the Act. Accordingly, we remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings. It is up to the District Court to determine whether the additional taking of evidence and/or factfinding is necessary in order to determine the proper survey criteria and resolve the boundary issue in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b618 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\"> The version of the statute applied by the District Court is not expressly identified in its order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\"> Those requirements include that \u201cretracement of lines must conform to United States bureau of land management instructions, and all public land survey comers must be filed in accordance with Comer Recordation Act of Montana ...\u201d Section 76-3-402(3), MCA (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> Of course, the Act changed considerably between 1973 and 2003.
