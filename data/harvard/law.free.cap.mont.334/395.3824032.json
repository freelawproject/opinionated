(SVKV), doing business as Beehive Homes of Helena, on Harding\u2019s counterclaims, and from the court\u2019s later order denying Harding\u2019s request for a hearing on SVKV\u2019s motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by failing to hold a hearing or obtain the parties\u2019 express waiver of a hearing before granting SVKV summary judgment on Harding\u2019s counterclaims?</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to SVKV?</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u00b65 3. Is SVKV entitled to attorney\u2019s fees or costs on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">\u00b66 In October of 1996, Bee Hive Homes of Northern Montana, Inc. (Northern) entered into a contract, with Ken Vivrette and Damian Flaherty signing it in their capacity as Northern\u2019s officers. The other party to the 1996 contract was Bee Hive Development, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">\u00b67 According to a document of record, Bee Hive Homes Development, Inc., was the predecessor of both Bee Hive Homes of America, Inc., and Bee Hive Homes, Inc. Another document states Bee Hive Homes of America, Inc., and Bee Hive Homes, Inc., had entered into an agreement pursuant to which the sub-franchisor, Bee Hive Homes, Inc., could in turn sub-franchise to others, upon written consent from Bee Hive Homes of America, Inc. The relationship of these three entities is not at issue in this appeal. Therefore, we refer to all of them as Bee Hive.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">\u00b68 The 1996 contract generally stated that Bee Hive would provide certain plans, specifications, operations and procedural manuals for residential care facilities (homes) in exchange for Northern\u2019s payments of certain sums. One paragraph of the contract stated that, as consideration for Bee Hive\u2019s providing certain consulting services-including assistance in construction-related matters, accounting and payroll procedures, training, and menus-Northern would pay specified percentages of its homes\u2019 gross rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">\u00b69 In late 1996, apparently before or around the same time as the 1996 contract involving Northern was executed, Tricia and Damian Flaherty and Sue and Ken Vivrette formed TDSK, L.L.C. (TDSK) to build and operate homes. It is not clear what, if any, relationship existed between TDSK and Northern. Later-perhaps in March of1999, according to Sue Vivrette\u2019s deposition testimony-the Vivrettes bought out the Flahertys and formed SVKV. The Vivrettes were involved, via <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>one entity or another, in the construction, development and operation of three homes in Lewis and Clark County.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b610 In June of 1998, Bee Hive sent a letter to the Vivrettes, addressed to them at Bee Hive Homes of Helena, in which Bee Hive advised it was \u201crestructuring its operations to conform to all national and federal franchise law\u201d and recommended the execution of a franchise agreement with Bee Hive. The letter also set forth two other options: a repurchase offer and an \u201coption to rej ect the repurchase offer.... This means that you will agree to continue under the existing agreement and that you do not elect to sign a new franchise agreement.\u201d The letter stated that acceptance of either of the last two options would constitute a release of Bee Hive from any claims and liabilities regarding the offer and sale of homes. Neither the Vivrettes nor any entity involving the Vivrettes responded to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b611 Later, in October of 1998, Bee Hive executed a \u201csub-franchise agreement\u201d with Harding, which stated that Bee Hive granted Harding \u201cthe exclusive right to build, own, and operate Bee Hive Homes (under the franchise agreement ...) and to sell franchises on [Bee Hive\u2019s] behalf of Homes using the System under the Names and Marks\u201d within Montana. Under the 1998 agreement, Harding agreed to pay a franchise fee in the amount of 50% of the franchise fees payable under \u201cthe Franchise Agreement for each franchise\u201d after the first eight acquired and owned by Harding, as well as \u201ceach franchise sold\u201d by Harding in Montana. In addition, the 1998 agreement stated that Harding agreed to pay 50% of franchise royalties on the franchises acquired and owned by Harding in Montana and \u201ceach franchise sold\u201d in Montana. After the 1998 agreement was executed by Bee Hive and Harding, SVKV paid Harding certain amounts for a period of time, but later reduced-and ultimately stopped-its payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b612 In August of 2000, SVKV filed a complaint against Ty Harding, doing business as Harding Enterprises, asserting he had demanded money under the 1996 agreement and had threatened to sue SVKV to collect. Among other things, SVKV requested a declaratory judgment that the 1996 contract was void, asserted breach of the 1996 contract, and requested damages and restitution. At different points during the underlying action, the District Court dismissed each of SVKVs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AJC\">\u00b613 Harding answered and counterclaimed, affirmatively alleging that he and Harding Enterprises were actually Harding Enterprises, Inc., and asserting breach of contract, fraud, and unjust enrichment. SVKV responded to the counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u00b614 The District Court held a scheduling conference in June of 2002, which counsel for both parties attended telephonically, and later entered a scheduling order stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\">[w]hen any motion has been fully briefed, oral argument if requested by any party has been held and the motion is submitted for decision, one of the parties must so advise the Court by filing and serving a \u201cNotice of Submittal.\u201d Until such notice has been filed and served, the motion will not be deemed submitted for decision. Hearing on a motion for summary judgment is deemed waived unless a written request for hearing is submitted within the time period for filing the briefs on the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In September of2003, after the parties stipulated to continue the trial date, the court entered another scheduling order containing the same language.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b615 In October of 2003, SVKV moved for summary judgment on Harding\u2019s counterclaims, and Harding responded. On the same day it filed its reply brief in November of 2003, SVKV filed and served a \u201cNotice of Submittal\u201d stating that \u201c[p]ursuant to local rule, the undersigned hereby advised [sic] the Court that briefing on the Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment ... has been completed, neither party has requested oral argument, and the matters may be deemed submitted and ready for decision.\u201d Harding did not dispute or respond to the Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u00b616 In January of2004, the District Court granted SVEN\u2019S motion for summary judgment on Harding\u2019s counterclaims, determining there was no evidence of contractual privity between Harding and SVKV. Approximately four days later, Harding requested a hearing on SVEN\u2019S motion for summary judgment-asserting, among other things, that \u201cit would ... be an abuse of discretion should the Court deny [Harding] a hearing on the matter \u2018unless\u2019 [Harding] \u2018specifically\u2019 waived its right to a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b617 The District Court denied the request for a hearing. It referred Harding to the June 24, 2002 and September 26, 2003 scheduling orders that directed the parties, in bold print, to request a hearing by the end of briefing on a motion or the hearing would be deemed waived. Noting it had ruled two months after briefing was completed and neither party had requested a hearing, the court stated Harding \u201capparently expects the Court to sit on pending summary judgment motions indefinitely until a party decides it wants a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u00b618 Harding appeals. We set forth additional facts in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a hearing on a summary judgment motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Virginia City v. Olsen, </em>2002 MT 176, \u00b6 13, 310 Mont. 527, \u00b6 13, 52 P.3d 383, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted). A court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Pumphrey v. Empire Lath and Plaster, </em>2006 MT 99, \u00b6 16, 332 Mont. 116, \u00b6 16, 135 P.3d 797, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>determining whether-viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor-genuine issues of material fact exist and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>Prindel v. Ravalli County, </em>2006 MT 62, \u00b6 19, 331 Mont. 338, \u00b6 19, 133 P.3d 165, \u00b6 19 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u00b621 Before addressing the issues before us on appeal, we note the parties\u2019 briefs variously refer to the appellant as Mr. Harding, Harding Enterprises, and Harding Enterprises, Inc. In this regard, we observe the 1998 agreement names Harding Enterprises, Inc. as \u201cSub-Franchisor\u201d and is signed, in pertinent part, \u201cSub-Franchisor: By Ty Harding, Its Owner\u201d-an unusual designation for a person signing on a corporation\u2019s behalf. Although Harding alleged a corporate status via its answer and counterclaims, Harding has never moved to amend the caption under which SVKV filed its complaint, which is the caption set forth above. However, both parties and the District Court have used a caption-never formally adopted-naming Ty Harding, doing business as Harding Enterprises as the defendant and, below a line, naming Harding Enterprises, Inc., as the counterclaimant against SVKV as counterdefendant. Indeed, the District Court\u2019s orders at issue in this appeal have different captions. Moreover, Harding\u2019s notice of appeal states \u201cDefendant above named\u201d-referring to Ty Harding, doing business as Harding Enterprises-\u201cappeals ... in this case.\u201d SVKV has not questioned the propriety of Harding Enterprises, Inc.\u2019s counterclaims where it has not been named as a defendant. Nor has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>either party asked the District Court or this Court to resolve the apparent confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b622 Absent any request by the parties to determine the counterclaimant\u2019s or appellant\u2019s identity, we decline to make such a determination. We use the original caption in this case because that caption was never properly amended. Further, without resolving the actual identity of the appellant, we refer to the appellant as \u201cHarding\u201d and \u201cit\u201d and we refer to Ty Harding as an individual only in association with his deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b623 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by failing to hold a bearing or obtain the parties\u2019 express waiver of a hearing before granting SVKV summary judgment on Harding\u2019s counterclaims?</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b624 Harding asserts it was \u201ccaught off guard\u201d by the District Court\u2019s order granting SVKV summary judgment because it expected that, before granting summary judgment, the court would schedule a hearing or obtain the parties\u2019 express waiver of the hearing. Harding does not dispute that the scheduling orders state without equivocation that the District Court would determine a party waived the right to a hearing on a summary judgment motion if the party did not request a hearing before the close of briefing. Nor does Harding dispute that it failed to respond when SVKV filed and served its Notice that neither party had requested a hearing before the end of briefing and the matter was submitted for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u00b625 Harding argues that-despite the scheduling orders and its failure to respond to SVKVs Notice-this Court\u2019s prior cases require a court to schedule a hearing or obtain express waivers from the parties before granting summary judgment. On this basis, Harding contends the District Court abused its discretion by granting summary judgment without a hearing and denying Harding\u2019s post-judgment motion for a hearing. As the following somewhat detailed discussion bears out, we conclude <em>Cole v. Flathead County, </em>236 Mont. 412, 771 P.2d 97 (1989)-one case advanced by Harding-controls here.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u00b626 In <em>Cole, </em>the district court granted the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, without a hearing, on grounds that the plaintiffs had not filed a response brief within ten days, the time limit set forth in Rule 2(a) of the Montana Uniform District Court Rules (MUDCR). <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 414, 771 P.2d at 98. In doing so, the district court apparently relied on Rule 2(b), MUDCR, which states, in part, that \u201c[flailure to file briefs may subject the motion to summary ruling .... Failure to file an answer brief by the adverse party within ten days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>shall be deemed an admission that the motion is well taken.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 415, 771 P.2d at 99. On appeal, the issues were whether the time limit for filing a response brief in Rule 2, MUDCR, applied to summary judgment motions, whether a party is entitled to rely upon the setting of a hearing or oral argument on a motion for summary judgment, and whether any conflict existed among the MUDCR, the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure and the district court\u2019s Policies and Procedures. <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 413-14, 771 P.2d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b627 Addressing the first issue, we noted Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., allows a party to serve affidavits opposing a summary judgment motion \u201cprior to the day of hearing,\u201d and a court may consider oral testimony at a summary judgment hearing. <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 415-16, 771 P.2d at 99. Accordingly, we determined the time limit for briefing set forth in Rule 2(a), MUDCR, conflicted with Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., which authorizes a court to grant summary judgment only if, among other things, no genuine issues of material fact exist-an \u201cinquiry [that] does not admit of decision merely on a technical point, such as whether briefs have been filed on time.\u201d Pursuant to Rule 2(e), MUDCR-which provides that in the event of a conflict, the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure control-we concluded that the 10-day time limit contained in Rule 2(a), MUDCR, did not apply to summary judgment motions. <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 416-17, 771 P.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b628 We next addressed the remaining issues, both of which we characterized as related to the question of the necessity of a hearing in connection with a summary judgment motion. <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 417, 771 P.2d at 100. Noting that either party \u201ccould have applied to the [djistrict [c]ourt for a hearing,\u201d we opined that the parties \u201cmay have been deterred\u201d in that respect by a provision in the district court\u2019s Policies and Procedures. <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 417-18, 771 P.2d at 100. The Policies and Procedures provision stated that the district court\u2019s \u201c \u2018practice will be to discourage\u2019 \u201d oral arguments and that the court would require \u201c \u2018full-fledged compliance\u2019 \u201d with Rules 2(c) and (d), MUDCR-by which the court meant a request for oral argument \u201c \u2018must be couched in specific terms, to show me that briefs alone are insufficient to advise me fully of your client\u2019s contentions and all relevant points of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101. In this regard, we note Rules 2(c) and (d), MUDCR, unchanged since that time, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">(c) Oral argument. The court may order oral argument sua sponte or upon application of a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>(d) When motion deemed submitted. Unless oral argument is ordered or unless the time is enlarged by the court, the motion is deemed submitted at the expiration of any of the applicable time limits set forth above without supporting briefs having been filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-4\">If oral argument is ordered, the motion will be deemed submitted at the close of argument unless the court orders additional briefs, in which case the motion will be deemed submitted as of the date designated as the time for filing the final brief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b629 On appeal in <em>Cole, </em>we quoted Dredge <em>Corp. v. Penny, </em>338 F.2d 456, 461-62 (9th Cir. 1964)-a case involving a local rule that effectively precluded an adverse party from requesting a hearing by requiring that such a request be attached to the underlying motion-for its statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">Rule[s] 56(c), 78 and 83, read together, authorize district courts to provide by a rule that a party desiring oral argument on a motion for summary judgment must apply therefore, in the absence of which oral argument will be deemed to have been waived. Such a local rule was involved, and upheld, in <em>Bagby v. United States </em>[(8th Cir. 1952), 199 F.2d 233].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\"><em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101. We also determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">[i]n view of the language of Rule 56(c), and having in mind that the granting of such a motion disposes of the action on the merits, with prejudice, a district court <em>may not, </em>by rule or otherwise, <em>preclude </em>a party <em>from requesting oral argument, </em>nor deny such a request when made by a party opposing the motion unless the motion for summary judgment is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\"><em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\u00b630 Subsequently, the Court stated \u201c[w]e hold, therefore, that unless the right to a hearing on a Rule 56 motion is specifically waived by all parties (and not waived simply by the failure to file briefs) either the movant or the adverse parties are entitled to a hearing under Rule 56 in the ordinary case.\u201d The Court acknowledged that a trial court might dispense with a hearing if the moving party were \u201cclearly entitled\u201d to judgment as a matter of law, but determined that situation was not present there. Finally, the Court observed the district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d did not include a determination that no genuine issue of material fact existed and, therefore, did not specify the grounds for granting the motion with sufficient particularity as to apprise the parties and appellate court of its rationale, as required by Rule 52(a), M.R.Civ.P. Consequently, the Court reversed the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>granting summary judgment and remanded. <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 419, 771 P.2d at 101-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b631 In <em>Cole, </em>we distinguished the acceptable trial court practice of requiring parties to request an oral argument or hearing from a rule deterring or precluding a party from making such a request-such as the Policies and Procedures provision in <em>Cole </em>and the \u201cattachment\u201d requirement in <em>Dredge Corp. </em>Our acknowledgment in <em>Cole </em>that either party could have applied for a hearing, although the parties in that case might have been deterred by the district court\u2019s Policies and Procedures, was entirely consistent with this distinction. <em>See Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 417-18, 771 P.2d at 100. Thus, in <em>Cole, </em>we expressly approved requirements for parties to request summary judgment hearings, so long as courts do not preclude or deter such requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b632 Regarding our statement in <em>Cole </em>that a party must have \u201cspecifically waived\u201d the right to a hearing on a summary judgment motion, that statement also includes the parenthetical phrase \u201cand not waived simply by the failure to file briefs.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 419, 771 P.2d at 101. This parenthetical phrase-which has not been carried forward in the post-CoZe cases mentioned below that refer to \u201cspecific\u201d or \u201cexplicit\u201d waiver-establishes that, in <em>Cole, </em>we rejected any notion that a party could waive the right to a hearing by merely failing to file a brief. We did not address in <em>Cole </em>whether \u201cspecific\u201d or \u201cexplicit\u201d waiver could occur if a party failed to request a hearing in the face of a requirement for such a request; however, that interpretation is supported by <em>Cole\u2019s </em>favorable citation of <em>Dredge Corp. </em>At the very least, the language in <em>Cole </em>regarding \u201cspecific\u201d waiver, as opposed to waiver by failing to file a response brief, in no way contradicts the earlier-almost immediately preceding-statement that a trial court may require a party to apply for a summary judgment hearing and, absent such a request, deem the right to a hearing waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b633 Here, the District Court\u2019s scheduling orders provided that a party could request oral argument or hearing at any time during briefing on the motion. As discussed above, that requirement is entirely consistent with-and expressly authorized <em>by-Cole. </em>Harding has advanced nothing of record suggesting that the District Court precluded or deterred it from requesting a hearing; indeed, the scheduling orders state in bold print that parties could submit a written request during briefing. Thus, the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment without a hearing is consistent with <em>Cole.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b634 Harding also relies on post-CoZe cases in support of its position that a hearing was required in this case. It advances <em>Aetna Life Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>Co. v. Jordan, </em>254 Mont. 208, 211, 835 P.2d 770, 772 (1992), for the proposition that a district court may not preclude a party from requesting oral argument on a summary judgment motion or deny such a request by the party opposing the motion unless the motion for summary judgment is denied. In addition, Harding relies on <em>Estate of Schwabe v. Custer\u2019s Inn, </em>2000 MT 325, \u00b6 55, 303 Mont. 15, \u00b6 55, 15 P.3d 903, \u00b6 55, regarding the statement that \u201c[a]s a general rule, an oral argument is required for summary judgment unless it is specifically waived by all parties\u201d-a statement we made before declining to address a party\u2019s assertion that it was entitled to a second summary judgment hearing because that assertion was raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Estate of Schwabe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56-57. In this regard, we note that other cases include similar \u201cspecifically waived\u201d or \u201cexplicitly waived\u201d language. <em>See, e.g., Virginia City, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Linn v. City County Health Dept., </em>1999 MT 235, \u00b6 8, 296 Mont. 145, \u00b6 8, 988 P.2d 302, \u00b6 8. Harding also advances <em>Konitz v. Clover, </em>1998 MT 27, \u00b6 31, 287 Mont. 301, \u00b6 31, 954 P.2d 1138, \u00b6 31, in which we agreed with a contention that parties are entitled as a matter of right to a hearing on a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b635 As in <em>Cole, </em>these statements in post-CoZe cases establish that a party is entitled to a summary judgment hearing and a court may not deter or preclude a party from requesting one. Nothing in our post-<em>Cole </em>cases has altered our statement in <em>Cole </em>that a court may require parties to request hearings on summary judgment motions. Nor have any of our post-CoZe cases addressed the issue presented here: whether a party who fails to timely request a hearing on a summary judgment motion-despite a requirement for such a request-is nevertheless entitled to a hearing, especially after the trial court has ruled on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b636  It is undisputed that Harding did not request a hearing or assert its right to a hearing until after the District Court entered summary judgment for SVKV-despite receiving ample notice, via the scheduling orders and SVEN\u2019S Notice, that the District Court would deem the hearing waived and decide the motion without a hearing unless a party requested one. As noted above, Harding has advanced nothing to suggest the District Court precluded or deterred it from requesting a hearing on SVEN\u2019S summary judgment motion or otherwise interfered with its right to a hearing. Given these circumstances and our case law, Harding has not established that in granting summary judgment without a hearing, the District Court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>See Pumphrey, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b637 We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion by granting summary judgment to SVKV on Harding\u2019s counterclaims without first holding a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b638 2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b639 Harding asserts entitlement to payments from SVKV based on certain provisions in the 1996 contract and 1998 agreement. Paragraph 3.3 of the 1996 contract states that Northern agreed to pay to Bee Hive</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">[a]s consideration for the consulting services described in paragraph 2, six percent (6%) of the gross rents payable monthly, beginning sixty (60) days after issuance of the occupancy permit on the first five (5) Homes, four percent (4%) after the sixth Home occupancy permit is issued and ending ten (10) years after said date. After ten (10) years, Northern shall pay two percent (2%) of the gross rents in perpetuity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Paragraph 2.1 of the 1998 agreement between Harding and Bee Hive reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">Grant of Franchise. Subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, Franchisor [Bee Hive] hereby grants to Sub-Franchisor [Harding], and Sub-Franchisor hereby accepts, the exclusive right to build, own, and operate Bee Hive Homes (under the franchise agreement...) and to sell franchises on Franchisor\u2019s behalf of Homes using the System under the Names and Marks within [Montana].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Paragraph 3.2 of the 1998 agreement states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">Franchise Fee. Sub-Franchisor hereby promises and agrees to pay to Franchisor a franchise fee (the \u201cFranchise Fee\u201d) in the amount of Fifty Percent (50%) of: (I) the Franchise Fees payable under the Franchise Agreement for each franchise acquired and owned by Sub-Franchisor in the Area, provided that no Franchise Fees shall be paid on the first 8 franchises acquired and owned by the Sub-Franchisor in the Area and (ii) [sic] the Franchise fees payable under the Franchise agreement for each franchise sold by Sub-Franchisee [sic] in the Area, such Franchise Fees to be payable upon the execution and delivery of the Franchise Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8a\">Paragraph 3.3 of the 1998 agreement states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">Royalty. In addition to the Franchise Fee, Sub-Franchisor promises and agrees to pay to Franchisor a royalty (the \u201cRoyalty\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>in the amount of (I) Fifty Percent (50%) of the Franchise Royalties, including interest and penalties, payable by Sub-Franchisor on the first 8 (eight) franchises acquired and owned by the Sub-Franchisor in the Area; (ii) [sic] Fifty Percent (50%) of the Franchise Royalties, including interest and penalties, payable by Sub-Franchisor on the 9th and each additional franchise acquired and owned by the Sub-Franchisor in the Area and (iii) [sic] Fifty Percent (50%) of the Franchise Royalties, including interest and penalties, received by Sub-Franchisor from the Franchisee of each franchise sold in the Area. The Royalty is due and payable on or before the 15th day of the month following the calendar month for which the Franchise Royalties are required to be paid by the Franchisee and the Sub-Franchisor under their respective Franchise Agreements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b640 Harding contends that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to whether the parties to the 1998 agreement-Harding and Bee Hive-intended to assign Bee Hive\u2019s rights under the 1996 contract, including the right to collect money, to Harding. In this regard, Harding correctly notes that nothing in the 1996 contract prohibits assignments. SVKV responds that the 1998 agreement, byits terms, applies only to franchises, and Harding has not raised a genuine issue of material fact or a valid legal argument to refute SVKV\u2019s position that its homes were not franchises. In granting summary judgment to SVKV, the District Court reasoned that, \u201c[w]hile there may be contractual obligations between SVKV and [Bee Hive], there is simply no evidence of privity between Harding and SVKV.\u201d On that basis, the trial court determined no genuine issue of material fact existed, and SVKV was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b641 Replying to SVKV\u2019s argument that the 1998 agreement does not apply to franchises, Harding asserts that if parties to a contract have given a contract term a special meaning, they should be able to advise a court of that special meaning. In this respect, Harding relies on <em>360 Ranch Corp. v. </em>R &amp; D Holding (1996), 278 Mont. 487, 491-92, 926 P.2d 260, 262-63, in which we determined an affidavit-and, more importantly, the language of the agreement at issue-constituted evidence contradicting the district court\u2019s determination that no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding the contract parties\u2019 intent. Because <em>360 Ranch Corp. </em>did not address a special meaning attributed to a term by contract parties, that case does not support Harding\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b642  Section 28-3-501, MCA, however, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>[t]he words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense rather than according to their strict legal meaning unless used by the parties in a technical sense or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage, in which case the latter must be followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Although not entirely clear, it appears Harding\u2019s argument is that Bee Hive and Harding gave a special meaning to the term \u201cfranchises\u201d in the 1998 agreement. In this regard, Bee Hive president Twayne Walker\u2019s affidavit speaks to his interpretation of the 1998 agreement as a whole, rather than to any special meaning of the term \u201cfranchises.\u201d More importantly, Ty Harding testified in his deposition that he did not regard the Vivrettes as franchise holders and that he viewed the 1996 contract between Bee Hive and Northern as an operating agreement rather than a franchise agreement. Based on this testimony, we conclude Harding has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether any special meaning ascribed by the 1998 agreement parties to the term \u201cfranchises\u201d encompasses SVKV\u2019s homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b643  Harding also asserts that the language of the 1998 agreement supports his position that Bee Hive assigned Harding its rights under the 1996 contract. The interpretation of a contract is a question of law. When the contract has been reduced to writing, the parties\u2019 intention is to be ascertained, if possible, from the writing alone; thus, if a contract\u2019s terms are clear and unambiguous, a court must apply the language as written. <em>Wurl v. Polson School Dist. No. </em>23, 2006 MT 8, \u00b6 16, 330 Mont. 282, \u00b6 16, 127 P.3d 436, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted). An ambiguity exists where the language of a contract, as a whole, is reasonably subject to two or more interpretations. When a contract term is ambiguous, interpretation of the term involves determining a question of fact regarding the parties\u2019 intent. The initial determination of whether an ambiguity exists, however, is a question of law for a court to determine. <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 17 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b644  First, Harding contends that-because \u00b6 2.1 specifically refers to homes using the Bee Hive system-a reasonable interpretation of the 1998 agreement is that it assigned Bee Hive\u2019s rights to collect fees from all homes in Montana, including SVKV\u2019s homes. We disagree. Paragraph 2.1 states that Bee Hive granted to Harding \u201cthe exclusive right to build, own, and operate Bee Hive Homes (under the franchise agreement...) and to sell franchises on [Bee Hive\u2019s] behalf[.]\u201d Given Ty Harding\u2019s testimony establishing the 1998 agreement parties\u2019 special meaning of the term \u201cfranchises\u201d did not encompass SVKV\u2019s homes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>discussed above, it is not reasonable to interpret \u00b6 2.1 as applicable to SVKVs homes. Thus, we conclude \u00b6 2.1 does not create an ambiguity with respect to whether the 1998 agreement authorized Harding to collect fees from SVKV pursuant to the 1996 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b645 Next, Harding argues that, by explicitly requiring it to pay Bee Hive 50% of franchise fees and royalties, \u00b6\u00b6 3.2 and 3.3 of the 1998 agreement implicitly authorize Harding to collect 100% of the franchise fees and royalties. From that premise, Harding asserts \u201cthe only logical interpretation of the [1998 agreement] is that Bee Hive intended to assign all of its rights and obligations under the [1996] Contract to Harding, including the right to collect all fees[.]\u201d Harding also advances \u00a7 28-3-201, MCA, which states \u201c[a] contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful, operative, definite, reasonable, and capable of being carried into effect if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b646 Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the 1998 agreement implicitly authorizes Harding to collect franchise fees and royalties in general, the issue here is whether Harding has the right to collect franchise fees and royalties <em>from SVKV. </em>By their terms, \u00b6\u00b6 3.2 and 3.3 apply only to \u201cfranchises\u201d and, as addressed above, Ty Harding\u2019s testimony establishes that the special meaning ascribed by the 1998 agreement parties to the term \u201cfranchises\u201d did not encompass SVKVs homes. In addition, we observe the record lacks any evidence-or, indeed, any argument-that the franchise fees and royalties mentioned in \u00b6\u00b6 3.2 and 3.3 of the 1998 agreement are related in any way to \u00b6 3.3 of the 1996 contract, in which Northern agreed to pay Bee Hive percentages of its homes\u2019 gross rents for \u201cconsulting services.\u201d Thus, we conclude \u00b6\u00b6 3.2 and 3.3 do not create an ambiguity regarding whether the 1998 agreement authorizes Harding to collect payments from SVKV pursuant to the 1996 contract. Having concluded that none of the paragraphs advanced by Harding creates an ambiguity, we further conclude that the 1998 agreement unambiguously does not apply to SVKVs homes and, thus, does not constitute an assignment of any of Bee Hive\u2019s rights under the 1996 contract to Harding.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b647 Harding argues, however, that despite the inclusion of a merger clause in the 1998 agreement, extrinsic evidence-including Walker\u2019s affidavit and Ty Harding\u2019s deposition testimony-is admissible to demonstrate Bee Hive\u2019s intent to assign its rights under the 1996 contract. We reiterate that, in interpreting a contract, we first ascertain the parties\u2019 intent from the writing alone, and resort to extrinsic evidence only if the contract is ambiguous on its face. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Stockman Bank of Montana v. Potts, </em>2002 MT 178, \u00b6 21,311 Mont. 12, \u00b6 21, 52 P.3d 920, \u00b6 21 (citation omitted). Here, we have concluded-as a matter of law-that the 1998 agreement unambiguously does not authorize Harding to collect from SVKV. Thus, no fact question regarding the 1998 agreement parties\u2019 intent exists, and extrinsic evidence is not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b648 Finally, Harding asserts genuine issues of material fact remain regarding its fraud and unjust enrichment counterclaims. Harding concedes its fraud counterclaim is dependent on whether Bee Hive assigned its rights under the 1996 contract. Because we have determined the 1998 agreement did not apply to SVKV\u2019s homes and no assignment of Bee Hive\u2019s rights under the 1996 contract occurred, we need not further address Harding\u2019s fraud counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b649 Harding also contends, however, that its unjust enrichment counterclaim is not dependent on its contractual privity. Harding did not make this argument in the District Court, despite SVKV\u2019s clear assertion that Harding\u2019s fraud and unjust enrichment counterclaims were both dependent on Harding\u2019s privity of contract. While this Court reviews orders granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>we also generally do not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Andersen v. Monforton, </em>2005 MT 310, \u00b6 30, 329 Mont. 460, \u00b6 30, 125 P.3d 614, \u00b6 30 (citation omitted). Thus, we decline to address Harding\u2019s contention further.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b650  We hold the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to SVKV on Harding\u2019s counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b651 3. Is SVKV entitled to attorney\u2019s fees or costs on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b652 SVKV requests attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal. First, noting Harding\u2019s counterclaims were based on the 1996 contract, SVKV relies on a provision of that contract stating that the prevailing party in an action to enforce a provision of the contract is entitled to costs and attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. SVKV advances no authority, however, for the proposition that we may require an unsuccessful litigant-as Harding is here on appeal-to pay costs or attorney\u2019s fees on appeal under a contract provision, after we have determined that litigant was not in privity to the contract. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires an appellant to support arguments with citations to relevant authorities. <em>See In re Marriage of Markegard, </em>2006 MT 111, \u00b6 34, 332 Mont. 187, \u00b6 34, 136 P.3d 532, \u00b6 34 (citation omitted). Rule 23(b), M.R.App.P., requires the same of respondents. Absent authority, we decline to further address SVKV\u2019s request for costs and attorney\u2019s fees on appeal based on the contractual provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u00b653  Regarding costs on appeal, SVKV also relies on \u00a7 25-10-104, MCA, wliich provides that, except in certain circumstances not applicable here in which this Court has discretion to award costs, \u201cthe successful party shall recover from the other party his costs.\u201d Rule 33(a), M.R.App.P., states costs will be taxed as provided by \u00a7 25-10-104, MCA, and unless otherwise provided by the Court in its decision, costs will automatically be awarded to the successful party. Thus, under the circumstances in this case, the successful party need not request costs on appeal. Although Harding addresses SVKVs request for attorney\u2019s fees, Harding does not address SVKVs request for costs on appeal pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-104, MCA. We have determined the District Court did not abuse its discretion or err in granting summary judgment to SVKV on Harding\u2019s counterclaims without a hearing. Therefore, SVKV has successfully defended against Harding\u2019s appeal and is entitled to its costs on appeal pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-104, MCA. \u00b654 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-4\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b433-5\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AAZ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"A31\">\u00b655 I concur in the Court\u2019s resolution of Issues Two and Three. However, with respect to Issue One, while I agree with the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Harding waived its right to a summary judgment hearing, I dissent from the analysis proffered by the Court in support of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b656 In a series of cases beginning with <em>Cole v. Flathead County, </em>236 Mont. 412, 771 P.2d 97 (1989), this Court established unequivocally that (1) in the ordinary case, both the movant and the adverse party are \u201centitled\u201d to a hearing on a motion for summary judgment and, therefore, a district court may not \u201cpreclude\u201d a party from requesting oral argument nor \u201cdeny\u201d such a request when made (unless the motion itself is denied), and (2) this right to a hearing exists unless it is \u201cspecifically waived\u201d by all parties. Given these mandates, the admonition set forth in the District Court\u2019s scheduling orders in the case at hand-namely, that a \u201c[h]earing on a motion for summary judgment is <em>deemed </em>waived unless a written request for hearing is submitted within the time period for filing the briefs on the motion\u201d (bold typeface omitted, emphasis added)-is of dubious propriety. Nevertheless, for the reasons set forth below, the court\u2019s admonition is reconcilable with <em>Cole </em>and its progeny, though such reconciliation requires further development of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>waiver rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u00b657 Rather than take on this task, the Court elects instead to completely rewrite <em>Cole </em>so that it \u201cauthorize^]\u201d the District Court\u2019s scheduling orders. As explained below, however, we never in Cole-or in any other case, for that matter-\u201cexpressly approved\u201d or \u201cexpressly authorized\u201d the trial court practice of requiring parties to an action to request a summary judgment hearing or risk waiver. This brand new holding has been fabricated out of thin air by a majority of the Court today and grafted onto the <em>Cole </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b658 In a similar vein, several of our post-CoZe cases contain misstatements of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>core holdings. Yet, rather than deal with these inaccuracies forthrightly, the Court glosses over them with one sentence. Worse still, the Court purports in that one sentence to equate the misstatements in our post <em>-Cole </em>cases with the actual holdings in <em>Cole, </em>as if they all \u201cestablish\u201d the same proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b659 Unfortunately, the inevitable result of the Court\u2019s revisionist approach-as opposed to overruling or clarifying our precedents based on what they <em>actually </em>say-is a take-your-pick buffet of legal rules, which in turn creates confusion and unpredictability. It is therefore necessary to provide an independent discussion of Issue One-one which rests on the actual holdings of <em>Cole </em>and which also clarifies the cases containing inaccurate restatements of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b660 In <em>Cole, </em>we addressed two procedural rules relied on by the district court in granting Flathead County\u2019s motions for summary judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). First, Rule 2 of the Montana Uniform District Court Rules (\u201cM. U. D. C. R.\u201d) provided that \u201c \u2018[flailure to file an answer brief by the adverse party within ten days shall be deemed <em>an admission that the motion is well taken.\u2019 \u201d Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 415, 771 P.2d at 99 (some emphasis omitted) (quoting M. U. D. C. R. 2(b)). Since the Coles had not filed a responsive brief to the County\u2019s motions within the ten days prescribed by Rule 2(b), the district court deemed this an admission that the motions were well taken and, accordingly, granted the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b661 On appeal, we observed that by relying on Rule 2(b), the district court had decided the County\u2019s motions \u201con a technical point,\u201d which was contrary to the purpose of a motion under Rule 56-namely, \u201cto dispose promptly of actions in which there is no genuine issue of fact.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 415, 416, 771 P.2d at 99, 100. Thus, because \u201cthe essential question for the District Court in deciding a motion for summary judgment either for the plaintiff or for the defendant is whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact,\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 416, 771 P.2d at 100, we held that the portion of Rule 2 which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>deemed a party\u2019s failure to file an answer brief within ten days as \u201can admission that the motion is well taken\u201d did <em>not </em>apply to motions for summary judgment, <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 417, 771 P.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b662 The second rule we addressed in <em>Cole </em>was a local rule adopted by the district court which stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">unless I am satisfied that oral argument would be beneficial (in which case I may call for it, <em>sua sponte), </em>my practice will be to discourage this occasionally wasteful use of the Court\u2019s (and your) time, and to require full-fledged compliance with Rule 2(c) and (d), Uniform Rules. By \u201cfull-fledged,\u201d I mean your application for leave to present oral argument must be couched in specific terms, to show me that briefs alone are insufficient to advise me fully of your client\u2019s contentions and all relevant points of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\"><em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101 (some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b663 Relying on this rule, the district court had denied the Coles\u2019 post-judgment motion to set aside the order granting summary judgment and their concomitant request for oral argument. We determined that this was error, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">[UJnder Rule 56(c), a hearing is contemplated from which the district court will consider not so much legal arguments, but rather whether there exists genuine issues of material fact. Moreover, it is permissible under Rule 56 for the District Court to receive affidavits on the day of the hearing and to take oral evidence, as has been indicated above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-9\"><em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">\u00b664 Accordingly, based on the language of Rule 56(c) and the fact that the granting of a motion for summary judgment disposes of the action on the merits <em>with prejudice, </em>we held that a district court may not, by rule or otherwise, <em>\u201cpreclude </em>a party from requesting oral argument, nor <em>deny </em>such a request when made by a party opposing the motion unless the motion for summary judgment is denied.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101 (emphases added). In addition, we further held that \u201cunless the right to a hearing on a Rule 56 motion is <em>specifically waived </em>by all parties (and not waived simply by the failure to file briefs) either the movant or the adverse parties are entitled to a hearing under Rule 56 in the ordinary case.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 419, 771 P.2d at 101 (emphasis added). Finally, we made allowance for the unusual case by noting that \u201c[t]here may be an occasion when under the law and the facts adduced, the movant would be so <em>clearly entitled </em>as a matter of law to a summary judgment that a district court might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>by order dispense with the necessity of a hearing.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 419, 771 P.2d at 101 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b665 Thus, we specifically established in <em>Cole </em>that a hearing on a Rule 56 motion is a matter of right and that inaction by itself (such as failing to file a responsive brief, as was the case in <em>Cole) </em>does not constitute a waiver <em>of </em>this right. A review of our subsequent precedents reveals that we have remained faithful to these holdings in a variety of contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b666 First, <em>in Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Jordan, </em>254 Mont. 208, 210-12, 835 P.2d 770, 772-73 (1992), we confirmed the holdings of <em>Cole </em>but then determined that the district court had properly reinstated its order granting summary judgment to Aetna because the Jordans had \u201cadmitted\u201d in their brief in support of their post-judgment motions that there were \u201cno fact questions\u201d precluding summary judgment. Then, in <em>Konitz v. Claver, </em>1998 MT 27, 287 Mont. 301, 954 P.2d 1138, we agreed with Claver that, pursuant to Rule 56 and our holding in <em>Cole, </em>\u201cthe parties are entitled as a matter of right to a hearing on a motion for summary judgment,\u201d but we did not agree that the party opposing the motion is \u201centitled to testify without prior notice\u201d at that hearing. <em>Konitz, </em>\u00b6 31. Rather, we concluded that a district court\u2019s decision whether to allow the party opposing the motion to testify is \u201ca discretionary ruling.\u201d <em>Konitz, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b667 Next, in <em>Linn v. City County Health Dept., </em>1999 MT 235, 296 Mont. 145, 988 P.2d 302, we first stated that \u201c[i]n the ordinary case, the parties have a right to a summary judgment hearing unless the hearing is explicitly waived.\u201d <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 8. We then noted our allowance in <em>Cole </em>for \u201cthe unusual case\u201d-i.e., when under the law and the facts adduced, the movant is so \u201c \u2018clearly entitled\u2019 \u201d as a matter of law to a summary judgment that a district court might, by order, dispense with the necessity of a hearing. <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 8 (quoting <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 419, 771 P.2d at 101). Examining the facts before us to determine whether this exception applied, we concluded that the City County Health Department \u201cwas not so clearly entitled to judgment as a matter of law as to make this case the exception to the general rule that a party is entitled to a hearing before having her claim dismissed by summary judgment.\u201d <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 10. We therefore reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the absence of a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\u00b668 In <em>Estate of Schwabe v. Custer\u2019s Inn, </em>2000 MT 325, 303 Mont. 15, 15 P.3d 903, we were presented with the question of whether parties are entitled to a <em>second </em>summary judgment hearing. The district court had held a hearing on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>judgment and thereafter had issued an order denying both motions. <em>Schwabe, </em>\u00b6 52. However, four months later, after \u201cnew evidence or new materials\u201d had arisen, the district court revisited its ruling and entered summary judgment in favor of Custer\u2019s Inn. <em>Schwabe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b669 Reviewing the district court\u2019s actions, we reaffirmed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">[a]s a general rule, an oral argument is required for summary judgment unless it is specifically waived by all parties. <em>See Cole v. Flathead County </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 412, 418-19, 771 P.2d 97, 101; <em>Linn v. City County Health Dept., </em>1999 MT 235, \u00b6 8, 296 Mont. 145, \u00b6 8, 988 P.2d 302, \u00b6 8. This Court has stated that a district court may not, by rule or otherwise, preclude a party from requesting oral argument, nor deny such a request when made by a party opposing the motion. <em>See Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Jordan </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 208, 211, 835 P.2d 770, 772 (quoting <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\"><em>Schwabe, </em>\u00b6 55. However, a summary judgment hearing had, in fact, been held on Custer\u2019s Inn\u2019s motion. Thus, the issue was whether the district court was required to afford the Estate a <em>second </em>summary judgment hearing when the court revisited its order denying that motion. We declined to answer this question, since the Estate had neither objected to the district court\u2019s entry of judgment without a second hearing (or adequate notice thereof) nor requested such a hearing. <em>Schwabe, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56-57. We therefore concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it entered summary judgment in favor of Custer\u2019s Inn. <em>Schwabe, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b670 Lastly, in <em>Virginia City v. Olsen, </em>2002 MT 176, 310 Mont. 527, 52 P.3d 383, our most recent decision applying <em>Cole, </em>we were presented again with the \u201cclearly entitled\u201d exception previously discussed in <em>Linn. </em>After stating the general principle that \u201cin the ordinary case the parties have a right to a summary judgment hearing unless the hearing is explicitly waived,\u201d <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 8), we reiterated that \u201c \u2018[t]here may be an occasion when under the law and the facts adduced, the movant would be so clearly entitled as a matter of law to a summary judgment that a district court might by order dispense with the necessity of a hearing,\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6 16 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 419, 771 P.2d at 101).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b671 We could not, however, ascertain whether this exception applied on the facts of the case, since the district court had neither entered an order dispensing with the necessity of a hearing nor specified \u201cwith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>sufficient particularity,\u201d as required by M. R. Civ. P. 52(a), the grounds underlying its grant of summary judgment to Virginia City. <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-20. Furthermore, the only hearing afforded the parties had taken place before discovery was conducted or responsive pleadings were filed. Consequently, we saw \u201cno reason in this case to depart from the general rule that a party opposing a summary judgment motion is entitled to a hearing in order to establish genuine issues of material fact pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.,\u201d <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6 23, and we concluded, accordingly, that Olsen and his co-defendant, Mason, were \u201centitled to a further evidentiary hearing prior to entry of a determination of the merits in this case,\u201d <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b672 Thus, to summarize, our cases establish that both the movant and the adverse party are \u201centitled\u201d to a hearing on a motion for summary judgment, unless that right is \u201cspecifically waived\u201d by all parties, unless the motion is denied, or unless the movant is so \u201cclearly entitled\u201d to summary judgment under the law and the facts adduced that the court might, by order, dispense with the necessity of a hearing. In addition, the court must specify with sufficient particularity (pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 52(a)) the grounds underlying its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b673 Before applying these principles to the case at hand, it is necessary to do what the Court has not: address our slight-but nevertheless significant-misstatements of <em>Cole's </em>waiver rule in <em>Linn </em>and <em>Virginia City. </em>First, we stated in <em>Linn </em>that \u201c[i]n the ordinary case, the parties have a right to a summary judgment hearing unless <em>the hearing </em>is <em>explicitly </em>waived.\u201d <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 8 (emphases added). Similarly, in <em>Virginia City </em>we again stated that \u201cin the ordinary case the parties have a right to a summary judgment hearing unless <em>the hearing </em>is <em>explicitly </em>waived.\u201d <em>Virginia City, </em>\u00b6 15 (emphases added) (citing <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 8). Yet, our original statement of the waiver rule in <em>Cole </em>was that \u201cunless <em>the right </em>to a hearing on a Rule 56 motion is <em>specifically </em>waived by all parties (and not waived simply by the failure to file briefs) either the movant or the adverse parties are entitled to a hearing under Rule 56 in the ordinary case.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 419, 771 P.2d at 101 (emphases added). In other words, under <em>Cole, </em>it is the <em>right, </em>not the hearing, which must be waived. Furthermore, and of particular significance in the case at hand, the right must be waived <em>specifically, </em>not necessarily explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b674 The significance of this latter distinction is in the fact that an \u201cexplicit\u201d waiver rule may be interpreted as requiring a narrower or heightened standard. In point of fact, \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cexplicit,\u201d while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>close in meaning, are not identical in meaning. \u201cSpecific\u201d has been defined as \u201cclearly distinguished, stated or understood,\u201d <em>The New Lexicon Webster\u2019s Encyclopedic Dictionary of the English Language </em>954 (deluxe ed., Lexicon Publications 1992), while \u201cexplicit\u201d has been defined as \u201cclearly and openly stated or defined, not left to be understood,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Encyclopedic Dictionary </em>333; <em>see also Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>409 (10th ed., Merriam-Webster 1997) (\u201cEXPLICIT implies such verbal plainness and distinctness that there is no need for inference and no room for difficulty in understanding.\u201d). Certainly, something which is \u201cleft to be understood\u201d may nevertheless become \u201cclearly... understood.\u201d Restated, something may be \u201cclearly . . . understood,\u201d though it was not \u201copenly stated.\u201d Indeed, \u201cimplicit\u201d has been defined as \u201cunderstood though not stated.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Encyclopedic Dictionary </em>486. Thus, a specific waiver is not <em>necessarily </em>made explicitly (though explicit waivers unquestionably are the norm). Rather, there may be narrowly-defined circumstances in which the party\u2019s waiver is \u201cclearly . . . understood,\u201d though it was not \u201copenly stated\u201d (the case at hand being one example, as discussed below). Perhaps, then, the most pertinent definition of \u201cspecific\u201d in this context is \u201cfree from ambiguity.\u201d <em>Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>1128.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b675 Given both the distinction between \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cexplicit\u201d and the fact that our use of the latter term in <em>Linn </em>and <em>Virginia City </em>was in the context of reciting established law, as opposed to engaging in a reasoned narrowing of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>waiver rule, it would be inappropriate not to abide by our original \u201cspecifically waived\u201d language. The \u201cexplicitly waived\u201d rule in <em>Linn </em>and <em>Virginia City, </em>therefore, should be overruled. It should not be characterized as merely the equivalent of \u201cspecifically waived,\u201d as the Court does today <em>(see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-35). (In this regard, I note that the Court provides no reasoning or authority whatsoever for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>proposition that \u201cspecifically\u201d and \u201cexplicitly\u201d mean or \u201cestablish\u201d the same thing under our <em>Cole </em>jurisprudence.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b676 Turning now to the case at hand, it is undisputed that the District Court granted SVKVs motion for summary judgment without holding a hearing on the motion. It also is undisputed that the District Court\u2019s decision to dispense with a hearing was not based on or supported by a determination that SVKV was \u201cclearly entitled,\u201d under the law and facts adduced, to summary judgment. Rather, as explained in the court\u2019s order denying Harding\u2019s post-judgment motion to reconsider and request for hearing, the court relied on its two scheduling orders (one issued June 24, 2002, and the other September 26, 2003), both of which stated as follows: \u201cHearing on a motion for summary judgment is deemed waived unless a written request for hearing is submitted within the time period for filing the briefs on the motion\u201d (bold typeface omitted). Because \u201c[t]he Court received no request for hearing from either party\u201d during this time frame, it \u201cdeemed\u201d the hearing \u201cwaived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b677 Thus, the crux of the issue before us is whether Harding \u201cspecifically waived\u201d its right to a summary judgment hearing by failing to submit a written request for a hearing within the time period for filing the briefs on SVKVs motion, as mandated by the District Court\u2019s scheduling orders. In other words, does Harding\u2019s inaction in the face of the court\u2019s orders constitute a specific waiver?</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b678 It cannot be disputed that under the specific language of <em>Cole, </em>inaction <em>alone </em>does not constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on a Rule 56 motion. Indeed, we stated that this right must be \u201cspecifically waived\u201d by all parties, and we identified the mere \u201cfailure to file briefs\u201d as a contrasting example of what does <em>not </em>constitute a specific waiver (which was apropos, given that the grant of summary judgment in <em>Cole </em>was based on the Coles\u2019 failure to file a responsive brief within the time period provided by M. U. D. C. R. 2). <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 414, 419, 771 P.2d at 98, 101. As the Court observes at \u00b6 32, however, we did not address in <em>Cole </em>the question of whether inaction constitutes a specific waiver where a party fails to request a hearing <em>in the face of a requirement that it do so. </em>For the reasons which follow, I conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b679 The importance of hearings on motions for summary judgment cannot be overstated. Such hearings provide the parties with an opportunity to speak directly to and interact with the judge and to answer any questions which have arisen upon the judge\u2019s review of the briefs. They also enable the parties to present more nuanced versions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of their arguments whereas briefs, by contrast, provide comparatively sterile presentations of the parties\u2019 respective positions. In addition, because the granting of a motion for summary judgment \u201cdisposes of the action on the merits, <em>with prejudice,\u201d Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101 (emphasis added), a summary judgment hearing is the non-movant\u2019s last chance to speak in defense of its case. Thus, as we noted in <em>Cole, </em>it is permissible under Rule 56 for the district court to receive additional evidence, such as affidavits and oral evidence, on the day of the hearing. <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101. It is for these reasons that summary judgment hearings, as opposed to most other hearings, are a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b680 At the same time, however, our holding in <em>Cole </em>that parties have a \u201cright\u201d to a summary judgment hearing unless it is \u201cspecifically waived\u201d was not intended as a tool by which a party could preclude a court from ever rendering a decision on a motion for summary judgment or get a second bite at the apple (by forcing the court, post-judgment, to revisit an adverse summary judgment ruling). Thus, if a district court were to inquire of a party directly whether it will be requesting a summary judgment hearing, <em>Cole </em>does not sanction the party\u2019s postponing its response indefinitely under the assumption that the court will interpret such silence as a \u201cyes\u201d or in the hopes of obtaining some tactical advantage. Rather, in such circumstances, the party\u2019s failure to respond in a timely manner to the court\u2019s inquiry <em>must </em>constitute a specific waiver of its right to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b681 This principle mandates the same conclusion with respect to the District Court\u2019s scheduling orders. The court informed the parties that a hearing on a motion for summary judgment is \u201cdeemed waived\u201d unless \u201ca written request for hearing is submitted within the time period for filing the briefs on the motion.\u201d Instructing a party in this manner that it must request a hearing within a reasonable time frame is not materially distinguishable-at least not for purposes of honoring the party\u2019s entitlement to a hearing-from making a specific inquiry of the party as to whether it would like a hearing. Failure to respond in either situation constitutes a specific waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b682 Harding cites <em>Schwabe, </em>\u00b6 55, for the proposition that if a district court does not obtain \u201cexpress\u201d waivers from both parties, it must schedule a summary judgment hearing. Based on this premise, Harding informs us that it was \u201ccaught off guard\u201d by the District Court\u2019s ruling on SVKV\u2019s motion without first holding a hearing. Harding further explains that it \u201csimply expected, in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Rule 56(c) and this Court\u2019s prior rulings, that <em>as a matter of course </em>the hearing would be scheduled\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b683 But for the District Court\u2019s scheduling orders, Harding\u2019s assumption would have been reasonable. As it is, however, Harding\u2019s being \u201ccaught off guard\u201d could only be due to its failure to read those orders in their entirety. More importantly, our case law does not support Harding\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b684 To be sure, we stated in <em>Schwabe </em>that, \u201c[a]s a general rule, an oral argument is <em>required </em>for summary judgment <em>unless </em>it is specifically waived by all parties.\u201d <em>Schwabe, </em>\u00b6 55 (emphases added) (citing <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418-19, 771 P.2d at 101; <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 8). This was not to say, however, that an oral argument must be <em>scheduled </em>unless it is specifically waived. But, to the extent that the foregoing statement in <em>Schwabe </em>could be read in this manner, it does not constitute an intentional modification of our holdings in <em>Cole. </em>Rather, it is an imprecise summation of those holdings, in the same sense that our restatements of <em>Cole\u2019s </em>waiver rule in <em>Linn </em>and <em>Virginia City </em>(\u201cexplicitly waived\u201d in place of \u201cspecifically waived\u201d) were inaccurate recitations of established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b685 Again, we held in <em>Cole </em>that the parties are \u201centitled\u201d to a hearing under Rule 56 in the ordinary case and that a district court, therefore, may not preclude a party from requesting oral argument, nor deny such a request when made (except in the unusual case or if the motion is denied). Furthermore, the parties remain \u201centitled\u201d to a hearing until \u201cthe right ... is specifically waived by all parties.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418-19, 771 P.2d at 101. However, simply because a party is \u201centitled\u201d to a hearing, it does not necessarily follow that a district court must schedule one \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Nothing in <em>Cole </em>suggests such a rule, and principles of judicial efficiency and fairness counsel <em>against </em>interpreting <em>Cole </em>in this maimer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AG2\">\u00b686 Moreover, there is no requirement in our cases that the party\u2019s waiver be made \u201cexpress[ly]&gt;\u201d a term that \u201cimplies both explicitness and direct and positive utterance,\u201d <em>Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>409. As explained above, a specific waiver is one which is \u201cfree from ambiguity,\u201d <em>Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>1128, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>which can be achieved, in certain narrowly-defined circumstances, without a \u201cdirect and positive utterance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b687 Harding also asserts that the District Comb\u2019s scheduling orders come within the meaning of \u201cotherwise\u201d as that term is used in the following passage from <em>Cole: </em>\u201ca district court may not, by rule or <em>otherwise, </em>preclude a party from requesting oral argument, nor deny such a request when made by a party opposing the motion unless the motion for summary judgment is denied.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101 (emphasis added). Based on this language, Harding maintains that the court\u2019s scheduling orders \u201climited [its] right to a hearing.\u201d Yet, the court merely informed the parties that a hearing on a motion for summary judgment would be deemed waived unless a written request for hearing was submitted within the time period for filing the briefs on the motion. Certainly, this admonition neither \u201cpreclude^]\u201d a party from requesting oral argument nor constitutes a preemptive \u201cden[ial]\u201d of such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b688 In sum, therefore, I conclude that a party\u2019s failure to request a summary judgment hearing \u201cwithin the time period for filing the briefs on the motion\u201d constitutes a specific waiver of the party\u2019s right to such a hearing where the party has been clearly, unambiguously, and timely informed of this requirement. Such are the facts of the case at hand, since Harding was apprised of the District Court\u2019s waiver rule with respect to motions for summary judgment in the two scheduling orders, both of which were provided <em>prior </em>to SVEYs filing its motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, Harding specifically waived its right to a hearing by failing to request one in the allotted time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"AQY\">\u00b689 As noted at the outset, the Court reaches the same conclusion, but on an entirely different basis. Specifically, the foundation of the Court\u2019s analysis under Issue One is its manifestly incorrect statement that <em>Cole </em>\u201cexpressly approved\u201d and \u201cexpressly authorized\u201d the trial court practice of requiring parties to request a summary judgment hearing. First, the Court assumes the very conclusion it seeks to prove, asserting that \u201c[i]n <em>Cole, </em>we distinguished the <em>acceptable </em>trial court practice of requiring parties to request an oral argument or hearing from a rule deterring or precluding a party from making such a request.\u201d \u00b6 31 (emphasis added). Of course, the Court can provide no pinpoint citation to <em>Cole </em>in support of the proposition that the trial court practice of requiring parties to request an oral argument or hearing is \u201cacceptable,\u201d because we never said this in <em>Cole. </em>Indeed, had we actually done so, then Issue One could be resolved with a single citation to that holding and there would be no need for the Comb\u2019s 514 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>pages of belabored discussion <em>(see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-36). (The Court acknowledges as much with its observation in \u00b6 32 and again in \u00b6 35 that we did not address in <em>Cole </em>or its progeny the waiver issue presented in the case at hand.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b690 The Court then goes on to assert more forcefully that \u201cin <em>Cole, </em>we <em>expressly approved </em>requirements for parties to request summary judgment hearings, so long as courts do not preclude or deter such requests.\u201d \u00b6 31 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>\u00b6 33 (claiming that the requirement in the District Court\u2019s scheduling orders that a party request a hearing was \u201cexpressly authorized\u201d by <em>Cole). </em>Where in <em>Cole </em>did we \u201cexpressly approve[]\u201d or \u201cexpressly authorize^\u201d such requirements? Nowhere, because those were not the facts with which we were presented. Rather, as the lack of pinpoint citations following the Court\u2019s assertions reflects, the genesis of this holding is today\u2019s majority Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b691 The same is also true of the Court\u2019s reference in \u00b6 35 to \u201cour statement in <em>Cole </em>that a court may require parties to request hearings on summary judgment motions.\u201d <em>See also </em>\u00b6 32 (also referring to \u201cthe .. . statement [in Cole] that a trial court may require a party to apply for a summary judgment hearing and, absent such a request, deem the right to a hearing waived\u201d). We never made such a statement in <em>Cole, </em>and it would be shocking to see one there given that the district court had not imposed such a requirement and, thus, we were not presented with facts from which to synthesize such a statement. (Indeed, the district court had a rule <em>discouraging </em>requests for a summary judgment hearing.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b692 It appears that the departure point for the Court\u2019s flight of fancy is our quotation in <em>Cole </em>of a 1964 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31, 32 of the Court\u2019s Opinion. Specifically, we noted that in connection with oral argument on a Rule 56 motion under the federal counterpart, the Ninth Circuit had held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">Rule[s] 56(c), 78 and 83, read together, authorize district courts to provide by a rule that a party desiring oral argument on a motion for summary judgment must apply therefore, in the absence of which oral argument will be deemed to have been waived. Such a local rule was involved, and upheld, in <em>Bagby v. United States [(8th Cir. </em>1952), 199 <em>F.2d 238].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\"><em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101 (alterations in original, internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Dredge Corporation v. Penny, </em>338 F.2d 456, 461-62 (9th Cir. 1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u00b693 To the extent this passage from <em>Dredge Corporation </em>is actually relevant to the issue at hand, it is worth noting that Montana\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure do not include a version of Fed. R. Civ. P. 78, which the Ninth Circuit cited for the following proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">[F]or the purpose of expediting its business, a district court may make provision by rule or order for the submission and determination of motions without oral hearing upon brief written statements of reasons in support and opposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><em>Dredge Corporation, </em>338 F.2d at 461 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 78). Thus, whereas the foregoing <em>Dredge Corporation </em>holding rested on three rules, one of which authorized district courts to \u201cmake provision by rule or order for the submission and determination of motions without oral hearing,\u201d our decision in <em>Cole, </em>by contrast, rested on M. R. Civ. P. 56 <em>alone, </em>which contains no such authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b694 In any event, in a remarkable embellishment of <em>Cole, </em>the Court submits in \u00b6 31 that the foregoing quote from <em>Dredge Corporation </em>constitutes our \u201cexpress[] approv[al]\u201d of requirements for parties to request summary judgment hearings. Yet, aside from the fact, noted above, that such requirements were not even <em>implicated </em>by the facts of <em>Cole, </em>the Court\u2019s inference is entirely unfounded given the context in which we quoted <em>Dredge Corporation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b695 Immediately preceding the quotation, we stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">[U]nder Rule 56(c), a hearing is contemplated from which the district court will consider not so much legal arguments, but rather whether there exists genuine issues of material fact. Moreover, it is permissible under Rule 56 for the District Court to receive affidavits on the day of the hearing and to take oral evidence, as has been indicated above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-9\"><em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418, 771 P.2d at 101. And immediately after the <em>Dredge Corporation </em>quotation, we held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">In view of the language of Rule 56(c), and having in mind that the granting of such a motion disposes of the action on the merits, with prejudice, a district court may not, by rule or otherwise, preclude a party from requesting oral argument, nor deny such a request when made by a party opposing the motion unless the motion for summary judgment is denied. Even when a party is entitled to oral argument, as a general proposition there will be general circumstances when a court may properly terminate oral argument or even dispense with it and deem the right waived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">We hold, therefore, that unless the right to a hearing on a Rule 56 motion is specifically waived by all parties (and not waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>simply by the failure to file briefs) either the movant or the adverse parties are entitled to a hearing under Rule 56 in the ordinary case. There may be an occasion when under the law and the facts adduced, the movant would be so clearly entitled as a matter of law to a summary judgment that a district court might by order dispense with the necessity of a hearing. That, however, is not the kind of order presented to us here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 418-19, 771 P.2d at 101 (citation omitted). Thus, notwithstanding the language <em>o\u00ed Dredge Corporation, </em>we adopted the stringent requirement that the right to a hearing must be \u201cspecifically\u201d waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b696 The only other explanation offered by the Court in support of its assertion that we \u201cexpressly approved\u201d or \u201cexpressly authorized\u201d a waiver-by-inaction rule in <em>Cole </em>is the fact that we acknowledged in our discussion that either of the parties could have applied for a hearing. <em>See </em>\u00b6 31 of the Court\u2019s Opinion; <em>Cole, </em>236 Mont. at 417, 771 P.2d at 100. Yet, just because the parties \u201ccould have applied\u201d for a hearing does not establish that we approved a policy requiring them to do so or risk waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b697 Simply stated, the Court\u2019s analysis of Issue One rests on a cracked foundation. We could not possibly have held in <em>Cole </em>that a district court may require parties to request a summary judgment hearing or risk waiver, since we were not presented with such facts. Thus, <em>Cole\u2019s </em>purported \u201cexpress\u201d approval and authorization of the District Court\u2019s scheduling orders here is nothing but the imaginings of the majority in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b698 For these reasons, I dissent from the Court\u2019s flawed and incomplete analysis under Issue One. However, as explained earlier, I agree with the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Harding waived its right to a summary judgment hearing by failing to request one in the face of a clear and unambiguous requirement that it do so within the reasonable time frame provided by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-5\"> Lest the foregoing distinction between \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cexplicit\u201d be perceived as splitting hairs or a \u2018battle of the dictionaries\u201d-indeed, some dictionaries list \u201cexplicit\u201d as one definition of \u201cspecific,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1434 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 8th ed., West 2004); <em>Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary </em>1376 (Michael Agnes ed., 4th ed., Wiley Publishing 2002)-the point to be made here is this: We should not leave these two terms open to as many interpretations as there are dictionaries and district court judges in this state. Otherwise, one district court could proceed under a dictionary definition which equates \u201cspecifically\u201d with \u201cexplicitly\u201d (in which case a waiver that is not clearly and openly stated would be insufficient), while another could adopt a definition under which \u201cspecific\u201d encompasses both \u201cexplicit\u201d and \u201cimplicit\u201d (in which case a waiver that is understood though not stated would be sufficient in certain situations), thus leading to inconsistent results based on nothing more than happenstance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> Incidentally, the foregoing quotation from <em>Schwabe </em>is an incorrect restatement of the law set forth in <em>Linn, </em>where we stated that <em>the right </em>to a summary judgment hearing must be waived, <em>Linn, </em>\u00b6 8, not that <em>oral argument </em>must be waived, <em>Schwabe, \u00b655</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
