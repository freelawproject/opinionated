The children of Gardar and Sigrid Hjartarson, including Marleen Hjartarson, Marie Hjartarson, and Evelyn Hjartarson, along with Iceland Farms are the Appellants in this matter. They appeal from the Order of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Toole County, resolving the dispute between Gardar and Sigrid Hjartarson and their children over the control of the Hjartarson family farming and ranching operation. The Respondents include Jon Hjartarson, Doreen Gillespie, the G&amp;S Land and Cattle Company and Sigrid Hjartarson for herself, and as personal representative of the estate of Gardar Hjartarson. Sigrid Hjartarson also cross appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">\u00b62 We review the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court correctly applied the grantor-support theory rather than the principles of contractual rescission set forth at \u00a7 28-2-1713, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court correctly determined that the children breached the grantor-support agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">\u00b65 Whether the District Court abused its discretion in allowing Gardar and Sigrid to proceed to trial claiming breach of a grantor-support agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">\u00b66 Whether the District Court abused its discretion in finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the $35,000 check to capitalize Iceland Farms was a loan and therefore not subject to the two-year statute of limitations for injuries involving property?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b67 Whether substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Marleen possessed authority to withdraw $66,000 and $55,000 from Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s personal accounts?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b68 Whether substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that the children were not liable for the $66,000 and $55,000 withdrawals from Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s personal accounts?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b69 Whether substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Marleen lacked authority to transfer the \u201cnamed payee\u201d of a Conservation Reservation Payment from G&amp;S Land and Cattle to Iceland Farms?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b610 Whether substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Gardar had no personal interest in the farm equipment in question?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u00b611 The families of brothers Gardar and Hjortur Hjartarson formed several business organizations to hold and operate their jointly-owned family farm. In 1979 Gardar and his wife, Sigrid, formed G&amp;S Land and Cattle Company (G&amp;S), and Hjortur and his wife, Judy, formed H&amp;J Quarters, Inc. (H&amp;J). These corporations in turn formed a partnership called \u201cHjartarsons\u201d that held the real property. The couples also formed \u201cHjartarson Farms\u201d as a partnership between Gardar, Hjortur, Sigrid, and Judy that served as the entity that operated the land held by \u201cHjartarsons.\u201d We refer to each couple\u2019s respective personal, corporate, and partnership interest in the business as the G&amp;S group and H&amp;J group.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">\u00b612 Gardar and Sigrid began to transfer their G&amp;S stock in 1979 to their children Marleen Hjartarson, Evelyn Hjartarson, Marie Hjartarson, Doreen Gillespie and Jon Hjartarson. Marleen, Marie, Evelyn, and Jon formed a separate partnership called \u201cIceland Farms,\u201d that they intended to serve as the operator for the real property held by G&amp;S. Gardar and Sigrid eventually changed their mind and sought to rescind the stock transfers. Gardar and Sigrid also revised their wills to limit the beneficiaries to Doreen and Jon. Thus, as a practical matter, this case pits Respondents Gardar, Sigrid, Doreen, Jon, and G&amp;S against Appellants Marleen, Evelyn, Marie, and Iceland Farms. We address the facts and issues using the names of the actual family members involved in an effort to avoid confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"Acu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u00b613 Gardar and Sigrid maintain that in 1992 they transferred all of their remaining G&amp;S stock to their children subject to two conditions: (1) that Gardar still would continue to be involved in the management of G&amp;S, and (2) that the children would ensure that the corporation would continue to provide necessary living expenses to Gardar and Sigrid. Other witnesses testified that Gardar and Sigrid transferred their shares without conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b6 14 Following the 1992 stock transfers, Gardar remained in control as president of G&amp;S until 1996. He remained on as a director for some time thereafter, but by 1999 he had lost all decision-making power. The corporation provided funds for Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s living expenses through the G&amp;S checking account up until October 2000. At that point, Marleen, Marie, and Evelyn, acting as a majority of the G&amp;S board, voted to restrict Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s access to G&amp;S corporate funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b615 Gardar petitioned a court in 1996 to partition the real and personal property of the G&amp;S group and the H&amp;J group, thereby terminating his business relationship with his brother, Hjortun. The parties signed a settlement agreement in April of 1998. Gardar and Sigrid gave Jon and Marleen powers of attorney to act on behalf of the G&amp;S group for purposes of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b616 The partners divided all of the farming equipment subject to the settlement between the G&amp;S group and the H&amp;J group. Gardar and Sigrid maintain that Gardar reserved a personal interest in some of the equipment transferred to G&amp;S in the 1998 settlement. Based on this ownership interest, Gardar and Sigrid claim that Iceland Farms owes them $22,500 in rent and $20,000 in insurance proceeds from equipment that Iceland Farms had used and damaged in the years following the 1998 settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b617 The 1998 settlement also required that the G&amp;S group make a cash payment of approximately $120,000 to the H&amp;J group. Marleen made withdrawals of $66,000 and $55,000 from Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s personal accounts to finalize the settlement. The evidence at trial conflicted as to whether the G&amp;S group authorized these withdrawals and whether they should be characterized as loans, or gifts to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\u00b618 Around the time of the 1998 settlement, Marleen, Marie, Evelyn, and Jon formed Iceland Farms. Marleen drew a $35,000 check on Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s personal account to capitalize the partnership. Testimony at trial, again, conflicted as to whether Marleen had the authority to write the check, and whether it was intended to be a loan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>or a gift to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b619 The Farm Service Agency (FSA) office received a letter from Marleen on August 11, 1999, that instructed them to change the designated operator on a Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) contract from G&amp;S and Gardar to Iceland Farms. This change redirected a $50,000 CRP payment from G&amp;S and Gardar to Iceland Farms. Gardar earlier had executed a letter on July 5, 1999, to the FSA, however, revoking Marleen\u2019s power of attorney for FSA purposes. Upon discovering its mistake, the FSA wrote Iceland Farms a letter demanding repayment of the $50,000. Iceland Farms never repaid the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b620 Gardar and Sigrid filed a complaint against Norwest Bank and Marleen Hjartarson on April 13, 2000. They filed an amended complaint on July 28, 2000, removing Norwest Bank and adding as defendants the remaining children, G&amp;S, and Iceland Farms. Gardar died in September of2002. Sigrid continued to pursue her claims, and those of Gardar, in her capacity as the personal representative for Gardar\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b621 The District Court held a bench trial on May 24 through May 27, 2004. Gardar and Sigrid sought to rescind the gifts of G&amp;S stock that they had given to their children based on the children\u2019s breach of the alleged conditions on the stock transfer. Gardar and Sigrid also sought to recover the money that Marleen had taken from Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s personal accounts, rent and damages proceeds for the disputed equipment, and the $50,000 CRP payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b622 The District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order on January 19, 2005. The District Court rescinded the 1992 stock transfer because the children had breached an equitable grantor-support agreement when they restricted Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s access to G&amp;S corporate funds. The court found that Gardar and Sigrid had authorized Marleen\u2019s withdrawals of $66,000 and $55,000 to finalize the settlement with the H&amp;J group. The court denied Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s request that Marleen repay this money. The court concluded that Gardar and Sigrid had presented no credible evidence by which it could determine whether these withdrawals were intended to be loans, as Gardar and Sigrid maintained, rather than gifts, as asserted by Marleen. The court also found that Gardar and Sigrid had authorized Marleen to write the $35,000 check to Iceland Farms, but that the money constituted a loan and therefore Marleen had to repay the $35,000 to Gardar and Sigrid. The court rejected Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s claim to rental and insurance proceeds on the disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>equipment. The court determined that G&amp;S owned the disputed equipment at all relevant times. Finally, the court ordered the children to repay the $50,000 CRP payment because Gardar had revoked Marleen\u2019s authorization to change the named payee on the contract \u25a0with the FSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b623 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Bonnie M.

Trust, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b624 <em>Whether the District Court correctly applied the grantor-support theory rather than the principles of contractual rescission set forth at \u00a728-2-1713, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b625 Montana long has recognized that equitable principles inapplicable to ordinary conveyances govern when elderly parents transfer property to their children in consideration for support and maintenance under so called grantor-support agreements. <em>De Atley v. Streit, </em>81 Mont. 382, 389, 263 P. 967, 970 (1928). Grantor-support agreements arise from the unique fiduciary duty children assume upon such a transfer. <em>De Atley, </em>81 Mont. at 388, 263 P. at 970. As a result, this Court is disinclined to apply strict rules of law to such agreements. <em>De Atley, </em>81 Mont. at 388, 263 P. at 970. A court may rescind a grantor-support agreement on any number of grounds including, but not limited to, failure of consideration, fraud in the transaction, or breach of a condition subsequent. <em>De Atley, </em>81 Mont. at 387, 263 P. at 969-70.</p>\n<p id=\"Age\">\u00b626  The children challenge the District Court\u2019s decision to rescind the 1992 stock transfers because Gardar and Sigrid failed to comply with the statutory rules of contractual rescission set forth in \u00a7 28-2-1713, MCA. As described in <em>De Atley, </em>however, strict rules of law do not apply to a rescission governed by the equitable principles of a grantor-support agreement. <em>De Atley, </em>81 Mont. at 388, 263 P. at 970. We cannot simultaneously apply the equitable principles of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>grantor-support theory of rescission and the formalities of the contractual rescission statute. If we were to hold that \u00a7 28-2-1713, MCA, applies here, then we would have to extinguish the grantor-support theory of rescission and replace it with the formalities of the contractual rescission statute. Such an outcome would conflict with our precedent. <em>See e.g., Sands v. Nesteguard, </em>198 Mont. 421, 427, 646 P.2d 1189, 1192 (1982) (recognizing the continuing validity of the <em>De Atley </em>theory of equitable rescission). The District Court was correct in deciding that the formalities of \u00a7 28-2-1713, MCA, do not apply to the unique facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b627 We might agree with the children if they had argued that, as a matter of equity, the District Court should have required Gardar and Sigrid to restore some or all of the value that they received from the children under the grantor-support agreement. <em>De Atley, </em>81 Mont. at 387, 263 P. at 971. The children arguably raised this issue in pre-trial arguments before the court regarding whether Gardar and Sigrid could proceed to trial under the grantor-support theory; however, the children offered no evidence at trial to substantiate any claim that this rescission would inequitably deprive them of value that they had transferred to Gardar and Sigrid under the grantor-support agreement. Thus, we cannot hold that the District Court abused its equitable discretion in light of the record before us. <em>De Atley, </em>81 Mont. at 392, 263 P. at 971-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b628 The children allege next that the grantor-support theory of rescission developed in <em>De Atley </em>is inapplicable here because Sigrid and Gardar had other means of support and were not under hardship. The children\u2019s focus on the relative means and hardship of Gardar and Sigrid is misplaced. The fiduciary duty of support that children assume upon receipt of their parents\u2019 assets represents the primary principle underlying the equitable doctrine of grantor-support agreements. <em>De Atley, </em>81 Mont. at 388, 263 P. at 970. The parents\u2019 relative means or hardship represents only one of many considerations the court may choose to weigh in its discretion. <em>De Atley, </em>81 Mont. at 387, 263 P. at 969-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b629  Here the District Court found a grantor-support agreement based upon Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s decision to transfer stock to their children with the understanding that G&amp;S would continue to support them, as it always had, regardless of Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s other means. The children\u2019s breach of their duty triggered the rescission, not Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s relative means or hardship. <em>De Atley, </em>81 Mont. at 388, 263 P. at 970. The court correctly applied the grantor-support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>theory under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b630 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that the children breached the grantor-support agreement ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b631  The children also allege that the District Court erred in determining that they breached the grantor-support agreement. We disagree. The District Court found that by 1999, the children effectively had excluded Gardar from decision making at G&amp;S. The District Court also found that Marleen, Marie, and Evelyn, exercising their corporate majority, restricted Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s traditional uses of corporate funds for their living expenses. In October 2000, Marleen, Marie, and Evelyn closed the corporate checking account without notice to their parents. This closure halted the payment of Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s health insurance premiums. Sigrid and Gardar no longer could write corporate checks. Instead they had to submit receipts to the corporation for approval and reimbursement or buy items through charge accounts that were billed directly to the corporation. The corporation refused to reimburse Gardar and Sigrid for their assisted living, and cut off their long distance telephone line. In light of this evidence, the District Court correctly determined that the children materially had breached the grantor-support agreement. <em>See Bonnie M. Combs-DeMaio Liv. Trust, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b632 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in allowing Gardar and Sigrid to proceed to trial claiming breach of a grantor-support agreement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">\u00b633  A district court possesses wide discretion in deciding whether to allow a party to raise a factual issue or legal theory not explicitly raised in the pretrial order, but the court must be mindful not to prejudice the parties. <em>Nentwig v. United Industry, Inc., </em>256 Mont. 134, 139, 845 P.2d 99, 103 (1992). The pretrial order should be construed liberally, but the theory or issue must be included, at least implicitly, in the pretrial order. <em>Nentwig, </em>256 Mont. at 139, 845 P.2d at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">\u00b634 The children argue that the District Court abused its discretion by allowing Gardar and Sigrid to proceed to trial on a grantor-support theory when Gardar and Sigrid had failed to include this theory in the Pretrial Order. Gardar and Sigrid counter that, regardless of the name, the theory always had been the same: Gardar and Sigrid transferred G&amp;S stock to their children subject to two conditions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the children breached those conditions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b635  As discussed above, a grantor-support agreement is implied where parents transfer assets to their children in consideration for support. <em>DeAtley, </em>81 Mont. at 389, 263 P. at 970. Gardar and Sigrid set forth the elements of the grantor-support agreement in the Pretrial Order. The Pretrial Order states that Gardar and Sigrid transferred their shares of G&amp;S stock to their children as long as the children would (1) continue to involve Gardar in decision making at G&amp;S, and (2) continue to meet Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s physical and financial needs. Gardar and Sigrid also allege in the Pretrial Order that the children have jointly and severally breached these conditions. As a result, the grantor-support theory was at least implicit in the Pretrial Order. <em>See Nentwig, </em>256 Mont. at 139, 845 P.2d at 102. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Gardar and Sigrid to proceed to trial on the grantor-support theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b636 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in finding that the $35,000 check to capitalize Iceland Farms was a loan and therefore not subject to the two-year statute of limitations for injuries involving property?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b637 Appellant Iceland Farms (the children\u2019s operating partnership) contends that the two-year statute of limitations on injuries to property set forth in \u00a7 27-2-207, MCA, barred Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s claim for the $35,000 check that Marleen wrote to capitalize the Iceland Farms partnership. Iceland Farms points to the fact that Gardar and Sigrid alleged in their complaint that Marleen wrongfully had converted the $35,000 in June of 1998, but did not seek relief from Iceland Farms until July of 2000. Thus, they argue that the two-year statute of limitations had lapsed with respect to Iceland Farms. The District Court determined, however, that the statute of limitations did not bar the claim because the pleadings should be amended to conform to the evidence. The District Court relied upon the fact that two separate writings admitted at trial indicated that the parties intended the $35,000 check to be a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b638 Rule 15(b) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure provides that issues not raised by the pleadings may be tried by the express or implied consent of the parties. <em>Armbrust v. York, </em>2003 MT 36, \u00b6 13, 314 Mont. 260, \u00b6 13, 65 P.3d 239, \u00b6 13. A party impliedly consents to try an issue not raised in the pleadings where the party fails to object to the introduction of evidence relating to that issue. <em>Armbrust, </em>\u00b6 16. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The trial court exercises its discretion when deciding whether to allow such amendments. <em>Armbrust, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b639 Gardar and Sigrid offered substantial testimony and exhibits that tended to prove that the parties intended the $35,000 check to be a loan. The children did not object to any of this evidence on grounds that it was outside the scope of the issues to be tried. For example, the children did not object when Jon and Marleen both testified to the fact that the $35,000 check was a loan. The children also did not object when Gardar and Sigrid moved to enter a letter from Gardar that characterized the $35,000 check as an \u201coperating loan [Marleen, Marie, Evelyn, and Jon] took last June\u201d that needed to be \u201cpay[ed] back.\u201d The children did object when Gardar and Sigrid moved to enter an accounting report that characterized the $35,000 as a loan. The children only \u201crequested] foundation for that one,\u201d however, and they did not object that the accounting report fell outside the scope of the issues to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b640 The children\u2019s failure to object to evidence indicating that the $35,000 check constituted a loan implies their consent to include this issue in the matters to be resolved at trial. <em>Armbrust, </em>\u00b6 16. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding the parties implicitly agreed to try the issue of whether the $35,000 was intended to be a loan. <em>Armbrust, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b641 <em>Whether substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Marleen possessed authority to withdraw $66,000 and $55,000 from Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s personal accounts ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u00b642 Gardar and Sigrid cross appeal the District Court\u2019s finding that Marleen possessed authority to withdraw the $66,000 and $55,000 closing payments from Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s personal accounts. Gardar and Sigrid claim that Jon did not authorize the withdrawals, and that, in any event, Gardar did not give Jon authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u00b643 The children presented substantial evidence that Jon had the authority to authorize Marleen to make the withdrawals. Jon testified that he was president of G&amp;S, and that Gardar gave him the power and authority to effectuate the closing of the multimillion-dollar settlement with H&amp;J. Marleen, Marie, and Evelyn each testified that Jon, on behalf of Gardar, authorized Marleen to withdraw the funds. Marleen testified that soon after she withdrew the closing funds she disseminated time sheets to all the members of G&amp;S and Iceland Farms, including Jon, describing these withdrawals in detail. Jon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>testified that he was aware that the closing would transfer money from G&amp;S to H&amp;J, and that he had signed the papers consummating the deal. Based on this testimony, the District Court justifiably inferred that Jon must have been aware that Marleen withdrew the money, and that he authorized her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b644 Moreover, Jon helped Gardar write a letter to Iceland Farms that characterized the $35,000 check as an \u201coperating loan [Marleen, Marie, Evelyn, and Jon] took last June\u201d that needed to be \u201cpay[ed] back.\u201d Gardar and Jon wrote this letter almost one year after Jon should have been aware of Marleen\u2019s withdrawal of the $66,000 and $55,000 closing payments. Yet, nowhere in Gardar\u2019s letter to Iceland Farms does it state that Marleen did not have the authority to withdraw the $35,000, the $66,000 and $55,000, or any other money from Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s personal accounts. Substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Jon properly authorized Marleen, on behalf of Gardar, to make withdrawals from Gardar\u2019s and Sigrid\u2019s personal accounts. <em>See Bonnie M.

The District Court decided not to hold the children liable because Gardar and Sigrid failed to present credible evidence that would allow the court to determine that these withdrawals were intended to be loans rather than gifts. Gardar and Sigrid argue on appeal that the court erred because similar evidence tends to prove that the parties intended that both the $35,000 check and the $66,000 and $55,000 withdrawals to be loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">\u00b647 Gardar and Sigrid point to \u201cpage 4\u201d of the G&amp;S tax returns for years 1998 through 2002 and Marleen\u2019s testimony as evidence that the parties intended the withdrawals to be loans. Gardar and Sigrid argue that \u201c[G&amp;S\u2019s] accountant had placed the parents\u2019 loans on the tax returns for the corporation for numerous years.\u201d We see only two debts indicated on \u201cpage 4\u201d of the tax returns: a short term debt of $127,300.00 and a long term debt of $162,287.40. Neither of these figures readily correlates to the $66,000 withdrawal, the $55,000 withdrawal, or sum of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\u00b648  Gardar and Sigrid further point to what can be described as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>equivocal testimony by Marleen regarding the status of the withdrawals. Marleen does admit that her accountant told her that \u201cthese moneys\u201d were loans. It is not clear, however, that she is referring to the $66,000 and $55,000 withdrawals as opposed to the $35,000 check. On the other hand, the District Court found that an accounting report and Gardar\u2019s letter characterize the $35,000 check as a loan. <em>See supra, </em>\u00b6 38. No such evidence suitably characterizes the closing payments as loans. Substantial credible evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Gardar and Sigrid failed to present sufficient evidence by which it could determine that the $66,000 and $55,000 withdrawals were intended to be loans or gifts. <em>See Bonnie M. Combs-DeMaio Liv. Trust, </em>\u00b6 9. Absent such evidence, the District Court correctly determined that the children cannot be held liable for repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">ISSUE SEVEN</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b649 <em>Whether substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Marleen lacked authority to transfer the \u201cnamed payee\u201d of a Conservation Reservation Payment from G&amp;S Land and Cattle to Iceland Farms?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b650 Robert Hermanee, county executive director of FSA, provided undisputed testimony that Gardar revoked Marleen\u2019s power of attorney for FSA purposes. Hermanee further testified that no child, including Marleen, had the authority to change the named payee in the CRP contract. The children do not point to any evidence in the record that refutes Hermance\u2019s testimony. Substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding on this issue. <em>See Bonnie M. Combs-DeMaio Liv. Trust, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">ISSUE EIGHT</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u00b651 <em>Whether substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Gardar had no personal interest in the farm equipment in question?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u00b652 Gardar and Sigrid cross appeal the District Court\u2019s finding that Gardar had no personal interest in the disputed farm equipment. They allege that Gardar, as a partner in Hjartarson Farms, owned the disputed equipment individually and as a partner. The District Court found that G&amp;S owned the disputed equipment at all times relevant. It determined that Gardar and Sigrid were not entitled, therefore, to rental or insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u00b653 The 1998 settlement agreement states that the equipment will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>divided between the \u201cH&amp;J Group\u201d and the \u201cG&amp;S Group\u201d through mutual bills of sale. The settlement agreement does not specify how the equipment will be divided between the individuals, corporations, and partnerships that make up each group. The subsequent bills of sale, however, divided the disputed equipment solely between G&amp;S corporation and H&amp;J corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b654  Don Lee, counsel for the G&amp;S group during the partition, testified that at the time of the settlement, he had never been aware that Gardar had, or claimed to have, a personal interest in any of the disputed equipment. Moreover, G&amp;S insured and paid taxes on the disputed equipment. Substantial evidence supports the District Court\u2019s finding that Gardar retained no personal interest in the disputed equipment following the 1998 settlement. <em>See Bonnie M. CombsDeMaio Liv.
