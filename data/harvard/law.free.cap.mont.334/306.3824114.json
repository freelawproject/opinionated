We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it denied Woeppel\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b63 Woeppel was charged in the City of Billings Municipal Court of partner or family member assault, pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-206(a), MCA, for allegedly assaulting his wife. Woeppel was tried without a jury and found guilty of the assault. Woeppel\u2019s wife did not testify at trial. The guilty verdict was based primarily on testimony of the investigating police officer and some photographs of the victim\u2019s neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b64 The day after his conviction, Woeppel\u2019s trial attorney filed a notice of appeal in the Montana Thirteenth Judicial District Court. After the notice of appeal was filed, Woeppel obtained new counsel, Jeffrey Michael, to handle his appeal. When Michael did not file a brief in support of Woeppel\u2019s appeal by December 11,2003, the City of Billings (City) filed a motion to dismiss. The District Court did not dismiss the appeal and instead set forth a briefing schedule. Woeppel was given until December 26, 2003, to file his initial brief. When this deadline came and went and Michael still did not file a brief, the City filed another motion to dismiss, which the court granted. The case was remanded to Municipal Court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\u00b65 When the Municipal Court ordered Woeppel to appear for re-sentencing, Michael filed a motion to continue because he was going to be out of town. The court granted the motion and rescheduled the hearing. On the date of the rescheduled hearing, Michael filed another motion to continue on the grounds he intended to file a writ of mandamus or petition for postconviction relief. The court granted this motion and again rescheduled the hearing. A few days before the rescheduled hearing, Michael filed another motion to continue, again stating his intent to file a writ of mandamus or petition for postconviction relief, as well as stating he would be unavailable. On the date of the rescheduled hearing, Michael filed a motion to withdraw on the grounds that new charges were pending against Woeppel and he believed he had a conflict of interest. Woeppel appeared in court by himself and the court re-imposed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"An1\">\u00b66 Woeppel hired another attorney who filed a petition for postconviction relief in the Montana Thirteenth Judicial District Court on the basis that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to file a brief or pursue his appeal, and that he was denied his right to confront witnesses in the underlying case when his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>conviction was primarily based on hearsay testimony from the police officer. The City argued the petition should be denied because even if Michael had filed the appellate brief, there was no merit to Woeppel\u2019s confrontation clause argument, thus the error was not prejudicial. In arguing the confrontation clause issue, the City relied on the recent decisions of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S. Ct. 1354 (2004), and <em>State v. Cameron, </em>2005 MT 32, 326 Mont. 51, 106 P.3d 1189. Before Woeppel had a chance to reply, the District Court, relying on the City\u2019s legal analysis, summarily denied Woeppel\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. We note that the postconviction petition was handled by Honorable Ingrid Gustafson, a different judge than handled the appeal from Municipal Court (Honorable Russell C. Fagg). Further, Judge Gustafson denied the petition for postconviction relief prior to our decision in <em>State v. Mizenko, </em>2006 MT 11, 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458, and the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>126 S. Ct. 2266 (2006). Woeppel appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b67 The standard of review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief is whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Hope v. State, </em>2003 MT 191, \u00b6 13, 316 Mont. 497, \u00b6 13, 74 P.3d 1039, \u00b6 13. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact and are therefore reviewed <em>de novo. Garrett v. State, </em>2005 MT 197, \u00b6 9, 328 Mont. 165, \u00b6 9, 119 P.3d 55, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it denied Woeppel\u2019s petition for postconviction relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b69 Woeppel argues that he should be granted postconviction relief in the form of a new trial or reinstatement of his initial appeal on the basis that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to file an initial appeal brief causing his appeal to be dismissed. Criminal defendants have a constitutionally protected right to reasonably effective legal assistance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984); U.S. Const. Amend. 6; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24. Pursuant to <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must show (1) that counsel\u2019s representation is deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u00b610 The United States Supreme Court has applied this test to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>defendants claiming ineffective assistance of counsel for their attorney\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal. <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 476-77, 120 S. Ct. 1029, 1034 (2000). In <em>Roe, </em>the Supreme Court stated that a lawyer who fails to file a notice of appeal contrary to the defendant\u2019s request acts in a professionally unreasonable manner, thus meeting the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 477, 120 S. Ct. at 1035 (citing <em>Rodriquez v. United States, </em>395 U.S. 327, 89 S. Ct. 1715 (1969)). In these circumstances, to show prejudice under the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, a defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant would have appealed. A defendant can demonstrate that he or she would have appealed by presenting evidence that the defendant expressed a desire to appeal, or that there were nonfrivolous grounds for appeal. If a defendant objectively indicated intent to appeal, he or she is not required to demonstrate the merits of the underlying claim and is entitled to a new appeal. <em>Roe, </em>528 U.S. at 484-86, 120 S. Ct. at 1038-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b611 This Court has adopted the <em>Roe </em>standards, which provide that (1) failure to preserve a defendant\u2019s right to appeal when he has requested notice be filed is error; and (2) when, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, defendant would have appealed, such error is prejudicial. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>2001 MT 165, \u00b6 24, 306 Mont. 130, \u00b6 24, 32 P.3d 724, \u00b6 24. In <em>Rogers, </em>the Court noted that the defendant requested his attorney to file a notice of appeal, which the attorney repeatedly refused. Further, at least one of the appeal issues had merit. <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b612 This Court followed <em>Roe </em>and <em>Rogers </em>in <em>State v. Adams, </em>2002 MT 202, \u00b6 17, 311 Mont. 202, \u00b6 17, 54 P.3d 50, \u00b6 17. In <em>Adams, </em>the defendant filed an affidavit stating he asked his attorney to appeal his conviction, which his attorney failed to do. Adams also contended that a letter from his attorney and a court order contained conflicting information that led him to believe that his opportunity to file a notice of appeal had passed. The Court concluded there was sufficient evidence that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, Adams would have filed an appeal. <em>Adams, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b613 Similarly, in State <em>v. Tweed, </em>2002 MT 286, 312 Mont. 482, 59 P.3d 1105, the defendant\u2019s assertion that he requested his attorney to file an appeal was not disputed. <em>Tweed, </em>\u00b6 16. This Court concluded that his counsel\u2019s error in failing to preserve Tweed\u2019s right to appeal was prejudicial <em>per se. Tweed, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b614 In this case, a notice of appeal was filed, but the appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>dismissed when Woeppel\u2019s attorney failed to perfect the appeal by filing a brief. The City concedes that this was error on Michael\u2019s part. Therefore, Woeppel meets the first requirement that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. However, the City argues that Woeppel was not prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s error because he had no grounds for appeal. As noted above, demonstrating that nonfrivolous grounds for appeal exist is one way to show that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant would have appealed. Another way to show the defendant would have appealed is to demonstrate that the defendant objectively indicated his intent to appeal. Woeppel objectively indicated his intent to appeal in this case as is evidenced by the fact that his trial attorney filed a notice of appeal. It was only because of his appellate attorney\u2019s failure to file the brief that the appeal was dismissed. Because Michael\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced Woeppel, we do not need to discuss the merits of the underlying appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b615  Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief and remand this case to the District Court for appellate review of any claims that Woeppel could have made on direct appeal had his counsel filed an appeal brief-including, but not limited to, his claim that, since his conviction was based primarily on hearsay testimony, he was denied his right to confront witnesses.</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
