The Auditor, based on information provided by the State Department of Revenue (DOR), compiled the requested information for tax year 2002 and provided it to Elliott. Later, DOR denied the Auditor and Elliot access to similar tax information for other tax years. Elliott filed a Petition to Obtain Public Documents (Petition), which the District Court denied. Elliott appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">\u00b62 The restated issue on appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">Did the District Court err when it denied public disclosure of Montana \u201cC\u201d corporations\u2019 state tax records?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">\u00b63 In January 2004, Elliott, in his capacity as Chairman of the Senate Taxation Committee and Vice-chairman of the Legislative Audit Committee, requested tax information for \u201cC\u201d corporations with $1,000,000.00 or more in Montana sales for all tax years for which DOR had the information. Elliott sought the information because he believed a \u201cresponsible legislator needs to be informed so as to make responsible and accurate decisions on the part of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">\u00b64 Initially, Elliott asked the Auditor to provide him with tax information about all corporations that paid less than $150.00 in Montana taxes in 2002. After inspecting the information, Elliott requested tax information for the top 500 \u201cC\u201d corporations in terms of Montana sales. <em>(See </em>\u201cC\u201d corporation definition at \u00a7 15-30-101(3), MCA.) DOR provided the information to the Auditor on Elliott\u2019s behalf. The Auditor compiled for Elliott spreadsheets containing information for tax year 2002. Corporate taxpayers, however, were not identified by name on the spreadsheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">\u00b65 Elliott then researched the identities of some of the corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>by matching up the tax information he received for 2002 with financial information he located on the internet from such sources as the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission\u2019s published filings and corporate financial reports. Elliott disclosed the results of his research to his constituents and other Montana citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b66 Elliott testified that \u201cthe compelling reason for the people of the state of Montana [to have access to state corporate tax records] is that a just, equitable taxation policy is important. For every dollar that one person avoids illegally ... in paying taxes, the citizens of the state of Montana make up for that in increased taxes or in decreased services.\u201d Subsequently, Elliott reiterated his request for tax records from all available tax years. DOR refused Elliott\u2019s request because he had disclosed to the public corporate tax information previously provided.</p>\n<p id=\"A24\">\u00b67 Elliott petitioned the District Court to order disclosure of the state corporate tax records. On April 6, 2005, the District Court denied Elliott\u2019s Petition after holding an evidentiary hearing on November 23, 2004, and oral arguments on February 11, 2005. Elliott appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law regarding a constitutional question to determine whether it is correct. <em>Bryan v. District, </em>2002 MT 264, \u00b6 16, 312 Mont. 257, \u00b6 16, 60 P.3d 381, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err when it denied public disclosure of Montana \u201cC\u201d corporations\u2019 state tax records?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">\u00b610 Elliott invokes the right to know provisions of Article II, Section 9, of the Montana Constitution in support of his contention that state corporate tax records are subject to public disclosure. Article II, Section 9 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-10\">Right to know. No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">However, state law prohibits the disclosure of tax records provided to DOR by Montana corporate taxpayers. Section 15-31-511, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">Confidentiality of tax records. (1) Except as provided in this section in accordance with a properjudicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it is unlawful to divulge or make known in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">(a) the amount of income or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any return or report required under this chapter or any other information relating to taxation secured in the administration of this chapter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">(b) any federal return or information in or disclosed on a federal return or report required by law or rule of the department of revenue under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b611 In briefs to this Court, Elliott highlights the conflict between the provisions of Article II, Section 9, and \u00a7 15-31-511, MCA, but dismisses the statute by arguing that, \u201cObviously, state statutory law must yield to constitutional law.\u201d We agree with this cardinal premise. However, statutes are presumed constitutional absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the contrary. <em>Ravalli County v. Erickson, </em>2004 MT 35, \u00b6 17, 320 Mont. 31, \u00b6 17, 85 P.3d 772, \u00b6 17 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b612 Notably, Elliott has mounted no constitutional challenge-either facial or as applied-to invalidate \u00a7 15-31-511, MCA. Indeed, Elliott\u2019s counsel stated unequivocally, both in briefs to this Court and during oral argument, that Elliott does <em>not </em>challenge the constitutionality of the statutory prohibition on disclosure of corporate tax information. Rather, he views the statute as \u201ca nullity\u201d in light of case law interpreting Article II, Section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">\u00b613 Elliott seeks precisely the information the disclosure of which is directly prohibited by \u00a7 15-31-511(1), MCA. Elliott asked the District Court to order disclosure of information for \u201cC\u201d corporations with $1,000,000.00 or more in Montana sales, including: the name of the corporation; Montana sales; total sales; Montana property; total property; Montana payroll; total payroll; apportionment factor; adjusted taxable income; Montana taxable income before net operating loss; Montana taxable income; Montana corporate tax liability; and the date the tax return was received. While Elliott concedes the statute prohibits such disclosure, he maintains that the constitutional right to know in essence \u201ctrumps\u201d these statutory restrictions, and that we may so rule without <em>per se </em>declaring the statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u00b614 The Legislature has exercised its constitutional power to enact a statute. Article V, Section 1, Montana Constitution. The role of the courts in construing a statute is well established. We are to ascertain a statute\u2019s terms and substance, but we are not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-2-101, MCA. Thus, we may not simply disregard the provisions of a duly enacted statute unless we first conclude that it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u00b615 As already stated, the unconstitutionality of a statute must be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Ravalli County, </em>\u00b6 17. In that no demonstration of unconstitutionality has been offered-much less proven-here, we may not declare this statute unconstitutional, nor will we undertake to do so <em>sua sponte. </em>Absent a successful constitutional challenge to the propriety of a statute, we are obligated to apply it. <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 149, 915 P.2d 208, 223 (1996) <em>(Gray, J., specially concurring).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b616  Without a direct constitutional challenge to \u00a7 15-31-511, MCA, we have no basis for confronting, much less disturbing, its prohibition on disclosure of state corporate tax records. Therefore we conclude we cannot grant the relief Elliott seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u00b617 For the foregoing reason, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, RICE and NELSON and DISTRICT JUDGE BUYSKE, sitting for JUSTICE MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b221-8\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AfZ\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\u00b618 I concur with the result of the Court\u2019s opinion. I write to address the reason Elliott claims it is not necessary to find \u00a7 15-31-511, MCA, unconstitutional in order to secure the tax information he prays for. \u00b619 Senator Elliott argues the \u201cor as otherwise provided by law\u201d exception in \u00a7 15-31-511(1), MCA, renders the statute ineffective because \u201claw\u201d includes Article II, Section 9 of the Montana Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">\u00b620 Section 15-31-511(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">Except as provided in this section in accordance with a proper judicial order <em>or as otherwise provided by law, </em>it is unlawful to divulge or make known in any manner[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">(Emphasis added.) Elliott points out that the \u201cor as otherwise provided by law\u201d exception in \u00a7 15-31-511, MCA, encompasses the Montana Constitution\u2019s Right to Know provision, Article II, Section 9, which is set forth at \u00b6 10 of the Court\u2019s Opinion. Although what constitute \u201cdocuments ... of all public bodies\u201d is not defined in Article II, Section 9, this Court has interpreted the phrase to encompass \u201cdocuments generated or maintained by a public body which are somehow related to the function and duties of that body.\u201d <em>Becky v. Butte-Silver Bow Sch. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>Dist. No. </em>1, 274 Mont. 131, 138, 906 P.2d 193, 197 (1995). Thus, Article II, Section 9, is applicable to \u201cpublic documents.\u201d <em>Becky, </em>274 Mont. at 138, 906 P.2d at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b621 The only limitation on the constitutional right to view public documents, according to Elliott, is an individual\u2019s constitutional right to privacy. Elliott goes on to point out that this Court has held that a for-profit corporation has no individual right to privacy under the Montana Constitution. <em>Great Falls Tribune v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Commn., </em>2003 MT 359, \u00b6 39, 319 Mont. 38, \u00b6 39, 82 P.3d 876, \u00b6 39. Thus, Elliott adroitly argues that there is a loop-hole in the law which requires that the public be able to examine a for-profit corporation\u2019s tax records. This is because Article II, Section 9, is a law which provides that the tax records of for-profit corporations are available to the public, and thus the exception in \u00a7 15-31-511(1), MCA, applies to abrogate the statute\u2019s requirement of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b622 Under this interpretation, the exception in \u00a7 15-31-511(1), MCA, would render the statute ineffective. Elliott\u2019s counsel did not dispute this conclusion at oral argument, and acknowledged that the exception essentially swallows the statute. He pointed out, however, that the statute was effective until this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJd\">\u00b623 I do not conclude that the exception to \u00a7 15-31-511(1), MCA, renders the statute without effect. An interpretation that gives effect to a statute is always preferred to one that makes a statute void or treats a statute as mere surplusage. <em>Missoula Rural Fire Dist. v. Missoula Co., </em>222 Mont. 178, 182, 720 P.2d 1170, 1173 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b624 Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that under <em>Great Falls Tribune </em>a for-profit corporation has no privacy interest to be weighed against the public\u2019s right to know, the analysis does not end there. The right to privacy is not the only constitutional provision that may circumscribe the right to know provided by Article II, Section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b625 In <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Dist. Ct. </em>201 Mont. 376, 654 P.2d 982 (1982), this Court considered whether the right to know could be circumscribed by the right to a trial by an impartial jury. We explained in <em>Smith:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">the \u201cRight to Know\u201d provision of the Montana Constitution ... is not absolute. It can be properly circumscribed when the right or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>interest against which it competes is <em>weighty or compelling.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al\"><em>Smith, </em>201 Mont. at 383, 654 P.2d at 986 (emphasis added). In <em>Smith, </em>this Court held that a pretrial suppression hearing could be excluded from the public eye \u201conly if dissemination of information acquired at the hearing would create a clear and present danger to the fairness of defendant\u2019s trial and no reasonable alternative means can be utilized to avoid the prejudicial effect of such information.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>201 Mont. at 385, 654 P.2d at 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b626 I acknowledge that in <em>Great Falls Tribune Co., Inc. v. Great Falls Pub. Schools, </em>255 Mont. 125, 841 P.2d 502 (1992), this Court concluded that \u201cpursuant to the clear language of Article II, Section 9, meetings may be closed <em>only </em>when the need for individual privacy exceeds the merits of public disclosure.\u201d <em>Great Falls Pub. Schools, </em>255 Mont. at 131, 841 P.2d at 505 (emphasis added); <em>Cf., In re Lacy, </em>239 Mont. 321, 325, 780 P.2d 186, 188 (1989) (\u201cThe <em>only </em>limitation on the right to receive this information is the constitutional right to privacy.\u201d) (emphasis added). In my view, these statements, that it is only the right to individual privacy that can circumscribe the public\u2019s right to know, are both overbroad and unnecessary. Neither <em>Great Falls Pub. Schools </em>nor <em>Lacy </em>involved matters other than whether an individual\u2019s right to privacy outweighed the public\u2019s right to know. In <em>Great Falls Pub. Schools </em>the Court did not overrule, nor did it discuss, <em>Smith. </em>The Court has continued to cite to the language in <em>Smith </em>that the right to know \u201ccan be properly circumscribed when the right or interest against which it competes is weighty or compelling.\u201d <em>E.g., Great Falls Tribune, </em>\u00b6 30 (quoting <em>Smith, </em>201 Mont. at 383, 654 P.2d at 986). The rule in <em>Smith </em>should control in this case and I would overrule <em>Great Falls Pub. Schools </em>to the extent it suggests that it is only the right to privacy that may circumscribe the right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b627 In the present case, Elliott\u2019s argument necessarily raises the issue of whether the State\u2019s authority to tax, and its ability to enforce this authority, which is provided for by Article VIII of the Montana Constitution, is so sufficiently \u201cweighty or compelling\u201d that it may in appropriate circumstances circumscribe the right to know. <em>See Lacy, </em>239 Mont. at 326, 780 P.2d at 189 (because the judiciary has authority over the interpretation of the Constitution, it is the courts\u2019 duty to balance the competing interests at issue in order to determine what, if any, information should be given to a party requesting information from the government under Article II, Section 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b628 The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized the importance of the power to tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>It is admitted that the power of taxing the people and their property, is essential to the very existence of government, and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable, to the utmost extent to which the government may choose to carry it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><em>McCulloch v. Maryland, </em>17 U.S. 316, 428 (1819). Article VIII of the Montana Constitution gives the Legislature the power to tax. At the 1972 Montana Constitutional Convention, the Revenue and Finance Committee went so far as to suggest that putting such a power in the Constitution was unnecessary, because \u201cthe power to tax is an inherent power of the state, a power already possessed by the state without any grant of authority.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Revenue and Finance Committee Proposal, February 18,1972, p. 579. In discussing Article VIII, Section 2, Delegate Rygg stated: \u201cOf course, the power of taxation is the most important power a governmental body possesses, and it is equally important that this power never be treated lightly or bargained away.\u201d Montana Constitutional Convention, Verbatim Transcript, March 3,1972, p. 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b629 The State requires revenue to provide for the common good, and taxation is of course necessary to raise this revenue. Without the power to tax, the government could not protect the right to know, the right of individual privacy, or any of the fundamental rights of the people. Therefore, I conclude that the State\u2019s interest in enforcing its authority to tax is sufficiently \u201cweighty or compelling\u201d that it may, in limited and appropriate circumstances, circumscribe the right to know.</p>\n<p id=\"AOj\">\u00b630 The record establishes that it is a critical component of the current corporate tax structure of Montana that the United States Internal Revenue Service (I.R.S.) provide information contained in United States corporate tax returns to the Montana Department of Revenue. The system would simply not work without such information. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(p)(8) prohibits the I.R.S. from disclosing information about a federal tax return to any State unless that State adopts a confidentiality provision such as \u00a7 15-31-511, MCA. Thus, if this Court were to conclude that \u00a7 15-31-511 is of no effect, it follows that the I.R.S. would stop providing information to DOR, and the current Montana system for levying taxes on for-profit corporations would fail.</p>\n<p id=\"A4h\">\u00b631 The record also establishes that Montana does not have the resources to establish a tax system which could effectively compile and process the necessary information to levy and collect taxes from the many for-profit corporations that do business in this State, without tax information gathered and provided by the I.R.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u00b632 I conclude that in this limited circumstance, the confidentiality provisions of \u00a7 15-31-511, MCA, which flow from Article VIII of the Montana Constitution, are sufficiently weighty and compelling to circumscribe the public\u2019s right to know provided in Article II, Section 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b633 It is for this reason that I vote to affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-13\"> This argument is clearly articulated in Elliot\u2019s opening brief to the District Court, as well as his appellate briefs and oral argument before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\"> <em>Mt.
