Proponents had to comply with the procedural requirements for qualifying their initiative as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 13-27-101 through 504, MCA. We mention only those requirements that are relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\u00b63 Proponents submitted CI-97 to the Secretary of State who in turn forwarded it to the Attorney General for a determination of \u201clegal sufficiency\u201d as required by \u00a7 13-27-202(3), MCA. The Attorney General determined that CI-97 was \u201clegally sufficient\u201d to qualify for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>November 2006 ballot. Proponents gathered the requisite number of signatures in support of CI-97 and submitted them to county election administrators pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-301, MCA. The county officials forwarded the signatures to the Secretary of State pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-304, MCA. The Secretary of State then certified to the Governor that Proponents had filed a completed petition, as required by \u00a7 13-27-308, MCA, on the statutory deadline of July 21, 2006, as determined by \u00a7 13-27-104, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b64 \u201cNot In Montana: Citizens Against CI-97\u201d (Opponents) timely filed this action on July 27,2006, in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis &amp; Clark County, asking the court to overrule the Attorney General\u2019s determination concerning the \u201clegal sufficiency\u201d of CI-97. Opponents alleged that CI-97 violated the single amendment provision found in Article XTV, Section 11, of the Montana Constitution. The District Court issued its Memorandum and Order on September 19,2006. The court agreed that CI-97 violated the single amendment provision, overruled the Attorney General\u2019s determination, and enjoined the Secretary of State from counting any votes on CI-97. Proponents and the State appealed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b65 Opponents and two other ballot committees filed a separate challenge to CI-97, as well as Constitutional Initiative 98 (CI-98) and Initiative 154 (1-154), on August 16, 2006, in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County. They challenged these initiatives on the basis that Proponents and two other ballot committees had gathered illegally the signatures necessary to qualify these initiatives for the ballot. The district court agreed and invalidated the Secretary of State\u2019s certification of CI-97, CI-98, and 1-154 on September 13, 2006. We affirmed on appeal, holding that any votes for CI-97 would have \u201cno force or effect.\u201d <em>Montanans for Justice v. State of Montana, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 87, 334 Mont. 237, \u00b6 87, 146 P.3d 759, \u00b6 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b66 Proponents now ask this Court to reverse the District Court\u2019s invalidation of the \u201clegal sufficiency\u201d of CI-97 to allow it to be \u201csubmitted to the voters at the November 7, 2006 election.\u201d The State requests that we reverse the District Court and \u201cadopt a clear separate amendment rule.\u201d We first must address the issue of whether we have jurisdiction to hear these appeals as they appear to be non-justiciable in light of our decision in <em>Montanans for Justice. Dennis v. Brown, </em>2005 MT 85, \u00b6 8, 326 Mont. 422, \u00b6 8, 110 P.3d 17, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b67  This Court may raise questions of justiciability <em>sua sponte </em>because we lack jurisdiction over non-justiciable matters. <em>Dennis, </em>\u00b6 8. We include moot questions and advisory opinions among the matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>that exceed our jurisdiction. <em>Dennis, </em>\u00b6 8. We previously have described a question as moot when we no longer can grant effective relief. <em>Turner v. Mountain Engineering and Const., Inc., </em>276 Mont. 55, 61, 915 P.2d 799, 803 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b68 In <em>Turner, </em>a district court granted summary judgment to a mortgagee, finding that his mortgage interest was superior to that of several construction hen creditors. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 58, 915 P.2d at 801. The construction lien creditors appealed the ruling, but failed to stay the mortgagee\u2019s foreclosure proceedings. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont, at 58, 915 P.2d at 801. The mortgagee proceeded pursuant to a court order to foreclose on the property and sell it at a sheriffs sale before this Court could address the merits of the construction lien creditors\u2019 appeal. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 58, 915 P.2d at 801. We dismissed the appeal as moot because we had no power to reverse the sheriffs sale, thereby making it impossible for this Court to grant effective relief. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont. at 64, 915 P.2d at 805; <em>see also Graveyard Creek Ranch, Inc. v. Bell, </em>2005 MT 172, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, 327 Mont. 491, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, 116 P.3d 779, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b69  Here, too, we are unable to grant effective relief to Proponents or the State. Our decision in <em>Montanans for Justice </em>conclusively has invalidated the Secretary of State\u2019s certification of CI-97 for the November 2006 ballot. <em>Montanans for Justice, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 83-88. The Secretary of State\u2019s certification represents a condition precedent to qualifying CI-97 for the November 2006 ballot. Sections 13-27-101,308, MCA; <em>see also Montanans for Justice, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 85-88 (affirming the district court\u2019s invalidation of the Secretary of State\u2019s certification and instructing county administrators not to count the votes for CI-97). We could not force the county administrators to count the votes cast for CI-97 during the November 2006 election even if we determined that the District Court had erred when it overruled the Attorney General\u2019s determination of \u201clegal sufficiency.\u201d <em>Montanans for Justice, </em>\u00b6 87. Proponents\u2019 appeal, therefore, presents a moot question for which we can provide no effective relief. <em>Turner, </em>276 Mont, at 64, 915 P.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b610  A justiciable controversy is limited also to \u201cone upon which the judgment of the court may effectively operate,\u201d as distinguished from a debate or argument that proposes a purely academic conclusion, or advisory opinion. <em>Montana-Dak. Util. Co. v. City of Billings, </em>2003 MT 332, \u00b6 9, 318 Mont. 407, \u00b6 9, 80 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 9, <em>modified, Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6 36, 333 Mont. 331, \u00b6 36, 142 P.3d 864, \u00b6 36. Our decision in <em>Montanans for Justice </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ensures that any judgment here would have no effect on the rights of the parties and, thus, reduces the State\u2019s appeal to a request for an impermissible advisory opinion. <em>See Montana-Dak.
