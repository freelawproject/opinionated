Prior to sentencing, Moody filed objections to several probation conditions recommended in the pre-sentence investigation (PSI) report. The District Court nonetheless imposed most of the proposed conditions. Moody now appeals. We affirm on the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">\u00b62 1. Does requiring a probationer to keep her home open and available for the probation officer to visit at all times violate the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">\u00b63 2. Did the District Court properly impose a travel restriction as a condition of Moody\u2019s probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">\u00b64 In responding to a report on May 7, 2004, Officers Wells and Ostermiller of the Laurel Police Department came across a gray van that had reached a complete stop in the middle of an intersection. Officers Wells and Ostermiller approached the van and found Moody, who appeared to be asleep at the wheel. The officers removed Moody from the van and verified that she did not need medical attention. Smelling of alcohol and unsteady on her feet, Moody swore at the officers and refused to perform any field sobriety tests or provide a breath alcohol sample. Moody could not find the registration for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>vehicle and stated that she did not have any car insurance. The officers arrested Moody, placing her in handcuffs. When they tried to get Moody into the backseat of the patrol vehicle, Moody kicked at Officer Wells, striking him in the face with such force that she left a visible boot imprint. Eventually the officers restrained Moody and transported her to the Yellowstone County Detention Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b65 The State charged Moody by information with Count I, assault on a police officer, a felony in violation of \u00a7 45-5-210(l)(a), MCA; Count II, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA; and Count III, driving without required motor vehicle insurance, a misdemeanor in violation of \u00a7 61-6-302, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b66 Moody pled guilty to all three counts pursuant to a plea agreement. Prior to sentencing, Probation Officer Barry Ivanoff prepared the PSI with recommendations for the conditions of Moody\u2019s probation. Moody filed an objection to several of the proposed conditions, including 2 and 3, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">2. The Defendant will not change [her] place of residence without first obtaining permission from [her] Probation/Parole Officer. The residence must be approved by [her] Probation &amp; Parole Officer. <em>The Defendant will make the home open and available for the Probation &amp; Parole Officer to visit as required per policy. </em>The Defendant will not own dangerous/vicious animals such as guard dogs, use perimeter security doors, or refuse to open the door of the residence when requested. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">3. The Defendant shall not leave [her] assigned district without first obtaining written permission from [her] Probation &amp; Parole Officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u00b67 Moody objected to the requirement that she make her home \u201copen and available\u201d to her probation officer on the grounds that this condition obviated the reasonable cause requirement for searches of probationers\u2019 homes, and thus violated her constitutional rights of privacy and protection from unreasonable search and seizure. Moody also objected to the travel restriction, arguing that it inhibited her constitutional rights to travel and work and her freedom of association; she also argued that the restriction was not sufficiently related to her rehabilitative needs and did not protect society.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u00b68 At the sentencing hearing, Moody called Officer Ivanoff to testify regarding the probation conditions he recommended. After Moody and the State argued their respective positions, the District Court issued the sentence, imposing both the second and third probation conditions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Moody appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b69 We review a District Court\u2019s criminal sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 287, \u00b6 11, 99 P.3d 661, \u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b610 1. Does requiring a probationer to keep her home open and available for the probation officer to visit at all times violate the Montana Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b611 Moody argues that Condition 2 of her probation, which requires that she keep her \u201chome open and available for the Probation &amp; Parole Officer to visit,\u201d violates the <em>reasonable cause </em>standard applied by this Court to searches of probationers\u2019 residences, as well as Admin. R. M. 20.7.1101(7), governing conditions on probation. Because we conclude that a \u201chome visit\u201d to a probationer\u2019s residence does not qualify as a \u201csearch,\u201d we affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\u00b612  The search of a person may be conducted pursuant to a valid search warrant or in accordance with a judicially recognized exception. Section 46-5-101, MCA. In Montana, a probation officer may search a probationer\u2019s residence without a warrant so long as the officer has reasonable cause for the search. <em>See State v. Roper, </em>2001 MT 96, \u00b6 12, 305 Mont. 212, \u00b6 12, 26 P.3d 741, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Beaudry, </em>282 Mont. 225, 228, 937 P.2d 459, 460-61 (1997); <em>State v. Burchett, </em>277 Mont. 192, 195, 921 P.2d 854, 856 (1996); <em>State v. Boston, </em>269 Mont. 300, 305, 889 P.2d 814, 817 (1995); and <em>State v. Burke, </em>235 Mont. 165, 169, 766 P.2d 254, 256-57 (1988). \u201cThe \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 standard is substantially less than the probable cause standard required by the Fourth Amendment because of the probationer\u2019s diminished expectation of privacy ....\u201d <em>Burchett, </em>277 Mont. at 195-96, 921 P.2d at 856 (citing <em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 169, 766 P.2d at 256-57, and <em>Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 U.S. 868, 107 S. Ct. 3164 (1987)). Admin. R. M. 20.7.1101(7) further underscores our precedent by permitting a warrantless search of a probationer\u2019s or parolee\u2019s person, vehicle or residence only \u201cupon reasonable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">\u00b613 The State points out that the United States Supreme Court has recently held that a suspicionless search, conducted pursuant to a California statute requiring parolees to agree in writing to be subject to searches with or without cause was constitutional. <em>Samson v. </em>California,_U.S._, 126 S. Ct. 2193 (2006). The search in <em>Samson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>was conducted by a police officer rather than a probation officer so the court applied an ordinary Fourth Amendment analysis, rather than engaging in a <em>Griffin </em>\u201cspecial needs\u201d analysis applicable to probationers. <em>Griffin, 483 U.S. </em>at 873, 107 S. Ct. at 3168. The State, relying on <em>Samson, </em>contends that if there is no \u201creasonable cause\u201d requirement for a search of a parolee, there should be no such requirement for a less intrusive \u201chome visit,\u201d which is not a search.</p>\n<p id=\"ANr\">\u00b614 Moody contends that <em>Samson </em>is distinguishable since it involved search of a parolee on the street as opposed to a probationer in her home; further, since probationers such as Moody are much less of a threat than parolees, they have a higher expectation of privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches under the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"Aio\">\u00b615 The initial inquiry then is whether a \u201chome visit\u201d constitutes a \u201csearch\u201d under Article II, Section 11, Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b616 A <em>home </em>cisii-where the probation officer stops by the probationer\u2019s home to determine whether the individual is abiding by the conditions of his or her probation-operates as an important check on a probationer\u2019s rehabilitation efforts. As the Department of Corrections states in its <em>Probation and Parole Bureau Standard Operating Procedures, </em>home visits are conducted to address the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">* verify offender\u2019s home address;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">* observe and determine lifestyle factors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">* meet significant others, family members, other residents of home;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">* observe residence for contraband, weapons, illegal or dangerous objects (if visual inspection of the residence provides reasonable suspicion that the offender has items banned by probation rules or court order, conduct a search per P&amp;P 60-4, Searches of Offender\u2019s Person, Vehicle, Residence Confiscation of Offender\u2019s Property);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">* observe residence for non-essential items such [as] VCR/ Cable/Computer-Intemet capabilities if offender\u2019s financial obligations to victim, court and bureau are not being met;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">* observe residence for cable/computer/Internet capabilities if offender is a sex offender and/or has restrictions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">* conduct visual inspection of home;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-12\">* observe neighborhood for potential public safety issues such as high crime area (gang graffiti), schools/parks (sex offenders) or other vulnerable neighbors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-13\">* assess home environment for officer safety (may draft a floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>plan of home); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">* require offender to submit to breathalyzer/urinalysis screening for use of alcohol and/or drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Chapter 60, \u201cSign-Up Procedure/Supervision Standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\u00b617 As the above list indicates, probationary restrictions are meant to facilitate rehabilitation and ensure that the community is not harmed by the probationer\u2019s conditional liberty status. <em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 169, 766 P.2d at 256. The probation officer is charged with not only enforcing conditions of supervision, but also discerning any deception by the probationer. <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>283 F.3d 446, 458 (2d Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">\u00b618 In determining whether a \u201csearch\u201d has occurred, we look at three factors: (1) whether the person has an actual expectation of privacy; (2) whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as objectively reasonable; and (3) the nature of the State\u2019s intrusion. <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 48, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 48, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u00b619  \u201cProbation is an act of grace by a sentencing court, intended to give the offender a chance to rehabilitate outside the prison setting.\u201d <em>State v. Boulton, </em>2006 MT 170, \u00b6 15, 332 Mont. 538, \u00b6 15, 140 P.3d 482, \u00b6 15. Although less restrictive than prison, probation is nonetheless a form of punishment. Although a probationer is restored to \u201cfull rights\u201d upon successful completion of state supervision, Article II, Section 28(2), Montana Constitution, a probationer who is still subject to supervision has a diminished expectation of privacy. <em>Burchett, </em>277 Mont. at 195-96, 921 P.2d at 856. Accordingly, probationers do not enjoy the absolute liberty and heightened expectations of privacy afforded every Montana citizen; rather, they are subject to conditional liberty properly dependent upon special restrictions. <em>Beaudry, </em>282 Mont. at 229, 937 P.2d at 461. Home visits are one commonly imposed condition of probation. We conclude that a convicted felon who is granted probation on a clearly expressed condition, of which she is \u201cunambiguously\u201d aware, that she make her home open and available for the probation officer to visit pursuant to state policy does not have an actual expectation of privacy that would preclude home visits. <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 119, 122 S. Ct. 587, 591-92 (2001). Since there is no actual expectation of privacy, there is no search.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">\u00b620 Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a probationer had an actual expectation that there would be no home visits during the period of supervision, home visits serve to ensure that the supervised felon is abiding by the conditions of her probation, thus addressing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>problem of recidivism. As the United States Supreme Court has noted, \u201c [t]he very assumption of the institution of probation\u2019 is that the probationer is more likely than the ordinary citizen to violate the law.\u2019 The recidivism rate of probationers is significantly higher than the general crime rate.\u201d <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 120, 122 S. Ct. at 592 (citing studies) (quoting <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 880, 107 S. Ct. at 3172). Studies suggest that \u201cmore intensive supervision can reduce recidivism ....\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 875, 107 S. Ct. at 3168. Accordingly, society would not recognize that expectation as objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b621 As to the nature of the state\u2019s intrusion, home visits are a commonly imposed condition of probation which allow the probation officer to determine whether the individual is abiding by the conditions of probation and thus serve to protect the safety and welfare of society.</p>\n<p id=\"A88h\">\u00b622 Other courts addressing the issue of whether a home visit constitutes a search have concluded that, although such visits can evolve into a search, the initial visit is not a search. <em>See United States v. Workman, </em>585 F.2d 1205, 1208 (4th Cir. 1978) (superseded on other grounds); <em>Latta v. Fitzharris, </em>521 F.2d 246 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied </em>423 U.S. 897 (1975). The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Reyes, </em>283 F.3d at 460-62, upheld a plain view discovery of contraband in the context of a home visit of a probationer pursuant to a probation condition permitting home visits at any time. The appeals court reasoned that such visits are a necessary incident to probationary supervision and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">Accordingly, consonant with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Knights </em>that \u201cno more than reasonable suspicion\u201d was required to search a state probationer\u2019s home when that search was authorized by a condition of probation, we hold that the probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment do not apply to a federal probation officer conducting a home visit-a far less invasive form of supervision than a search-pursuant to a convicted offender\u2019s conditions of supervised release. Furthermore, we hold that because home visits \u201cat any time\u201d are conducted pursuant to a <em>court-imposed condition </em>of federal supervised release of which the supervisee is aware, and because a home visit is far less intrusive than a <em>probation search, </em>probation officers conducting a <em>home visit </em>are not subject to the reasonable suspicion standard applicable to <em>probation searches </em>under <em>Knights.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\"><em>Reyes, </em>283 F.3d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b623  A probationer has no reasonable expectation of privacy that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>would preclude home visits from taking place. <em>See also State v. Guzman, </em>990 P.2d 370 (Or. App. 1999); <em>Grubbs v. State, </em>373 So.2d 905, 908-10 (Fla. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b624  Since a home visit is not a search, a probation officer may not open drawers, cabinets, closets or the like; nor may the officer rummage through the probationer\u2019s belongings. While a home visit has the potential to turn into a search pursuant to an officer\u2019s plain view observations, it must remain within the parameters of a home visit unless or until there is reasonable cause to engage in a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\u00b625 The dissent argues that the Court has gone astray in its analysis by relying on the fact that Moody was granted probation on the condition that she submit to home visits. In the dissent\u2019s view, this condition of probation \u201cplays no meaningful\u201d role in determining whether the intrusion constitutes a search. Secondly, assuming that the Court has adopted a \u201cconsent\u201d rationale for circumventing what would otherwise be a search, the dissent proceeds to argue lack of meaningful consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u00b626 The \u201ccondition of probation\u201d focus, however, is separate from a \u201cconsent\u201d analysis. The United States Supreme Court made this abundantly clear in <em>Knights </em>where, although the Court specifically declined to address the issue of \u201cconsent,\u201d it nonetheless noted that the probation order clearly set out the probation search requirement; that Knights was \u201cunambiguously\u2019 aware of the condition and that his acceptance of a clear and unambiguous condition significantly diminished his reasonable expectation of privacy. In <em>Knights, </em>the probationary search which the Court upheld was predicated on both the probation condition and reasonable suspicion. In 2006, the Court in <em>Samson </em>addressed the question left unresolved <em>inKnights-whether </em>the search would have been reasonable under the Fourth Amendment had it been <em>solely </em>predicated upon the condition of probation. <em>Samson, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2198 <em>(citing Knights, </em>534 U.S. 120 n. 6, 122 S. Ct. at 592 n. 6). Clearly, under both <em>Samson </em>and <em>Knights, </em>the condition of probation (or parole) is not only meaningful but, in the words of the Court, \u201csalient\u201d <em>(Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 118, 122 S. Ct. at 491; <em>Samson, </em>126 S. Ct. at 2199) and can be dispositive of the issue of whether a probationer has an expectation of privacy that society would recognize as legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\u00b627  In the present case, Moody was granted probation on certain conditions of which she was \u201cunambiguously\u2019 aware. Her expectation of privacy during her period of supervision, like Knights\u2019 and Samson\u2019s, was significantly diminished. Although the dissent likens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Moody\u2019s plight to that of a prisoner in a cell, that is not our holding. A prisoner in a cell has no expectation of privacy. <em>See </em>Samson; <em>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 105 S. Ct. 733 (1985); and <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S. Ct. 3194 (1984). Under our holding today, a probationer has an expectation of privacy during her period of supervision, albeit significantly diminished. The enclosed areas of a probationer\u2019s residence (closets, cabinets, drawers and the like) cannot be searched without reasonable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\u00b628  In conclusion, we hold that home visits, as a routine and reasonable element of supervising a convicted person serving a term of supervised release, are not searches and are thus not subject to the reasonable cause standard. The District Court, in requiring that Moody consent to home visits as a condition of probation, did not violate Moody\u2019s constitutional rights to privacy or right to be free from unreasonable searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u00b629 2. Did the District Court properly impose a travel restriction as a condition of Moody\u2019s probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\u00b630 Moody also insists that the District Court erred by imposing Condition 3, requiring that she obtain written permission from her probation officer before leaving her assigned district. Although Moody concedes that this condition does not absolutely limit her travel beyond the multi-county district, she nonetheless argues that the condition improperly places her rights at the mercy of the supervising officer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\u00b631  Since probation is a form of punishment, probationers do not enjoy the absolute liberty afforded every citizen; rather, they are subject to conditional liberty properly dependent on special restrictions. <em>Beaudry, </em>282 Mont. at 229, 937 P.2d at 461. We have held that for a condition to be reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and protection of the victim and society, a sentencing condition \u201cmust have some correlation or connection to the underlying offense for which the defendant is being sentenced.\u201d <em>State v. Malloy, </em>2004 MT 377, \u00b6 8, 325 Mont. 86, \u00b6 8, 103 P.3d 1064, \u00b6 8. This of course requires analyzing the condition in the context of the charged offense. To be legitimate, the condition must both rehabilitate the defendant and help protect society from further similar conduct. <em>Malloy, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"A-q\">\u00b632  In this case, the offense resulted from Moody\u2019s admitted problem with alcohol. Unless Moody maintains sobriety, she is likely to re-offend. The deferred sentence permitted Moody the opportunity to address her chemical dependency under the <em>supervision </em>of the probation office. This supervision properly includes a travel restriction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>to allow Moody\u2019s probation officer to effectively keep track of her whereabouts in order to ensure that she remains on course with treatment. The travel restriction does not prohibit Moody from leaving her assigned district, it merely requires written permission from her probation officer. In light of our mandate that a probation restriction both rehabilitate the defendant and help protect society from further similar conduct, we conclude that the District Court properly imposed Condition 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b549-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b549-6\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AUf\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">\u00b634 I concur in the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue 2, but I dissent from its decision on Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\u00b635 I cannot agree that a \u201chome visit\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is not a search.

We also based this conclusion on the fact that \u201claw enforcement officers use field sobriety tests <em>as investigative tools to assist them </em>in discovering and arresting persons driving under the influence of alcohol.\u201d <em>Hulse, </em>\u00b6 32 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">\u00b636 When determining whether there has been an unlawful governmental intrusion into one\u2019s privacy in search and seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>situations, we look at the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">(1) whether the person has an actual expectation of privacy; (2) whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as objectively reasonable; and (3) the nature of the State\u2019s intrusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajf\"><em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 48; <em>see also Hulse, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>Scheetz, </em>286 Mont. at 48, 950 P.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">\u00b637 In the case at hand, the subject of the search is Moody\u2019s home. That a person has an actual expectation of privacy in his or her home, which society is willing to recognize as objectively reasonable, is beyond dispute. Indeed, in <em>State v. Graham, </em>2004 MT 385, 325 Mont. 110, 103 P.3d 1073, we observed that \u201c[although the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures encompasses more than the home, the home, nonetheless, is historically the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for the constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>\u00b6 22. Similarly, in <em>State v. McLees, </em>2000 MT 6, 298 Mont. 15, 994 P.2d 683, we stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">At the risk of belaboring the obvious, private residences are places in which the individual normally expects privacy free of governmental intrusion not authorized by warrant, and that expectation is plainly one that society is prepared to recognize as justifiable. The fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is to protect the privacy and security of individuals and safeguard the sanctity of the home against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\"><em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 25 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). And in <em>Scheetz, </em>we recited \u201cthe long-standing notion throughout this country, but especially in Montana, that a person\u2019s residence and his homestead are secure from unwarranted government intrusion, be it by physical or technological means.\u201d <em>Scheetz, </em>286 Mont. at 48, 950 P.2d at 726 (citing <em>State v. Bullock, </em>272 Mont. 361, 901 P.2d 61 (1995), and <em>State v. Siegal, </em>281 Mont. 250, 934 P.2d 176 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u00b638 Such an expectation of privacy is legitimately held by probationers. <em>See Griffin v. Wisconsin, </em>483 U.S. 868, 875, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3169 (1987) (The \u201cpermissible degree [of impingement upon a probationer\u2019s privacy] is not unlimited.\u201d); <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 873, 107 S.Ct. at 3168 (\u201cA probationer\u2019s home, like anyone else\u2019s, is protected by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that searches be \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Acl\">\u00b639 As for the nature of the State\u2019s intrusion, we consider \u201cwhether the state\u2019s method of investigation is so personally invasive that we recognize the intrusion as a search that requires further justification, such as a warrant or other special circumstances.\u201d <em>Scheetz, </em>286 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>at 50, 950 P.2d at 727. Here, even a cursory examination of the Department of Corrections\u2019 definition of a \u201chome visit\u201d <em>(see </em>the bullet-pointed items in \u00b6 16 of the Court\u2019s Opinion) discloses that the purpose and extent of this intrusion are to visually \u201cinspectD\u201d the probationer\u2019s home; \u201cobserve\u201d activities therein, including evidence of \u201ccontraband, weapons, illegal or dangerous objects\u201d; \u201cassess\u201d the home environment; and otherwise gather evidence of probation violations. (Significantly, nothing in this definition limits the probation officer to plain view observations.) Such an intrusion certainly qualifies as \u201ca visual examination, or the use of some other means of gathering evidence,\u201d <em>Carlson, </em>198 Mont. at 119, 644 P.2d at 501, which is \u201cso personally invasive\u201d as to constitute a search, <em>Seheetz, </em>286 Mont. at 50, 950 P.2d at 727-particularly since, as the Court itself acknowledges, the probation officer\u2019s purpose is to \u201cenforc[e]\u201d conditions of supervision and \u201cdiscemD\u201d any deception by the probationer.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\u00b640 Thus, given that \u201c[t]he home is the most sanctified of all \u2018particular places,\u2019 \u201d <em>Graham, </em>\u00b6 22, and that the purpose and extent of a probation officer\u2019s \u201chome visit\u201d is to inspect the probationer\u2019s home and gather evidence of noncompliance with probation conditions, the impingement on privacy brought about by such an intrusion unquestionably is a \u201csearch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\u00b641 The Court\u2019s contrary conclusion rests on a fundamentally erroneous application of the factors set forth in <em>Elison. </em>First, with respect to whether a probationer has an actual expectation of privacy in her home, the Court observes that \u201cprobationers do not enjoy the absolute liberty and heightened expectations of privacy afforded every Montana citizen\u201d but, rather, \u201care subject to conditional liberty properly dependent upon special restrictions\u201d and, thus, have a \u201cdiminished expectation of privacy.\u201d \u00b6 19. These observations, while true, do not establish that a probationer has <em>no </em>actual expectation of privacy in her home. Indeed, it goes without saying that a \u201cdiminished expectation of privacy\u201d is not a <em>nonexistent </em>expectation of privacy. <em>See State v. 1993 Chevrolet Pickup, </em>2005 MT 180, \u00b6 41, 328 Mont. 10, \u00b6 41, 116 P.3d 800, \u00b6 41 (Leaphart, J., dissenting) (\u201cWhile [a] citizen may not expect as much privacy in the garbage that she sets out for collection as, say, the defendants in <em>Siegal </em>did in their compound, <em>this is not to say that she expects none.\u201d </em>(emphasis added, citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"Akd\">\u00b642 The Court reasons, in addition, that a convicted felon whose probation includes a \u201cclearly expressed\u201d condition that she make her home open and available for a probation officer to visit \u201cdoes not have an actual expectation of privacy that would preclude home visits.\u201d \u00b6 19; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>see also </em>\u00b6 23 (\u201cA probationer has no reasonable expectation of privacy that would preclude home visits from taking place.\u201d). This reasoning and the Court\u2019s concomitant reliance on the probationer\u2019s unambiguous[]\u2019 aware[ness]\u201d of the probation condition, \u00b6 19, however, are entirely unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\u00b643 For one thing, the Court\u2019s observation totally misses the point. The issue at hand is whether the probationer has an actual expectation of privacy in her home, not whether she has an actual expectation of privacy \u201cthat would preclude home visits from taking place.\u201d No one is arguing that the State is precluded altogether from conducting home visits. Rather, the question is whether a home visit constitutes a \u201csearch,\u201d which in turn would require further justification-such as a warrant or other special circumstances-not a complete ban. Likewise, no one has suggested that a probationer whose sentence includes the home visit condition could possibly have \u201can actual expectation that there would be no home visits during the period of supervision.\u201d \u00b620. Obviously, the probationer <em>does </em>expect that there will be home visits, given that this is a condition of her probation. Rather, the question, again, is whether such intrusions are so personally invasive that we require further justification for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\u00b644 Moreover, the question of whether an intrusion into a home constitutes a \u201csearch\u201d is <em>not </em>contingent on whether the State has permitted the homeowner to have a privacy interest therein. Under the Court\u2019s flawed reasoning, the State could vitiate every citizen\u2019s expectation of privacy by the simple expedient of announcing that, henceforth, homes in this State are subject to suspicionless intrusions under the guise of \u201chome visits.\u201d However, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 99 S.Ct. 2577 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWv\">Situations can be imagined, of course, in which [the] two-pronged inquiry [of <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507 (1967)] would provide an inadequate index of Fourth Amendment protection. For example, if the Government were suddenly to announce on nationwide television that all homes henceforth would be subject to warrantless entry, individuals thereafter might not in fact entertain any actual expectation of privacy regarding their homes, papers, and effects.... In such circumstances, where an individual\u2019s subjective expectations had been \u201cconditioned\u201d by influences alien to well-recognized Fourth Amendment freedoms, <em>those subjective expectations obviously could play no meaningful role in ascertaining what the scope of Fourth Amendment protection was. </em>In determining whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d existed in such cases, a normative inquiry would be proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><em>Smith, </em>442 U.S. at 740 n.5, 99 S.Ct. at 2580 n.5 (emphasis added). For this reason, the fact that a probationer\u2019s sentence includes a condition that she make her home open for \u201cvisits\u201d plays \u201cno meaningful role\u201d in ascertaining whether the probation officer\u2019s intrusion constitutes a search-particularly when it is the validity of the probation condition itself that is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b645 In a similar vein, the Court is also mistaken to suggest that a \u201chome visit\u201d is not a search because the probationer had notice of and consented to this condition on her sentence. <em>See </em>\u00b6 19. To the contrary, the officer\u2019s intrusion may be a \u201csearch\u201d nonetheless. <em>See Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, </em>515 U.S. 646, 650, 652, 115 S.Ct. 2386, 2389, 2390 (1995) (holding that random urinalysis drug testing of students participating in interscholastic athletics constitutes a \u201csearch\u201d subject to the demands of the Fourth Amendment, even though the students had consented to the testing); <em>Board of Ed. of Independent Sch. Dist. v. Earls, </em>536 U.S. 822, 826, 832, 122 S.Ct. 2559, 2562, 2566 (2002) (holding that students who consent to drug testing in order to participate in any extracurricular activity still have an expectation of privacy, albeit a \u201climited\u201d expectation).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b646 Furthermore, it is disingenuous to suggest that the probationer had a meaningful choice <em>not </em>to consent to such intrusions on her privacy. As Justice Stevens succinctly observed in <em>Samson v. </em>California,_U.S._, 126 S.Ct. 2193 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">[T]he State\u2019s argument that a California parolee \u201cconsents\u201d to the suspicionless search condition is sophistry. Whether or not a prisoner can choose to remain in prison rather than be released on parole, he has no \u201cchoice\u201d concerning the search condition; he may either remain in prison, where he will be subjected to suspicionless searches, or he may exit prison and still be subject to suspicionless searches. Accordingly, \u201cto speak of consent in this context is to resort to a manifest fiction, for the [parolee] who purportedly waives his rights by accepting such a condition has little genuine option to refuse.\u201d 5 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 10.10(b), pp. 440-441 (4th ed. 2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-9\"><em>Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2206 n.4 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (second alteration in original, first citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">\u00b647 The same is equally true here. Moody\u2019s \u201cchoice\u201d was to accept either suspicionless entries into her home or suspicionless entries into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>her prison cell. Such alternatives are hardly the waiver this Court implies. <em>See State v. Olson, </em>2002 MT 211, \u00b6 20, 311 Mont. 270, \u00b6 20, 55 P.3d 935, \u00b6 20 (\u201cThe knowing and <em>voluntary </em>consent by a citizen to a search is a recognized exception to the warrant requirement. The prosecution carries the burden of establishing that consent to a warrantless search was <em>freely and voluntarily given </em>and <em>uncontaminated by any express or implied duress or coercion.\u201d </em>(emphases added, citation omitted)). In any event, the Court\u2019s suggestion that a probationer who \u201cconsents\u201d to the \u201chome visit\u201d condition on her sentence (because the condition was \u201cclearlyj expressed\u201d and she was \u201c \u2018unambiguously* aware\u201d of it when she was! \u201cgranted\u201d probation) expects only as much privacy in her home as does' a prisoner in his cell is, in the final analysis, pure conjecture lacking any foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u00b648 With respect to whether a probationer\u2019s expectation of privacy in her home is one society is willing to recognize as objectively reasonable, the Court reasons that home visits \u201censure that the supervised felon is abiding by the conditions of her probation, thus addressing the problem of recidivism\u201d and that \u201c \u2018more intensive supervision can reduce recidivism\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 875, 880, 107 S.Ct. at 3168, 3172, and <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 U.S. 112, 120, 122 S.Ct. 587, 592 (2001)). Yet, these are precisely the rationales undergirding the Supreme Court\u2019s approval of the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d or \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standard in <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Knights. See Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 875, 878-80, 107 S.Ct. at 3169, 3171-72; <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 119-21, 122 S.Ct. at 591-93. This Court fails to explain why these rationales now, suddenly, justify elimination of the standard altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u00b649 Again, the question under the first two <em>Elison </em>factors is whether the probationer has an actual expectation of privacy that society is willing to recognize as objectively reasonable. As explained above, private residences are \u201cplaces in which the individual normally expects privacy free of governmental intrusion not authorized by warrant, and that expectation is plainly one that society is prepared to recognize as justifiable.\u201d <em>McLees, </em>\u00b6 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). The fact that the probationer\u2019s expectation of privacy is \u201cdiminished\u201d (\u00b6 19 of the Court\u2019s Opinion) merelyjustifi.es the lesser standard of \u201creasonable grounds\u201d approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Knights </em>and adopted by this Court in <em>State v. Burke, </em>235 Mont. 165, 169-71, 766 P.2d 254, 256-57 (1988). It does not justify an intrusion based on no standard whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u00b650 Lastly, with respect to the nature of the State\u2019s intrusion, the Court acknowledges that \u201chome visits\u201d enable a probation officer \u201cto determine whether the individual is abiding by the conditions of probation.\u201d \u00b6 21. In other words, \u201chome visits\u201d serve verification and evidence-gathering functions-which, heretofore, we have referred to as a \u201csearch.\u201d To be sure, verifying the probationer\u2019s home address and observing the neighborhood for potential public safety issues do not infringe a probationer\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. Even meeting the probationer\u2019s family, which does not necessarily require an intrusion into the probationer\u2019s home, is comparatively benign. However, observing the probationer\u2019s residence for contraband, weapons, and illegal objects, conducting a visual inspection of the home, and requiring the probationer to submit to breathalyzer or urinalysis screening for use of alcohol and drugs certainly constitute an intrusion into the home by the State which infringes a reasonable expectation of privacy and which should be made only upon \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b651 The Court attempts to bolster the result it reaches here with citations to the same five cases cited in the State\u2019s brief for the proposition that a home visit is not a search-namely, <em>United States v. Workman, </em>585 F.2d 1205 (4th Cir. <em>1978), Latta v. Fitzharris, </em>521 F.2d 246 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>283 F.3d 446 (2nd Cir. 2002), <em>State v. Guzman, </em>990 P.2d 370 (Or.App. 1999), and <em>Grubbs v. State, </em>373 So.2d 905 (Fla. 1979). <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23. However, the courts in those cases were interpreting the Fourth Amendment <em>(Workman, Latta, Reyes, </em>and <em>Grubbs), </em>Oregon statutes <em>{Guzman), </em>and the Florida Constitution <em>{Grubbs), </em>whereas the issue with which we have been presented, according to this Court, is whether \u201crequiring a probationer to keep her home open and available for the probation officer to visit at all times violate[s] <em>the Montana Constitution\u201d </em>(emphasis added). It is axiomatic that <em>we, </em>not the United States Courts of Appeals, the Court of Appeals of Oregon, and the Supreme Court of Florida, are the authoritative expositors of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b652 But, at a more fundamental level, even if the decisions of courts in other jurisdictions based on other constitutional and statutory provisions afford persuasive authority on the issue at hand, the cases cited by this Court at \u00b6\u00b6 22-23 are readily distinguishable, in that the \u201cvisits\u201d mentioned in those cases either are undefined (in other words, the contours of a \u201cvisit\u201d are not stated) or are far less intrusive than the \u201chome visits\u201d under our review. <em>See Workman, </em>585 F.2d at 1207, 1208 (referring generically, and as dictum, to \u201cwarrantless visits to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>probationer\u2019s home or place of employment,\u201d while the dispositive issue was \u201cwhether a probation officer can conduct warrantless <em>searches </em>of his probationer\u2019s premises whenever he has <em>probable cause\u201d </em>(emphases added)); <em>Reyes, </em>283 F.3d at 451, 457 (addressing \u201cwhether Reyes, a convicted person serving a term of federal supervised release, had a legitimate expectation of privacy in his driveway,\u201d given that a condition on his sentence was that he permit a probation officer to \u201cvisit\u201d him at any time at home or elsewhere and permit confiscation of any contraband observed \u201cin plain view\u201d by the probation officer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>); <em>Guzman, </em>990 P.2d at 374 (\u201c[T]he authority to conduct a home visit does not carry with it the authority to inspect private areas of the residence.\u201d); <em>Grubbs, </em>373 So.2d at 908,909-10 (also referring to \u201cvisit\u201d generically-in other words, without defining the term<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\u00b653 Simply labeling something a \u201chome visit\u201d does not afford an answer. Because the intrusions at issue in the foregoing cases were, in substance, not as invasive as the \u201chome visit\u201d at issue here, the Court\u2019s reliance on those cases is, therefore, misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b654 The same is true of the State\u2019s conclusory assurance that the Department of Corrections \u201cdistinguishes between home visits and probationary searches.\u201d The State fails to point to any such distinction in the Department\u2019s policies and procedures. Indeed, the State provides no explanation whatsoever of what a probation officer may do in a probationary search that the officer may <em>not </em>do in the course of a home visit. The Court assumes that the probation officer (during a home visit) \u201cmay not open drawers, cabinets, closets or the like; nor may the officer rummage through the probationer\u2019s belongings.\u201d \u00b6 24. Yet, such restrictions do not appear anywhere in the Department\u2019s policies and procedures concerning supervision of probationers. Rather, the Court has simply inserted its own language, unfortunately created from whole cloth and contrary to the actual record, into the definition of a \u201chome visit.\u201d In point of fact, the home visits under our review instruct probation officers, <em>without qualification, </em>to \u201cinspectD\u201d the probationer\u2019s home and, during that inspection, to \u201cobserve\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>evidence of contraband, weapons, and illegal or dangerous objects and \u201crequire\u201d the probationer to submit to breathalyzer and urinalysis screening for use of alcohol or drugs-all of which, <em>in substance, </em>constitutes a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b655 Notably, <em>Latta </em>(cited by the Court at \u00b6 22) actually supports the conclusion that a \u201chome visit\u201d is a search. In <em>Latta, </em>the Ninth Circuit, in the context of addressing whether a parole officer\u2019s \u201cwarrantless search of [a parolee\u2019s] home violated the Fourth Amendment,\u201d <em>Latta, </em>521 F.2d at 248, observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">The purposes of the parole system give the parole authorities a special and unique interest in invading the privacy of parolees under their supervision. In order to fulfill his dual responsibilities for helping the parolee to reintegrate into society and evaluating his progress, and for preventing possible further antisocial or criminal conduct by the parolee, it is essential that the parole officer have a thorough understanding of the parolee and his environment, including his personal habits, his relationships with other persons, and what he is doing, both at home and outside it. It is equally important that this information be kept up to date. Much of this information can be obtained by methods which necessitate little or no invasion of the parolee\u2019s privacy, such as interviews with the parolee himself or with his employer, family, or friends and <em>visits to his house. </em>However, these techniques have <em>inherent limitations. </em>For example, it may be impossible to determine <em>whether a parolee is using alcohol or narcotics, whether he is keeping weapons or other contraband in his home, whether he is using or preparing to use his home as a base for improper or unlawful activities, whether he is making a real effort to obtain employment, or the general nature of his home environment, without conducting some type of search.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-6\"><em>Latta, </em>521 F.2d at 249-50 (emphases added, citations omitted). It is this same information that the probation officers conducting the \u201chome visits\u201d under our consideration seek to obtain: whether the probationer is using alcohol or narcotics, whether she is keeping weapons or other contraband in her home, whether she is using or preparing to use her home as a base for improper or unlawful activities, and the general nature of her home environment-all of which involve \u201csome type of search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b656 The Comb points out that \u201chome visits\u201d serve important goals and purposes-namely, to \u201censure that the supervised felon is abiding by the conditions of her probation\u201d; to \u201caddressD the problem of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>recidivism\u201d; and to \u201cprotect the safety and welfare of society.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 20, 21. These observations, however, miss the mark. The purpose of virtually <em>every </em>entry into a home by law enforcement is to ensure that the homeowner is abiding by the law or to protect the safety and welfare of society. This does not mean that the entries, therefore, are not searches. Article II, Section 11, does not define a \u201csearch\u201d as a mere unimportant impingement upon an individual\u2019s privacy. Rather, as explained earlier, the question of whether an intrusion constitutes a \u201csearch\u201d depends on whether the person has an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy, whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as objectively reasonable, and the nature-not importance-of the State\u2019s intrusion. Thus, while home visits may indeed operate as an important check on a probationer\u2019s rehabilitation efforts, this fact does not determine the nature of the officer\u2019s entry.</p>\n<p id=\"AkX\">\u00b657 This is not to say that the goals and purposes served by \u201chome visits\u201d are irrelevant. To the contrary, this factor bears on the degree of certainty or suspicion required to support the officer\u2019s decision to intrude. <em>See Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 121, 122 S.Ct. at 592 (\u201cAlthough the Fourth Amendment ordinarily requires the degree of probability embodied in the term \u2018probable cause,\u2019 a lesser degree satisfies the Constitution when the balance of governmental and private interests makes such a standard reasonable.\u201d). We previously recognized that the State\u2019s operation of a probation system, like its operation of a school, government office, or prison, or its supervision of a regulated industry, \u201c \u2018presents \u201cspecial needs\u201d beyond normal law enforcement that may justify departures from the usual warrant and probable cause requirements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 168-69, 766 P.2d at 256 (quoting <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 873-74, 107 S.Ct. at 3168). We therefore approved a warrantless probationary search conducted upon \u201creasonable grounds.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 169-71, 766 P.2d at 256-57. In so doing, we reasoned that a probation officer \u201cmust be able to supervise the probationer, and upon his judgment and expertise, search the probationer\u2019s residence or cause it to be searched.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 171, 766 P.2d at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">\u00b658 The \u201creasonable grounds\u201d standard was sufficient, we held in <em>Burke, </em>to accommodate two often opposing interests: the probation officer\u2019s duty to supervise the probationer and the probationer\u2019s reduced, but nevertheless existent, privacy interest. Quoting <em>Griffin, </em>we reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">[T]he probation agency must be able to act based upon a lesser degree of certainty than the Fourth Amendment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>otherwise require in order to intervene before a probationer does damage to himself or society. The agency, moreover, must be able to proceed on the basis of its entire experience with the probationer, and to assess probabilities in the light of its knowledge of his life, character and circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\"><em>Griffin, </em>[483 U.S. at 879,] 107 S.Ct. at 3171. Thus, the special needs of the probation system strongly militate toward the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><em>Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 169, 766 P.2d at 256 (first alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"AsP\">\u00b659 With no apparent justification for modifying this balance-indeed, as noted above, the Court merely reiterates the exact rationales by which we approved the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d standard in the first place, <em>compare Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 169-71, 766 P.2d at 256-57, <em>with </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 20, 21 of the Court\u2019s Opinion-the Court today lowers the bar in favor of no standard at all. Now, a probation officer may enter a probationer\u2019s home-under the guise of a \u201chome visit\u201d-with no grounds whatsoever, on any basis the officer deems sufficient (or on no basis at all), and in the absence of any programmatic safeguards to ensure evenhandedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b660 Yet, nothing in the record supports the notion that the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d standard inhibits a probation officer from supervising the probationer or renders the officer\u2019s expertise meaningless. Indeed, we adopted the reasonable grounds standard precisely to accommodate probation officers\u2019 expertise in supervising probationers. <em>See Burke, </em>235 Mont. at 169, 766 P.2d at 256 (The probation officer\u2019s \u201ccontinued experience with the probationer,\u201d \u201cknowledge of the original offense,\u201d and judgment as to \u201cthe degree of supervision necessary in each case\u201d \u201cstrongly militate toward the \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 standard.\u201d). Moreover, reasonable grounds may be supplied by this very expertise-i.e., individual-specific knowledge, gained through the supervisory relationship, concerning the probationer\u2019s criminal history and projected likelihood of re-offending. <em>See Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 871, 107 S.Ct. at 3167 (noting that the regulation at issue, which the Court upheld, required the officer to consider a variety of factors in determining whether \u201creasonable grounds\u201d exist, including \u201cthe officer\u2019s own experience with the probationer\u201d); <em>Griffin, </em>483 U.S. at 879-80, 107 S.Ct. at 3171-72 (suggesting that the reasonable grounds standard accommodates a probation agency\u2019s need \u201cto proceed on the basis of its entire experience with the probationer, and to assess probabilities in the light of its knowledge of his life, character, and circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u00b661 It is counterintuitive that, under this Court\u2019s decision today, a probation \u201csearch\u201d must be based on \u201creasonable cause,\u201d since probationers have conditioned liberty and, therefore, a reduced privacy interest (see \u00b6 24 of the Court\u2019s Opinion; see <em>also Roper, </em>\u00b6 12); yet, by the simple expedient of calling a \u201csearch\u201d a \u201cvisit,\u201d we do away with the reasonable cause requirement altogether, even though the object of the exercise is precisely the same: to inspect the home of a person who has conditioned liberty and, therefore, a reduced privacy interest and gather evidence of probation violations. The fact that the probation officer may rummage through drawers and personal belongings in a \u201csearch,\u201d but may not do so in a \u201cvisit\u201d (see \u00b6 24 of the Court\u2019s Opinion), seems a slender reed of distinction indeed when, during the visit, the probation officer, as a \u201cvisitor,\u201d may, nevertheless, observe and visually inspect everyone and everything in the home-with no restriction whatsoever in the Department of Corrections\u2019 definition of a \u201chome visit\u201d that the officer is limited to \u201cplain view\u201d observations-and require the probationer to give breath and urine samples.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b662 In sum, I cannot agree that calling something which is, for all intents and purposes, a search a \u201chome visit\u201d necessarily changes what probation officers are actually doing: seeking and gathering evidence. Nor can I agree that by the simple expedient of renaming a search a \u201chome visit,\u201d the privacy of a presumably innocent probationer becomes subject to <em>greater </em>infringement (given that the Court requires <em>no cause </em>for a \u201chome visit\u201d) than is the privacy of a probationer of whom the probation officer actually has a <em>reasonable suspicion </em>of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b663 Before concluding, it is appropriate to address the extensive arguments presented to us by Moody and the State based on <em>Samson v. </em>California,_U.S._, 126 S.Ct. 2193 (2006), which the Supreme Court decided on June 19, 2006, shortly after we handed down our original Opinion in the case at hand. In <em>Samson, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit a police officer from conducting a suspicionless search of a parolee. <em>Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2202. In other words, the Court upheld a search that was based solely on the subject\u2019s status as a parolee. <em>Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2196. The State argues that in light of this holding, probation officers may conduct \u201chome visits\u201d of probationers without having \u201creasonable cause\u201d for doing so. However, neither <em>Samson\u2019s </em>holding nor the reasoning behind it sustains the State\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\u00b664 First, <em>Samson </em>involved the search of a <em>parolee, </em>not a probationer. Notably, the <em>Samson </em>majority went to great lengths to characterize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>parolees as having \u201cfewer expectations of privacy than probationers, because parole is more akin to imprisonment than probation is to imprisonment.\u201d <em>Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2198. <em>See, e.g., Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2198 (\u201c \u2018[0]n the Court\u2019s continuum of possible punishments, parole is the stronger medicine; ergo, parolees enjoy even less of the average citizen\u2019s absolute liberty than do probationers.\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Cardona, </em>903 F.2d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 1990))); <em>Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2201 (\u201c[P]arolees, in contrast to probationers, \u201chave been sentenced to prison for felonies and released before the end of their prison terms\u2019 and are \u2018deemed to have acted more harmfully than anyone except those felons not released on parole.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>372 F.3d 1048, 1077 (9th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (Kleinfeld, J., concurring))).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b665 Thus, the Court in <em>Samson </em>did not broaden the holding of <em>Knights, supra, </em>that \u201c[w]hen an officer has <em>reasonable suspicion </em>that a <em>probationer </em>subject to a search condition is engaged in criminal activity, there is enough likelihood that criminal conduct is occurring that an intrusion on the probationer\u2019s significantly diminished privacy interests is reasonable.\u201d <em>Knights, </em>534 U.S. at 121, 122 S.Ct. at 593 (emphases added). Indeed, the question of whether a <em>probation </em>search is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment absent \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d was not before the Court in <em>Samson. See Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2198.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b666 Second, <em>Samson </em>involved a search of Samson\u2019s person on a street, not a search of his house. As explained above, one\u2019s expectation of privacy is at its pinnacle in the home. <em>See McLees, </em>\u00b6 25 (The fundamental purpose of the prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures \u201cis to protect the privacy and security of individuals and safeguard the sanctity of the home against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Graham, </em>\u00b6 22 (\u201c[T]he home... is historically the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>for the constitutional protection.\u201d). To say that a probation officer may enter a probationer\u2019s <em>home </em>without reasonable cause because a police officer may conduct a suspicionless search of a parolee on the <em>street </em>is to disregard entirely the fundamental and crucial difference between these two contexts: the heightened expectation of privacy in the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">\u00b667 Third, the suspicionless search system approved by the Supreme Court in <em>Samson </em>did not, in the Court\u2019s view, give officers \u201cunbridled discretion to conduct searches.\u201d <em>Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2202; <em>see also Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2204 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201c[I]f individualized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>suspicion is to be jettisoned, it must be replaced with measures to protect against the state actor\u2019s unfettered discretion.\u201d). In particular, the Court was satisfied that California prohibited \u201carbitrary, capricious or harassing\u201d searches. <em>Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2202 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Court rejected the argument that California\u2019s parole search law permits \u201ca blanket grant of discretion untethered by any procedural safeguards.\u201d <em>Samson, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2202 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b668 Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the \u201chome visits\u201d at issue here, the implementation of which is not constrained by any standards, guidelines, or procedures at all. Indeed, the only parameters imposed on a probation officer\u2019s otherwise unfettered ability to enter and inspect a probationer\u2019s home under the guise of a \u201chome visit\u201d are set forth in this Court\u2019s Opinion; namely, the officer \u201cmay not open drawers, cabinets, closets or the like\u201d or \u201crummage through the probationer\u2019s belongings\u201d-at least not until the inspection made possible by the officer\u2019s suspicionless intrusion into the house has given him or her reasonable cause to begin rummaging <em>(see </em>\u00b6 24 of the Court\u2019s Opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b669 Finally-and perhaps most fundamentally-Samson was decided under the Fourth Amendment, whereas we are bound, in addition, by the provisions of the Montana Constitution. <em>See State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 17, 315 Mont. 59, \u00b6 17, 67 P.3d 295, \u00b6 17 (\u201c[SJearch analysis to determine proper constitutional criminal procedure in Montana is typically conducted under Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution, in addition to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d). In this regard, we have frequently stated in the search and seizure context that Montanans are afforded a broader privacy protection under Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution than under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See Hulse, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>State v. Siegal, </em>281 Mont. 250, 263, 264, 934 P.2d 176, 183, 184 (1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 19, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 19; <em>State v. Bullock, </em>272 Mont. 361, 384, 901 P.2d 61, 75 (1995); <em>State v. Sawyer, </em>174 Mont. 512, 515, 571 P.2d 1131, 1133 (1977), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Long, </em>216 Mont. 65, 67, 71, 700 P.2d 153, 155, 157 (1985). This increased protection is even more closely guarded when the search is conducted in one\u2019s home. <em>Graham, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-22. Accordingly, <em>Samson </em>does not afford an answer to the question of whether, in this State, probation officers may conduct \u201chome visits\u201d without reasonable cause for doing so. <em>See Scheetz, </em>286 Mont. at 47, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>950 P.2d at 725 (holding that <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637 (1983), \u201cis not determinative\u201d of whether the government\u2019s use of a drug-detecting canine violates the Montana Constitution, since \u201cwe have chosen not to \u2018march lock-step\u2019 with the United States Supreme Court, even when applying nearly identical language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b670 In conclusion, a probation officer\u2019s entry into a probationer\u2019s home to conduct a \u201chome visit,\u201d as that term is presently defined by the Department of Corrections, constitutes a search. The Court decides otherwise on the grounds that the probationer was \u201cgranted\u201d this condition on her sentence and that home visits are one \u201ccommonly imposed\u201d condition of probation. However, neither of these considerations establishes that the probationer does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in her home that is infringed by suspicionless intrusions to \u201cinspect\u00fc\u201d and \u201cobserve\u201d for evidence of \u201ccontraband, weapons, illegal or dangerous objects.\u201d The Court also reasons that home visits \u201cserve to protect the safety and welfare of society.\u201d However, the importance of the goal served by an officer\u2019s intrusion into a home does not determine the <em>nature </em>of that intrusion and, thus, is not a factor by which we determine whether the intrusion constitutes a search. Otherwise, the citizens of this State are protected only from unimportant intrusions, and the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures are meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b671 I would require reasonable grounds to conduct the \u201chome visits\u201d at issue here. I dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary conclusion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\"> The Department of Corrections uses the term \u201chome contact\u201d in its procedures manual. However, the parties and the Court use the term \u201chome visit\u201d; thus, for consistency, I also am using the term \u201chome visit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\"> In Reyes, the probation officers \u201cwalk[ed] on the driveway toward the backyard to determine whether anyone was at home\u201d and, in so doing, discovered marijuana plants in plain view in Reyes\u2019s yard.
