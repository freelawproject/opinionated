Parker asserts on appeal that the District Court violated his fundamental constitutional right to confrontation because the District Court\u2019s bailiff delivered to the jury room audio-taped evidence not admitted at trial. Parker also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of certain evidence. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">\u00b62 We rephrase the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court violated Parker\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation when the bailiff delivered to the jury room a witness\u2019s taped interview that had not been introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">2. Whether Parker\u2019s counsel ineffectively represented him by failing to object when the bailiff delivered to the jury room audio tapes of a \u201c911\u201d call and police interviews with Parker\u2019s children and another witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">\u00b64 On the morning of October 2, 2003, police arrested Parker after a disturbance at his home in Lake County. After police arrived, Parker\u2019s wife, Annalisa McDonough, was taken by ambulance to the hospital for treatment of several injuries including a cut to the back of her head, lacerations, and swelling and bruising in both of her shoulders, her right elbow, and her left knee. Police also observed and photographed bruising, swelling, and cuts sustained by Parker\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax\">\u00b65 Immediately following Parker\u2019s arrest Officer Bell interviewed the couple\u2019s four children, and Eve Kratz, an adult houseguest at their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>home. Each of the five had observed some portion of the events preceding Parker\u2019s arrest. Bell recorded all of the interviews he conducted that morning onto one audio-tape. At trial, the State introduced into evidence Bell\u2019s taped interviews with Parker\u2019s children and played the interviews for the jury. Kratz\u2019s statement was not entered into evidence, nor did she testify in person. At the close of arguments the District Court ordered the audio-tape and a tape player delivered to the jury room for use by the jury during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b66 The taped statements given by Parker\u2019s children and Kratz on the morning of Parker\u2019s arrest implicated Parker for injuries to both McDonough and Parker\u2019s son. Also that morning, McDonough told her treating nurse and physician that Parker caused her injuries, and they so testified at trial. However, Parker\u2019s family members recanted their recorded statements under oath at trial. Each testified that they either could not remember the details of the event, or had been forced by Kratz to make false statements about Parker\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b67 Parker\u2019s son testified he lied to police because Kratz, a woman he described as six feet tall and weighing 300 pounds, intimidated him. McDonough, Parker\u2019s wife, told the jury Kratz \u201cdidn\u2019t care for [Parker] very much\u201d because he repeatedly asked Kratz to leave after she overstayed by a month McDonough\u2019s invitation to \u201cstay a few days\u201d at their home. McDonough said Kratz needed a stable residence to meet the conditions of her probation and avoid going back to prison, and that she had nowhere else to live. Parker\u2019s wife also testified under oath that Kratz caused her head injury when Kratz pushed her and her head struck an electric baseboard in the hours before Parker\u2019s arrest. She also denied having told medical personnel that Parker caused her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b68 When the State moved to admit into evidence Officer Bell\u2019s taped interviews, Bell provided the following foundation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">[State]: I will hand you what\u2019s been marked as State\u2019s Exhibit 2 and ask if you can identify that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">[Bell]: Yeah. That\u2019s the tape. It\u2019s 7:05 a.m., 10/2/03. It\u2019s got my name, my badge number, the CR number for our agency that keeps track of every case, and Annalisa Parker, victim, and kids\u2019 statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">[State]: Contained therein is a true and correct copy of your interview with the kids?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">[Bell]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">[State]: That would be all of the kids?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Bell then indicated the tape contained the statements of each of the Parker children, at which point the District Court admitted the tape, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>and the prosecutor played the children\u2019s statements in open court. The tape revealed that each Parker child saw a different portion of the events leading up to Parker\u2019s arrest, but no one child saw the entirety of the interaction between their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b69 Unbeknownst to Parker, the tape contained not only the children\u2019s statements, but also Kratz\u2019s statement recorded by Bell on the morning of Parker\u2019s arrest. When the State played the tape in the courtroom, the prosecutor stopped the tape at the conclusion of the children\u2019s statements so neither Parker nor the jury heard Kratz\u2019s recorded statement. Kratz was not called to testify by either party. Nor did Officer Bell testify as to the content of his interview with Kratz, which revealed Kratz\u2019s version of the events preceding Parker\u2019s arrest, and a description of Parker\u2019s actions. At the close of arguments the court ordered that the tape and all other admitted evidence be delivered to the jury room, and instructed the jury to consider all of the evidence before submitting a verdict. Parker\u2019s counsel did not object to delivery of the tape to the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b610 The jury convicted Parker of one count of assault with a weapon in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, and the District Court sentenced him to a twenty-year prison term with ten years suspended. Parker timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b611 We generally review a district court\u2019s decision to deliver exhibits in evidence to a jury room during deliberations for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Bales, </em>1999 MT 334, \u00b6 8, 297 Mont. 402, \u00b6 8, 994 P.2d 17, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted). The evidence at issue here, however, was not admitted, which requires us to determine whether the District Court\u2019s error violated Parker\u2019s constitutional right to confront a witness against him. Accordingly, our review of the constitutional law question raised here is plenary. <em>State v. Mann, </em>2006 MT 160, \u00b6 10,332 Mont. 476, \u00b6 10, 139 P.3d 159, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">ISSUES ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">\u00b612 <em>1. Whether the District Court violated Parker\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation when the bailiff delivered to the jury room a witness\u2019s taped interview that had not been introduced into evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">\u00b613 It is undisputed that during Parker\u2019s trial the bailiff delivered to the jury room an audio-tape which included an interview of Kratz recorded by Officer Bell and a tape player for use during deliberations. The record is likewise clear that neither party entered into evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Kratz\u2019s recorded interview, called Kratz to testify in person, or elicited testimony from Officer Bell as to the content of his interview with Kratz.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b614 Parker contends the jury\u2019s exposure to extrinsic evidence violated his right to confrontation under both the United States and Montana Constitutions, and as a result he is entitled to a new trial. Parker argues the prosecution misled the District Court as to the contents of the audio-tape when the State offered the tape into evidence premised upon Officer Bell\u2019s testimony that the tape contained interviews with Parker\u2019s children. At no time did the State disclose Kratz\u2019s interview was on the tape. Parker also asserts there was no reason he should have known that Kratz\u2019s interview was delivered to the jury during deliberations, nor should he be required to prove that the jury heard and was prejudiced by Kratz\u2019s interview in order to receive a new trial. Parker posits the prosecution\u2019s infraction infringed upon his constitutional right to address Kratz\u2019s allegations against him, resulted in the District Court\u2019s delivery of extrinsic evidence to the jury room, and constituted reversible error entitling him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A15\">\u00b615 The State responds that Parker failed to preserve this issue for direct appeal because he never objected to the delivery of the tape to the jury room, and therefore robbed the District Court of the opportunity to exercise its discretion to disallow the audio-tape exhibit into the jury room in accordance with \u00a7 46-16-504, MCA. The State further argues that Parker cannot establish here that the jury actually <em>heard </em>Kratz\u2019s testimony, and Parker should therefore pursue his claim through post-conviction proceedings. In the alternative, the State contends that delivery of Kratz\u2019s interview to the jury was harmless error, cumulative to other admissible evidence, and did not contribute to Parker\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b616 Parker counters that Kratz\u2019s interview fails harmless error analysis because it struck at the heart of Parker\u2019s defense. Parker based his defense on his contention, and his family members\u2019 sworn testimony, that Kratz essentially bullied them into making false statements to police and medical personnel. The jury\u2019s exposure to Kratz\u2019s taped statement, combined with her absence from court, denied Parker the opportunity to counter her version of critical events or challenge her credibility as a witness. Moreover, because the jury never saw Kratz testify in person, it had no opportunity to observe her demeanor, body language, or conduct so as to compare the weight of her testimony against other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b617  At the outset of our analysis, we address whether this issue is properly before us on direct appeal given Parker\u2019s failure to object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>delivery of the tape to the jury room. At trial the prosecutor and Officer Bell represented to the court that the tape contained <em>\u201ca </em>true and correct copy of [Bell\u2019s] interview <em>with the </em>kids[.] \u201d (Emphasis added.) The transcript reveals that when the prosecutor played the tape in the courtroom listeners heard only the interviews with Parker\u2019s children, followed by this exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">Officer Bell: Can you think of anything else, [son]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">[Son]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">Officer Bell: Okay. We can get some-who is this lady-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">(Whereupon, the playing of State\u2019s Exhibit 2 was concluded ....) Nothing in this record suggests that Parker should have been alerted that Kratz\u2019s interview was also on the tape. When Officer Bell authenticated and laid the foundation for the tape, he represented to the court that the tape was what the State, as its proponent, claimed it to be. M. R. Evid. 901(a). We will not fault Parker for failing to challenge this representation when he had no knowledge to the contrary. Therefore, we conclude that Parker\u2019s failure to object at trial does not preclude our consideration of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\u00b618  Further, we must reject the State\u2019s contention that because Parker cannot prove on the record before us that the jury actually <em>heard </em>Kratz\u2019s statements, his claim is not appropriate for consideration on direct appeal. The problem with the State\u2019s argument is it presumes that <em>Parker </em>must prove both the existence of an error and its prejudicial impact. This is not his burden. It is well established that in the routine case where evidence is erroneously <em>admitted </em>and a defendant alleges prejudice, <em>the State </em>bears the burden of demonstrating the error was not prejudicial. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 42, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 42, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 42. Here, where the evidence was never admitted in the first place and as a result reached the jury without court scrutiny or the defendant\u2019s knowledge, it would be illogical to saddle Parker with the burden of proving he was prejudiced as the State would have us do. In the interest of preserving the fundamental fairness of criminal trials, when extrinsic evidence reaches a jury, as it did here, the burden of disproving prejudice must rest with the State as it does in other cases in which harmless error analysis is applied. This being so, we decline to accept the State\u2019s invitation to dismiss Parker\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\u00b619 We turn now to the merits of Parker\u2019s claim. We must determine whether the evidentiary error which occurred at Parker\u2019s trial violated his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him, and whether it was sufficiently prejudicial to require a new trial. We conclude that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u00b620 \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witness against him....\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. VI. In Montana, the rights guaranteed an accused in a criminal prosecution, including confrontation, are fundamental. <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, \u00b6 20, 290 Mont. 479, \u00b6 20, 964 P.2d 766, \u00b6 20. The Montana Constitution at Article II, Section 24, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right to appear and defend in person and by counsel; to demand the nature and cause of the accusation; to meet the witnesses against him face to face; to have process to compel the attendance of witnesses in his behalf, and a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county or district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">An accused criminal is specifically granted the right to \u201cmeet the witnesses against him face to face,\u201d and accordingly we recognize that \u201cfull cross-examination\u201d is a \u201ccritical aspect of the right of confrontation.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 22. \u201cCross-examination is the hallmark of our system of justice because it produces truth. Such things as the demeanor of a witness, his or her body language, and a witness\u2019s hesitancy in giving testimony, often communicate as much to the fact-finder as the spoken words....\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b621 In the case before us, the jury was given access, and may have listened, to a police interview with a critical eyewitness who did not testify at trial, was not subject to cross-examination, and whose demeanor the jury was never able to observe. While clearly an error occurred, the parties dispute whether the error prejudiced Parker to the extent that a new trial is required. As previously discussed in \u00b6 18, we would normally answer such a question by applying the two-step analysis we adopted in <em>Van Kirk, </em>and examine whether erroneously admitted evidence was sufficiently prejudicial to require a new trial. \u00b6 37. The anomaly in this case, though, is that the evidence in question was never admitted. As this Court has not previously been presented with this peculiar situation, we look to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in <em>Eslaminia v. White, </em>for a frame of reference. 136 F.3d 1234 (9th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">\u00b622 In <em>Eslaminia, </em>the prosecution offered into evidence a taped interview with the defendant which the jury took into the jury room during deliberations. The defendant\u2019s lawyers later discovered that the reverse side of the admitted tape contained a police interview with the defendant\u2019s brother who had not testified at trial, and whose interview had not been entered in evidence. There, the court said, \u201cIt is clear that the jury\u2019s consideration of the tape is a serious error of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>dimensions.\u201d <em>Eslaminia, </em>136 F.3d at 1237. The court then evaluated the prejudicial effect of the extrinsic evidence under the harmless error standard applied to \u201ctrial errors\u201d under federal law. The court remanded for a new trial, holding that the tape recording, which bore on the credibility of key witnesses, was prejudicial because credibility was the central issue determining the defendant\u2019s culpability. We are persuaded by the <em>Eslaminia </em>court\u2019s reasoning, and conclude it is reinforced by our <em>Van Kirk </em>jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b623 Under <em>Van Kirk, </em>to determine whether Kratz\u2019s statement was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal, we first determine whether delivery of the tape was \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201ctrial\u201d error. \u00b6 37. Structural error is that which \u201caffects the framework within which the trial proceeds ....\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38 (citations omitted). Structural errors are presumptively prejudicial, and require automatic reversal. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39 (citations omitted). A trial error typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury, and is \u201camenable to qualitative assessment by a reviewing court for prejudicial impact relative to the other evidence introduced at trial.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. We conclude that delivery of Kratz\u2019s taped statement to the jury was trial, as opposed to structural, error. Therefore, we move to the second step in the <em>Van Kirk </em>analysis to determine whether the error was harmless under the circumstances. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\u00b624 In order to assess the impact of the error on the trial, we apply the \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d test to determine whether Parker\u2019s jury was presented with other admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence-i.e., Kratz\u2019s statement-proved. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43. The \u201ccumulative evidence\u201d standard further requires the State to show that the <em>quality </em>of the Kratz statement was such that there was no reasonable possibility that it might have contributed to Parker\u2019s conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b625 The State contends the information Kratz relayed in her statement was harmless because it merely duplicated information presented to the jury through the recorded statements of Parker\u2019s family members and the statements McDonough made to medical personnel who testified at trial. Moreover, the State argues, the quality of Kratz\u2019s statement was inferior to other admissible evidence because Kratz \u201cviewed only a small part of the incident, did not provide a detailed account of what she saw, and did not see the [alleged] stabbing in the car ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b626 We disagree with the State. We conclude that Kratz\u2019s recorded statement was of sufficient quality to prejudice Parker\u2019s defense and contribute to his conviction. At trial, Parker\u2019s family members testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>under oath that they lied to Officer Bell and medical personnel on the morning following the alleged assault because they were intimidated by Kratz. They claimed she instructed them to implicate Parker as having caused the injuries suffered by Parker\u2019s wife and son. Given Kratz\u2019s absence from trial, Parker could not cross-examine her, and the jury had no opportunity to assess either her capability of intimidation or her credibility as compared to McDonough and the Parker children. The subsequent introduction of her taped statement into the jury room then presumably gave the jury Kratz\u2019s unchallenged one-sided version of events preceding Parker\u2019s arrest, to the State\u2019s advantage and Parker\u2019s detriment. Moreover, given that no one witness could establish all of the elements of the crime the State charged, Kratz\u2019s account was at least as crucial to the prosecution\u2019s case as were the statements of Parker\u2019s family members, and likely more so, given that all of the eyewitnesses except Kratz recanted their accusations against Parker at trial. Finally, Kratz\u2019s statement must be considered of superior quality to the hearsay testimony given by medical personnel who testified at trial. McDonough\u2019s treating nurse and physician could relay only what they had been told about the event by McDonough and what they observed about McDonough\u2019s injuries and behavior at the hospital, none of which proved any element of the State\u2019s charge against Parker.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b627  We therefore conclude that Parker\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him was violated when the tape of Kratz\u2019s statement to police was delivered to the jury. We further conclude, pursuant to <em>Van </em>Kirk, that a reasonable possibility exists that the delivery of Kratz\u2019s statement to the jury room contributed to Parker\u2019s conviction. Parker is therefore entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b628 <em>2. Whether Parker\u2019s counsel ineffectively represented him by failing to object when the bailiff delivered to the jury room audio tapes of a \u201c911\u201d call and police interviews with Parker\u2019s children and another witness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u00b629 We decline to address this issue in light of our resolution of Issue One.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\u00b630 For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b159-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, MORRIS, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
