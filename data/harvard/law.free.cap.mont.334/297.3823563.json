As a preliminary matter, Gratzer challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-22-101(2), MCA (2003), suggesting that the statute, by prohibiting a petitioner from challenging the validity of a sentence, impermissibly suspends the writ of habeas corpus. Substantively, Gratzer maintains that the District Court violated his constitutional rights and exceeded its authority when it declared him ineligible for parole. Gratzer insists that \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (1981) (\u201cAdditional Restrictions on Sentence\u201d), does not permit such a parole restriction to be imposed upon a life sentence. Gratzer also contends that the District Court violated his constitutional rights when it designated him a \u201cdangerous offender,\u201d because, he asserts, the court lacked the authority to designate a person serving a life sentence as a \u201cdangerous offender.\u201d Finally, relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), Gratzer argues that the District Court violated his constitutional rights when, absent a specific charge and a jury finding that Gratzer had used a weapon, it sentenced him to a consecutive ten-year term for the use of a weapon in the commission of an offense. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">I. Constitutionality of \u00a7 46-22-101(2), MCA (2003)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u00b62 Section 46-22-101(2), MCA (2003), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-8\">The writ of habeas corpus is not available to attack the validity of the conviction or sentence of a person who has been adjudged guilty of an offense in a court of record and has exhausted the remedy of appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Gratzer, who is attacking the validity of his sentence, challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-22-101(2), MCA (2003). We recently addressed this issue in <em>Lott v. State of Montana, </em>2006 MT 279, wherein we held that the procedural bar to habeas corpus petitions contained in \u00a7 46-22-101(2), MCA (2003), is unconstitutional as applied to facially invalid sentences. Since Gratzer\u2019s challenges draw into question the facial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>validity of his sentence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the procedural bar to his habeas corpus petition is not applicable, and we address the merits of bis claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\u00b63 We evaluate the legality of a sentence according to the sentencing statutes in effect at the time a defendant is sentenced. <em>State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 147, 915 P.2d 208, 221 (1996). Gratzer was sentenced in 1982. Accordingly, we examine Gratzer\u2019s sentence through the lens of the 1981 Montana Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">H. Parole Ineligibility</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u00b64 Gratzer contends that the District Court violated his constitutional rights when it declared him ineligible for parole while serving a life sentence. Gratzer interprets the sentencing statutes and parole eligibility statutes to distinguish between determinate time sentences-statutorily dubbed \u201cterm\u201d sentences, according to Gratzer-and indeterminate life sentences, and suggests that the statutory scheme, therefore, does not authorize a court to remove a prisoner\u2019s eligibility for parole if the prisoner is serving a life sentence. Essentially, Gratzer argues that the statute that authorizes a court to restrict parole eligibility, because it speaks only of \u201ca sentence of imprisonment in the state prison for a <em>term </em>exceeding 1 year,\u201d \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (1981) (emphasis added), does not apply to life sentences. Gratzer notes that a life sentence carries a statutorily mandated restriction on parole during the first thirty years of the sentence, \u00a7 46-23-201(l)(b), MCA (1981), and insists that courts lack authority to affix any additional parole restrictions to a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\u00b65 The structure of the statutory framework authorizing sentences and parole restrictions and the statutory terminology pertaining thereto, however, undermine Gratzer\u2019s argument and evince the legislature\u2019s clear intent to enable courts to impose life sentences without the possibility of parole. Gratzer correctly points out that his \u201clife sentence\u201d carries a statutorily mandated restriction on parole during the first thirty years of his incarceration, \u00a7 46-23-201(l)(b), MCA (1981), as distinguished from the parole eligibility of prisoners serving \u201ctime sentence[s]\u201d (which is dictated by the duration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>sentence), \u00a7 46-23-201(l)(a), MCA (1981). Gratzer overlooks the essential fact that the statutory provisions delineating parole eligibility for prisoners serving both \u201ctime sentence[s],\u201d and \u201clife sentence[s],\u201d explicitly yield to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (1981), which allows a court to impose \u201cthe restriction that the defendant be ineligible for parole and participation in the supervised release program while serving his term.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-23-201(1), MCA (1981) (providing that the parole board shall release certain prisoners on parole, \u201cexcept ... persons serving sentences imposed under 46-18-202(2)\u201d). This explicit exception to parole eligibility applies equally to the ensuing statutory subsections governing time sentences, \u00a7 46-23-201(l)(a), MCA (1981), and life sentences, \u00a7 46-23-201(l)(b), MCA (1981). This statutory structure clearly reflects the legislature\u2019s intent to authorize a sentencing court to impose parole ineligibility on either a life sentence or a time sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\u00b66 This discernment of legislative intent is supported by the criminal code\u2019s repeated references to <em>term </em>sentences. \u201cTerm\u201d is used throughout the criminal code to refer to the duration of a sentence without any indication that it is meant to refer exclusively to determinate time sentences. <em>See, </em>e.g., \u00a7 46-23-103(4), MCA (1981), and \u00a7 46-23-1001(3), MCA (1981) (defining \u201cparole\u201d as \u201crelease to the community of a prisoner by the decision of the board prior to the expiration of his <em>term,\u201d </em>and thereby indicating that if a prisoner serving a life sentence may be released on parole, then his sentence is for a \u201cterm\u201d of life) (emphasis added); <em>see also, </em>\u00a7 46-23-216(2), MCA (1981), \u201cDuration of parole\u201d (mandating that \u201c[t]he period served on parole or conditional release shall be deemed service of the <em>term </em>of imprisonment, and ... the total time served may not exceed the maximum <em>term </em>or sentence,\u201d thereby implying that \u201cterm\u201d applies equally to determinate time sentences and to life sentences, or else there is no delineation of the duration of parole for prisoners serving life sentences) (emphasis added); \u00a7 45-2-101(21) MCA (1981), (defining \u201cfelony\u201d as \u201can offense in which the sentence imposed upon conviction is death or imprisonment in the state prison for any <em>term exceeding 1 year\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). The statutes defining parole and establishing its duration refer to the \u201cterm\u201d of a sentence. By use of this nomenclature, the legislature evidently intended to refer both to prisoners <em>serving </em>determinate time sentences and to prisoners serving life sentences. Otherwise, \u00a7 46-23-201(l)(b), MCA (1981) (establishing the parole eligibility of prisoners serving a life sentence), would be rendered null by exclusion of life sentences from the very definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>parole. We must interpret a statutory scheme so as to give meaning and effect to each provision, whenever possible. Section 1-2-101, MCA (2005). Thus, we interpret \u201ca sentence of imprisonment in the state prison for a term exceeding 1 year,\u201d in \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (1981), as referring to all felonies (this being the exact definition of \u201cfelony,\u201d \u00a7 45-2-101(21), MCA (1981)), including those punishable by alife sentence,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather than as a cryptic means of limiting the court\u2019s authority to restrict the parole eligibility of those prisoners serving life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"AbUq\">\u00b67  In addition to the structure of the statutory framework and the repeated use of \u201cterm\u201d in the criminal code to genetically refer to the duration of a sentence, common sense buttresses our interpretation of the statutory scheme. A life sentence could conceivably endure for a period of less than one year, but only if the prisoner dies within one year of being sentenced. Section 46-23-201(l)(b), MCA (1981), however, provides that a prisoner serving a fife sentence \u201cmay [not] be paroled until he has served 30 years, less the good time allowance provided for in 53-30-105.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 53-30-105(1), MCA (1981), a prisoner may accrue good time credits at a rate of fifteen days per month, at most. Consequently, a prisoner must serve <em>at least fifteen years </em>of a life sentence before first becoming eligible for parole. If a prisoner who has been sentenced to life imprisonment lives long enough to become eligible for parole, he has necessarily been committed to serve, and has in fact served, \u201ca sentence of imprisonment in the state prison for a term exceeding 1 year,\u201d and the sentencing court is therefore authorized to \u201cimpose the restriction that the defendant be ineligible for parole and participation in the supervised release program ....\u201d Section 46-18-202(2), MCA (1981). In light of the several foregoing reasons, the District Court did not exceed its sentencing authority nor violate Gratzer\u2019s constitutional rights when it sentenced Gratzer to a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">III. Dangerous Offender Designation</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">\u00b68 Having determined that the District Court did not violate Gratzer\u2019s constitutional rights when it sentenced him to life without parole, we can easily dispense with his claim that the court violated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>constitutional rights when it designated him a \u201cdangerous offender\u201d for all purposes. Gratzer argues that a dangerous offender designation cannot be applied to a life sentence and that the only legitimate purpose for designation as a dangerous offender is to affect a prisoner\u2019s parole eligibility. A prisoner serving a determinate time sentence becomes eligible for parole after serving one-half of his sentence, less good time allowances, while a prisoner who is designated as a non-dangerous offender becomes eligible for parole after serving only one-quarter of his sentence, less good time allowances. Section 46-23-201(l)(a), MCA (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b69  Ultimately, the District Court\u2019s designation of Gratzer as a \u201cdangerous offender\u201d has no effect on the length of time he must serve before becoming parole eligible. Irrespective of this designation, Gratzer\u2019s life sentence and ineligibility for parole preclude him from ever becoming eligible for parole. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not violate Gratzer\u2019s constitutional rights when it designated him as a \u201cdangerous offender\u201d for all purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">IV. Sentence Enhancement for the Use of a Weapon</p>\n<p id=\"A-s\">\u00b610 Gratzer argues that the District Court violated his constitutional rights when it sentenced him to a consecutive ten-year term for using a weapon in the commission of the homicide, absent a specific charge and a jury\u2019s finding of that fact beyond a reasonable doubt. His argument relies squarely on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>and on its progeny, <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), and <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S. Ct. 2428 (2002). Notwithstanding Gratzer\u2019s contention that his conviction did not become final until ninety days after the Ninth Circuit denied his petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus in January 2005, <em>see Gratzer v. Mahoney, </em>397 F.3d 686 (9th Cir. 2005), his conviction actually became final for purposes of collateral review when Gratzer\u2019s time for petitioning the United States Supreme Court for <em>direct review </em>expired, ninety days after this Court\u2019s 1984 affirmance of Gratzer\u2019s conviction on direct appeal, <em>see State v. Gratzer, </em>209 Mont. 308, 682 P.2d 141 (1984). <em>See Caspari v. Bohlen, </em>510 U.S. 383, 390, 114 S. Ct. 948,953 (1994) (\u201c[a] state conviction and sentence become final for purposes of retroactivity analysis when the availability of direct appeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely filed petition has been finally denied\u201d). Gratzer\u2019s conviction became final long before the Supreme Court decided <em>Apprendi, Blakely </em>or <em>Ring. </em>Consequently, our ability to consider his claim that relies on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>these decisions depends on whether they apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See State v. Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. 114, 125, 900 P.2d 260, 267 (1995) (\u201c[rjetroactivity is properly treated as a threshold question\u201d (quoting <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 300-01, 109 S. Ct. 1060, 1070 (1989))), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by Montana v. Egelhoff, </em>518 U.S. 37, 116 S. Ct. 2013 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u00b611 Gratzer does not argue that <em>Apprendi, Blakely </em>or <em>Ring </em>do apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. Instead, by his insistence that his conviction did not become final until after these decisions were rendered, Gratzer appears to concede that none of these cases would apply retroactively. If so, he has correctly interpreted the writing on the walls, as we now confirm that <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny do not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b612 Pursuant to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63. Here, the District Court, rather than the jury, found that Gratzer had used a weapon in committing deliberate homicide and therefore the court imposed a consecutive ten-year sentence enhancement. Clearly, the District Court\u2019s imposition of a consecutive ten-year sentence on top of a life sentence increased the penalty for Gratzer\u2019s crime precisely ten years beyond the prescribed statutory maximum sentence for deliberate homicide, rendering <em>Apprendi </em>potentially applicable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA (1981) (authorizing the court to impose sentences of death, life imprisonment or imprisonment for between ten and one hundred years on a person convicted of deliberate homicide). The dispositive question, however, is whether <em>Apprendi </em>should apply retroactively to Gratzer\u2019s collateral challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b613 This Court has adopted the <em>Teague </em>Court\u2019s two-part \u201cthreshold\u201d test for determining whether a procedural rule of constitutional law should be applied retroactively on collateral review. <em>See Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 126, 900 P.2d at 267 <em>{\u201c[Teague\u2019s] </em>view of retroactivity for cases on collateral review is binding upon this Court\u201d); <em>see also State v. Goebel, </em>2001 MT 155, \u00b6\u00b6 7-17, 306 Mont. 83, \u00b6\u00b6 7-17, 31 P.3d 340, \u00b6\u00b6 7-17, <em>abrogated on other grounds by Gundrum v. Mahoney, </em>2001 MT 246, \u00b6 13, 307 Mont. 96, \u00b6 13, 36 P.3d 890, \u00b6 13; <em>State v. Whitehorn, </em>2002 MT 54, \u00b6\u00b6 30-42,309 Mont. 63, \u00b6\u00b6 30-42, 50 P.3d 121, \u00b6\u00b6 30-42 (clarifying that the <em>Teague </em>test properly applies when determining whether to retroactively apply procedural rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>constitutional law, but does not apply to substantive rules of constitutional law). Under the plurality opinion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in <em>Teague, </em>new constitutional rules of criminal procedure do not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review unless: (1) the rule \u201cplaces \u2018certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe\u2019 or (2) the rule qualifies as a \u201cwatershed rule[] of criminal procedure.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 310-11, 109 S. Ct. at 1075-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\u00b614  The Supreme Court, applying <em>Teague, </em>has held <em>that Ring </em>does not apply retroactively. <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 </em>U.S. 348, 124 S. Ct. 2519 (2004). The Court\u2019s reasoning supports the conclusion that neither <em>Apprendi </em>nor <em>Blakely </em>would apply retroactively. The Court first concluded that <em>Ring, </em>and, by implication, <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>announced a procedural rule, insofar as they \u201cregulate only the <em>manner of determining </em>the defendant\u2019s culpability ....\u201d <em>Schriro, 542 </em>U.S. at 353, 124 S. Ct. at 2523. <em>Apprendi </em>simply allocates the fact-finding function to the jury and prescribes the appropriate standard of proof. As the Supreme Court observed with respect to a similar allocation in <em>Ring, </em>\u201c[rjules that allocate decisionmaking authority in this fashion are prototypical procedural rules ....\u201d <em>Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 353, 124 S. Ct. at 2523. <em>Apprendi </em>fails to satisfy the first <em>Teague </em>exception, as it announces a rule that does not inhibit the State\u2019s ability to substantively proscribe and punish a defendant for using a weapon in the commission of an offense, but merely establishes procedures that the State must follow in doing so. Pursuant to <em>Teague, </em>in order to apply retroactively, such procedural rules must constitute \u201c \u2018watershed rules of criminal procedure ... without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is <em>seriously </em>diminished.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 352, 124 S. Ct. at 2523 (quoting <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 311, 313, 109 S. Ct. at 1076, 1077). The Court concluded that it is \u201cimplausible that judicial fact-finding so <em>\u2018seriously </em>diminishe[s]\u2019 accuracy as to produce an \u201c \u2018impermissibly large risk\u2019 \u201d of injustice.\u201d <em>Schriro, 542 </em>U.S. at 356, 124 S. Ct. at 2525. The federal courts of appeals unanimously<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> agree that the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See U.S. v. Jenkins, </em>333 F.3d 151, 153-54 (3rd Cir. 2003) (declining to apply <em>Apprendi </em>retroactively, and citing similar decisions by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits); <em>see also Sepulveda v. U.S., </em>330 F.3d 55, 61 (1st Cir. 2003) (\u201ca decision ... by a judge (on the preponderance standard) rather than a jury (on the reasonable-doubt standard) is not the sort of error that necessarily undermines the fairness ... of judicial proceedings\u201d) (quotations omitted, ellipses in original); <em>Coleman v. U.S., </em>329 F.3d 77, 90 (2nd Cir. 2003). In light of the overwhelming weight of authority and the fact that neither Gratzer, his attorney, nor amicus for the Montana Association for Criminal Defense Lawyers presented this Court with an argument for applying <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny retroactively, we decline to part ways with our federal counterparts. Accordingly, we hold that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review in Montana courts and therefore conclude that the District Court did not violate Gratzer\u2019s constitutional rights when it imposed an additional ten years on Gratzer for his committing deliberate homicide with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b615 Each of Gratzer\u2019s three claims fails on the merits. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b616 IT IS ORDERED that Karl Eric Gratzer\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b617 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court give notice of this order by mail to counsel of record as well as to petitioner personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">DATED this 1st day of November, 2006.</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\"> Based on the wording of the sentencing statutes and parole eligibility statutes, Gratzer contends the court had no authority to restrict parole eligibility for a person serving a \u2018life\u201d sentence. Gratzer similarly argues that the sentencing statutes do not allow the court to impose a dangerous offender designation to someone serving a life sentence. Finally, Gratzer argues that the sentencing statutes are unconstitutional in that they allow a judge to impose a weapon enhancement absent a specific jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-5\"> Crimes that punish by the imposition of a life sentence are properly classified as felonies. A crime is classified as a misdemeanor if the sentence imposed is \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for any term of one year or less.\u201d Section 45-2-101(36), MCA (1981). A crime is classified as a felony if it is punished by death or imprisonment in the state prison for a term exceeding one year. Section 45-2-101(21), MCA (1981). Offenses that are punished by life sentences are not explicitly designated as either felonies or misdemeanors, but they are clearly more properly classified as felonies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-5\"> A maj ority of the Supreme Court subsequently adopted the test first pronounced by the plurality opinion, joined by only four Justices in <em>Teague. </em>See <em>Penry v.
