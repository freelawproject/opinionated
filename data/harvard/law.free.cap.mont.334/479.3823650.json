Diaz also alleges ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm the District Court and reject Diaz\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">\u00b62 We restate and address the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by excluding the testimony of Jonathan Comes At Night?</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">\u00b64 2. Did Diaz receive ineffective assistance of counsel due to counsel's failure to procure D. J. Matt\u2019s presence at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in denying Diaz\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b66 On the evening of June 8, 2003, a man entered the Starway Superette with a gun and ordered Calixto Joaquin, the owner and sole employee of the store, to open the cash register. The same man had been in the store about fifteen minutes earlier. Joaquin opened the register, and the man shot him in the head. Joaquin managed to remain conscious. Ryan McVey entered the store during the robbery, and the man ordered him to get down. Joaquin called 911 once the man left the store. Both Joaquin and McVey provided descriptions of the man. Joaquin described him as an approximately 25-year-old Native American male with short, dark hair and a stocky build. McVey described the man as pretty big, and thought he might be a Native American from Rocky Boy or Browning, in part because of his \u201creservation accent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b67 An evidence technician for the Great Falls Police Department found no usable fingerprints at the crime scene. He located some footprints outside the store, but only obtained impressions of poor quality. He found one .22 bullet casing and a hair near the cash register. None of this evidence was sent to the Montana State Crime Lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b68 The police pursued multiple leads in the weeks following the shooting. Several possible suspects emerged, including D. J. Matt. Jonathan Comes At Night stated that he heard Matt admit to the shooting, and Helen and Donald Comes At Night provided similar information. However, there were inconsistencies between these statements, and McVey said with certainty that Matt was not the shooter after seeing a photograph of Matt. Before the authorities either searched for Matt or showed his picture to Joaquin, who had moved to Florida, a new suspect, Diaz, emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b69 On July 18,2003, Tiffany Davies, Diaz\u2019s girlfriend, contacted law enforcement in Colorado. At a subsequent interview, Davies cried and appeared extremely scared. Davies related that she had asked Diaz about a gun she found in his duffle bag when he returned from Great Falls, where the two had previously resided. Diaz explained to her that he had robbed a convenience store while in Great Falls and shot the clerk in the top of the head after the clerk reached for a gun. Additionally, Janice Louis, Davies\u2019s mother, lived near Great Falls at the time, and Diaz visited her on June 6, 2003. During the visit, Diaz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>shot a gun in Louis\u2019s backyard for target practice and picked up the cartridges. The authorities inspected this location but found no evidence. Authorities sent a photographic lineup including Diaz to Florida, and Joaquin identified Diaz as the shooter. Authorities also showed such a lineup to McVey, who could not, with certainty, identify Diaz as the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b610 The State filed an information charging Diaz with attempted deliberate homicide and robbery on July 21, 2003. The District Court scheduled a jury trial to begin on October 20, 2003, but several delays occurred. The delay at issue on appeal arose on March 1, 2004, when the State filed a second motion to continue trial because of its inability to locate Davies after Diaz contacted her. The State had previously filed an amended information adding a count of solicitation to commit witness tampering on February 24, 2004. This delay lasted 91 days. Other delays occurred, and the trial was finally scheduled for October 4, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b611 Before trial, Diaz filed a motion to dismiss due to the violation of his right to a speedy trial, alleging that the State was responsible for the pivotal 91-day delay during which the State attempted to locate Davies. The State responded that the delay was due to Diaz\u2019s illegal contact with Davies. The District Court attributed the 91-day delay to Diaz, reasoning that \u201c[Diaz\u2019s] alleged misconduct directly caused an issue to be raised. The State should not be held responsible for periods of delay directly resulting from alleged actions of [Diaz].\u201d This left only 249 days attributable to the State, giving Diaz the burden to demonstrate prejudice. The District Court determined Diaz failed this burden and denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b612 On September 23, 2004, Diaz filed a motion to add Jonathan, Helen and Donald Comes At Night as witnesses at trial. The State filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude these three as witnesses, arguing that any testimony by them regarding an alleged confession by D. J. Matt would be hearsay under M. R. Evid. 804. The District Court initially deemed this issue moot, as it appeared that none of these three would be available to testify when trial began on October 4,2004. However, Diaz called Jonathan Comes At Night to testify on the last day of trial, and the State renewed its request that the District Court exclude his hearsay testimony. The District Court granted the State\u2019s request, determining that Diaz failed to prove either the unavailability of Matt or corroborating circumstances indicating the trustworthiness of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b613 Following a three-day trial, the jury found Diaz guilty of all three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>charges, and the District Court sentenced him to a total of 150 years in the Montana State Prison, without eligibility for parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts follow as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b614 The determination of the relevancy and admissibility of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and this Court will not overturn such determination absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Paoni, </em>2006 MT 26, \u00b6 13, 331 Mont. 86, \u00b6 13, 128 P.3d 1040, \u00b6 13 (citations omitted). A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact that this Court reviews <em>de novo. State v. Gallagher, </em>2005 MT 336, \u00b6 15, 330 Mont. 65, \u00b6 15, 125 P.3d 1141, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted). The right to a speedy trial involves a question of constitutional law, and this Court will review a district court\u2019s conclusion regarding such a question to determine whether it correctly interpreted the law. <em>State v. Stiffarm, </em>2003 MT 70, \u00b6 12, 314 Mont. 499, \u00b6 12, 67 P.3d 249, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b615 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by excluding the testimony of Jonathan Comes At Night?</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00b616 Diaz argues that the District Court erred in not allowing Comes At Night to testify that D. J. Matt confessed to the shooting of Joaquin. Diaz argues that Matt was unavailable pursuant to M. R. Evid. 804(a)(5) because his counsel attempted to locate Matt and was unable to do so. As support, Diaz notes that neither the Glacier County Attorney\u2019s Office nor the Pondera County Attorney's Office knew Matt\u2019s location, and the lead detective in the investigation failed to locate Matt.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">\u00b617 Diaz further argues that sufficient corroborating circumstances regarding Matt\u2019s confession existed to satisfy the trustworthiness requirement of M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3). These corroborating circumstances included that Matt was crying and very upset when he confessed to Jonathan, that Matt correctly identified the location of the store and the ethnicity of the victim as Chinese or Asian, that an FBI field agent in Browning informed the State of possible evidence tying Matt to the shooting, and that both Joaquin and McVey indicated that the shooter was a Native American.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">\u00b618 M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">(b) Hearsay exceptions. The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is <em>unavailable </em>as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>(3) Statement against interest. A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another or to make the declarant an object of hatred, ridicule, or disgrace, that a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the declarant believed it to be true. <em>A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b619 M. R. Evid. 804(a)(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">(a) Definition of unavailability. Unavailability as a witness includes situations in which the declarant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">(5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of the declarant\u2019s statement has been unable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b620  For a declarant to be considered unavailable under M. R. Evid. 804(a)(5), the proponent must be unable to procure attendance by \u201creasonable means.\u201d <em>See </em>Commission Comments to M. R. Evid. 804. More than a half-hearted effort is thus required. For example, this Court has held that subpoenaing an out-of-town witness the night before trial falls short of meeting the \u201creasonable means\u201d standard. <em>State v. Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. 341, 352-53, 950 P.2d 1383, 1390 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b621  As in <em>Widenhofer, </em>Diaz\u2019s counsel took insufficient steps to satisfy the \u201creasonable means\u201d standard. Counsel\u2019s only effort to locate Matt consisted of contacting the county attorney offices in Glacier and Pondera Counties. Diaz\u2019s counsel failed to take other available steps, such as contacting the Blackfeet Reservation, having a subpoena issued for Matt, or sending an investigator to attempt to find Matt. Also, we are not persuaded by the inability of the lead investigator to find Matt, since he abandoned this effort after Diaz emerged as a more likely suspect, and the burden of establishing the unavailability of a declarant resides with the proponent. <em>State v. Osborne, </em>1999 MT 149, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 54, \u00b6 21, 982 P.2d 1045, \u00b6 21 (citing <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 816, 110 S. Ct. 3139, 3147 (1990)). Given the failure of Diaz\u2019s counsel to utilize \u201creasonable means\u201d to locate Matt, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Diaz failed to prove the unavailability of Matt.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b622 Having affirmed the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Diaz failed to prove that Matt was unavailable, we need not discuss whether the corroborating circumstances provided by Diaz were sufficient to satisfy the trustworthiness requirement of M. R. Evid. 804(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b623 2. Did Diaz receive ineffective assistance of counsel due to counsel\u2019s failure to procure D. J. Matt\u2019s presence at trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b624 Diaz argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel because she failed to either procure Matt\u2019s presence at trial or make a showing of his unavailability. Diaz argues that the evidence against him was not overwhelming and that evidence of Matt\u2019s confession would have led to a not guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b625 A criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to effective assistance of counsel under both the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>See Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 23. The burden is on the defendant to prove that: (1) his counsel\u2019s representation was deficient and below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) his counsel\u2019s failure was prejudicial. <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064-65 (1984)). The defendant must establish prejudice showing a reasonable probability that the results of the proceedings would have been different but for the unprofessional conduct of counsel. <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068). This Court will dispose of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for lack of sufficient prejudice when possible to avoid unnecessarily grading counsels performance. <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>State v. Kearney, </em>2005 MT 171, \u00b6 20, 327 Mont. 485, \u00b6 20, 115 P.3d 214, \u00b6 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u00b626 Here, we are able to dispose of Diaz\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he was not sufficiently prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s inability to procure Matt\u2019s presence at trial. Despite the absence of Matt\u2019s testimony, Diaz\u2019s claim of prejudice fails because his counsel nevertheless succeeded in introducing the alleged confession at trial through the testimony of the State\u2019s lead investigator. During cross-examination of the lead investigator, Diaz\u2019s counsel asked why Matt was considered a strong suspect. In response, the lead investigator explained \u201cwe had information that he had been bragging about doing the robbery and shooting a man in the head.\u201d Later, during closing, Diaz\u2019s counsel reminded the jury: \u201c[W]e have that suspect up in Browning . . . that apparently confessed to this. Heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>testimony about that.... This is a confession. This is law enforcement gold, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d The jury, therefore, knew of the alleged confession and Diaz\u2019s counsel was able to argue, in closing, that the confession exonerated Diaz. Diaz actually benefited from Matt\u2019s absence since Matt was not subject to cross-examination and had no opportunity to invoke the Fifth Amendment or deny his alleged confession. Since Diaz suffered no prejudice, we hold that his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b627 3. Did the District Court err in denying Diaz\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b628 Diaz argues that the District Court erred in attributing to him the 91 days of delay for his alleged misconduct in contacting Davies. He argues that the delay is attributable to the State since it requested the continuance. He further contends that attributing this delay to him because of the alleged solicitation violated his rights to a presumption of innocence and due process, as well as his right to a speedy trial. The delay was unnecessary, according to Diaz, because the State could have filed a separate case against him regarding the solicitation charge. Finally, Diaz contends that, although the District Court erred in placing the burden of establishing prejudice on him, he nonetheless established prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u00b629 Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee the right to a speedy trial. <em>See Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 15. To determine whether a violation of this right occurred, this Court must consider \u201c(1) the length of the delay; (2) the reason for the delay; (3) the assertion of the right to a speedy trial by the defendant; and (4) the prejudice to the defense.\u201d <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, \u00b6 19, 290 Mont. 148, \u00b6 19, 965 P.2d 866, \u00b6 19 (citing <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2192 (1972)). Since no single factor is decisive, this Court employs the following balancing test: the \u201cgreater the degree of fault by the State in causing the delay, the less the delay or prejudice that need be shown. Where there is no fault on the part of the State for [the] delay, greater prejudice, and presumably greater delay, would have to be shown.\u201d <em>State v. Highpine, </em>2000 MT 368, \u00b6 14, 303 Mont. 422, \u00b6 14, 15 P.3d 938, \u00b6 14 (quoting Brace, \u00b6 53).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\u00b630 The State does not dispute that Diaz satisfied the first factor, length of delay, and the third factor, timely assertion of the right. As such, we need only consider the second factor, reason for the delay, and the fourth factor, prejudice to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">\u00b631 The reason for the delay, or, in other words, which party is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>responsible for the delay, effects the burden of proof concerning prejudice to the defense. If 275 or more days of delay are attributable to the State, \u201cthe burden should shift to the State to demonstrate that the defendant has not been prejudiced by the delay.\u201d <em>Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56). Here, if the 91 days of delay are attributed to Diaz, that leaves 249 days attributed to the State, which is less than the 275 days required to shift the burden to the State. On the other hand, if the 91 days are attributed to the State, that totals 340 days for the State. This is more than sufficient to shift the burden to the State to show that Diaz was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b632 Speedy trial delay will not be charged to the State when a material witness with \u201cvalid reason\u201d is not available. <em>State v. Tilly, </em>227 Mont. 138, 142, 737 P.2d 484, 487 (1987) (citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S. Ct. at 2192). In <em>Tilly, </em>we explained that a valid reason exists when a material witness is unavailable due to defendant\u2019s unlawful acts. <em>Tilly, </em>227 Mont. at 142, 737 P.2d at 487. The defendant in <em>Tilly </em>was accused of sexual intercourse without consent with his minor daughter. <em>Tilly, </em>227 Mont. at 139, 737 P.2d at 485. Prior to trial, the defendant wrote love letters to his daughter, in violation of a court order, and the State moved for a continuance due to the daughter\u2019s mental and physical illness which was caused in large part by the Defendant\u2019s unlawful acts. <em>Tilly, </em>227 Mont. at 140-41, 737 P.2d at 486-87. We found that the State produced a reasonable excuse and charged the defendant with the delay. <em>Tilly, </em>227 Mont. at 141-42, 737 P.2d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b633  Here, as with <em>Tilly, </em>the State\u2019s inability to locate Davies was attributable to Diaz\u2019s communication with the witness. Diaz had corresponded with both Davies and Lords, Davies\u2019s mother. At trial, Louis testified that the correspondence she received from Diaz indirectly told Davies not to testify. Louis also testified that Diaz wanted Davies to go to Mexico. In showing that Diaz unlawfully solicited Davies in an attempt to prevent her from testifying, we conclude that the State produced a \u201cvalid reason\u201d for the delay and thus the 91 days were attributable to Diaz. As such, only 249 days of delay were attributable to the State, and Diaz had the burden to show prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b634  A defendant can establish prejudice to the defense based on any of the following three factors: (1) pretrial incarceration; (2) anxiety and concern to the defendant; and (3) impairment of defense. <em>State v. Bowser, </em>2005 MT 279, \u00b6 13, 329 Mont. 218, \u00b6 13, 123 P.3d 230, \u00b6 13. Diaz argues that his pretrial incarceration denied him his rights under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Article II, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution (Inalienable Rights). Diaz failed to make this argument before the District Court, however, and we will not allow him to raise the issue for the first time on appeal, because it is fundamentally unfair to fault a district court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it never had the opportunity to consider. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2005 MT 318, \u00b6 13, 329 Mont. 497, \u00b6 13, 125 P.3d 1096, \u00b6 13. Diaz also argues that his incarceration prevented him from assisting in the preparation of his defense, but he fails to explain what assistance he could have but did not provide. Such a general allegation is insufficient to establish prejudice. <em>See Bowser, </em>\u00b6 23 (defendant\u2019s general allegations, with no evidence or citation to particular instances, insufficient to establish impairment of defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b635 Diaz, as evidence that he experienced anxiety and concern, asserts the same two arguments he advanced under pretrial incarceration: that his rights were denied and he was prevented from assisting his defense counsel. The contentions fail for the same reasons we stated above. Diaz also asserts that he suffered anxiety and concern because he was denied access to his friends and family. This Court has recognized that since a certain amount of anxiety and concern is inherent in a criminal charge, the focus must be on the anxiety which is <em>aggravated </em>as a result of the delay. <em>Highpine, </em>\u00b6 28. Diaz fails to show any denial of access to his friends and family beyond that inherent in being charged with a felony offense. Diaz further asserts anxiety and concern from his inability to seek employment, but a generalized inability to work because of pretrial incarceration is alone insufficient to prove prejudice. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 180, \u00b6 31, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6 31, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\u00b636  Diaz also argues that his defense was impaired because witness memories fade over fourteen months, but such a generalized claim of impairment of witnesses\u2019 memories is insufficient to rise to the level of prejudice. <em>Bowser, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\u00b637 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to exclude witness testimony and deny Diaz\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial. We also reject Diaz\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
