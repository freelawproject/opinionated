Thereafter, the Fourth Judicial District Court sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Garrymore challenges the parole restriction and urges us to vacate his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u00b63 (1) Does Garrymore\u2019s failure to object to the District Court\u2019s imposition of sentence preclude our review on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\u00b64 (2) Did the District Court\u2019s imposition of the parole eligibility restriction pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (2001), violate Garrymore\u2019s federal and state constitutional and statutory rights to jury trial and due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">\u00b65 After an incident on January 2, 2003, left nearly two-year-old Tylin Garrymore dead, the State charged her father, Appellant Jason Lucas Garrymore (Garrymore), with deliberate homicide in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA (2001). Garrymore pleaded not guilty to the charge on February 4, 2003, and the case proceeded to trial by jury. The jury convicted Garrymore of deliberate homicide on February 27, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">\u00b66 After completion of a pre-sentence report, Garrymore\u2019s case proceeded to sentencing on May 6, 2004. At the hearing, both Garrymore and the State presented evidence of Garrymore\u2019s past conduct and character, and each side argued for a different sentence. The State adopted the recommendation of Mr. Sonju, the probation/parole officer who had prepared the pre-sentence report. Relying on considerable evidence, Mr. Sonju concluded that Garrymore could not be rehabilitated, and recommended that Garrymore be given a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Conversely, Garrymore argued that he was never given an opportunity to properly rehabilitate, especially when his mental health issues were considered, and urged the court not to impose a parole eligibility restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">\u00b67 Notwithstanding Garrymore\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the District Court adjudged Garrymore a violent offender and sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The court provided the following basis for its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-11\">Now, this defendant has three convictions for domestic abuse and unlawful restraint. He was arrested on the same type of charges in Utah and California but moved out of their jurisdiction so the charges were dismissed. In addition, he was on probation when this offense was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Now, throughout the trial and these proceedings, contrary to the testimony, I have not seen any remorse from this defendant. And I\u2019m going to adopt some of Mr. Sonju\u2019s reasons as my reasons. Mr. Sonju, quite candidly, said, I have been looking for all mitigating factors in this case. What is most disturbing is that I have been unable to find any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-4\">Further, I agree with Mr. Sonju, especially after viewing the photographs, that I do not believe Tylin\u2019s death was caused by a tragic culmination of accidents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">Though he may not have actively planned this death, his behavior, sadistic or otherwise, certainly caused it. He has a record of being mean and abusive to women.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-6\">As a result of his delay, the child died a violent, slow, painful death. She could have been taken to the hospital and possibly saved. He talked the mother out of that, and it appears that he would rather save his own neck from child abuse charges than save his two-year-old adopted daughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-7\">Finally, in our society, and I think we all realize it, even total strangers rush to assist a child in distress. But you, her adoptive father, chose to abuse and, from the pictures, torture this little girl and let her die.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-8\">So it\u2019s now the judgment of this Court that you be sentenced to <em>life imprisonment in the Montana State Prison without eligibility for parole.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">(Emphasis added.) Garrymore did not object to the sentence at the time of its pronouncement by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\u00b68 Garrymore appeals, asserting that the District Court imposed the parole eligibility restriction in violation of his federal and state constitutional and statutory rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u00b69 We review criminal sentences that include at least one year of actual incarceration to determine whether they are legal. <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6 22, 320 Mont. 490, \u00b6 22, 87 P.3d 1017, \u00b6 22. \u201c[A] sentence is not illegal when it is within the parameters provided by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 11, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 11,983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 11 (quoting <em>State v. Gunderson, </em>282 Mont. 183, 187, 936 P.2d 804, 806, (1997) (overruled on other grounds)). We review questions of law de <em>novo. Wadsworth v. State, </em>275 Mont. 287, 298, 911 P.2d 1165, 1171 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\n<em>Issue 1: Does Garrymore\u2019s failure to object to the District Court\u2019s imposition of sentence preclude our review on appeal?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b610 Noting that \u201cthe defense did not assert a state or federal constitutional objection to the sentencing court\u2019s statutory authority to restrict parole,\u201d the State offers a brief argument that the merits of Garrymore\u2019s claim should not be reviewed on appeal. The State acknowledges the exception to the contemporaneous objection rule we adopted for sentencing purposes in <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979), but offers \u201cthree reasons why Lenihan jurisdiction should not be invoked.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b611 Initially, we observe that the State\u2019s \u201cthree reason\u201d argument is very brief and is not supported by reference to any case from our <em>Lenihan </em>jurisprudence, but, rather, by citations, without analysis, to a state civil case and a federal case addressing the exercise of plain error review, a separate doctrine not at issue herein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, a comprehensive response to the State\u2019s <em>Lenihan </em>arguments is not necessary. The <em>Lenihan </em>rule states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">It appears to be the better rule to allow an appellate court to review any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-8\"><em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">\u00b612 First, the State offers that <em>Lenihan </em>does not apply because \u201cneither party recommended a deferred or suspended sentence in this case.\u201d Although the <em>Lenihan </em>case involved the imposition of a deferred sentence, the rule we adopted therein was not limited to probationary sentences, and we have undertaken, pursuant to <em>Lenihan, </em>appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>review of sentences which had no deferred or suspended portions. <em>See State v. Honey, </em>2005 MT 107, \u00b6 35, 327 Mont. 49, \u00b6 35, 112 P.3d 983, \u00b6 35, and <em>State v. Stone, </em>2004 MT 151, \u00b6 45, 321 Mont. 489, \u00b6 45, 92 P.3d 1178, \u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b613 Secondly, noting that the parole ineligibility condition Garrymore challenges on appeal was raised during the sentencing hearing by the prosecution, the State contends that the <em>Lenihan </em>rule is inapplicable because an objection by Garrymore \u201cwould not have provoked judicial vindictiveness which <em>Lenihan </em>fears,\u201d and that Garrymore\u2019s appellate challenge is nothing more than an impermissible change of theories on appeal. Though judicial vindictiveness was a concern addressed in <em>Lenihan, </em>our holding therein was not limited to such circumstances, and we have since explained that the risk of judicial vindictiveness is only \u201cpart\u201d of the rationale underpinning the <em>Lenihan </em>rule. <em>See State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, \u00b6 9, 314 Mont. 291, \u00b6 9, 65 P.3d 559, \u00b6 9. Further, the general rule governing a change of theories on appeal necessarily presupposes that a \u201ctheory\u201d or argument was first advanced in the district court, a circumstance inherently inconsistent with <em>Lenihan, </em>which applies, in the sentencing context, when the defendant remains silent and offers no argument in the district court, and, thus, is an exception to the general rule. More importantly, however, it would ultimately undermine the efficacy of the sentencing process to reject appellate review of sentences where the defendant objected in the district court and changed his theory on appeal, yet allow appellate review of sentences where no objection is made, thereby creating an institutional incentive for defendants to remain silent during sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b614 Thirdly, the State contends that Garrymore\u2019s sentence \u201cwas not, as Garrymore now contends, unconstitutional.\u201d We presume from this statement the State means that, because of the State\u2019s confidence in the constitutionality of the sentence, Garrymore\u2019s sentence cannot be \u201cillegal\u201d for purposes of applying the <em>Lenihan </em>rule. However, the <em>Lenihan </em>rule allows \u201can appellate court to review\u201d certain sentences, on their substantive merits, which are \u201calleged\u201d to be illegal, <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000, and is not limited to those appeals in which the defendant prevails on the merits. Rather, the <em>Lenihan </em>rule is a procedural mechanism whereby appellate review of certain allegedly illegal sentences, which would be procedurally barred for lack of objection, may nonetheless be obtained. After undertaking appellate review of the sentence by way of the <em>Lenihan </em>rule, the Court then takes up the merits. <em>See State v. Vernes, </em>2006 MT 32, \u00b6\u00b6 26-30, 331 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Mont. 129, \u00b6\u00b6 26-30, 130 P.3d 169, \u00b6\u00b6 26-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b615 Lastly, the State suggests that, because Garrymore\u2019s sentence is within statutory parameters, we \u201cshould refrain from invoking <em>Lenihan </em>to address a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 46-18-202(2),\u201d citing only to <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S. Ct. 1781 (2002), which addressed plain error review, which, we again note, is a separate doctrine. The State offers no analysis from our <em>Lenihan </em>jurisprudence in support of its \u201cstatutory parameters\u201d argument or why <em>Lenihan </em>should not apply to Garrymore\u2019s particular constitutional challenge. Therefore, we decline to address the issue further.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore undertake appellate review of the sentencing issue raised herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>Issue 2: Did the District Court\u2019s imposition of the parole eligibility restriction pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (2001), violate Garrymore\u2019s federal and state constitutional and statutory rights to jury trial and due process?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b616 Convicted of deliberate homicide pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA, Garrymore received a life sentence without the possibility of parole from the District Court. On appeal, Garrymore argues that the District Court\u2019s imposition of the parole eligibility restriction was unconstitutional. Specifically, he argues that the parole eligibility restriction constitutes a sentence enhancement which was based on facts not found by a jury. Accordingly, Garrymore argues that the imposition of the parole eligibility restriction by the District Court violated his rights to trial by jury and due process guaranteed by both the Montana and United States Constitutions, as well as commensurate state statutory rights provided by \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\n<em>Federal Constitutional Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u00b617 Garrymore\u2019s federal constitutional claim is predicated on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), a case which focused on the interplay between sentence enhancement statutes, a sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>judge\u2019s discretion, and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny have impacted sentencing statutes, sentencing guidelines, and criminal sentences throughout the country, and according to Garrymore, lead to the inexorable conclusion that the District Court unconstitutionally imposed the parole eligibility restriction upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\u00b618 In <em>Apprendi, </em>a defendant pled guilty in New Jersey state court to three offenses, one of which was possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 469-70, 120 S. Ct. at 2352. Classified as a second-degree offense by New Jersey law, possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose carried a penalty range of five to ten years. After a plea hearing at which the trial judge heard sufficient evidence to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt on all three offenses, the court accepted the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b619 However, the defendant in <em>Apprendi </em>did not receive a sentence between five and ten years, as authorized for second degree offenses in New Jersey. Rather, pursuant to a New Jersey hate crime enhancement statute, the trial judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant was motivated by racial bias, and as such, imposed an additional two years of incarceration. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 471, 120 S. Ct. at 2352.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b620 On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, holding \u201cit is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2363. The Court formulated the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-8\"><em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63. Applying the rule to the facts in <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court determined that New Jersey\u2019s sentencing scheme was unconstitutional, because factfinding by the sentencing judge, not the jury, under the hate crime statute had increased the maximum punishment to which the defendant was exposed. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 497, 120 S. Ct. at 2366-67. Therefore, the statutory scheme constituted a \u201cdeparture from the jury tradition that is an indispensable part of our criminal justice system\u201d and violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 497, 120 S. Ct. at 2366.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">\u00b621 Though <em>Apprendi </em>demonstrated the Sixth Amendment\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>application to the sentencing process, an issue of practical importance remained; namely, what did \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d mean for the purposes of Apprendi\u2019s requirement that \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed <em>statutory maximum </em>must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d? <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63. This question was critical because any judicially imposed sentence which exceeded \u201cthe prescribed statutory maximum\u201d was violative of a defendant\u2019s rights under <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b622 Accordingly, the Supreme Court provided further clarification in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S. Ct. 2428 (2002), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004). In <em>Ring, </em>the Court considered Arizona\u2019s capital sentencing statutes, which provided that a death sentence could not be imposed unless, following a sentencing hearing conducted by the trial judge, one aggravating circumstance was found by the judge. <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 597, 122 S. Ct. at 2437. In <em>Blakely, </em>the Court considered Washington\u2019s determinate sentencing scheme, which provided a mandatory sentencing range for Blakely\u2019s crime, and authorized a judge to impose a sentence above the range if he found \u201ccompelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 299, 124 S. Ct. at 2535. In concluding that these sentencing statutes violated the holding in <em>Apprendi, </em>the Court explained that, \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303, 124 S. Ct. at 2537. In other words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">[T]he relevant \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV\"><em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303-04, 124 S. Ct. at 2537. A subtle distinction thus emerged: the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is not the maximum possible sentence authorized by statute, but, rather, the maximum sentence for which a defendant is eligible \u201con the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303, 124 S. Ct. at 2537.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b623 Garrymore compares his cause to that of the defendant in <em>Apprendi. </em>Specifically, Garrymore characterizes the parole eligibility restriction as a sentence enhancement, and asserts that the parole eligibility restriction increased his penalty beyond the statutory maximum authorized by the jury verdict. Accordingly, we take up the Montana statutes at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AiW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00b624 Conviction of the offense of deliberate homicide, \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA, is punishable as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-4\">(2) A person convicted of the offense of deliberate homicide shall be punished by death as provided in 46-18-301 through 46-18-310, unless the person is less than 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense, by life imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of not less than 10 years or more than 100 years, except as provided in 46-18-219 and 46-18-222.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Section 45-5-102(2), MCA. Because the State did not seek the death penalty, and since neither \u00a7 46-18-219, MCA, nor \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, is applicable to Garrymore\u2019s case, the maximum sentence which could have been imposed upon Garrymore pursuant to the language of the statute was \u201clife imprisonment.\u201d However, Garrymore argues that the parole eligibility restriction, although plainly authorized by another statute (\u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA), operates to allow the imposition of a sentence which improperly exceeds the range authorized by \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA. He argues that the \u201clife sentences\u201d authorized by \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA, contain a presumption of parole eligibility which can be overcome only by additional factfinding pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, and that because such factfinding was not reflected by the jury\u2019s verdict, but was conducted by the sentencing judge, the parole eligibility restriction violates the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b625 Section 46-18-202(2), MCA, which authorizes restrictions on parole eligibility, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">Whenever the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of imprisonment in a state prison for a term exceeding 1 year, the sentencing judge may also impose the restriction that the offender is ineligible for parole and participation in the supervised release program while serving that term. If the restriction is to be imposed, the sentencing judge shall state the reasons for it in writing. If the sentencing judge finds that the restriction is necessary for the protection of society, the judge shall impose the restriction as part of the sentence and the judgment must contain a statement of the reasons for the restriction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">It is clear from the language of the statute that a sentencing judge, when imposing a prison term exceeding one year, <em>may </em>also impose a parole eligibility restriction in the judge\u2019s sole discretion. This provision evidences a legislative intent to authorize, but not require, sentencing judges to restrict parole whenever they impose prison terms exceeding one year. Accordingly, it is evident that the parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>eligibility restriction imposed upon Garrymore fell within the statutory range for his offense. Indeed, we held in <em>Cavanaugh v. Crist, </em>189 Mont. 274, 278, 615 P.2d 890, 893 (1980), that \u201c[\u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA] does not permit district judges to add any time beyond the statutory maximum for the underlying offense,\u201d thus establishing that the restriction falls within the statutory range of punishments for offenses exceeding one year in the state prison. However, <em>Cavanaugh </em>did not address the subtle distinction later advanced by <em>Ring </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>and discussed above: whether Garrymore was eligible to receive imposition of the parole eligibility restriction under \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, based upon the facts reflected in the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b626 It is for this reason Garrymore\u2019s assertion that \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA, contains an implicit \u201cpresumption of parole eligibility\u201d is critical to his argument. He seeks to demonstrate that under the penalty statute, standing alone and without the operation of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, he was entitled to a parole-eligible sentence (subject to the requirements of the parole statute, \u00a7 46-23-201, MCA), which was then taken away from him by the sentencing judge. However, we reject Garrymore\u2019s argument that such a presumption exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b627  We find no indicia in the sentencing statutes of a legislative intent to create a presumption in favor of parole eligibility which must be overcome in order for a sentencing judge to impose a parole restriction. The broad grant of discretionary authority-clearly indicated by the term \u201cmay also impose\u201d-given to sentencing judges under \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, to impose parole eligibility restrictions on the enormous class of sentences which exceed a one-year term of imprisonment bebes such an assertion. With regard to these sentences, no limitation has been placed upon the exercise of this grant of authority by the legislature. Thus, a parole-eligible sentence was not taken away from Garrymore because he was not entitled to such a sentence to begin with. There is no implicit presumption of parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b628 Of course, we acknowledge that a parole eligibihty restriction must be accompanied by reasons stated in writing pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA. We disagree, however, with Garrymore\u2019s contention that the implicit fact-finding embodied within \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, places the restriction beyond the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for the purposes of <em>Apprendi. </em>We initially note that the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that \u201cevery fact with a bearing on sentencing must be found by a jury . . . .\u201d <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 248, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 1226 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u00b629 As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005), though the exercise of a judge\u2019s discretion often necessitates findings of fact to support a particular sentence, a defendant does not necessarily have a right to have those facts found by a jury in all instances. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233, 125 S. Ct. at 750; <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 309, 124 S. Ct. at 2540. Instead, where it is conferred by a legislature, a judge can exercise \u201cbroad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233, 125 S. Ct. at 750. Thus, while a judge may not find facts which, once found, increase the defendant\u2019s exposure to punishment, a judge may find facts to support the exercise of discretion in imposing a sentence which falls within the statutory maximum. As explained in <em>Blakely:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">[T]he Sixth Amendment by its terms is not a limitation on judicial power, but a reservation of jury power. It limits judicial power only to the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on the province of the jury. Indeterminate sentencing does not do so. It increases judicial discretion, to be sure, but not at the expense of the jury\u2019s traditional function of finding the facts essential to lawful imposition of the penalty. Of course indeterminate schemes involve judicial factfinding, in that a judge (like a parole board) may implicitly rule on those facts he deems important to the exercise of his sentencing discretion. But the facts do not pertain to whether the defendant has a legal <em>right </em>to a lesser sentence-and that makes all the difference insofar as judicial impingement upon the traditional role of the jury is concerned. In a system that says the judge may punish burglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail. In a system that punishes burglary with a 10-year sentence, with another 30 added for use of a gun, the burglar who enters a home unarmed is <em>entitled </em>to no more than a 10-year sentence-and by reason of the Sixth Amendment the facts bearing upon that entitlement must be found by a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\"><em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 308-09, 124 S. Ct. at 2540.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b630 Applying this reasoning to Garrymore\u2019s sentence demonstrates his argument is without merit. First, as noted above, a plain reading of the statutes evidences the legislature\u2019s intent to make life imprisonment without the possibility of parole an authorized sentence for deliberate homicide. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102(2) and 46-18-202(2), MCA. Second, although \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, requires written reasons to support imposition of parole eligibility restriction, those reasons need not go beyond those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>facts found by the jury. Indeed, the factfinding requirement embodied in \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, simply requires a judge to support his discretion with reasons, but does not tie the parole eligibility restriction to any particular facts or findings whatsoever. Instead, under the plain language of the statute, it is entirely possible for a judge to restrict parole based solely upon facts found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b631 Further, imposition of a parole restriction is not necessarily improper merely because the sentencing judge finds facts, to aid in the exercise of his discretion, not found by the jury. Here, the sentencing judge noted Garrymore\u2019s prior convictions and his lack of remorse among the factors he considered in pronouncing sentence. Of course, as noted above, a prior conviction is a specific exception to the <em>Apprendi </em>rule, but, critical to this discussion, lack of remorse is an example of a fact \u201cimportant to the exercise\u201d of the sentencing discretion which does not \u201cpertain to whether the defendant has a legal right to a lesser sentence ....\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 309, 124 S. Ct. at 2540. In other words, finding a \u201clack of remorse\u201d does not trigger the imposition of the parole restriction under the statutes nor endue the District Court with additional statutory authority to impose the restriction. Imposition of the restriction remains within the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion and a part of indeterminate sentencing. Thus, the \u201clack of remorse\u201d finding was merely one which the sentencing judge found useful in guiding the exercise of his discretion, along with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b632  Under <em>Blakely, </em>this sort of indeterminate sentencing scheme-i.e., leaving parole eligibility restrictions to the discretion of sentencing judges-is constitutional. Accordingly, and because \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, does not remove from the jury a determination of facts necessary to restrict parole, we conclude that the statutory maximum punishment for the crime of deliberate homicide when the death penalty is not sought, for the purposes of <em>Apprendi, </em>is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b633 Faced with an almost identical issue, the Arizona Supreme Court came to the same conclusion. In <em>State v. Fell, </em>115 P.3d 594, \u00b6\u00b6 8-19 (Ariz. 2005), the defendant argued, based <em>on Apprendi, </em>that a statutory sentencing scheme surrounding a deliberate homicide statute created a presumptive sentence of life with the possibility of parole, in part because the statute authorizing parole restrictions called for findings of fact. <em>Fell, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 18. The court, however, rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, and held that (a) there was no presumption of parole eligibility for deliberate homicide, and (b) because the legislature had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>not required a sentencing court to find <em>specific facts </em>before restricting parole, the factfinding requirement did not increase the statutory maximum for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes. <em>Fell, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-18; <em>see also Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233, 125 S. Ct. at 750. As the court noted, \u201c[a] statutory requirement that a judge make findings ... does not mean that any specific finding is necessary for imposition of the sentence.\u201d <em>Fell, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"AN_\">\u00b634  Section 46-18-202(2), MCA, permits a sentencing judge to impose a parole eligibility restriction whenever the judge imposes a sentence that exceeds one year. Further, while a judge must state the reasons for the restriction if it is imposed, no particular finding of fact need be included among those reasons. For that reason, and because we conclude that the legislature intended the statutory maximum for \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA, to be life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, we conclude that the District Court restriction of Garrymore\u2019s parole eligibility did not violate Garrymore\u2019s federal constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\n<em>State Statutory Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b635 Mirroring his federal constitutional claim above, Garrymore argues that the District Court\u2019s restriction on his parole eligibility pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, violated his statutory rights under \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA (2001), a statute enacted in response to <em>Apprendi. </em>Again, we must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b636 Section 46-1-401, MCA (2001), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">(1) A court may not impose an incarceration penalty enhancement specified in Title 45, Title 46, or any other provision of law unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">(a) the enhancing act, omission, or fact was charged in the information, complaint, or indictment, with a reference to the statute or statutes containing the enhancing act, omission, or fact and the penalty for the enhancing act, omission, or fact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">(b) if the case was tried before a jury, the jury unanimously found in a separate finding that the enhancing act, omission, or fact occurred beyond a reasonable doubt; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-10\">(2) The enhancement issue may be submitted to a jury on a form separate from the verdict form or may be separately stated on the verdict form. The jury must be instructed that it is to reach a verdict on the offense charged in the information, complaint, or indictment before the jury can consider whether the enhancing act, omission, or fact occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>(3) An enhancing act, omission, or fact is an act, omission, or fact, whether stated in the statute defining the charged offense or stated in another statute, that is not included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense and that allows or requires a sentencing court to add to, as provided by statute, an incarceration period provided by statute for the charged offense or to impose the death penalty instead of a statutory incarceration period provided by statute for the charged offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Codifying <em>Apprendi, </em>\u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, essentially requires a jury determination of the facts necessary to impose an additional sentence pursuant to a sentence enhancement statute. Because we see no substantive distinction between the principles enunciated in <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny and this statutory rendering thereof, our disposition of Garrymore\u2019s claim under the statute is also the same as our disposition of his federal constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b637  As he did above, Garrymore argues that the application of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, \u201callowe[ed]\u201d or \u201crequire[ed]\u201d the District Court to add on to the sentence authorized by \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA. However, as mentioned previously, \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA, authorizes a district court to impose both life imprisonment and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Thus, \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, does not, vis-\u00e1-vis an \u201cact, omission, or fact,\u201d allow or require a sentencing court to increase punishment for a charged offense. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s sentence did not violate \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\n<em>State Constitutional Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b638 Finally, Garrymore argues that the District Court violated his rights under Article II, Sections 24 and 26, of the Montana Constitution when it restricted his parole eligibility pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA. Specifically, Garrymore argues that because the Montana Constitution is more protective of the right to jury trial than the United States Constitution, he should prevail on state constitutional grounds regardless of our disposition of his case under the federal constitution and <em>Apprendi. </em>Unfortunately, we find this argument too undeveloped to undertake a distinctive application of state constitutional principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b639  Garrymore correctly notes that we have interpreted Article II, Sections 24 and 26 of the Montana Constitution as affording a greater jury trial right than does the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>See Woirhaye v. Fourth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>1998 MT 320, 292 Mont. 185, 972 P.2d 800. However, Garrymore fails to offer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>compelling reason why the greater jury trial right in Montana dictates a different result in his case. Accordingly, we will not further consider the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b640 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-10\"> The State\u2019s use of the term <em>\u201cLenihan </em>jurisdiction\u201d echoes our own frequent misuse of the term. As a technical matter, a court cannot create its own jurisdiction. \u201cJurisdiction as applied to courts is the power or capacity <em>given by law </em>to a court to entertain, hear and determine the particular case or matter.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a v.

The <em>Lenihan </em>rule is a judicial creation whereby this Court accepts certain sentences for appellate review.

We recognize that terms such as <em>\u201cLenihan </em>jurisdiction\u201d are commonly used to refer generally to a body of law or jurisprudence, but the better practice is to avoid such uses so that clarity of the actual meaning of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d can be promoted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b27-11\"> <em>See State v.

Further development of this issue, and reconciliation of inconsistencies in these and other cases, may he necessary. However, neither of the parties has cited to any of these cases or offered such argument, and we thus deem it inappropriate to undertake such issues until they have been properly raised and briefed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b38-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b641 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on both issues. I write separately to caution criminal defense attomeys-public defenders, appellate public defenders and privately retained counsel-that I, at least, will expect more from them in future cases asserting <em>Lenihan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u00b642 As is apparent from the Court\u2019s discussion of the State\u2019s arguments about <em>Lenihan\u2019s </em>applicability, the application of that case is far from automatic. Not every sentence to which no objection is made at the time of sentencing may successfully be appealed under <em>Lenihan. </em>Thus, it is my view that the party asserting the <em>\u201cLenihan </em>exception\u201d bears the burden of establishing her or his entitlement to that exception. A mere reference and citation to <em>Lenihan </em>will not suffice in the future, at least for me.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u00b643 Here, in the standard of review section of Garrymore\u2019s opening brief, counsel merely cited to <em>Lenihan </em>and its progeny for the proposition that a \u201ccriminal sentence may be reviewed on appeal if it is alleged to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates.\u201d Counsel then stated, without analysis, that \u201c[a] failure to raise a contemporaneous objection to an illegal sentence at the time of hearing does not result in a waiver of the defendant\u2019s objection!,]\u201d and cited to four of our cases for that proposition. The problem with this approach is that we have other cases refusing to apply the <em>Lenihan </em>exception. It is my view that counsel must present more in the way of discussion and analysis regarding entitlement to the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\u00b644 When appellate counsel fails to do so, the result is a discussion such as that contained in our opinion here: the burden of establishing an appellant\u2019s entitlement to the <em>Lenihan </em>exception improperly shifts. Under this shift, the State becomes responsible for establishing why <em>Lenihan </em>does not-or should not-apply in a given case. While this has been our approach in the past, it is an approach I am unwilling to continue to follow. Therefore, I encourage criminal defense counsel to clearly establish entitlement to the exception in their opening brief, or risk a determination that-because they have not done so-they have not met their burden on appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b38-11\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b645 I concur in the result of the Court\u2019s Opinion; however, I do not agree with the lack of detail in the Court\u2019s reasoning. I therefore write separately to set forth an independent analysis of the important issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b646 In particular, with respect to Issue 1,1 agree with the Court that, notwithstanding Garrymore\u2019s failure to raise his sentencing claims in the first instance in the District Court, we nevertheless may reach the merits of those claims by way of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception to the timely objection rule. <em>See State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 343, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979). In arriving at this conclusion, I also agree with the Court\u2019s rejection of each of the State\u2019s \u201cthree reasons\u201d why <em>Lenihan </em>should not be available to Garrymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b647 I find it insufficient, however, to end the discussion there and not explain why Garrymore has, in fact, satisfied the requisites for invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>exception. Indeed, the Comb\u2019s truncated analysis implies that unless the State demonstrates in a given case that the <em>Lenihan </em>exception is <em>not </em>available, the appealing defendant may, by default, invoke it. This is not the case, as explained below, though the Court\u2019s treatment of Issue 1 could lead one to believe otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b648 Furthermore, we stated in <em>Lenihan </em>that \u201c[i]t appears to be the better rule to allow an appellate court to review any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. Yet, in the 27 years since adopting this exception, we have never defined \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates.\u201d Rather, we have simply allowed defendants to invoke the exception when it seemed right to do so \u2014 and vice versa. And in most of these cases, we provided little or no insight into our reasoning. The unfortunate result of our proceeding in this manner is, as the Court implies in footnote 3 of its Opinion, that our cases have not been consistent with respect to any one conceivable definition of \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates.\u201d Because these inconsistencies will only proliferate-and at an increasingly rapid pace<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 until we explicitly articulate the contours of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, I do not agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion in \u00b6 11 that a comprehensive response to the State\u2019s (and Garrymore\u2019s) <em>Lenihan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>arguments is \u201cnot necessary\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b649 To the contrary, it is necessary not only that we articulate the contours of <em>Lenihan, </em>but also that, for at least three reasons, the exception be crafted as narrowly as possible. First, in basic fairness to defendants, the practicing prosecution and defense bars, and the courts, our <em>Lenihan </em>rule must be clear, unambiguous, and predictable in its application. Second, as mentioned above, <em>Lenihan </em>is an exception to the timely objection rule, which is set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104(2) and -701(2), MCA. While this Court has the inherent power to protect the statutory and constitutional rights of criminal defendants, <em>see, e.g., State v. Finley, </em>276 Mont. 126, 132-38, 915 P.2d 208, 212-15 (1996), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, \u00b6 21, 19 P.3d 817, \u00b6 21, we are not privileged to simply ignore lawful statutory mandates in order to achieve a particular result for the sake of either palatability or expediency. Third, by not articulating a clear and narrow <em>Lenihan </em>rule, we are, implicitly, maintaining an approach that relies less on careful, comprehensive, record-based legal analysis and more on ad hoc decision-making, which serves neither the litigants nor the courts, not to mention the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b650 In assuming that we ultimately will develop a narrow and focused definition of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception on a case-by-case basis, prompted by and as a consequence of the Court\u2019s Opinion and this Special Concurrence, we are, in truth, to quote Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., \u201cspending] a great deal of. . . time shoveling smoke.\u201d Notably, we already have been presented with arguments to limit the exception\u2019s availability. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief of Respondent at 6-9, <em>State v. Ironmaker, </em>2005 MT 226N, 328 Mont. 522 (Table), 120 P.3d 811 (Table) (No. 04-610) (arguing that <em>\u201cLenihan </em>should be limited to facially invalid sentences which the lower court has no authority to impose\u201d); Brief of Respondent at 7-11, <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2005 MT 48, 326 Mont. 161, 108 P.3d 485 (No. 04-002) (suggesting that a defendant may not invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>exception where his sentence is within the range authorized by statute and he is not alleging that the statute is unconstitutional). Yet, we have chosen to ignore these arguments and persist in an ad hoc approach. Moreover, experience teaches that, not surprisingly, prosecutors and criminal defense attorneys each will argue whatever version of <em>Lenihan </em>in our existing jurisprudence best serves their particular theory in the given case. Unfortunately, as explained below, our present jurisprudential cafeteria offers up a precedent for nearly every theory. Thus, there simply is not the incentive the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>presumes for the practicing bar to seek a narrow and focused <em>Lenihan </em>rule. That obligation falls solely on this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b651 Indeed, it is our obligation to articulate the <em>Lenihan </em>exception as clearly as possible, and it is our responsibility to clean up our case law and, thereby, take some of the offerings off the steam table. I am convinced that the Court\u2019s unwillingness here to shoulder this obligation and to address forthrightly the complexities of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception in its present and unstructured state in our case law will simply encourage-rather than constrain-muddled, ad hoc, and unpredictable decision-making. Again, such an approach serves no one. \u00b652 For these reasons, I am proceeding beyond the Court\u2019s discussion under Issue 1 by providing a comprehensive analysis of the foundation for the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, addressing the inconsistencies in our jurisprudence, and articulating a narrow and concise <em>Lenihan </em>rule-specifically, the exception may be invoked only by a defendant who alleges a colorable claim that the sentencing court lacked statutory authority to impose the challenged sentence. I then explain, based on this articulation, why Garrymore may invoke <em>Lenihan </em>in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b653 With respect to Issue 2,1 agree with the Court that application of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (2001) (the parole eligibility statute) to Garrymore\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment was not unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (2000), and did not contravene \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA (2001). And I further agree that Garrymore did not adequately develop his claim under Article II, Sections 24 and 26, of the Montana Constitution. However, these issues are indisputably complex. And while the Court\u2019s discussion under Issue 2 supplies a measure of insight into our reasoning, I believe it is necessary and appropriate to explain in further detail, for the benefit of the parties, the practicing bar, and the lower courts, the intricacies of Apprendi\u2019s application to our parole eligibility statute. Accordingly, I am providing an independent analysis of Garrymore\u2019s Sixth Amendment and statutory claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">II. Issue 1: Does Garrymore\u2019s failure to object in the District Court to its imposition of the parole eligibility restriction preclude our considering his challenges thereto on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\u00b654 Garrymore did not object during the sentencing proceeding to the District Court\u2019s restricting his parole eligibility. Nor did he raise the constitutional and statutory issues he now pursues on appeal. He did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>suggest a lesser sentence of 40 years and argued against restricting his parole eligibility. Specifically, defense counsel recommended as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1K\">I believe it\u2019s appropriate for the Court to sentence Mr. Garrymore to a term of years, a specific term of years, and I would suggest the number 40.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\">... And we would urge upon you to give Mr. Garrymore the possibility of parole after whatever period of time this Court thinks is appropriate as a sentence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">However, a defendant\u2019s request at the sentencing hearing for a particular sentence does not constitute an objection to the sentence actually imposed. <em>State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 18, 906 P.2d 663, 667 (1995). Thus, we must determine, as a threshold matter, whether Garrymore\u2019s failure to object in the District Court to its imposition of the parole eligibility restriction on his life sentence precludes our considering his challenges thereto on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b655 Generally, this Court may not consider an issue to which a timely objection was not made in the district court. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104(2), - 701(2), MCA; <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 154, \u00b6 15, 41 P.3d 314, \u00b6 15. However, a longstanding exception to this rule exists in the context of sentencing. Specifically, as mentioned above, we held in <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979), that we will \u201creview any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection [was] made at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000; <em>see also Brister, </em>\u00b6 16.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The precise question at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>hand, therefore, is whether Garrymore may invoke this exception in order to have his otherwise procedurally barred challenge to his sentence heard on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">B. The State\u2019s Three <em>Lenihan </em>Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"ABL\">\u00b656 The State advances \u201cthree reasons\u201d why the <em>Lenihan </em>exception is not available to Garrymore in this case: (1) \u201cthe <em>Lenihan </em>rationale does not apply\u201d because \u201cneither party recommended a deferred or suspended sentence in this case\u201d and because \u201ca contemporaneous <em>Apprendi </em>objection would not have provoked the judicial vindictiveness that <em>Lenihan </em>fears\u201d; (2) \u201cappellants are not permitted to change theories on appeal\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe sentence Garrymore received was within statutory parameters and it was not... unconstitutional.\u201d As stated earlier, I agree with the Court\u2019s rejection of each of these assertions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">i. The State\u2019s First Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u00b657 As the Court states in \u00b6 12, it is not a prerequisite to invoking <em>Lenihan </em>that the sentence at issue be one that the sentencing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>deferred or suspended. The language of <em>Lenihan </em>does not carry such an implication. Rather, we stated that \u201c[i]t appears to be the better rule to allow an appellate court to review <em>any </em>sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000 (emphasis added). Accordingly, in <em>State v. Honey, </em>2005 MT 107, 327 Mont. 49, 112 P.3d 983, we concluded that Honey could invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, notwithstanding the fact that the district court had not suspended or deferred any portion of his sentence. <em>See Honey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-35. On numerous other occasions, we have queried whether, pursuant to <em>Lenihan, </em>we could review an appellant\u2019s challenge to a sentence which had been neither suspended nor deferred. <em>See Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 18-20, 906 P.2d at 667-68; <em>State v. Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. 479, 482, 918 P.2d 296, 298 (1996); <em>State v. Lafley, </em>1998 MT 21, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 287 Mont. 276, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27, 954 P.2d 1112, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27; <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15, 313 Mont. 358, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15, 61 P.3d 126, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 15; <em>State v. Legg, </em>2004 MT 26, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 60, 319 Mont. 362, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 60, 84 P.3d 648, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 60. And, in <em>State v. Stone, </em>2004 MT 151, 321 Mont. 489, 92 P.3d 1178, the State conceded, and we agreed, that the <em>Lenihan </em>exception applied to Stone, who had been given a non-deferred, non-suspended sentence. <em>See Stone, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 45,47. Thus, <em>Lenihan </em>is not limited to deferred and suspended sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u00b658 Likewise, the State\u2019s analogous suggestion that <em>Lenihan </em>applies only to cases in which there was a risk of judicial vindictiveness or retaliation at the sentencing hearing must be rejected as well. As we explained in <em>Lenihan, </em>this risk is of particular concern in the context of a deferred (and, for the same reasons, a suspended) sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">As a practical matter, [appellate review of the allegedly illegal sentence] may be a defendant\u2019s only hope in cases involving deferred imposition of sentence. If a defendant objects to one of the conditions, the sentencing judge could very well decide to forego the deferred sentence and send him to prison. To guard against this possibility, a defendant often times must remain silent even in the face of invalid conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\"><em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u00b659 Our acknowledgement of the risk of judicial vindictiveness or retaliation, however, was not meant as a limitation on the availability of <em>Lenihan </em>to situations in which such risk was present. To the contrary, in adopting the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, our primary reasoning was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">The sentencing authority of a court exists solely by virtue of a statutory grant of power and therefore cannot be exercised in any manner not specifically authorizedL]... Where, as in this case, it is alleged that a sentencing court has exceeded its statutory authority in imposing a specific sentence, an objection below is not a prerequisite to the challenging of the sentencing order alleged to be void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 342, 602 P.2d at 1000 (ellipsis in original, internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>State v. Braughton, </em>561 P.2d 1040, 1041 n.2 (Or.App. 1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\u00b660 Thus, our discussion of a defendant\u2019s incentive to remain silent in the face of an invalid condition placed on his deferred (or suspended) sentence was simply an <em>additional </em>rationale for our decision to allow particular sentencing challenges to be raised for the first time on appeal. Indeed, as the Court notes in \u00b6 13, we have characterized the risk of judicial vindictiveness as \u201cpart\u201d-not \u201call\u201d-of the rationale behind <em>Lenihan. See State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, \u00b6 9, 314 Mont. 291, \u00b6 9, 65 P.3d 559, \u00b6 9. And we have applied <em>Lenihan </em>in at least one situation where the defendant arguably had an incentive to speak up, not remain silent. <em>See Stone, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-47 (the court sentenced Stone to three years more than was statutorily authorized). Thus, <em>Lenihan </em>is not limited to cases in which there was a risk of judicial vindictiveness or retaliation at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">ii. The State\u2019s Second Argument</p>\n<p id=\"AE\">\u00b661 With respect to the State\u2019s contention that <em>Lenihan </em>should not be available to Garrymore because \u201cappellants are not permitted to change theories on appeal,\u201d the State is correct that, as a general rule, \u201c[a] party may not raise new arguments or change his legal theory on appeal,\u201d <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 39,320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 39,89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 39. However, underlying the State\u2019s argument is the premise that an objection <em>was made </em>to the particular sentencing term or condition that the appellant challenges on appeal and the appellant has since changed the legal theory advanced in support of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>objection. Yet, if an objection was in fact made to the particular sentencing term or condition, it would be unnecessary for the appellant to invoke <em>Lenihan, </em>as his claim would be properly preserved. The only question would be whether we must nevertheless refuse to consider it because the legal theory behind the objection has changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b662 We have long held that <em>\u201ca </em>party complaining of error must stand or fall upon the ground relied on in the trial court.\u201d <em>Bower v. Tebbs, </em>132 Mont. 146, 160, 314 P.2d 731, 739 (1957). The rationale underlying this rule is that it is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider. <em>See Day v. Payne, </em>280 Mont. 273, 276-77, 929 P.2d 864, 866 (1996); <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 17, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 17, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 17. But this is the same rationale underlying the timely objection rule, to which <em>Lenihan </em>is an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b663 Indeed, if a challenge to a sentence comes within the meaning of Lenihan\u2019s \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates\u201d concept, then it would be counterintuitive for us to refuse to consider that challenge on the ground that the appellant objected in the district court under one legal theory but now (on appeal) advances a different legal theory. Such a rule would reward appellants who made no objection whatsoever to the alleged sentencing error (and, thus, gave the sentencing court <em>no </em>opportunity to remedy the alleged error) and punish those who did object but then changed their legal theories. Moreover, as the Court aptly observes in \u00b6 13, this approach ultimately would create an institutional incentive for defendants not to object during sentencing and thereby undermine the efficacy of the sentencing process. Accordingly, the State\u2019s change-of-legal-theories argument must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">iii. The State\u2019s Third Argument</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">\u00b664 The State argues that \u201cthis Court should refrain from invoking <em>Lenihan </em>to address a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 46-18-202(2)\u201d because \u201cthe sentence Garrymore received was within statutory parameters and it was not... unconstitutional.\u201d Garrymore responds that \u201cthe Court cannot make this... determination without considering the substantive merits of the issue to begin with.\u201d In other words, Garrymore contends that since this Court will not reach the merits of a sentencing claim to which a timely objection was not made in the district court unless the <em>Lenihan </em>exception applies, application of <em>Lenihan </em>cannot depend on whether the defendant ultimately will prevail on his underlying claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b665 Garrymore is correct. To say that the <em>Lenihan </em>exception may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>invoked only when the contested sentence is <em>in fact </em>illegal or in excess of statutory mandates puts the proverbial cart before the horse. By virtue of the timely objection rule, we will not reach the merits and make that determination without first deciding that the defendant may invoke Lenihan. For this reason, <em>Lenihan </em>is more properly viewed as a \u201cgateway\u201d through which a defendant must pass in order to have his otherwise procedurally barred sentencing claim considered on the merits. As stated above, the question here is whether Garrymore may pass through this gateway. I now turn to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">C. Definition of the <em>Lenihan </em>Exception</p>\n<p id=\"A7U\">\u00b666 In <em>Lenihan, </em>we stated that an appellate court may review any sentence imposed in a criminal case if (1) it is \u201calleged\u201d (2) that such sentence is \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates.\u201dLenihan, 184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. Thus, a mere allegation is sufficient to pass through the <em>Lenihan </em>gateway.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b667 However, while this standard is minimal-requiring only an allegation-it is also specific. By \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates,\u201d we did not mean that the sentencing court simply imposed an objectionable sentence. Such an interpretation of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception would render the timely objection rule a practical nullity in the sentencing context. Rather, as discussed already, the basis for our adopting this exception to the timely objection rule in the sentencing context was the principle that a sentencing court\u2019s purported exercise of power not granted to it by law is subject to appellate review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Specifically, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">[t]he sentencing authority of a court exists solely by virtue of a statutory grant of power and therefore cannot be exercised in any manner not specifically authorized[.]... Where, as in this case, it is alleged that a sentencing court has exceeded its statutory authority in imposing a specific sentence, an objection below is not a prerequisite to the challenging of the sentencing order alleged to be void.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 342, 602 P.2d at 1000 (ellipsis in original, internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Braughton, </em>561 P.2d at 1041 n.2); <em>see also Commonwealth v. Lane, </em>345 A.2d 233, 234 n.5 (Pa.Super. 1975) (\u201c[A] sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum is not subject to waiver.\u201d), cited in <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 342, 602 P.2d at 1000; <em>State v. Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. 479, 482, 918 P.2d 296, 298 (1996) (explaining that the sentence in <em>Lenihan </em>was illegal or in excess of statutory mandates because the district court lacked the specific statutory authority to impose the sentence); <em>State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 19, 906 P.2d 663, 668 (1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b668 Thus, \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates\u201d reflects a narrow concern: whether the challenged sentence was statutorily authorized. Given this precise focus, only a defendant who alleges a colorable claim that his sentence was imposed in the absence of statutory authority may pass through the <em>Lenihan </em>gateway and have his otherwise procedurally barred sentencing claim considered on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">\u00b669 For instance, the defendant may allege that the sentencing court imposed a sentence that is outside the range provided by the relevant sentencing statute. <em>See, e.g., State v. Stone, </em>2004 MT 151, \u00b6 44, 321 Mont. 489, \u00b6 44, 92 P.3d 1178, \u00b6 44 (alleging that his five-year sentence exceeds the two-year maximum sentence authorized by the applicable statute). Or, the defendant may allege that the court imposed a sentence that is not authorized by any statute. <em>See, e.g., Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 339-40, 602 P.2d at 998 (alleging that the district judge did not have statutory authority to impose a condition on his sentence requiring him to reimburse the county for his appointed counsel\u2019s attorney fees); <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. 340, 345-46, 846 P.2d 1025, 1028-29 (1993) (alleging that the district court was without authority to impose a sentence of 210 days in jail, 180 of which would be served at the discretion of the supervising probation officer); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>v. Honey, </em>2005 MT 107, \u00b6 34, 327 Mont. 49, \u00b6 34, 112 P.3d 983, \u00b6 34 (alleging that the district court was without authority to impose a restitution obligation).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b670 Our decision in <em>State v. Nelson, </em>274 Mont. 11, 906 P.2d 663 (1995), illustrates this narrow focus on statutory authority. In <em>Nelson, </em>the defendant argued on appeal that because he qualified as a nonviolent felony offender, Montana law required the sentencing court to consider alternatives to incarceration when sentencing him. However, he had not raised this issue in the district court; therefore, we stated, this Court would not review his sentencing challenge unless he could invoke <em>Lenihan. See Nelson, </em>274 Mont, at 17-18, 906 P.2d at 666-67.</p>\n<p id=\"Aan\">\u00b671 In addressing Lenihan\u2019s applicability, we first emphasized that \u201can appellate court may review any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is <em>illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, </em>even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 18, 906 P.2d at 667 <em>(citing Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000, and <em>Hatfield, </em>256 Mont, at 346, 846 P.2d at 1029). We then reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">Sections 46-18-201(11) and 46-18-225, MCA, do not preclude a court from sentencing a nonviolent felony offender to prison. . . . Although these statutes require consideration of alternatives to imprisonment, such consideration would not have necessarily changed the court\u2019s final sentence for Nelson. Nelson\u2019s sentence of ten years is not in excess of the maximum <em>statutorily authorized </em>by \u00a7 45-5-202(3), MCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">Sections 46-18-201(11) and 46-18-225, MCA, impose an affirmative duty upon the court to take certain matters into consideration in sentencing. If the court fails to abide by this requirement, the sentence is subject to challenge or objection. <em>That does not mean, however, that in the absence of an objection, the sentence is thereby illegal. </em>The District Court, after considering the criteria in \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, and stating its reasons why alternatives to imprisonment were not selected as required by \u00a7 46-18- 201(11), MCA, <em>could still have legally sentenced Nelson to ten years in prison. </em>Thus, Nelson\u2019s sentence does not come within the exception found in <em>Lenihan </em>and <em>Hatfield.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont, at 19-20, 906 P.2d at 668 (emphases added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQz\">\u00b672 As the foregoing reasoning in <em>Nelson </em>makes clear, an allegation that the sentencing court did not impose a <em>particular </em>sentence within the range <em>authorized </em>by the applicable punishment statutes is not the kind of error for which the <em>Lenihan </em>exception may be invoked. Nelson alleged that he might have been given an alternative to imprisonment had the district court abided by its \u201caffirmative duty\u201d; yet, his sentence of ten years was authorized by \u00a7 45-5-202(3), MCA. Thus, his allegation, in substance, was that the court erred in its determination of which sentence <em>within the statutorily authorized range </em>was appropriate for Nelson, not that it imposed a sentence for which there was no statutory authority. For this reason, he could not invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>exception. <em>See also Swoboda, </em>276 Mont. at 482, 918 P.2d at 298 (reaching the same conclusion concerning Swoboda\u2019s allegation); <em>State v. Goulet, </em>277 Mont. 308, 312, 921 P.2d 1245, 1247 (1996) (same).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">D. Further Clarification of the <em>Lenihan </em>Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b673 Our applications of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception over the past 27 years have, for the most part, conformed with the foregoing principles; however, there have been a number of cases in which we diverged from the original meaning of \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates.\u201d As discussed earlier, these inconsistencies in our jurisprudence have rendered our precedents irreconcilable with any one conceivable definition of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception. Thus, for the sake of clarity and uniformity in this and future cases, it is necessary to revisit some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>our precedents and resolve the inconsistencies, which I group below into three lines of cases. As a preliminary matter, however, I pause to explain why doing so at this juncture is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">i. The Necessity and Appropriateness of Resolving Inconsistencies in our <em>Lenihan </em>Jurisprudence at this Juncture</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">\u00b674 At present, anyone attempting to ascertain the meaning of Lenihan\u2019s \u201cillegal or exceeds statutory mandates\u201d concept is doomed to failure due to the fact that, as just noted, we diverged in a number of cases from our original statutory authority approach and thereby created inconsistencies in our <em>Lenihan </em>jurisprudence (which are identified and analyzed in detail below). Notably, the uncertainty and confusion engendered by our seemingly arbitrary applications of <em>Lenihan </em>is evident from some of the arguments made to this Court over the years and has led to conflicting views over whether criminal defendants have been \u201cabusing\u201d the exception and whether it is broad or narrow.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b675 Tellingly, both arguments concerning Lenihan\u2019s scope are incorrect. The assertion that we have progressively narrowed the <em>Lenihan </em>exception over the years is belied by cases such as <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, 313 Mont. 358, 61 P.3d 126, and <em>State v. Legg, </em>2004 MT 26, 319 Mont. 362, 84 P.3d 648, which stand for the proposition that <em>any </em>alleged sentencing error may be reviewed on appeal (by way of <em>Lenihan) </em>if the error is simply framed as a \u201cdue process\u201d violation. <em>See McLeod, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16; <em>Legg, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 60. Conversely, the suggestion that we have made the <em>Lenihan </em>exception broad is belied by cases such as <em>State v. Lafley, </em>1998 MT 21, 287 Mont. 276, 954 P.2d 1112, and <em>Nelson, supra, </em>which stand for the proposition that any sentence falling within the parameters of a sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>statute-irrespective of the statute\u2019s constitutionality-does not qualify under <em>Lenihan </em>for our review. <em>See Lafley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-27; <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont, at 19-20, 906 P.2d at 668. Until we reconcile this case law, no one can reasonably predict whether the <em>Lenihan </em>exception will be available to a given defendant who failed to object to some aspect of his or her sentence in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b676 The Court states that \u201cneither of the parties has cited to any of these cases or offered such argument.\u201d Thus, the Court \u201cdeem[s] it inappropriate to undertake such issues until they have been properly raised and briefed.\u201d \u00b6 15 n.3. To be sure, neither the State nor Garrymore asserts in their briefs, \u201cThis Court\u2019s applications of <em>Lenihan </em>over the years have been confusing and unpredictable. Please clarify the exception! Here\u2019s how... .\u201d-a request that certainly would have been warranted. However, they do, in fact, cite an array of cases from our <em>Lenihan </em>jurisprudence, including Lenihan; <em>State v. Hatfield, </em>256 Mont. 340, 846 P.2d 1025 (1993); <em>State v. Brewer, </em>1999 MT 269, 296 Mont. 453, 989 P.2d 407; <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, 308 Mont. 154, 41 P.3d 314; <em>State v. Legg, </em>2004 MT 26, 319 Mont. 362, 84 P.3d 648; <em>State v. Stone, </em>2004 MT 151, 321 Mont. 489, 92 P.3d 1178; <em>State v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, 323 Mont. 287, 99 P.3d 661; <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, 309 Mont. 1, 43 P.3d 318; and <em>State v. Honey, </em>2005 MT 107, 327 Mont. 49, 112 P.3d 983. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9-10 (March 4, 2005); Brief of Respondent at 14-15 (May 20, 2005); Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 1-5 (June 6,2005). Even a cursory review of these precedents, in the context of the <em>Lenihan </em>issue presented by Garrymore, discloses glaring inconsistencies in our applications of the exception and consequent inequitable treatment of numerous defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b677 When faced with similar situations in the past, our approach has been to clear up the inconsistencies in our jurisprudence, even if the parties did not cite the conflicting cases and offer corresponding argument. For instance, in <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, 295 Mont. 288, 983 P.2d 937, we observed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">Although not put at issue by the parties, we note at the outset that there is a rather prevalent inconsistency in this Court\u2019s case law regarding the appropriate standard of review of criminal sentences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\"><em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 11. We therefore \u201c[took] [that] opportunity to clarify the proper standard.\u201d <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 13. After tracing back through our case law to the source of the confusion, <em>see Montoya, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14, we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEf\">[t]his Court reviews a criminal sentence only for legality .... To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the extent that <em>Davison, White, Gunderson, </em>and any other decisions from this Court suggest that we also review criminal sentences for an abuse of discretion, they are overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASR\"><em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 15.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b678 We have taken this approach in a number of other cases. <em>See In re Estate of Bradshaw, </em>2001 MT 92, \u00b6\u00b6 13-16, 305 Mont. 178, \u00b6\u00b6 13-16, 24 P.3d 211, \u00b6\u00b6 13-16 (identifying discrepancies in our applications of the five criteria for assessing undue influence and overruling nine cases that stood for the \u201cerroneous\u201d approach, although the parties had not raised and argued the \u201cmuddled\u201d nature of our precedents); <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6\u00b6 29-47, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6\u00b6 29-47, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6\u00b6 29-47 (resolving the \u201cinconsistency and confusion\u201d over the proper test to be applied in a harmless error analysis, although the parties had not identified this inconsistency and confusion and requested clarification); <em>Gliko v. Permann, </em>2006 MT 30, \u00b6\u00b6 15-24, 331 Mont. 112, \u00b6\u00b6 15-24, 130 P.3d 155, \u00b6\u00b6 15-24 (concluding that we \u201cmust\u201d resolve two inconsistent lines of authority pertaining to whether the existence of a special relationship giving rise to a fiduciary duty is a question of fact or a question of law, even though the parties had merely cited some of the inconsistent cases and not specifically argued the inconsistency issue); <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 21, 308 Mont. 154, \u00b6 21, 41 P.3d 314, \u00b6 21 (overruling three precedents-although neither of the parties had cited to any of these cases or offered such argument-to the extent they held that failure to raise a contemporaneous objection to an illegal sentence at the time of hearing results in a waiver of the defendant\u2019s objection).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b679 Notwithstanding, the Court, it seems, given its refusal in the case at hand to confront the inconsistencies in our <em>Lenihan </em>jurisprudence, would henceforth passively permit the continuation of a dichotomy in our case law until a party cites to the cases and specifically argues for a resolution. (Paradoxically, as noted earlier, there is an incentive for the parties <em>not </em>to request such resolution, since the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>conflicting parallel standards gives each side hope that we will employ the standard favorable to their position in the given case.) I do not believe that we should adopt such a limitation on our ability to clean up our own messes. To be sure, I do not dispute the principle that we do not address issues not presented to us or not properly briefed. However, this principle is not absolute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When, in the course of resolving a particular case, we become aware of inconsistent case law or parallel lines of authority standing for two irreconcilable standards, we have a duty to remedy the conflict if for no other reason than to ensure that similarly situated litigants are, in the particular case and thereafter, treated equally-which is the fundamental rationale on which the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b680 Accordingly, while it might be ideal to wait for the perfect case-complete with model briefing and an all-inclusive list of the cases which cite <em>Lenihan </em>and its progeny-in which to address and resolve our inconsistent applications of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, the vastly increased reliance on <em>Lenihan </em>in recent years (see \u00b6 48 n.l, <em>supra) </em>necessitates action on our part forthwith. And I cannot accept refraining from undertaking this issue now on the ground that the State\u2019s and Garrymore\u2019s briefing is inadequate, as such condition is largely due to the parties\u2019 misconceptions of <em>Lenihan </em>created by our own confusing applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b681 In this regard, the Chief Justice\u2019s Special Concurrence criticizes Garrymore for \u201cmerely cit[ing] to <em>Lenihan </em>and its progeny\u201d for the proposition that a criminal sentence may be reviewed on appeal if it is alleged to be illegal or in excess of statutory mandates and then \u201cstat[ing], without analysis,\u201d that a failure to raise a contemporaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>objection to an illegal sentence at the time of sentencing does not result in a waiver of the defendant\u2019s objection. \u00b6 43. Yet, while Garrymore\u2019s <em>Lenihan </em>discussion in his opening brief indeed leaves much to be desired (he later develops his <em>Lenihan </em>arguments in greater detail in his reply brief), the superficiality of his analysis, notably, mirrors our own in a number of cases. For instance, the full extent of our <em>Lenihan </em>discussion in <em>State v. Vernes, </em>2006 MT 32, 331 Mont. 129, 130 P.3d 169, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">Vernes also appeals from the portion of her sentence imposing restitution costs. Vernes failed to raise an objection at the time of sentencing, but this Court will consider an appeal from an alleged illegal sentence in a criminal case, even when the defendant did not raise a timely objection in the district court. <em>See State v. Lenihan </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-5\"><em>Vernes, </em>\u00b6 26. We then proceeded to set forth the relevant standard of review and address the merits of Vemes\u2019s claim. <em>See Vernes, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-30. Similarly, in <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>2005 MT 336, 330 Mont. 65, 125 P.3d 1141, we provided the following brief explanation for why Gallagher could invoke the exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">Gallagher now challenges his sentence on appeal, and, consistent with our rule in <em>State v. Lenihan </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997, we will review his challenge to the illegality of the sentence, despite no objection in the trial court. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000; <em>see also State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 16, 308 Mont. 154, \u00b6 16, 41 P.3d 314, \u00b6 16.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\"><em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 30. And in the case at hand, for that matter, the Court never explains why Garrymore\u2019s sentencing claims satisfy the requisites for invoking <em>Lenihan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u00b682 Thus, while the Chief Justice\u2019s admonition that \u201ccounsel must present more in the way of discussion and analysis regarding entitlement to the exception\u201d is well-taken, it is also precisely why we must articulate the contours of the <em>Lenihan </em>exception and resolve the inconsistencies in our case law <em>now. </em>Otherwise, we impose on counsel the hopeless task of deciphering-in the face of our superficial and conflicting applications <em>ofLenihan-why </em>the requisites for invoking the exception were satisfied in some cases and not in others, though the facts of the cases are materially indistinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">\u00b683 We have been presented with a variety of arguments by the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>and by criminal defendants in this case as well as in previous cases.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In my view, we have been sufficiently apprised of the issue and the competing interests. Therefore, while I might otherwise agree with the Court that \u201cit [is] inappropriate to undertake such issues until they have been properly raised and briefed,\u201d \u00b6 15 n.3,1 conclude that this is one of those rare instances in which we must undertake review of our case law to resolve inconsistencies therein, notwithstanding the parties\u2019 failure to brief this issue fully,</p>\n<p id=\"Ay1\">ii. The <em>Lafley </em>Line</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">\u00b684 In the first line of cases that is inconsistent with our statutory authority approach under <em>Lenihan, </em>we determined that the appellant\u2019s allegation did not satisfy the requisites for invoking the exception when, in fact, it did. In <em>State v. Lafley, </em>1998 MT 21, 287 Mont. 276, 954 P.2d 1112, Lafley had been convicted of felony assault and sentenced to ten years in the Montana State Prison plus two years for the use of a dangerous weapon. <em>Lafley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1, 17. On appeal, he claimed, inter alia, that the two-year sentence constituted double jeopardy and cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Lafley, </em>\u00b6 27. Lafley had not raised this claim in the district court; thus, he could not pursue it on appeal unless he could invoke <em>Lenihan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u00b685 We determined that Lafley was <em>\u201cnot </em>challenging the legality of the sentence.\u201d <em>Lafley, </em>\u00b6 27 (emphasis added). In reaching this conclusion, we first observed that \u201ca sentence is not illegal when it is within the parameters provided by statute.\u201d <em>Lafley, </em>\u00b6 26 (internal quotation marks omitted). We then explained that because \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, authorizes a court to sentence a person who uses a dangerous weapon in the commission of an offense \u201c \u2018to a term of imprisonment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>state prison of not less than 2 years or more than 10 years,\u2019 \u201d <em>Lafley, </em>\u00b6 27 (quoting \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA), and because Lafley was sentenced to two years imprisonment for the use of a weapon in the commission of the assault, the sentence imposed by the district court was within statutory parameters. Thus, we held that Lafley was barred from pursuing his claim on appeal. <em>Lafley, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b686 Yet, although our statement that \u201ca sentence is not illegal when it is within the parameters provided by statute\u201d was correct, it was also incomplete. It goes without saying that a legislature may not authorize a sentencing court to contravene state or federal constitutional provisions. Thus, while \u201c[t]he sentencing authority of a court exists solely by virtue of a statutory grant of power,\u201d <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 342, 602 P.2d at 1000 (internal quotation marks omitted), the granted power may not infringe constitutional rights. In other words, a sentencing court\u2019s authority to impose a particular sentence derives solely from <em>valid </em>sentencing statutes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b687 Accordingly, the fact that an appellant\u2019s sentence falls within the parameters provided by the relevant statute does not make <em>Lenihan </em>unavailable to him where his allegation is that the statute itself is invalid. A sentence is no less \u201cillegal\u201d because it conforms to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>mandates of an unconstitutional statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Hence, because Lafley challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, he was, in fact, challenging the sentencing court\u2019s statutory authority to impose the two-year sentence, as follows: the weapon enhancement statute cannot be applied to me without violating the constitutional proscriptions against double jeopardy and cruel and unusual punishment; thus, the statute is invalid as applied to me, and the sentencing court, therefore, lacked statutory authority to impose the two-year weapon enhancement upon my conviction of felony assault.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAv\">\u00b688 Relying on our reasoning in <em>Lafley, </em>the State argued in <em>State v. Brown, </em>1999 MT 31, 293 Mont. 268, 975 P.2d 321, that Brown\u2019s failure to raise his double jeopardy challenge to \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, in the district court precluded his reliance on <em>Lenihan </em>in this Court. <em>Brown, </em>\u00b6 8. Brown did not dispute the State\u2019s argument and instead urged us to consider his claim under the doctrine of plain error review, which we did. <em>See Brown, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-14. Yet, because Brown\u2019s sentencing challenge was identical to Lafley\u2019s (that the district court was without authority to apply the weapon enhancement statute on top of Brown\u2019s conviction of felony assault, <em>see Brown, </em>\u00b6 13), he met the requisites of <em>Lenihan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-3\">\u00b689 For these reasons, <em>Lafley </em>and <em>Brown </em>should be overruled to the extent they hold that <em>Lenihan </em>may not be invoked by an appellant who is challenging the validity of the statute under which he was sentenced. An allegation that a sentence falls within the range authorized by the sentencing statute, but that the statute is itself invalid and that the sentencing court, therefore, was without authority to impose the sentence, is sufficient to pass through the <em>Lenihan </em>gateway. (Indeed, the Court overrules <em>Lafley </em>and <em>Brown-aLbeit </em>implicitly-by deciding that Garrymore may invoke <em>Lenihan </em>to have his otherwise procedurally barred challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, considered on the merits.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>iii. The <em>McLeod </em>and <em>Legg </em>Line</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b690 We have also reached the mirror image result of <em>Lafley-in </em>other words, we determined that the appellant\u2019s allegation satisfied the requisites for invoking <em>Lenihan </em>when, in fact, it did not. In <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, 313 Mont. 358, 61 P.3d 126, the pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) on which the district court had relied in imposing sentence incorrectly stated that the conviction for which McLeod was being sentenced was his fifth felony, when it actually was his fourth. <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 9-10. Therefore, McLeod alleged on appeal \u201cthat his sentence is illegal because it was predicated on misinformation about his criminal history, thus violating his due process rights in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution.\u201d <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 16. McLeod had not raised this issue in the district court; thus, he was procedurally barred from raising it on appeal unless he could invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>exception.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b691 We concluded that McLeod could invoke <em>Lenihan, </em>since \u201c[he] challenges only the legal validity of the sentence.\u201d <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 15. Yet, McLeod had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment within the range statutorily authorized by \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, for the offense of criminal possession of dangerous drugs (he was given the maximum five-year sentence, <em>see McLeod, </em>\u00b6 11), and he was not challenging the legality of \u00a7 45-9-102. Therefore, his allegation, in substance, was analogous to Nelson\u2019s, <em>supra: </em>that he might have received a lesser sentence within the statutorily authorized range had the court not relied on misinformation in the PSI. As explained above, however, this is not an allegation of an \u201cillegal\u201d sentence for <em>Lenihan </em>purposes. Even if the court had been aware that the current conviction was McLeod\u2019s fourth (not fifth) felony, it still had authority to sentence him to five years in prison, <em>see McLeod, </em>\u00b6 26; thus, McLeod\u2019s failure to object at the time of sentencing should have precluded our consideration of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b692 The same is true of <em>State v. Legg, </em>2004 MT 26, 319 Mont. 362, 84 P.3d 648. Legg was sentenced to a fifty-year term in State prison with no part of the sentence suspended. <em>See Legg, </em>\u00b6 22. This was one-half the maximum allowed under law. <em>See Legg, </em>\u00b6 52. On appeal, he claimed, inter alia, that his sentence was in violation of due process because the district court had \u201cacted arbitrarily in imposing sentence because it failed to consider the mitigating factors referenced in [a psychological evaluation of Legg], or make a finding of aggravating circumstances.\u201d <em>Legg, </em>\u00b6 58. Legg had not challenged his sentence on this basis in the district court; nevertheless, we concluded that we could review the claim because Legg \u201chas challenged the legal validity of his sentence by alleging that it was issued without regard to the mitigating factors identified in [the] evaluation, thus violating his due process rights,\u201d <em>Legg, </em>\u00b6 60. This reasoning contravened our holding in <em>Nelson. </em>As in <em>McLeod, </em>Legg\u2019s claim was not that the court had imposed a sentence which it had no statutory authority to impose; rather, he claimed that the court had acted arbitrarily within the sentencing range authorized by the statute. As such, he should not have been permitted to invoke <em>Lenihan </em>to obtain our review of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b693 Therefore, <em>McLeod </em>and <em>Legg </em>also should be overruled in so far as they permit a defendant to invoke the <em>Lenihan </em>exception to obtain review of a sentence which the sentencing court had authority to impose pursuant to a concededly valid sentencing statute, but which (allegedly) was the result of an error in the <em>process </em>by which the sentence was selected within the statutorily authorized range. Otherwise, the <em>Lenihan </em>exception would swallow the timely objection rule by making appellate review of any allegedly incorrect sentence possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">iv. The <em>Mieklon </em>Line</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b694 The third line of cases that is inconsistent with our statutory authority approach under <em>Lenihan </em>began with <em>State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, 314 Mont. 291, 65 P.3d 559. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Mieklon pleaded guilty to felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute. The agreement provided that the State would dismiss the remaining counts of the information and recommend a ten-year suspended sentence and that Mieklon would pay a fine and surcharge totaling $55,000; however, the agreement did not specify a payment schedule. <em>See Mieklon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3-4. At sentencing, Mieklon requested that he be allowed to pay the $55,000 in five annual installments, while the State requested that he be required to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>entire amount within one year from the sentencing date. The district court agreed to Micklon\u2019s request, on the condition that interest accrue on the balance of the fine at a rate of ten percent per year. <em>See Micklon, </em>\u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b695 On appeal, Micklon contended \u201cthat the condition of his sentence requiring that interest accrue on the unpaid balance of his fine is illegal because no statutory authority exists for such a condition.\u201d <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 7. Micklon had not objected to this condition in the district court; however, as discussed above, his allegation that the district court was without statutory authority to impose the condition was sufficient for him to pass through the <em>Lenihan </em>gateway and have his challenge to the interest requirement considered on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b696 Nevertheless, we held that Micklon could not pursue his claim on appeal. In reaching this conclusion, we first observed that \u201c[p]art of the rationale\u201d behind the <em>Lenihan </em>exception \u201cis that, as a practical matter, \u2018a defendant often times must remain silent even in the face of invalid conditions\u2019 to guard against the possibility that the sentencing court may forego a more lenient sentence if the defendant objects to one of the conditions.\u201d <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 9 (quoting <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000). Micklon, however, had not remained silent during his sentencing. In response to the district court\u2019s asking him \u201cfor his thoughts about having interest accrue on the unpaid balance of his fine as an incentive to pay the fine in a shorter time period,\u201d Micklon had responded that \u201calthough it might create a greater financial burden on him, paying interest would be acceptable to him.\u201d <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10. Thus, we reasoned that he had \u201caffirmatively agreed to the inclusion of the interest condition in his sentence.\u201d <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10. We then cited the principle, long established in the non-sentencing context, that \u201c[w]e will not put a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated,\u201d <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 32, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6 32, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6 32),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and we concluded that Micklon, therefore, had \u201cwaived\u201d his right to appeal the allegedly illegal condition on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>suspended sentence, <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b697 Yet, although we recognized that a defendant often will refrain from objecting to what he believes is an invalid sentencing term or condition for fear of judicial vindictiveness or retaliation, our holding actually undermined this rationale. As explained in <em>Lenihan </em>and <em>Micklon, </em>when a defendant believes that objecting to an aspect of his sentence may cause the sentencing judge to forego a more lenient sentence, he often times must remain silent, even in the face of a condition of questionable legality. <em>See Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000; <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 9. Yet, doing so is not possible as a practical matter when, as in <em>Micklon, </em>the sentencing judge solicits the defendant\u2019s thoughts concerning the condition. At that point, the defendant could voice an objection to the condition, but he thereby would rim the risk that the judge will impose a harsher sentence (e.g., make Micklon pay the $55,000 amount within one year). Alternatively, he could remain silent or state that he has no thoughts and, accordingly, be deemed to have \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the condition. <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10. Lastly, he could \u201caffirmatively agreeD\u201d to or \u201cactively participate[]\u201d in the imposition of the condition, as we concluded Micklon had done. <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10. Irrespective of the option he chooses, however, the defendant\u2019s desire to avoid a harsher sentence still exists.</p>\n<p id=\"AW_N\">\u00b698 Accordingly, it does not inevitably follow from the fact that a defendant \u201caffirmatively agreed\u201d to or seemingly \u201cacquiesced\u201d in a condition on or a term of his sentence that the <em>Lenihan </em>exception is unavailable to him, our reasoning in <em>Micklon </em>notwithstanding. Given the choice to remain silent about having interest accrue on the unpaid balance of his fine, Micklon might well have done so (so as to avoid the harsher requirement of having to pay the $55,000 within one year). However, the applicability of <em>Lenihan </em>is not subject to such happenstance-namely, whether the sentencing judge happened to solicit the defendant\u2019s thoughts regarding the aspect of his sentence later challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b699 In addition, at a more fundamental level, Micklon\u2019s implication that a sentence is not \u201cillegal\u201d for <em>Lenihan </em>purposes if the defendant seemingly \u201cacquiesced or actively participated\u201d in its imposition is contrary to one of the most basic tenets of our judicial system. It is axiomatic that a sentencing court\u2019s power and authority are granted by the Legislature, not the defendant. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 41, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 41 (\u201cA district court\u2019s authority in sentencing a criminal defendant is defined and constrained by statute, and <em>the court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>specific statutory authority.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 342, 602 P.2d at 1000 (\u201cThe sentencing authority of a court exists <em>solely by virtue of a statutory grant of power </em>and therefore cannot be exercised in any maimer not specifically authorized.\u201d (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted)). A court does not gain, by virtue of a defendant\u2019s acquiescence or affirmative agreement, the power or authority to take a particular action that it does not otherwise have the power or authority to take.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Take, for example, an appeal by a defendant who, to evade imposition of a life sentence, bargained with the sentencing court and the prosecutor to serve two years in prison and have his left arm severed (a sentence for which there is no statutory authority), but then subsequently decided that he wanted to keep his arm. Surely his allegation that this sentence was not statutorily authorized is not nullified by the fact that he \u201cactively participated\u201d in its imposition. <em>Cf. Comer v. Schriro, </em>463 F.3d 934, 950, 2006 WL 2613669 at *9, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 23291 at *31 (9th Cir. 2006) (\u201c \u2018[T]he waiver concept was never intended as a means of allowing a criminal defendant to choose his own sentence.\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting Com. v. <em>McKenna, </em>383 A.2d 174, 181 (Pa. 1978))).</p>\n<p id=\"ADu\">\u00b6100 In a similar vein, it is important to recognize that the statutorily authorized punishment for a given crime represents the Legislature\u2019s judgment as to the appropriate range of penalties for that offense. An acquiescence or active participation rule would devalue this judgment and burden the community with costs that the Legislature has not deemed appropriate given the crime.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We should not be so quick to disregard these costs simply because the defendant and the sentencing court have. <em>Lenihan </em>certainly does not stand for such an approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b6101 For the foregoing reasons, the suggestion in <em>Micklon, </em>in <em>State v.

Summation and Application</p>\n<p id=\"AOu\">\u00b6102 To summarize, we may review any criminal sentence that was imposed, allegedly, in the absence of statutory authority, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s failure to object at the time of sentencing. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 342, 602 P.2d at 1000 (\u201cWhere . . . it is alleged that a sentencing court has exceeded its statutory authority in imposing a specific sentence, an objection below is not a prerequisite to the challenging of the sentencing order alleged to be void.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, the <em>Lenihan </em>exception to the timely objection rule is properly invoked by a defendant who alleges a colorable claim that the sentencing court lacked statutory authority to impose the challenged sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b6103 In this regard, I note that several types of colorable sentencing challenges, distilled from the discussion above, emerge from our <em>Lenihan </em>cases thus far: the measure of the sentence (duration of imprisonment, amount of fine, etc.) falls outside the range authorized by the applicable sentencing statute; a term of or a condition on the sentence was not authorized by any statute; the sentence falls within the range authorized by the applicable sentencing statute, but the sentencing statute is itself invalid, facially or as applied; and the sentencing court\u2019s authority to impose the sentence never arose because the court did not fulfill the statutory prerequisites to that authority. Such allegations reflect the principle that a sentencing court has no power to impose a criminal sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority, <em>Hicks, </em>\u00b6 41; <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 342, 602 P.2d at 1000, and an appellant may pass through the <em>Lenihan </em>gateway and have his otherwise procedurally barred sentencing claim reviewed on appeal if he alleges, with supporting analysis, that his sentence, or a portion thereof, is invalid for any of these reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b6104 By contrast, an allegation that the sentencing court failed to fulfill an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d or that it erroneously selected a particular term within the range authorized by a concededly valid sentencing statute <em>{see, e.g., </em>the discussions of <em>Nelson </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 70-72, <em>supra, </em>and <em>McLeod </em>and <em>Legg </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 90-93, <em>supra) </em>does not meet the requisites of <em>Lenihan. </em>If the sentence the defendant received is one that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>sentencing court still was authorized to impose had it not erred in the maimer alleged, then the sentence is not \u201cillegal\u201d for <em>Lenihan </em>purposes. <em>See Nelson, </em>274 Mont. at 20, 906 P.2d at 668.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7y\">\u00b6105 Lastly, it bears repeating that nothing in <em>Lenihan </em>is meant to preclude a timely appeal by a defendant who never had the opportunity to object at the time of sentencing in the first place. <em>See </em>\u00b6 90 n.16, <em>supra; McLeod, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-22; <em>State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33, 288 Mont. 286, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33, 957 P.2d 9, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33; \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b6106 Applying these principles to the case at hand, Garrymore may pass through the <em>Lenihan </em>gateway and have his otherwise procedurally barred challenges to his sentence reviewed on appeal. Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (2000), and its progeny, as well as Article II, Sections 24 and 26, of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA (2001), he claims that the District Court \u201cexceeded its authority when it imposed the parole eligibility restriction, and thus imposed an illegal and unconstitutional sentence.\u201d He further explains that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>[t]he district court imposed a sentence enhancement after making additional findings of fact on contested matters. Jason Garrymore had both a constitutional and a statutory right not to have the enhancement imposed unless it was charged in the Information, and proved to a jury by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The imposition of the parole restriction in this case constitutes an illegal sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Thus, while Garrymore acknowledges that he was sentenced within the ranges authorized by \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA (authorizing a sentence of life imprisonment) and \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (authorizing a sentencing court to restrict an offender\u2019s parole eligibility), he claims that this latter statute is invalid because it authorized the District Court-in contravention of the Sixth Amendment, Article II, Sections 24 and 26, and \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA-to restrict his eligibility for parole on the basis of facts not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, he alleges that the District Court lacked authority to impose this portion of his sentence because \u00a7 46-18-202(2) was, as applied to him, an \u25a0unconstitutional grant of power by the Legislature and, alternatively, because a sentencing court\u2019s application of \u00a7 46-18-202(2) is constrained by \u00a7 46-1-401. Such allegations constitute colorable claims that satisfy the requisites for invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>exception. We therefore may reach the merits of these claims, notwithstanding Garrymore\u2019s failure to raise them in the first instance in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">III. Issue 2: Did imposition of the parole eligibility restriction, because it was based on facts not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, violate Garrymore\u2019s federal and state constitutional and statutory rights to jury trial and due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">\u00b6107 Garrymore was convicted of violating \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA (2001).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This offense is punishable as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">A person convicted of the offense of deliberate homicide shall be punished by death as provided in 46-18-301 through 46-18-310, unless the person is less than 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense, by life imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison for a term of not less than 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>years or more than 100 years, except as provided in 46-18-219 and 46-18-222.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Section 45-5-102(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b6108 The State did not seek the death penalty in this case, and the exceptions listed in \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-219 and -222 are not at issue here. Thus, Garrymore\u2019s claims, in more specific terms, are as follows: that the maximum sentence authorized for the offense of which he was convicted is \u201clife imprisonment\u201d or \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for a term of not . . . more than 100 years\u201d; that both of these m\u00e1ximums contemplate the possibility of parole (which, as applied to Garrymore\u2019s sentence, requires that he serve at least 30 years, <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-23-201(3), MCA); that \u00a7 46-18-202(2) violates federal and state constitutional provisions to the extent it authorizes a sentencing judge to \u201cimpose the restriction that the offender is ineligible for parole\u201d on the basis of facts not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; that a sentencing judge is prohibited also by statute from restricting a prisoner\u2019s parole eligibility on the basis of facts not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and that the District Court, therefore, lacked authority to add the parole eligibility restriction to Garrymore\u2019s life sentence. As noted above, these claims are based on the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, as interpreted in Apprendi; Article II, Sections 24 and 26, of the Montana Constitution; and \u00a7 46-1-401. I begin with a discussion of Garrymore\u2019s federal claim under <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\"><em>A. </em>Federal Constitutional Claim</p>\n<p id=\"AuR\">\u00b6109 At issue in this case are two longstanding principles of criminal procedure: first, that upon a defendant\u2019s conviction for a charged offense, \u201cthe court must pronounce that judgment, which the law hath annexed to the <em>crime,\u201d Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 478-79, 120 S.Ct. at 2356 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 369-70 (1769)); and second, that \u201cthe prosecution must convince the trier of all the essential elements of guilt\u201d \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 478, 120 S.Ct. at 2356 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 361, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1071 (1970), in turn quoting C. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 321, at 681-82 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"Ai0\">\u00b6110 The Framers enshrined these fundamental guarantees in the Sixth Amendment, which ensures an accused the right to \u201ctrial, by an impartial jury,\u201d and in the Fourteenth Amendment, which proscribes any deprivation of liberty without \u201cdue process of law.\u201d <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 476-77, 120 S.Ct. at 2355. The Supreme Court has characterized the right of jury trial as \u201cno mere procedural formality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>but a fundamental reservation of power in our constitutional structure. Just as suffrage ensures the people\u2019s ultimate control in the legislative and executive branches, jury trial is meant to ensure their control in the judiciary.\u201d <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 305-06, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2538-39 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">fill As explained above, Garrymore alleges that the parole eligibility restriction on his sentence was imposed in violation of these constitutional protections. The starting point for analyzing this claim is the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi, </em>in which the Court addressed whether a factual determination authorizing an increase in the maximum possible prison sentence for an offense must be made by a jury on the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 469, 120 S.Ct. at 2351.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b6112 Apprendi was charged in a 23-count indictment with a number of shootings, as well as the unlawful possession of various weapons. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 469, 120 S.Ct. at 2352. Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty in New Jersey state court to three of the charged offenses, one of which was second-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose (Count 18). <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 469-70, 120 S.Ct. at 2352. Under New Jersey law, this offense carried a penalty range of 5 to 10 years; however, as part of the plea agreement, the State reserved the right to request the imposition of an enhanced sentence on the ground that Count 18 was committed with a biased purpose, and Apprendi, correspondingly, reserved the right to challenge the hate crime sentence enhancement as unconstitutional. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 470, 120 S.Ct. at 2352.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b6113 At the plea hearing, the trial judge heard sufficient evidence to establish Apprendi\u2019s guilt on all three counts. Thereafter, the prosecutor filed a motion for an extended term under the hate crime statute. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 470, 120 S.Ct. at 2352. At the evidentiary hearing on Apprendi\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d for the shooting on which Count 18 was based, Apprendi adduced evidence that he was not in any way biased against African-Americans. Nevertheless, the judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Apprendi\u2019s actions were taken \u201c \u2018with a purpose to intimidate\u2019 \u201d and that the crime \u201c \u2018was motivated by racial bias.\u2019 \u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 470-71, 120 S.Ct. at 2352. This finding had the effect of doubling the range of punishment for Count 18 to between 10 and 20 years. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 468-69, 120 S.Ct. at 2351. The judge then sentenced him to a 12-year term of imprisonment, which was 2 years greater than the maximum punishment authorized by the facts to which he had admitted guilt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 469, 471, 120 S.Ct. at 2351, 2352. (Apprendi was also sentenced to shorter concurrent sentences on the other two counts. Those sentences were not at issue on Apprendi\u2019s appeal before the Supreme Court. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 471, 474, 120 S.Ct. at 2352, 2354.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b6114 On appeal, the Supreme Court considered whether the foregoing procedures comported with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. At the outset of its analysis, the Court rejected the notion that this question could be answered by determining whether the finding that Apprendi\u2019s crime was motivated by racial bias and committed with a purpose to intimidate was an \u201celement\u201d of the offense or merely a sentencing \u201cfactor\u201d or \u201cenhancement.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">New Jersey threatened Apprendi with certain pains if he unlawfully possessed a weapon and with additional pains if he selected his victims with a purpose to intimidate them because of their race. As a matter of simple justice, it seems obvious that the procedural safeguards designed to protect Apprendi from unwarranted pains should apply equally to the two acts that New Jersey has singled out for punishment. Merely using the label \u201csentence enhancement\u201d to describe the latter surely does not provide a principled basis for treating them differently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aeb\"><em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 476, 120 S.Ct. at 2355; <em>see also Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 495-96, 120 S.Ct. at 2365-66 (\u201c[M]erely because the state legislature placed its hate crime sentence \u2018enhancer\u2019 \u2018within the sentencing provisions\u2019 of the criminal code \u2018does not mean that the finding of a biased purpose to intimidate is not an essential element of the offense.\u2019 . . . [T]he mere presence of this \u2018enhancement\u2019 in a sentencing statute does not define its character.\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AA5\">\u00b6115 The Court then examined the roles historically served by juries and judges in criminal proceedings and the measure of persuasion to which prosecutors were held. Among other things, the Court explained that in the late 18th century,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">\u201c[t]he substantive criminal law tended to be sanction-specific; it prescribed a particular sentence for each offense. The judge was meant simply to impose that sentence (unless he thought in the circumstances that the sentence was so inappropriate that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>should invoke the pardon process to commute it).\u201d As Blackstone, among many others, has made clear, \u201c[t]he judgment, though pronounced or awarded by the judges, is not their determination or sentence, but the determination and sentence of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aik\"><em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 479-80, 120 S.Ct. at 2357 (second alteration in original, citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b6116 The 19th century saw a shift in this country from statutes providing fixed-term sentences to those providing judges with discretion; however, such discretion was invariably \u201cbound by the range of sentencing options prescribed by the legislature.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 481, 120 S.Ct. at 2358. In other words, while it had become permissible for judges to take into consideration various factors relating both to the offense and the offender in imposing judgment, such discretion could only be exercised <em>\u201cwithin the range </em>prescribed by statute\u201d for that offense. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 481, 120 S.Ct. at 2358; <em>see also Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 482 n.9, 120 S.Ct. at 2358 n.9 (\u201c \u2018[I]f the law has given the court a discretion as to the punishment, it will look in pronouncing sentence into any evidence proper to influence a judicious magistrate to make it heavier or lighter, yet not to exceed the limits fixed for what of crime is within the allegation and the verdict.\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7 948 (9th ed. 1923))).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b6117 Thus, the Court observed, the historical evidence established that \u201cpunishment was, by law, tied to the offense\u201d and that American judges \u201cexercised sentencing discretion within a legally prescribed <em>range.\u201d Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 483 n.10, 120 S.Ct. at 2359 n.10. This evidence, in turn, pointed to \u201ca single, consistent conclusion: The judge\u2019s role in sentencing is constrained at its outer limits by the facts alleged in the indictment and found by the jury. Put simply, facts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition \u2018elements\u2019 of a separate legal offense.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 483 n.10, 120 S.Ct. at 2359 n.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b6118 The Court acknowledged the inconsistency between this historically mandated conclusion and the Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219 (1998). <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 487-90, 120 S.Ct. at 2361-62. In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Court held that the fact of recidivism, though it may increase the maximum penalty to which a defendant is exposed, need not be charged in an indictment or information. <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>523 U.S. at 243-47, 118 S.Ct. at 1230-33; <em>see also Jones v.

While this holding \u201crepresents at best an exceptional departure from the historic practice\u201d described <em>ahoye, Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 487, 120 S.Ct. at 2361, the Court found it unnecessary to revisit the precedent for purposes of deciding Apprendi\u2019s claim, since he had not contested the decision\u2019s validity, <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. at 2362. Instead, the Court distinguished <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>as \u201ca narrow exception to the general rule.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362.</p>\n<p id=\"Avq\">\u00b6119 Lastly, with respect to the burden necessary to prove the facts which expose an accused to a particular punishment, the Court reaffirmed the rationales undergirding the right to have the jury verdict based on proof \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">As we made clear in <em>Winship, </em>the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d requirement \u201chas [a] vital role in our criminal procedure for cogent reasons.\u201d Prosecution subjects the criminal defendant both to \u201cthe possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and... the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction.\u201d We thus require this, among other, procedural protections in order to \u201cprovid[e] concrete substance for the presumption of innocence,\u201d and to reduce the risk of imposing such deprivations erroneously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4A\"><em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. at 2359 (alterations and ellipsis in original, citations omitted) (quoting <em>Winship, 397 </em>U.S. at 363, 90 S.Ct. at 1072).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b6120 Hence, given the foregoing history of the jury trial right, the bounded discretion judges had in imposing sentences, and the heightened degree of persuasion required in criminal trials, the Court concluded that, except for the fact of recidivism, \u201cit is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2363 (alteration omitted). \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63; <em>see also Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 499, 120 S.Ct. at 2367 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201c[A]ll the facts which must exist in order to subject the defendant to a legally prescribed punishment <em>must </em>be found by the jury.\u201d). This inquiry \u201cis one not of form, but of effect-does the required finding expose the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury\u2019s guilty verdict?\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 494, 120 S.Ct. at 2365. For this reason, as stated earlier, the \u201celusive distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>between \u2018elements\u2019 and \u2018sentencing factors\u2019 \u201d is immaterial. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 494, 120 S.Ct. at 2365.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b6121 In light of this constitutional rule, the Court concluded that New Jersey\u2019s statutory scheme could not stand. Pursuant to that scheme, the trial judge in Apprendi\u2019s case had been allowed to impose a punishment greater than the maximum punishment authorized for the crime of unlawfully possessing a firearm, based on the judge\u2019s finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Apprendi\u2019s purpose for unlawfully possessing a firearm was to intimidate his victim on the basis of a particular characteristic the victim possessed. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 491, 120 S.Ct. at 2363. By \u201cremoving] the jury from the determination of a fact that, if found, exposes the criminal defendant to a penalty <em>exceeding </em>the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone,\u201d this scheme ignores \u201c[t]he historic link between verdict and judgment and the consistent limitation on judges\u2019 discretion to operate within the limits of the legal penalties provided.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 482-83, 120 S.Ct. at 2359.

The question to be answered is whether the restriction \u201cwithout possibility of parole\u201d exceeded this range.

By virtue of the word \u201cmay,\u201d it is clear that imposing a parole eligibility restriction is a sentencing option available to a sentencing judge to be exercised at his or her discretion whenever the sentence at issue exceeds one year. In other words, the restriction falls <em>within </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the legislature for offenses which, upon conviction, carry a sentence of imprisonment in a state prison for a term exceeding one year.

Under Arizona law, the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder was death, <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 592, 122 S.Ct. 2434; however, \u201cdeath\u201d was not the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes. This was so because upon a defendant\u2019s conviction of this offense, the trial judge was required to conduct a separate sentencing hearing \u201cbefore the court alone\u201d to determine \u201cthe existence or nonexistence of [certain enumerated] circumstances ... for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed.\u201d <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 592, 122 S.Ct. at 2434 (alteration and ellipsis in original, internal quotation marks omitted). Unless at least one aggravating circumstance was found <em>by the judge </em>to exist beyond a reasonable doubt, a death sentence could not legally be imposed. <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 597, 122 S.Ct. at 2437. In other words, \u201c[b]ased solely on the jury\u2019s verdict finding Ring guilty of first-degree felony murder, the maximum punishment he could have received was life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 597, 122 S.Ct. at 2437.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b6127 This scheme contradicted the holding <em>o\u00ed Apprendi. </em>\u201cIf a State makes an increase in a defendant\u2019s authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact-no matter how the State labels it-must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Ring, 536 U.S. at 602, 122 S.Ct. at 2439; <em>see also Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 610, 122 S.Ct. at 2444 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he fundamental meaning of the jury-trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is that all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishment that the defendant receives-whether the statute calls them elements of the offense, sentencing factors, or Mary Jane-must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). It did not matter that the maximum penalty for first-degree murder under Arizona law was death. \u201cThe Arizona first-degree murder statute \u2018authorizes a maximum penalty of death only in a formal sense,\u2019 for it explicitly cross-references the statutory provision requiring the finding of an aggravating circumstance [by the trial judge alone] before imposition of the death penalty.\u201d <em>Ring, </em>536 U.S. at 604, 122 S.Ct. at 2440 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u00b6128 In <em>Blakely, </em>the Court dealt with Washington\u2019s determinate sentencing scheme.

However, other provisions of state law mandated a \u201cstandard range\u201d sentence of 49 to 53 months for Blakely\u2019s offense. <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 299, 124 S.Ct. at 2535. A judge could impose a sentence above the standard range if he found \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 299, 124 S.Ct. at 2535 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[a] reason offered to justify an exceptional sentence [could] be considered only if it [took] into account factors <em>other than </em>those which [were] used in computing the standard range sentence for the offense.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 299, 124 S.Ct. at 2535 (first alteration in original, emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted). The trial court found that Blakely had acted with \u201cdeliberate cruelty\u201d in committing the kidnapping and imposed an exceptional sentence of 90 months, which was 37 months beyond the statutory maximum of the standard range. <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 300, 124 S.Ct. at 2535.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b6129 On appeal, the state argued that the 90-month sentence did not violate <em>Apprendi </em>\u201cbecause the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not 53 months, but the 10-year maximum for class B felonies.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303, 124 S.Ct. at 2537. The Court rejected this argument outright:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">Our precedents make clear ... that the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>In other words, the relevant \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings. When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts \u201cwhich the law makes essential to the punishment,\u201d and the judge exceeds his proper authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE0\"><em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303-04, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (citations omitted). Thus, the Court concluded, \u201c[t]he \u2018maximum sentence\u2019 is no more 10 years here than it was 20 years in <em>Apprendi </em>(because that is what the judge could have imposed upon finding a hate crime) or death in <em>Ring </em>(because that is what the judge could have imposed upon finding an aggravator).\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 304, 124 S.Ct. at 2538. A jury \u201ccould not function as circuitbreaker in the State\u2019s machinery of justice if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>were relegated to making a determination that the defendant at some point did something wrong, a mere preliminary to a judicial inquisition into the facts of the crime the State <em>actually </em>seeks to punish.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 306-07, 124 S.Ct. at 2539.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b6130 Thus, as <em>Ring </em>and <em>Blakely </em>make clear, the \u201cstatutory maximum\u201d for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is not the maximum <em>possible </em>sentence provided in the criminal code for a given offense. Rather, it is the maximum sentence the defendant may receive \u201con the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 303, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis omitted). For this reason, Garrymore\u2019s challenge cannot be answered simply by pointing out that \u00a7 45-5-102(2) authorizes a sentence of \u201clife imprisonment\u201d and \u00a7 46-18-202(2) permits a district judge to restrict parole eligibility. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>a <em>pre-Apprendi </em>case, did not answer the question clarified by <em>Ring </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>whether, in order to impose the \u201cwithout possibility of parole\u201d restriction pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), a district court first must find <em>additional </em>facts-i.e., facts not already admitted by the defendant or found by the jury and reflected in its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"ALp\">\u00b6131 In this regard, Garrymore argues that while the maximum sentence authorized <em>by the statute </em>may be \u201clife imprisonment\u201d or \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for a term of not... more than 100 years\u201d <em>without </em>the possibility of parole, the maximum sentence authorized <em>by the jury\u2019s verdict </em>in his case was \u201clife imprisonment\u201d or \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for a term of not... more than 100 years\u201d <em>with </em>the possibility of parole. Thus, \u201c[t]he verdict alone did not authorize the parole restriction imposed by the judge. That enhancement required additional findings of fact.\u201d He acknowledges that \u00a7 45-5-102(2) does not state explicitly whether or not the punishments set forth therein include eligibility for parole; however, \u00a7 46-23-201(1) provides that \u201cthe board [of pardons and parole] may release on nonmedical parole by appropriate order any person confined in a state prison, except... persons serving sentences imposed under 46-18-202(2) . . . , when in its opinion there is reasonable probability that the prisoner can be released without detriment to the prisoner or to the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b6132 Accordingly, Garrymore submits, a person convicted of deliberate homicide is eligible for parole (subject to the timing requirements of \u00a7 46-23-201(2)-(3)), <em>unless </em>that eligibility is restricted after further fact-finding under \u00a7 46-18-202(2). In other words, \u201c[a] \u2018life sentence\u2019 [does] not mean the offender\u2019s natural life.\u201d Rather, the terms \u201clife imprisonment\u201d and \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>term of not less than 10 years or more than 100 years\u201d include an implicit presumption of parole eligibility which may be overcome only upon additional, post-verdict findings of fact. Therefore, he maintains, \u201c[t]he effect of the [District Court\u2019s] post-verdict fact-finding... was to increase a sentence from 30 years\u2019 actual time before parole eligibility, to a literal life-time term of imprisonment.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b6133 Garrymore\u2019s interpretation of the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102(2), 46-23-201, and 46-18-202(2) is incorrect. To be sure, a prisoner is parole eligible pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-201 unless designated otherwise pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2) (or \u00a7 46-18-219, which is not at issue here). However, this scheme does not create the <em>Apprendi </em>violation Garrymore perceives. For one thing, the placement of \u00a7 46-23-201 in the Code does not support the conclusion that parole eligibility is a <em>presumption, </em>implicit in sentences imposed under \u00a7 45-5-102(2), that must be overcome through additional judicial fact-finding. Whereas \u00a7 46-18-202(2) appears in the \u201cSentence and Judgment\u201d chapter of Title 46, follows a provision outlining \u201c[sentences that may be imposed,\u201d and itself outlines \u201c[additional restrictions on sentences,\u201d \u00a7 46-23-201, by contrast, appears in a separate chapter of Title 46 concerning the granting of probation, parole, and clemency. In the absence of explicit language to the contrary, this organization suggests that the provision on granting nonmedical parole (\u00a7 46-23-201) yields to the provision on restricting an offender\u2019s parole eligibility (\u00a7 46-18-202(2)), not vice versa.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b6134 Furthermore, as discussed above, \u00a7 46-18-202(2) provides that \u201c[w]henever the sentencing judge imposes a sentence of imprisonment in a state prison for a term exceeding 1 year, the sentencing judge may also impose the restriction that the offender is ineligible for parole and participation in the supervised release program while serving that term.\u201d Such an unqualified grant of authority to the sentencing judge, conditioned only upon the term\u2019s exceeding one year, contradicts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>notion that there is a presumption of parole eligibility to be overcome. Indeed, if \u00a7 46-18-202(2) were setting forth the method for overcoming such a presumption, one would expect to see language to that effect-e.g., \u201cif the court finds \u2018X\u2019 then it may restrict parole eligibility notwithstanding 46-23-201.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b6135 To be sure, the second sentence of \u00a7 46-18-202(2) mandates that \u201c[i]f the restriction [that the offender is ineligible for parole and participation in the supervised release program while serving his term] is to be imposed, the sentencing judge shall state the reasons for it in writing.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Yet, while this provision, which imposes a specific requirement on a judge who restricts a defendant\u2019s parole eligibility, undoubtedly contemplates fact-finding on the part of the sentencing court in order to substantiate its imposition of the restriction, such a requirement does not necessarily place the resulting sentence beyond Apprendi\u2019s \u201cstatutory maximum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b6136 First, the Supreme Court has rejected the argument \u201cthat every fact with a bearing on sentencing must be found by a jury.\u201d <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 248, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1226 (1999). Indeed, the Court has \u201cnever doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence <em>within a statutory range.\u201d United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 233, 125 S.Ct. 738, 750 (2005) (emphasis added). The exercise of this discretion will often, if not invariably, necessitate implicit or explicit findings of fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>judge deems important or relevant in selecting a particular sentence. <em>See Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 309, 124 S.Ct. at 2540. However, \u201cthe defendant has no [Sixth Amendment] right to a jury determination of [these] facts.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233, 125 S.Ct. at 750. As the Court explained in <em>Blakely,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">the Sixth Amendment by its terms is not a limitation on judicial power, but a reservation of jury power. It limits judicial power only to the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on the province of the jury. Indeterminate sentencing does not do so. It increases judicial discretion, to be sure, but not at the expense of the jury\u2019s traditional function of finding the facts essential to lawful imposition of the penalty. Of course indeterminate schemes involve judicial factfinding, in that a judge (like a parole board) may implicitly rule on those facts he deems important to the exercise of his sentencing discretion. But the facts do not pertain to whether the defendant has a legal <em>right </em>to a lesser sentence-and that makes all the difference insofar as judicial impingement upon the traditional role of the jury is concerned. In a system that says the judge may punish burglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail. In a system that punishes burglary with a 10-year sentence, with another 30 added for use of a gun, the burglar who enters a home unarmed is <em>entitled </em>to no more than a 10-year sentence-and by reason of the Sixth Amendment the facts bearing upon that entitlement must be found by a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 308-09, 124 S.Ct. at 2540.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b6137 Second, the second sentence of \u00a7 46-18-202(2) does not mandate as a condition for imposing a parole eligibility restriction that the sentencing judge find a particular fact. Rather, it requires only that the judge \u201cstate the reasons for [imposing the restriction] in writing.\u201d Section 46-18-202(2), MCA. Washington\u2019s sentencing scheme, as it existed at the time of Blakely\u2019s sentencing, is useful for illustrating this crucial distinction. That scheme did not permit the sentencing judge to enhance Blakely\u2019s sentence on the basis of the facts already used in computing the standard range sentence-i.e., on the basis of the facts admitted in Blakely\u2019s guilty plea. Rather, \u201c \u2018[a] reason offered to justify an exceptional sentence can be considered only if it takes into account factors <em>other than </em>those which are used in computing the standard range sentence for the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 304, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (alteration in original, emphasis added). Thus, the judge <em>had </em>to find additional facts-facts not already admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>by Blakely-in order to impose the enhanced sentence. By contrast, pursuant to the first and second sentences of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), a sentencing judge\u2019s reasons for imposing a parole eligibility restriction may take into account facts reflected in the jury\u2019s verdict, as well as other facts not reflected in that verdict; but no particular finding is mandated before the restriction may be imposed.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXy\">\u00b6138 Construing a sentencing scheme similar in operation to \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102(2) and 46-18-202(2), the Arizona Supreme Court found no <em>Apprendi </em>violation. Under the statutory provision at issue in <em>State v. Fell, </em>115 P.3d 594 (Ariz. 2005), if the death penalty is not imposed for first-degree murder the only other possible sentences are life with the possibility of release after a specified period (\u201clife\u201d) or life with no possibility of eventual release (\u201cnatural life\u201d). <em>See Fell, </em>\u00b6 1. Although \u201cnothing in [the statutory provision] required that any specific fact be found before a natural life sentence could be imposed,\u201d the defendant nonetheless argued that \u201clife is the \u2018presumptive\u2019 sentence for first degree murder and that natural life is an \u2018aggravated\u2019 sentence.\u201d <em>Fell, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13. The court rejected this contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">The statute does not provide that a defendant \u201cshall\u201d receive life unless certain facts are found. To the contrary, the statute provides that \u201c[i]f the court imposes a life sentence, the court <em>may </em>order that the defendant not be released on any basis for the remainder of the defendant\u2019s natural life.\u201d A.R.S. \u00a7 13-703(A) (emphasis added). Had the legislature intended to require a specific finding be made before a natural life sentence could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>imposed, it surely would have said so specifically, as it did in the statutes governing sentencing for felonies other than first degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\">... In this area, the legislature has concluded that the trial court can appropriately exercise its discretion to determine whether future release is possible (although not assured) or whether the defendant must instead spend the rest of his or her life in prison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD\"><em>Fell, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b6139 This reasoning is equally applicable to \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102(2) and 46-18-202(2). As explained above, nothing in \u00a7 46-18-202(2) <em>requires </em>a district court to make a particular finding before it restricts a defendant\u2019s parole eligibility. The Montana Legislature did not make an increase in a defendant\u2019s punishment to exclude the possibility of parole \u201ccontingent on the finding of a fact,\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 231, 125 S.Ct. at 749 (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, \u00a7 46-18-202(2) permits the court to impose the restriction in its discretion: \u201cthe sentencing judge <em>may also </em>impose the restriction that the offender is ineligible for parole\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b6140 Garrymore cites a number of cases in his briefs and his notices of supplemental authority that reach a contrary result. These decisions, however, Eire distinguishable from the case at hand. <em>State v. Provost, </em>896 A.2d 55 (Vt. 2005), provides a typical example. In <em>Provost, </em>the statute at issue stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">The punishment for murder in the first degree shall be imprisonment for life Eind for a minimum term of 35 years <em>unless </em>the court finds that there are aggravating or mitigating factors which justify a different minimum term. If the court finds that the aggravating factors outweigh Einy mitigating factors, the minimum term may be longer than 35 years, up to and including life without parole. If the court finds that the mitigating factors outweigh any aggravating factors the minimum term may be set at less than 35 years but not less than 15 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-8\"><em>Provost, </em>\u00b6 14 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AN1\">\u00b6141 Interpreting this provision, the Vermont Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he maximum sentence the court may impose . . . without finding any facts in addition to the jury\u2019s verdict is fife imprisonment with a minimum term of thirty-five years.\u201d <em>Provost, </em>\u00b6 15. The court reasoned that the Vermont Legislature had intended \u201cto attach significance to the difference between minimum terms accompanying sentences of fife imprisonment.\u201d <em>Provost, </em>\u00b6 17. It is not surprising, therefore, that the court ultimately concluded that the statute \u201cviolates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>because it requires the sentencing court to weigh specific aggravating and mitigating factors not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt <em>before </em>imposing a sentence of life without parole.\u201d <em>Provost, </em>\u00b6 17 (emphasis added); <em>cf. State v.

Rather, the maximum sentence the jury\u2019s guilty verdict authorized the District Court to impose in this case was \u201clife imprisonment\u201d or \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for a term of not . . . more than 100 years,\u201d <em>without </em>the possibility of parole. For this reason, application of \u00a7 46-18-202(2) to Garrymore\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment was not unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny, and Garrymore\u2019s sentence, therefore, is not illegal under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">B. State Statutory Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b6143 The basis for Garrymore\u2019s state statutory claim is \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA (2001),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> which was enacted in response to <em>Apprendi. </em>It provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">(1) A court may not impose an incarceration penalty enhancement specified in Title 45, Title 46, or any other provision of law unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">(a) the enhancing act, omission, or fact was charged in the information, complaint, or indictment, with a reference to the statute or statutes containing the enhancing act, omission, or fact and the penalty for the enhancing act, omission, or fact; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">(b) if the case was tried before a jury, the jury unanimously found in a separate finding that the enhancing act, omission, or fact occurred beyond a reasonable doubt;...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>(3) An enhancing act, omission, or fact is an act, omission, or fact, whether stated in the statute defining the charged offense or stated in another statute, that is not included in the statutory definition of the elements of the charged offense and that allows or requires a sentencing court to add to, as provided by statute, an incarceration period provided by statute for the charged offense or to impose the death penalty instead of a statutory incarceration period provided by statute for the charged offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\">(4) Use of the fact of one or more prior convictions for the same type of offense or for one or more other types of offenses to enhance the incarceration penalty for a charged offense is not subject to the requirements of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Garrymore suggests that \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-202(2) and 46-1-401 conflict with each other to the extent that the former authorizes a sentencing judge to restrict an offender\u2019s parole eligibility based on facts not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; that \u00a7 46-1-401 prevails over \u00a7 46-18-202(2); and that the District Court, therefore, was without authority to impose the parole eligibility restriction on his sentence. (This argument is analogous to the scenario discussed above in \u00b6 86 n.13.)</p>\n<p id=\"A6D\">\u00b6144 Garrymore is incorrect. Sections 46-18-202(2) and 46-1-401 are not in conflict. Rather, \u00a7 46-1-401 merely codifies the mandates of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, as construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny. Thus, the disposition of Garrymore\u2019s claim based on this statute is identical to the disposition of his federal constitutional claim under Part III A. above. For the reasons just discussed, the District Court\u2019s stated reasons for imposing the parole eligibility restriction on Garrymore\u2019s sentence were not facts \u201cthat allow[ed] or require[d] [the] . . . court to add to, as provided by statute, an incarceration period provided by [\u00a7 45-5-102(2)] for [deliberate homicide],\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 46-1-401(3). To the contrary, the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on the charge of deliberate homicide authorized the District Court to impose a sentence of \u201clife imprisonment\u201d or \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for a term of not less than 10 years or more than 100 years,\u201d <em>without </em>the possibility of parole. Thus, Garrymore\u2019s sentence does not contravene \u00a7 46-1-401.</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">C. State Constitutional Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b6145 Lastly, Garrymore argues that his rights under Article II, Sections 24 and 26, of the Montana Constitution were violated when the District Court deemed him ineligible for parole under \u00a7 46-18-202(2) based on facts not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 24 guarantees an accused the right to \u201ctrial by an impartial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>jury,\u201d while Section 26 provides that \u201c[t]he right of trial by jury is secured to all and shall remain inviolate\u201d and that \u201c[i]n all criminal actions, the verdict shall be unanimous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b6146 Garrymore points out, correctly, that we have \u201crefused to \u2018march lock-step\u2019 with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of corresponding provisions in the federal constitution,\u201d particularly where, as in this case, \u201cthe language of the Montana Constitution setting forth the rights guaranteed is not identical to the language used in the federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Woirhaye v. Fourth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>1998 MT 320, \u00b6 14, 292 Mont. 185, \u00b6 14, 972 P.2d 800, \u00b6 14. Thus, in <em>Woirhaye, </em>we construed Sections 24 and 26 as affording a greater jury trial right than does the Sixth Amendment, and we invalidated former \u00a7 46-17-201(3) because it allowed a misdemeanor criminal defendant to exercise his right to a jury trial only once-either in justice court or in district court on trial de novo. <em>See Woirhaye, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 12-19, 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b6147 Yet, while we have interpreted some of our state constitutional provisions as providing more protection than do their federal counterparts, Garrymore has not explained, with respect to his specific sentence, why Sections 24 and 26 dictate a result contrary to the result reached above under <em>Apprendi. Woirhaye, </em>which applied the jury trial right in an entirely different context, does not afford an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b6148 As explained in detail above, pursuant to the first two sentences of \u00a7 46-18-202(2) a sentencing judge is authorized upon a conviction of deliberate homicide to restrict the defendant\u2019s parole eligibility without first having to find a particular fact. This scheme satisfies the dictates of the Sixth Amendment and <em>Apprendi; </em>whether it violates Sections 24 and 26, however, is not something we can address based on the undeveloped assertion that \u201cthe increased protection afforded criminal defendants under Montana\u2019s constitutional jury trial guarantees!] establishes] that the parole restriction imposed in this case violated Jason\u2019s rights, and is illegal.\u201d Accordingly, Garrymore is not entitled to relief on his state constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">\u00b6149 Although Garrymore did not object during the sentencing proceeding to the District Court\u2019s authority to impose the parole eligibility restriction on his life sentence, his allegation on appeal that the court lacked such authority (because \u00a7 46-18-202(2) is invalid on constitutional and statutory grounds) satisfies the requisites for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, meaning that he may obtain review of his allegedly illegal sentence, notwithstanding his failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahc\">\u00b6150 With respect to the merits of Garrymore\u2019s arguments under <em>Apprendi </em>and \u00a7 46-1-401, MCA, the maximum sentence the jury\u2019s verdict authorized the District Court to impose in this case was \u201clife imprisonment.\u201d or \u201cimprisonment in the state prison for a term of not . . . more than 100 years,\u201d <em>without </em>the possibility of parole. For this reason, the court had authority to impose the parole eligibility restriction, and Garrymore\u2019s sentence is not illegal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\"> <em>Lenihan </em>has been cited as an exception to the time objection rule in thirty cases since it was decided on November 21, 1979.

A court does not establish its own jurisdiction. Rather, \u201c[\u00a1jurisdiction as applied to courts is the power or capacity <em>given by law </em>to a court to entertain, hear and determine the particular case or matter.\u201d <em>State ex rel.

Rather, this Court\u2019s jurisdiction derives from Article VII, Section 2, of the Montana Constitution, which includes \u201cgeneral supervisory control over all other courts,\u201d and <em>Lenihan, </em>correspondingly, is a judicially-created exception to the timely objection rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b43-10\"> The State has also suggested, in previous cases, that we \u201ccabin\u201d the <em>Lenihan </em>exception, Brief of Respondent at 9, <em>State v.

However, the State recently retreated from this position and argued a more favorable view of <em>Lenihan. </em>Specifically, during oral arguments in <em>Gratzer v. Mahoney </em>(No. 05-075) on November 9,2005, in the context of discussing the remedies available <em>to </em>a prisoner challenging the legality of his sentence, counsel asserted that <em>Lenihan </em>is integral to the adequacy of the remedy of direct appeal: \u201c[B]ecause of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lenihan, </em>in particular, the scope of review on direct appeal is much broader than it was previously.... [T]hat makes the remedy very adequate and effective.\u201d Counsel acknowledged that he has \u201cquibbled with <em>Lenihan </em>in many briefs\u201d and \u201ctried to undermine <em>Lenihan\u201d-, </em>but \u201cin preparation for this case, I have become a <em>Lenihan </em>convert, because I think it really does... support the adequacy and effectiveness of direct appeal.\u201d Given this about-face, as well as our reaffirmation of <em>Lenihan </em>in <em>Brister, </em>\u00b6 21, Lenihan\u2019s continued vitality is not an issue, and we therefore need only address whether the exception applies on the given facts of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b44-7\"> A recent example of this risk occurred in <em>State v.

Osborne, </em>2005 MT 264, \u00b6 4, 329 Mont. 95, \u00b6 4, 124 P.3d 1085, \u00b6 4, in which the appellant claimed that \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (2003) (the felony DUI sentencing statute) conflicted with \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA (2003) (the persistent felony offender sentencing statute) and that the district court\u2019s sentencing authority was constrained by the former. Where one of the statutes must give way to the other (an issue we did not reach in <em>Osborne </em>because Osborne\u2019s claim was procedurally barred, see <em>Osborne, </em>\u00b6 20), the sentencing court\u2019s authority exists only to the extent authorized by the prevailing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Similarly, under some statutory schemes a sentencing court\u2019s authority does not arise until certain prerequisites have been satisfied. <em>See, e.g., State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6 7, 302 Mont. 1, \u00b6 7, 11 P.3d 539, \u00b6 7 (\u201cDistrict courts are not <em>authorized </em>to impose a sentence of restitution until all [the] . . . statutory requirements [found in \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-241 to -249, MCA,] are satisfied.\u201d (emphasis added)). Under such schemes, therefore, any sentence imposed by the court before the prerequisites to its authority have been fulfilled will be in the absence of statutory authority. (Note that this was not the situation in <em>Nelson, supra. </em>Nelson\u2019s sentence often years was statutorily authorized by \u00a7 45-5-202(3), MCA. <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont, at 20, 906 P.2d at 668. Although the sentencing court had an \u201caffirmative duty\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(11) and -225, MCA, to take certain matters into consideration in sentencing, doing so was not a prerequisite to its authority, <em>Nelson, </em>274 Mont, at 20, 906 P.2d at 668, which is the crucial distinction here.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b58-4\"> We later held that \u201capplication of the weapon enhancement statute to felony convictions where the underlying offense requires proof of use of a weapon violates the double jeopardy provision of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, \u00b6 16, 293 Mont. 224, \u00b6 16, 975 P.2d 312, \u00b6 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b58-5\"> Lafley challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, as applied to him (and, concomitantly, to similarly situated defendants whose underlying convictions required proof of the use of a weapon), as opposed to attacking the statute as unconstitutional on its face. For purposes of <em>Lenihan, </em>this makes no difference. A sentence is (allegedly) illegal regardless of whether the validity of the sentencing statute is challenged on its face or as applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\"> Essential to the ensuing discussion of <em>McLeod </em>is the fact that the error in the PSI could have been discovered with reasonable diligence at or before the time of sentencing, <em>see McLeod, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10,14,24; thus, McLeod had an opportunity to object to the misinformation concerning the number of his prior convictions. This fact distinguishes McLeod\u2019s situation from cases in which a prior conviction upon which the sentencing court relies in imposing a particular sentence is later-i.e., subsequent to the sentencing proceeding-determined to be invalid. <em>See McLeod, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-22. In such cases, the defendants \u201ccould [not] possibly have been afforded the opportunity to object to the consideration of their previous convictions at the time of sentencing because their previous convictions remained valid at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>McLeod, </em>\u00b6 21. As such, the defendants in those cases would not be precluded by their failure to make a timely objection from pursuing post-sentencing challenges to their sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\"> The \u201cacquiesced or actively participated\u201d principle had been applied in a line of cases involving alleged trial and procedural errors. <em>See Harris, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28, 32; <em>State v.

We did not reach this issue because we concluded that Micklon had waived his right to challenge the interest condition on appeal. Rather, the point here is that an allegation that the sentencing court lacked statutory authority to impose the challenged sentence is sufficient to pass through the <em>Lenihan </em>gateway, irrespective of the defendant\u2019s supposed complicity in that sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\"> Obvious costs include those associated with incarceration or monitoring by a probation officer (pursuant to a suspended or deferred sentence) in excess of the period set forth in the relevant punishment statute. <em>Cf.

In this regard, it is important to clarify that the term \u201clegality\u201d has a broader meaning in the standard of review context than it does in the <em>Lenihan </em>context.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">As a standard of review, our use of the term signifies that \u201cwe will not review a sentence for mere inequity or disparity.\u201d <em>State v. Webb, </em>2005 MT 5, \u00b6 8, 325 Mont. 317, \u00b6 8, 106 P.3d 521, \u00b6 8; <em>see also Montoya, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>but see State v.

Rather, when reviewing criminal sentences for \u201clegality,\u201d we are determining (i) whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence at issue, <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 41, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 41; <em>Ruiz, </em>\u00b6 12, (ii) whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 15, or (iii) whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes, see, <em>e.g., State v. Pence, </em>273 Mont. 223, 231, 902 P.2d 41, 46 (1995); <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, \u00b6 7, 302 Mont. 1, \u00b6 7, 11 P.3d 539, \u00b6 7; <em>State v.

We have also stated this \u201clegality\u201d review in a general sense in terms of correctness. <em>See State v. Megard, </em>2006 MT 84, \u00b6 16, 332 Mont. 27, \u00b6 16, 134 P.3d 90, \u00b6 16 (\u201cThis Court reviews a district court\u2019s imposition of sentence for legality only. The question is one of law and the determination is whether the district court interpreted the law correctly.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>State v. Sprinkle, </em>2000 MT 188, \u00b6 6, 300 Mont. 405, \u00b6 6, 4 P.3d 1204, \u00b6 6 (\u201cSentencing is based on statutory law. We review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing statutes to determine whether the district court was correct.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\"><em>Lenihan, </em>by contrast, is not concerned with whether the challenged sentence is \u201ccorrect.\u201d Indeed, under such an approach, as noted earlier, the <em>Lenihan </em>exception would swallow the timely objection rule. Rather, legality in the <em>Lenihan </em>context involves a narrower question: whether the sentence at issue was <em>authorized </em>by a valid sentencing statute. As such, \u201clegality\u201d for <em>Lenihan </em>purposes is narrower than our \u201clegality\u201d standard of review of criminal sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\"> Unless specified otherwise, further statutory references are to the 2001 Montana Code Annotated, which was in effect at the time Garrymore committed this crime (on or about January 3,2003). <em>See State v.

In the case at hand, Garrymore did not admit any of the facts on which his sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole is based.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\"> For purposes of the ensuing discussion, while there is no guarantee that a prisoner who is eligible for parole will in fact be paroled, the imposition of a parole eligibility restriction makes for a greater restriction on the prisoner\u2019s liberty and, thus, a harsher sentence. <em>See Cavanaugh, </em>189 Mont. at 276, 615 P.2d at 892 (\u201cThe clear effect of section 46-18-202(2) is to permit a district judge to close one avenue for escaping the full force of a sentence.\u201d). The sentencing scheme, in fact, contemplates this characterization. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 46-18-219 (mandating a life sentence without possibility of parole for specified recidivists).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> In the same vein, the State\u2019s suggestion that \u201clife imprisonment\u201d means \u201clife imprisonment without possibility of parole\u201d must be rejected. If that were the meaning intended by the Legislature, then \u00a7 46-18-202(2) would be a waste of print.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\"> In the case at hand, the District Judge\u2019s written reasons were as follows: \u201c[t]he Defendant has three prior convictions of abuse and unlawful restraint\u201d; \u201c[t]he Defendant was arrested on the same type of charges in the States of Utah and California but moved from their jurisdiction and charges were dismissed\u201d; \u201c[t]he Defendant was on probation when this offense was committed\u201d; and \u201c[flurther, the Court adopts a portion of Mr. Sonju\u2019s reasons.\u201d These reasons are consistent with the reasons given by the judge orally at the sentencing hearing. <em>See </em>\u00b6 7 of the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The Court notes that another factor considered by the District Judge in pronouncing sentence was Garrymore\u2019s lack of remorse. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 31. Specifically, the judge stated during the sentencing hearing that \u201cthroughout the trial and these proceedings, contrary to the testimony, I have not seen any remorse from this defendant.\u201d However, subsequent to Garrymore\u2019s sentencing, we decided <em>State v. Cesnik, </em>2005 MT 257, 329 Mont. 63, 122 P.3d 456, in which we held that a sentencing court may <em>not </em>punish a defendant or augment his sentence for refusing or failing to accept responsibility or show remorse for the offense of which he has been convicted when he has a right to appeal the conviction and has invoked his right to remain silent at the sentencing hearing or expressly maintained his innocence throughout the proceedings. <em>Cesnik, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-25; <em>see also State v. Shreves, </em>2002 MT 333, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, 313 Mont. 252, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23, 60 P.3d 991, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23. In the case at hand, Garrymore does not allege that his state or federal constitutional protections against self incrimination were violated when the District Judge based the sentence in part on Garrymore\u2019s failure to demonstrate sufficient remorse; thus, for purposes of this discussion, this factor was an otherwise valid sentencing consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b80-5\"> In <em>Cavanaugh, </em>we stated that \u201cDistrict Courts are required to determine whether the full restriction on parole and furlough eligibility is necessary for \u2018the protection of society\u2019 when a person is sentenced after conviction.\u201d <em>Cavanaugh, </em>189 Mont. at 279, 615 P.2d at 893. In view <em>o\u00ed Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>such an interpretation of \u00a7 46-18-202(2) would render the statute unconstitutional. For this reason, this portion of <em>Cavanaugh, </em>to the extent it may be read as making imposition of a parole eligibility restriction <em>contingent </em>on a finding by the sentencing court that it is necessary for the protection of society, is no longer good law. As explained above, the first and second sentences of \u00a7 46-18-202(2) leave imposition of a restriction on parole eligibility to the discretion of the sentencing court; they do not require such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The third sentence of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), however, is another matter. It provides that \u201c[i]f the sentencing judge finds that the restriction is necessary for the protection of society, the judge <em>shall </em>impose the restriction as part of the sentence and the judgment must contain a statement of the reasons for the restriction\u201d (emphasis added). In other words, if the judge \u201cfinds that the restriction is necessary for the protection of society,\u201d the judge not only <em>may </em>make the defendant ineligible for pair\u00f3le, the judge <em>must </em>do so (whether or not the judge would have imposed the restriction in the absence of the third sentence\u2019s mandate). Because the District Court did not impose the parole eligibility restriction on Garrymore\u2019s life sentence on the ground that it was necessary for the protection of society, we need not decide in this case whether the third sentence of \u00a7 46-18-202(2) constitutes an <em>Apprendi </em>violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b82-10\"> In his brief, Garrymore cites the 2001 version of \u00a7 46-1-401(3), but he quotes the 2003 version of this statute.

I still believe this is so. However, to the extent that our decision in <em>Micklon </em>might be construed to preclude a <em>Lenihan </em>challenge under other circumstances, I would agree that the conclusion reached by Justice Nelson in \u00b6 101 is legally correct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
