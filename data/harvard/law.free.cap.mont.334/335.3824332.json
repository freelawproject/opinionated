Hughes (Hughes) appeals the orders entered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Twentieth Judicial District Court, Lake County, granting summary judgment to Valley Bank of Ronan (Valley Bank) and granting Valley Bank\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of Hughes\u2019 expert witness. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b62 The following issues are dispositive on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment against Hughes on his counterclaims?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to Valley Bank on Hughes\u2019 promissory note?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b65 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by excluding the testimony of Hughes\u2019 banking expert, Cynthia Shea?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\u00b66 The District Court\u2019s approach to the factual issues in this matter was set forth in its summary judgment order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">The facts set forth herein are Hughes\u2019 \u201cversion\u201d of the facts. While several are contested by Valley Bank, the Court has assumed these facts to be true in analyzing the Motion for Summary Judgment presented by Valley Bank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">On appeal, the parties have utilized the same framework. In its appellate briefing, Valley Bank urges us to \u201clikewise ... test Hughes\u2019 facts and determine whether Valley is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Except for an argument it makes in response to defenses raised by Hughes to foreclosure of the promissory note, wherein it asserts that Hughes has not raised a genuine issue of material fact, Valley Bank urges us to rule that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law \u201cassuming [Hughes\u2019] facts to be true.\u201d Thus, except as otherwise noted, we consider the issues raised herein under that portion of the summary judgment standard of review, <em>see </em>\u00b6 14, infra, which requires us to determine whether the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">\u00b67 Lured by the promise of quick wealth, Hughes was conned by a \u201cNigerian scam.\u201d The swindlers promised Hughes a $3 minion to $4.5 million commission for his aid in procuring agricultural equipment for import into Africa and then proceeded to bilk him for hundreds of thousands of dollars in advanced fees. At least some of the funds Hughes advanced were wired via the services of Valley Bank, resulting in a dispute over which party should bear the loss from the flimflam.</p>\n<p id=\"Aga\">\u00b68 On Friday, March 22,2002, Hughes received four checks from one of the con-artists and deposited them into accounts Hughes held at Valley Bank. Two of them were \u201cofficial\u201d checks, and the other two were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>personal checks. One official check, for $1 million, was drawn on Colonial Bank. The other official check, for $500,000, was drawn on Firstar. The personal checks were for $62,000-drawn on the account of Maximilian H. Miltzlaff-and for $70,000-drawn on a Capital One credit card account held by Sarah Briscoe and Mary Bullard.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b69 Prior to depositing the checks, Hughes requested that Nancy Smith, a cashier and officer of Valley Bank, verify the validity of the official checks. In his deposition, Hughes described his conversation with Smith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">Well, my question was, how long do you have to hold money to have-how long do you have to hold these checks before they\u2019re sufficient funds; I think the bank calls them collected funds. And she said, these are official checks, Chuck. These two big ones are official checks. You will be transferring these? And I said I will be transferring a large sum. We\u2019ll have to determine next week what it will be. And she says, official checks, same as cash. You can do whatever you want to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Smith also assured Hughes that official checks were \u201cjust like\u201d cashier\u2019s checks. Milanna Shear, another bank employee, told Hughes to believe whatever Smith said regarding the validity of the checks. According to the deposition testimony of Hughes\u2019 wife, Barbara, Hughes had told her that \u201ceverybody at the bank assured him that the checks would be good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b610 On Tuesday, March 26, 2002, Hughes delivered a written request to Valley Bank to wire $800,000 to Ali dh. Abbas, an accountholder at the Housing Bank for Trade and Finance in Amman, Jordan. Valley Bank executed the transfer no later than 1:51 p.m. on the same day. The transfer proceeded through two intermediary banks, Wells Fargo, near Denver, Colorado, and Citibank in New York, before being sent to Amman. Upon receipt in Amman, the funds were promptly withdrawn, never to be seen again.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u00b611 At about 2:00 p.m.-approximately ten minutes after initiation of the transfer-Valley Bank and Hughes learned that one of the personal checks was being returned marked \u201cnonsufficient funds.\u201d Hughes immediately requested the wire to be stopped. No later than 3:26 p.m. Valley Bank requested that Wells Fargo reverse the wire transfer. The record is unclear about what happened during the interim between Hughes\u2019 request for cancellation and Valley Bank\u2019s attempts to comply with the request. The efforts of the several banks involved in the transfer to reverse the transaction were unsuccessful, and the later discovery that the two official checks were counterfeit resulted in Hughes\u2019 account being overdrawn by $800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u00b612 Valley Bank subsequently exercised its right to charge back the account and collect the $800,000 from Hughes. Allen Buhr (Buhr), Valley Bank\u2019s president, met with Hughes on March 29, 2002, to discuss Hughes\u2019 liability and suggested at that time that Hughes could be involved in a criminal prosecution for fraud. On April 11, 2002, Hughes deposited $607,838, which he had withdrawn from his retirement account, into the Valley Bank account. Also, on April 30, 2002, Hughes executed a promissory note to Valley Bank on behalf of his trust in the amount of $400,000, secured by mortgaged property. Of the $400,000 in proceeds generated by the secured note, $202,751.21 was used to pay off a previous loan against the mortgaged property, and the balance, $197,248.79, was applied to satisfy the charge-back liability in Hughes\u2019 account. Hughes was under the impression, given by Buhr, that the bank needed the note and loan agreement because it expected to be the subject of a government audit in the near future, and though Hughes thought that a new agreement might be reached after resolution of the \u201cfraud situation,\u201d he understood that the loan may not be forgiven. The trust subsequently made the first interest payment on the note on August 1, 2002, though it was one month late. The trust made no other payments on the note, and Valley Bank sent a notice of default and acceleration on October 15, 2002. Hughes requested that the bank forebear foreclosure until the end of the year, and the bank complied. However, when Hughes failed to make any more payments on the note, Valley Bank initiated an action for judicial foreclosure. Hughes asserted counterclaims of negligence, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (which was later abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b613 On April 15,2005, the District Court granted Valley Bank\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Cynthia Shea as an expert witness for Hughes. In an order dated April 20, 2005, the District Court granted Valley Bank summary judgment on Hughes\u2019 counterclaims. On the same day, the District Court granted Valley Bank summary judgment on its claims regarding the promissory note. From these orders Hughes appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b614 This Court articulated the standard of review we apply to grants of summary judgment in <em>Grimsrud v. Hagel, </em>2005 MT 194, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 142, \u00b6 14, 119 P.3d 47, \u00b6 14 (citations and quotation marks omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">This Court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s grant of summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>judgment is <em>de novo. </em>Our evaluation is the same as that of the trial court. We apply the criteria contained in Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. According to this rule, the moving party must establish both the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. If this is accomplished, the burden then shifts to the non-moving party to prove, by more than mere denial and speculation, that a genuine issue does exist. If the court determines that no genuine issues of fact exist, the court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b615 We review conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Galassi v. Lincoln County Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>2003 MT 319, \u00b6 7, 318 Mont. 288, \u00b6 7, 80 P.3d 84, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b616 This Court described the standard of review for evidentiary rulings in <em>McDermott v.

When a customer deposits a check at a bank, the bank will sometimes (but not always) credit the customer\u2019s account immediately with the face amount of the check and permit the customer to draw on the deposited funds. This practice is known in Uniform Commercial Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> parlance as \u201cprovisional settlement\u201d because the bank has not yet presented the check to the drawee bank and received payment from the check maker\u2019s account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(which would constitute \u201cfinal settlement\u201d). The depositary bank, however, may \u201ccharge back\u201d the depositor\u2019s account in the event the check is subsequently dishonored by the drawee bank. Thus, the UCC encourages the provisional settlement process by protecting a depositary bank from fraudulent or otherwise unenforceable check deposits. With this overview of the check settlement process in mind, we turn now to the specifics of the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b618 Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment against Hughes on his counterclaims?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>UCC Preemption and Ordinary Care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A62J\">\u00b619 Hughes argues that the District Court erroneously concluded that the UCC preempts Hughes\u2019 equitable and common law claims. Hughes asserts that preemption does not occur because \u201c[t]here <em>are </em>no regulations or UCC provisions which expressly regulate... promises and representations that bank personnel make to their customers.\u201d Further, Hughes contends that the \u201cpractical effect of the District Court\u2019s interpretation affords banks absolute immunity for negligence, fraud, misrepresentation and other acts which are not expressly addressed in the UCC...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b620 The District Court rested its conclusion on its interpretation of \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this code, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement its provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">The District Court stated that the \u201cofficial comments to UCC \u00a7 1-103 [on which \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA, is based] show that preemption of common law and equitable claims is one purpose of the... statute....\u201d The official comment to which the District Court referred clarifies that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">while principles of common law and equity may <em>supplement </em>provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, they may not be used to <em>supplant </em>its provisions, or the purposes and policies those provisions reflect, unless a specific provision of the Uniform Commercial Code provides otherwise. In the absence of such a provision, the Uniform Commercial Code preempts principles of common law and equity that are inconsistent with either its provisions or its purposes and policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">The language of subsection (b) is intended to reflect both the concept of supplementation and the concept of preemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">UCC \u00a7 1-103, cmt. 2. The District Court also concluded that three cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>from other jurisdictions, <em>Chase v. Morgan Guarantee Trust Co., </em>590 F.Supp. 1137 (S.D.N.Y. 1984), <em>Allen v. Carver Federal Sav. and Loan Ass\u2019n, All </em>N.Y.S.2d 537 (N.Y. App. Div. 1984), and <em>Call v. Ellenville Nat. Bank, 11A </em>N.Y.S.2d 76 (N.Y. App. Div. 2004), \u201csupport preemption of equitable and common law claims under the applicable UCC provisions and facts of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b621  We disagree with the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA, and of <em>Chase, Allen, </em>and <em>Call. </em>A bank receiving checks from depositors must use \u201cordinary care\u201d-as that term is defined and used in the UCC-in settling those checks. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 30-4-103(3), 30-4-103(5), and 30-4-212, MCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 30-3-102(g), MCA, defines \u201cordinary care\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">\u201cOrdinary care\u201d in the case of a person engaged in business means observance of reasonable commercial standards, prevailing in the area in which that person is located, with respect to the business in which that person is engaged. In the case of a bank that takes an instrument for processing for collection or payment by automated means, reasonable commercial standards do not require the bank to examine the instrument if the failure to examine does not violate the bank\u2019s prescribed procedures and the bank\u2019s procedures do not vary unreasonably from general banking usage not disapproved by this chapter or chapter 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In its order, the District Court examined the meaning of \u201cordinary care\u201d but did not distinguish the term\u2019s application to the two different actions at issue here: the settlement of the deposited checks and the alleged representations about the check settlement process. The second sentence of the definition of ordinary care specifically states that, subject to certain exceptions, a bank does not have a duty to examine instruments, in this case, checks. Pursuant to \u00a7 30-1-103, MCA, and UCC \u00a7 1-103, cmt. 2, such specificity preempts any common law concepts that might otherwise supplement the UCC. Thus, to the extent that Hughes\u2019 common law claims relate to Valley Bank\u2019s processing of the checks, they are preempted by the UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u00b622  Indeed, Hughes presents a claim directed toward the UCC-defined standard of ordinary care with respect to check processing. Hughes asserts that, by failing to comply with its own policies and the applicable federal regulations, Valley Bank inappropriately charged back his account after the dishonor of the deposited checks. However, \u00a7 30-4-212(4), MCA, states, \u201c[t]he right to charge back is not affected by ... failure by any bank to exercise ordinary care with respect to the item but any bank so failing remains liable.\u201d Official Comment 5 to \u00a7 30-4-212(4), MCA, expounds on this point, stating that \u201ccharge-back is permitted <em>even where nonpayment results from the depositary bank\u2019s own negligence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Accordingly, in evaluating the propriety of Valley Bank\u2019s actions with regard to check processing, it is irrelevant whether Valley Bank exercised ordinary care in exercising its charge back rights, and the claims are preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b623  However, Hughes\u2019 claims encompass not only Valley Bank\u2019s processing of the checks but also the bank\u2019s communications to Hughes about that process. Because such communications are not addressed with specificity by the UCC, common law and equitable principles supplement the UCC and govern the legal rights and responsibilities that apply to Valley Bank\u2019s representations to Hughes, upon which Hughes allegedly relied. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-1-103, MCA; <em>First Georgia Bank v. Webster, </em>308 S.E.2d 579, 581 (Ga. Ct. App. 1983) (UCC does not provide relief from common law negligence; thus, common law actions are permissible.); <em>see also </em>Henry J. Bailey &amp; Richard B. Hagedorn, <em>Brady on Bank Checks </em>\u00b6 24.05, n.84 (8th ed., 1999).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>erred by concluding that the UCC preempted common law and equitable principles with respect to the alleged misrepresentations. Therefore, while Hughes bore the obligation to repay Valley Bank to satisfy the bank\u2019s right of charge-back under \u00a7 30-4-212, MCA, it nevertheless is possible for Hughes to obtain a judgment to compensate him for the charge-back debt, though we express no opinion on the ultimate merits of these common law claims in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Axj\">\u00b624 Although holding in favor the bank in each case, <em>Chase, Allen, </em>and <em>Call </em>do not support preemption with regard to Valley Bank\u2019s alleged misrepresentations. Rather, there is support within these decisions for this Court\u2019s determination that common law principles apply to bank communications to a depositor inquiring about the processing of checks. In each of these cases, the bank exercised its right of charge-back under UCC \u00a7 4-212 and the plaintiff depositor alleged either that the bank had informed him that the deposited check had \u201ccleared\u201d or that the bank had led him to believe that it would clear in a certain amount of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b625 The <em>Chase </em>court expressly acknowledged the possibility that common law principles could apply to the type of communications at issue here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">[Blanks have nothing to gain by misleading customers into believing that uncleared items have cleared. Indeed, banks are usually overly cautious in giving provisional credit precisely because of the uncertainty of uncollected items. A bank could be liable for a misstatement in these general circumstances if the misstatement were part of a scheme to defraud a customer in Chase\u2019s position by, for example, a conspiracy between the bank and the party to whom Chase transferred the funds. This of course is merely one example. As discussed supra, however, [UCC] \u00a7 4-212(4) simply does not hold liable for charge-back a bank whose employee inadvertently in some remark misleads a customer as to the precise likelihood that an item will clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\"><em>The outcome might be different if a bank expressly informed a customer that it had made a final settlement on the account, </em>but that is not the case here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>Chase, </em>590 F.Supp. at 1139 n.3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b626 The court in <em>Allen </em>also acknowledged the potential for common law liability in this context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">We are dubious that the mere statement of a depositor that an unidentified teller told her (mistakenly) that a check had \u201ccleared\u201d, when in fact it had not, constitutes that quantum of proof of negligence which will enable a customer to prevail against the bank under the circumstances disclosed here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\"><em>Allen, </em>477 N.Y.S.2d at 538. Though <em>the Allen </em>court did not distinguish the bank\u2019s duties in processing the check at issue from its duties in its communications to its depositor about that process, the language employed in the opinion suggests that some \u201cquantum of proof\u2019 would be sufficient \u201cto prevail against the bank\u201d on common law claims in different circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u00b627 Similarly, in <em>Call, </em>the court indicated that the \u201cterm \u2018cleared\u2019... is not the equivalent of\u2018final settlement\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that, \u201calthough Mr. Call apparently assumed such, <em>he did not allege that this was a result of any inquiry with or representation to that effect by the defendant bank. </em>\u201d <em>Call, </em>774 N.Y.S.2d at 79 (emphasis added). Thus, the court, though not squarely addressing the issue, left open the possibility that a bank\u2019s misrepresentation of the status of the check settlement process could lead to liability for the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u00b628 In each of the above cases, the defendant bank was granted summary judgment because the plaintiff depositor failed to allege facts sufficient to impute liability to the bank. However, though the bank prevailed in each case, the analyses do not support the proposition that common law and equitable principles have been preempted by the UCC. Instead, they intimate that, in certain circumstances, common law and equitable principles may supplement the UCC where the bank-though not violating its UCC-defined duty of ordinary care with respect to processing checks-breaches a duty to its depositor by misrepresenting the status of the check settlement process.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">\u00b629  In summary, the District Court correctly determined that Valley Bank did not violate the UCC-defined duty of ordinary care in processing the checks. However, the District Court erred by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>consider whether common law and equitable principles supplement the UCC-defined duty of ordinary care with respect to the representations about the check settlement process. Therefore, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay1U\">\n<em>Holder in Due Course</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b630 Hughes argues that he took the counterfeit checks in good faith and that under the provisions of \u00a7 30-4-205, MCA, he became a \u201cholder in due course.\u201d He also alleges that by then depositing those checks, Valley Bank became a holder in due course of the checks. According to Hughes, under the UCC\u2019s rules regarding holders in due course, Firstar and Colonial then \u201chad no defenses to the \u2018checks\u2019 and were required to pay the sums to Valley.\u201d Consequently, Hughes argues, assuming Valley Bank took the deposited checks in good faith, it should have sought to recoup its losses from Firstar and Colonial, not Hughes, which it failed to do. Alternatively, Hughes contends that if Valley Bank knew of the \u201cpotential irregularities\u201d with the checks, then Valley Bank \u201cacted outside the bounds of UCC-defined \u2018good faith\u2019 banking standards\u201d and \u201cmust be the \u2018stuckee\u2019 of this transaction ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b631 Valley Bank correctly points out that this is a new argument on appeal that was not raised in the District Court and that should not be entertained by this Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">The general rule in Montana is that this Court will not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory. <em>Day v. Payne </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 273, 276, 929 P.2d 864, 866 (citation omitted). The basis for the general rule is that \u201cit is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>Day, </em>280 Mont. at 276-77, 929 P.2d at 866 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\"><em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15. Therefore, we do not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\n<em>The Wire Transfer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">\u00b632  Hughes contends that the District Court erred by ruling that Article 4A of the UCC applies to the $800,000 wire transfer and that Hughes\u2019 negligence claims with respect to the transfer cannot proceed to trial. Both parties agree that the wire transfer was executed via Fedwire and that the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1693 et seq. (2004), does not apply, but Hughes fails to offer authority demonstrating that Article 4A does not apply. As the District Court correctly concluded, \u201cFederal Reserve Regulation J governs wire transfers via the Fedwire system,\u201d and Appendix B to that regulation incorporates UCC Article 4A. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 210.25 et seq. Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>District Court rightly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">There is no requirement or duty under Regulation J or UCC Article 4A that a bank agree to cancellation under any circumstances. Here, it is undisputed that the soonest the stop order if any was made, was after Valley Bank executed the payment order. As such, there is no liability that can be alleged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err by granting summary judgment to Valley Bank on Hughes\u2019 negligence claims with respect to the wire transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b633 Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to Valley Bank on Hughes\u2019 promissory note?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b634 Hughes maintains that the promissory note he signed to satisfy his charge-back debt is invalid by reason of illegal purpose, lack of consideration, lack of consent due to menace and undue influence, and unconscionability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u00b635 First, Hughes asserts that the promissory note was invalid because it was made for the illegal purpose of \u201chiding Valley\u2019s unlawful transaction from a government auditor.\u201d Valley Bank correctly responds that Hughes failed to raise this affirmative defense in the proceedings below and is therefore barred from raising it here. <em>See Easley, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"AUq\">\u00b636 Hughes next contends that if he is not liable for the charge-back, then the promissory note fails for lack of consideration because he would have received nothing in exchange for his agreement to pay the note. As discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 above, Hughes\u2019 liability for the charge-back and Valley Bank\u2019s potential liability for its representations to Hughes are separate issues. Under \u00a7 30-4-212, MCA, Hughes became liable for satisfying the entire charge-back debt; thus, the promissory note does not fail for lack of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\u00b637 Hughes argues that Buhr \u201cthreatened Hughes that he could be charged with fraud\u201d and that this \u201cthreat\u201d constitutes menace under \u00a7 28-2-403, MCA, and A.H. <em>Averill Machinery Co. v. Taylor, </em>70 Mont. 70, 223 P. 918 (1924). However, <em>Averill </em>makes clear that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-10\">[i]f a party, who relies upon menace to relieve him from the consequences of his contract, remains silent for an unreasonable time after the removal of the menace, he may be held to have elected to waive the wrong and ratify the contract; but it is the general rule that to constitute an affirmance the conduct of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>injured party must be such as to indicate an intention to condone the wrong and a purpose to abide by its consequences, and the influence of the menace must be removed before the conduct becomes voluntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><em>Averill, </em>70 Mont. at 79-80, 223 P. at 921. Regardless of whether Buhr\u2019s statement constitutes conduct that could amount to menace within the statutory definition, we conclude that Hughes\u2019 first quarterly payment made on August 1,2002-three months after executing the note-and his subsequent renegotiation of the note sometime after October 15, 2002, comprise a ratification of the contract under <em>Averill. </em>Therefore, the note does not fail for lack of consent due to menace.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b638 Hughes also contends that \u201cBuhr exercised undue influence by utilizing his knowledge of Hughes\u2019 assets and took unfair advantage of Hughes\u2019 apparent distress over the situation in order to gain a legal advantage over Hughes.\u201d Undue influence is defined by statute in \u00a7 28-2-407, MCA, but in <em>Heintz v. Vestal, </em>185 Mont. 233, 237, 605 P.2d 606, 608 (1980), we summarized the test: \u201cThe influence exerted must be such as to destroy the free agency of the influenced person with the will of another substituted.\u201d In addition, we held that a court must take \u201cinto consideration the mental and physical health of the party being influenced\u201d and \u201call of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Heintz, </em>185 Mont. at 237, 605 P.2d at 608. Here, whatever influence Buhr may have exerted over Hughes, it did not rise to the level of substituting his will for that of Hughes. Moreover, there is no indication that Hughes was in a mentally or physically weak state or in a confidential relationship with Buhr. Thus, the note does not fail for lack of consent as a result of undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b639 Finally, Hughes asserts that the contract is unconscionable, but he fails to cite to any legal authority to support his position, and he does not develop his argument beyond a mere conclusory statement. Therefore, we do not consider it. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b640  Accordingly, based upon the claims made and facts asserted herein, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Valley Bank on the promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u00b641 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by excluding the testimony of Hughes\u2019 banking expert, Cynthia Shea?</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\u00b642 The District Court disqualified Cynthia Shea as an expert witness because she lacked adequate knowledge of the UCC standard of ordinary care defined in \u00a7 30-3-102(g), MCA. The District Court reasoned that, though Shea is \u201cwell qualified by education, special training and experience in banking policies and procedures,\u201d the \u201crecord here establishes that Shea has no knowledge of the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>commercial standards prevailing in the area in which the Plaintiff bank is located in Ronan, Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b643 Hughes relies on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Burlingham v. Mintz, </em>270 Mont. 277, 891 P.2d 527 (1995), to challenge the District Court\u2019s ruling. Hughes argues that banking practices are \u201cso basic that the standard of ordinary care is universal with respect to those duties of a bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_v\">\u00b644 In <em>Burlingham, </em>we overruled <em>Negaard v. Estate of Feda, </em>152 Mont. 47, 446 P.2d 436 (1968), which required dentists to \u201cexercise such reasonable care and skill as is usually exercised by a dentist in good standing in the community in which he or she resides.\u201d <em>Burlingham, </em>270 Mont. at 280, 891 P.2d at 529. We held in <em>Burlingham </em>that the standard for non-emergency dental care is the same as that required throughout the United States. <em>Burlingham, </em>270 Mont. at 280, 891 P.2d at 529. This uniform standard stood in contrast to the standard of care for a general practitioner physician in rural communities, who \u201cis held to the standard of a reasonably competent general practitioner acting in the same or similar community or in the same or similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Burlingham, </em>270 Mont. at 280, 891 P.2d at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b645  <em>Burlingham </em>set forth a <em>judicially </em>defined standard of care applicable to the type of service at issue. That is not the case here. The UCC statutes define a bank\u2019s duty of ordinary care with respect to the community in which the bank is situated. Therefore, <em>Burlingham </em>is inapplicable, and we reject Hughes\u2019 contention that the relevant standard of care is universal. Hughes has neither demonstrated that Shea possesses any knowledge of the reasonable commercial standards prevailing among Montana\u2019s banks nor that she has knowledge of procedures that fall within Montana\u2019s general banking usage. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err by excluding Shea\u2019s testimony regarding the UCC-defined standard of ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b646 Hughes raises other issues on appeal. However, given our holdings herein, it is unnecessary for us to address those additional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u00b647 The District Court correctly concluded that Valley Bank did not violate the UCC-defined duty of ordinary care in processing the checks. Thus, it did not err by granting summary judgment to Valley Bank on the promissory note and did not err by excluding Shea\u2019s testimony, and we affirm on those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u00b648 The District Court erred by failing to consider whether common law and equitable principles supplement the UCC-defined duty of ordinary care with respect to the bank\u2019s representations about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>check settlement process. Therefore, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order with regard to Hughes\u2019 counterclaims based upon those representations and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b649 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b372-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\"> Codified at Title 30, Chapters (also called \u201cArticles\u201d) 1 through 9A, Montana Code Annotated, and referred to as the \u201cUCC.\u201d Citations to UCC provisions that do not include \u201cMCA\u201d are to the UCC as adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.

Bellanger, </em>2001 MT 235, 307 Mont. 22, 36 P.3d 397, in- support of its conclusion. However, <em>Daniels-Sheridan </em>considered whether equitable principles displaced the UCC\u2019s Article 9 priority rules. As our discussion will show, the pivotal issue here is not whether equitable principles displace the applicable portions of the UCC but whether the UCC wholly displaces common law and equitable principles. Thus, reliance on <em>Daniels-Sheridan </em>is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\"> Section 30-4-104(3), MCA, incorporates the definition of ordinary care in \u00a7 30-3-102(g), MCA, into Article 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b365-5\"> Some courts, in confirming the propriety of asserting common law and equitable principles in similar factual contexts, have concluded that the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents a bank from exercising its charge-back rights under their states\u2019 equivalent of UCC \u00a7 4-212. <em>First National Bank of Denver v. Ulibarri, </em>557 P.2d 1221 (Colo. Ct. App. 1976); <em>Webster, </em>308 S.E.2d 579; <em>Symonds v. Mercury Sav. and Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>275 Cal. Rptr. 871 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990); <em>Burke v. First Peoples Bank of N. </em>J., 412 A.2d 1089 (N.J. Super Ct. 1980). These cases support our conclusion that common law and equitable principles apply to supplement the UCC in this context, but they run counter to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that equitable estoppel is inapplicable, a conclusion for which there is support. <em>See </em>Bailey &amp; Hagedorn, <em>Brady on Bank Checks </em>\u00b6 24.05, n.84 (\u201cIt would seem that a bank should have the right of chargeback notwithstanding its negligence or any act amounting to estoppel, in view of UCC \u00a7 4-212(4)(b) (1962), but the right of chargeback should he offset by the loss sustained by the customer because of rebanee on the bank\u2019s representation and the customer\u2019s change of position because of such rebanee.\u201d); <em>Hanners v. Industrial State Bank, </em>791 P.2d 752 (Kan. Ct. App. 1990) (not designated for pubbeation but citable as persuasive authority pursuant to Kan. Sup. Ct. Rule 7.04(f)(1)) (right to charge back not affected by failure of the bank to exercise ordinary care). In any event, because the District Court\u2019s determination that equitable estoppel is inapplicable is not challenged on appeal, and thus waived, we reserve judgment on the issue until it is properly presented to this Court in another case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\"> Although we would prefer, for guidance on remand, to specifically state which of Hughes\u2019 delineated counterclaims survived summary judgment and which did not, we cannot do so, given the manner in which they are pled. For example, the negligence counterclaim alleges a breach of ordinary care by Valley Bank. As discussed above, entry of summary judgment was proper with regard to breach of ordinary care in check processing, but was not proper with regard to breach of ordinary care in the making of the alleged representations about the validity of the checks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\"> Though it does not affect our analysis here, we pause to express bewilderment at this statement of the <em>Call </em>court. If the term \u201ccleared\u201d means anything in common banking usage, it is that final settlement has occurred. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th ed., 1999) (defining \u201cclear\u201d as \u201cto pay (a check or draft) out of funds held on behalf of the maker &lt;the bank cleared the employee\u2019s check&gt;\u201d); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 30-4-104(l)(j), MCA (defining \u201csettle\u201d), and <em>Southside Nat.
