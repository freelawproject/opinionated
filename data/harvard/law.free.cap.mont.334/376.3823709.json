The Bozeman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Municipal Court held a jury trial, and the jury found Bonamarte guilty on April 30, 2004. The Municipal Court imposed a one-year sentence with all but thirty days suspended and ordered Bonamarte to pay fines and costs. The Municipal Court also ordered conditional restitution \u2014 Bonamarte would be required to pay restitution only if the State requested it within sixty days and the court held a hearing. Bonamarte did not wait, however, for the State to request restitution or for the sixty-day period to expire. He already had filed notice of his appeal with the Municipal Court by the time the State requested restitution on May 12, 2004. The Municipal Court transferred the record to District Court, and the parties proceeded to file appellate briefs in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b63 Bonamarte argued in his opening brief on appeal to the District Court that the Municipal Court\u2019s restitution order should be stricken because the court had failed to hear evidence on restitution costs and had failed to \u201cspecify the amount, method and time of payment\u201d in its restitution order. The State responded that the Municipal Court had not had the benefit of this Court\u2019s May 18, 2004, decision in <em>State v. Eixenberger, </em>2004 MT 127, \u00b6 22, 321 Mont. 298, \u00b6 22, 90 P.3d 453, \u00b6 22, that held that a district court must specify the amount of restitution in the restitution order pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-244(1), MCA. The State conceded that \u201cany error [in the restitution order] should be remanded for a new hearing to determine, according to the statutory requirements for restitution, what is owed and whether the Defendant has the ability to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b64 The District Court agreed and issued the following order: WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">1 That the Municipal Court\u2019s judgment and sentence in the above captioned matter is AFFIRMED; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">2. That the issue of restitution costs to be paid to the victim is hereby REMANDED for a determination of the total amount to be paid, including the time and method of payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">\u00b65 The District Court purported to affirm the judgment and sentence of the Municipal Court; however, it remanded the restitution portion of Bonamarte\u2019s sentence to the Municipal Court. Bonamarte\u2019s sentence appears to be unresolved, thus, we must address, <em>sua sponte, </em>whether we have proper jurisdiction over this case. <em>State v. Reeder, </em>2004 MT 244, \u00b6 4, 323 Mont. 15, \u00b6 4, 97 P.3d 1104, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u00b66 Section 46-20-104, MCA, governs this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over Bonamarte\u2019s appeal. This section provides that \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken by the defendant only from a final judgment of conviction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>orders after judgment which affect the substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d Section 46-20-104(1), MCA. This same language limits the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over Bonamarte\u2019s appeal from the Municipal Court. U. M. C. R. App. 5(b)(2) (\u201cThe scope of appeal by the defendant [from a municipal court judgment] is governed by \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA.\u201d). We have noted that in order for a judgment and order to constitute a \u201cfinal judgment of conviction,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, the judgment must impose a final sentence. <em>City of Billings v. Costa, </em>2006 MT 181, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10,333 Mont. 84, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 140 P.3d 1070, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b67  Bonamarte\u2019s sentence was not yet final when he appealed to the District Court. The Municipal Court\u2019s sentencing order imposed restitution on Bonamarte only if the State requested it within sixty days of the order and the court held a hearing on costs. The State requested restitution within sixty days and noted that Bonamarte could request a hearing. Bonamarte appealed his conviction, however, two days before the State had requested restitution and before the Municipal Court could hold the required hearing. The fact that Bonamarte\u2019s sentence was pending at the time of his appeal to the District Court prevented Bonamarte from appealing a \u201cfinal judgment of conviction\u201d under \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA. Thus, Bonamarte\u2019s appeal to the District Court was premature, and the District Court had no jurisdiction to consider the appeal. <em>Costa, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b68  Bonamarte cannot cure this jurisdictional defect by ignoring the issue of restitution on appeal to this Court. The record indicates that his sentence is not final. Thus, under \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, no final judgment of conviction exists, and we have no jurisdiction to consider his appeal. <em>State v. Diesen, </em>1998 MT 163, \u00b6 4, 290 Mont. 55, \u00b6 4, 964 P.2d 712, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b69 We note that M. R. App. P. 5(b) handles premature appeals from district courts to this Court by providing that \u201c[a] notice of appeal filed after the oral pronouncement of a decision or sentence but before the entry of the judgment is treated as filed on the day of and after the entry.\u201d The Montana Uniform Municipal Rules of Appeal to District Court do not address how the municipal courts should handle a premature appeal. Section 46-17-401, MCA, provides, however, that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by Title 3, Chapter 6, and ... [section 46-17-401 through 404], the proceedings and practice in municipal court shall be the same as in district court.\u201d <em>See also City of Missoula v. Shea, </em>202 Mont. 286, 298-99, 661 P.2d 410, 416 (1983) (analyzing district court rules of practice to determine whether an appeal bond is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>required in municipal court pursuant to \u00a7 46-17-401). We find no provisions in Title 3, Chapter 6, or in Sections 46-17-401 through 404, or in the Montana Uniform Municipal Rules of Appeal to District Court that are contrary to M. R. App. P. 5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b610 Bonamarte\u2019s notice of appeal should be considered, consistent with the intent of M. R. App. P. 5(b), as effectively filed on the day of and after the Municipal Court entered its final judgment-an event that likely has passed, but that we cannot verify from the record. Bonamarte\u2019s right to appeal should not be prejudiced due to the District Court\u2019s error in taking premature jurisdiction over Bonamarte\u2019s case and attempting to decide it in piecemeal fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"A_p\">\u00b611 Bonamarte\u2019s appeal being premature,</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b612 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this appeal is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"Ato\">\u00b613 The Clerk of Court shall mail a copy of this Order to all counsel of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">DATED this 8th day of November, 2006.</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-8\">/S/KARLA M.
