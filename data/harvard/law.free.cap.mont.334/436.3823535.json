We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b63 (1) Whether the District Court\u2019s application of \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d) and 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA, was an unlawful retroactive application of the statutes?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b64 (2) Whether the District Court abused its discretion by admitting a judgment of D.L.\u2019s prior sexual offense conviction over the objection of D.L.?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b65 (3) Whether the District Court incorrectly concluded that D.L.\u2019s prior Texas conviction for indecency with a child constituted an \u201caggravated circumstance\u201d under the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b66 (4) Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it terminated D.L.\u2019s parental rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b67 (5) Whether the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">\u00b68 (6) Whether D.L. sufficiently preserved his equal protection argument for appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">\u00b69 D.L. is the natural father of M.A.L., bom on November 25, 1999, D.L.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> born on November 1, 2000, and T.L., bom on November 19, 2001. The children have been in the State\u2019s custody since September 11, 2002, and were adjudicated as youths in need of care, within the meaning of \u00a7 41-3-102, MCA, by written order on September 26,2002.</p>\n<p id=\"AX4\">\u00b610 In July 2002, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) received a referral from Texas Child Protection Services (TCPS) stating that they had been involved with the children\u2019s birth mother, A.B. TCPS purchased bus tickets to Great Falls for A.B. and her three children so she could leave the children\u2019s father, D.L., and not lose custody of the children at that time, as TCPS refused to permit A.B. to both remain with D.L. and keep her children.</p>\n<p id=\"A8P\">\u00b611 The Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, terminated A.B.\u2019s parental rights on April 27,2004. The court extended temporary legal custody to DPHHS while it investigated how to proceed with respect to D.L. While DPHHS investigated D.L., it learned that he had a prior conviction for a sexual offense involving a minor in Texas. DPHHS filed a petition to terminate D.L.\u2019s parental rights on May 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>2004. Additionally, it requested the court to determine that based upon the existence of an aggravated circumstance, pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-423, MCA, it was not necessary for DPHHS to provide rehabilitative services to D.L. On September 20, 2004, D.L. filed a motion to dismiss the termination petition. D.L. argued that finding an aggravated circumstance based upon a sexual offense conviction that predates the passage of \u00a7 41-3-423, MCA, would constitute an unlawful retroactive application of the statute. On September 21, 2004, the State filed a brief in response to D.L.\u2019s motion to dismiss. The State argued that since \u00a7 41-3-423, MCA, was in existence at the inception of the action, it was not an unlawful retroactive application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b612 The District Court conducted a hearing on D.L.\u2019s motion to dismiss and thereafter denied the motion by written order on September 28, 2004. The court reasoned that since \u00a7 41-3-423, MCA, was in effect at the time the State initiated the youth in need of care action, it was appropriate to apply the statute to D.L. The court determined that the State correctly relied upon D.L.\u2019s 1985 conviction to establish an aggravated circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u00b613 The court held the termination hearing on January 13,2005, and allowed the State to introduce certified copies of a \u201cDeferred Adjudication Order,\u201d a \u201cJudgment Adjudicating Guilt,\u201d and an \u201cIndictment of [D.L.] for the Offense of Aggravated Sexual Assault on a Child\u201d from the State of Texas. The 252nd District Court of Jefferson County, Texas, indicted D.L. in August 1985. Count I of the indictment states that D.L.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">[D]id then and there sexually assault [S.G.] ... a person younger than seventeen (17) years of age and not the Defendant\u2019s spouse, by intentionally and knowingly causing the sexual organ of the Complainant to come in contact with the Defendant\u2019s sexual organ; and the Complainant was then and there younger than fourteen (14) years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Count II of the indictment states, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">[D.L.] hereinafter, the Defendant, did then and there with intent to arouse and gratify the sexual desire of the Defendant, have sexual contact by touching the breast of [S.G.]... and did then and there with the intent to arouse and gratify the sexual desire of the defendant, have sexual contact by touching the genitals of [S.G.], a child under the age of seventeen (17) years and not the Defendant\u2019s spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">In the deferred adjudication order for the offense of \u201cLesser Included: Indecency With A Child,\u201d dated April 28,1986, the Texas court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>In the best interests of society and the Defendant, the Court, after hearing evidence finds that it substantiates the Defendant\u2019s guilt and defers further proceedings without entering an adjudication of guilt and places the Defendant on Probation for a period of six (6) years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">According to the certified copy of the judgment adjudicating guilt, which refers to the deferred adjudication order and which incorporates the \u201cMotion to Revoke Unadjudicated Probation,\u201d signed by the Texas court judge on April 17,1987, the court revoked D.L.\u2019s probation, due to his violation of the conditions of the probation, and imposed a punishment of a five-year commitment to the Texas Department of Corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b614 D.L. objected to the admission of the Texas court documents as hearsay, and also maintained that the documents did not establish that he was guilty of the offense of indecency with a child. In addition, D.L. argued that even assuming he had been convicted of the offense of indecency with a child, that Texas offense would not meet the definition of an \u201caggravated circumstance\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA. D.L.\u2019s counsel requested additional time to review the documents, and the court granted the request, continuing the hearing until January 20, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b615 D.L. failed to appear for the hearing on January 20,2005, but his counsel renewed his objection that the deferred adjudication order was hearsay and thus inadmissible. The court ruled that the document was admissible under M. R. Evid. 803(22) as an exception to the general hearsay rule. D.L.\u2019s counsel further argued that the document was not relevant because a Texas conviction for indecency with a child was analogous to an indecent exposure conviction in Montana, thus not constituting an aggravated circumstance pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA, which was rejected by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b616 On February 1,2005, the District Court entered written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order terminating D.L.\u2019s parental rights to M.A.L., D.L.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and T.L. The court found that pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA, D.L. had subjected a child to one of the circumstances listed in \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a) through (2)(e), MCA, that being the aggravated circumstance of sexual abuse by reason of his adjudication of guilt for the offense of felony indecency with a child. The court also found that the children had been in the State\u2019s custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>since September 11,2002, twenty-nine ofthe past twenty-nine months, and, therefore, a presumption that the termination of D.L.\u2019s parental rights was in their best interests had arisen pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-604, MCA (2003). The court granted permanent legal custody of the children to DPHHS with the right of DPHHS to appear in all future proceedings to consent to their adoption or guardianship. On February 18, 2005, D.L. filed a motion pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 50(b) for judgment as a matter of law. The court denied this motion. D.L. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court interpreted the law correctly. <em>In re A. J.E., </em>2006 MT 41, \u00b6 21, 331 Mont. 198, \u00b6 21, 130 P.3d 612, \u00b6 21. \u2018We review a district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>In re M.W., </em>2004 MT 301, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 433, \u00b6 14, 102 P.3d 6, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted). \u201cThe determination of whether evidence is relevant and admissible is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse.\u201d <em>M.W., </em>\u00b6 14. The test for an abuse of discretion is whether the trial court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>A.J.E., </em>\u00b6 21. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re L.M.A.T., </em>2002 MT 163, \u00b6 15, 310 Mont. 422, \u00b6 15, 51 P.3d 504, \u00b6 15. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or, if after review of the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>L.M.A.T., </em>\u00b6 15. We review a district court\u2019s ultimate decision to terminate parental rights for an abuse of discretion. <em>A.J.E., </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b618 \u201c[T]he best interests of the child are of paramount concern in a parental rights termination proceeding and take precedence over the parental rights.\u201d A.J.E., \u00b6 22. The party seeking to terminate the parental rights must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory requirements for termination have been met. A. <em>J.E., </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Discussion Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u00b619 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s application of\u00a7\u00a741-3-609(1) (d) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>and 41-3-423(2) (a), MCA, was an unlawful retroactive application of the statutes?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b620 D.L. argues that the District Court erroneously concluded that the statutes were not retroactively applied. D .L. contends that by applying the statutory amendment, which became effective October 1,1999, to an act that occurred thirteen or more years prior to the enactment is a retroactive application which violates \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, and infringes on his vested, constitutional parental rights. D.L. notes that the pre1999 version of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, did not give discretion to the court to terminate parental rights based solely upon the commission of a sexual offense by a parent. Instead, the pre-1999 version of \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, required the court to give the parent the opportunity to complete a court-ordered treatment plan, and thus application of the amended statute in this case gives the alleged commission of the sexual offense a different legal effect from that it had under the law when it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"ALW\">\u00b621 The State argues that the District Court correctly determined that \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d) and 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA, were not retroactively applied to D.L. because the statutes existed at the inception of the youth in need of care action. The State maintains that applying an amended statute to a factual situation occurring prior to the amendment is not a retroactive application. Moreover, the State contends that it was not D.L.\u2019s prior conviction that caused DPHHS to intervene and file a youth in need of care action in the first place; rather, it was only after the children\u2019s adjudication and their placement in foster care that D.L.\u2019s prior sexual offense became relevant. Alternatively, the State argues that even if the statutes were retroactively applied to D.L.\u2019s circumstances, such retroactive application was appropriate because the statutes are remedial in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b622 Section 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA (2003), states, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">The court may order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding established by clear and convincing evidence . . . that any of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">(d) the parent has subjected a child to any of the circumstances listed in 41-3-423(2)(a) through (2)(e)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In turn, the circumstances listed in \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA (2003), include \u201caggravated circumstances, including but not limited to abandonment, torture, chronic abuse, or sexual abuse or chronic, severe neglect of a child[.]\u201d Section 41-3-102(22)(a), MCA (2003), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>defines sexual abuse as \u201cthe commission of sexual assault, sexual intercourse without consent, indecent exposure, deviate sexual conduct, sexual abuse, ritual abuse, or incest, as described in Title 45, chapter 5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b623  Generally, DPHHS must make reasonable efforts to reunite a family after the children have been removed from the home. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-423(1), MCA. However, pursuant to the operation of \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA, DPHHS does not need to make reasonable efforts to provide preservation or reunification services if the court finds that the parent has subjected a child to any of the aggravated circumstances listed in \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b624  As a general rule, statutes cannot be applied retroactively unless expressly so declared by the Montana legislature. Section 1-2-109, MCA. A retroactive law is one \u201cwhich takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions already <em>passed.\u201dPorter v. Galarneau, </em>275 Mont. 174, 183, 911 P.2d 1143, 1148-49 (1996) (citing <em>Continental Oil Co. v. Montana Concrete Co., </em>63 Mont. 223, 207 P. 116 (1922)). A retroactive law is one which \u201cgives a transaction a different legal effect from that which it had under the law when it occurred.\u201d <em>Saint Vincent Hosp. v. Blue Cross, </em>261 Mont. 56, 60, 862 P.2d 6, 9 (1993). However, \u201c[a] statute does not operate retroactively merely because it is applied to conduct occurring prior to its enactment.\u201d <em>Carelli v. Hall, </em>279 Mont. 202, 210, 926 P.2d 756, 761 (1996) (citing <em>Porter, </em>275 Mont. at 183, 911 P.2d at 1148).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b625  This Court has held that \u201can amended statute which is applied to a factual situation which occurred prior to the enactment of the amendment is not viewed as retroactive in application.\u201d <em>Stiffarm v. Furois, </em>217 Mont. 335, 338, 704 P.2d 75, 77 (1985). In <em>Stiffarm, </em>Joseph Stiffarm (Stiffarm) was arrested on February 5, 1984, for driving under the influence of alcohol, and refused to submit to a chemical test to determine the alcohol concentration on his breath. Stiffarm had also previously refused the test in March 1982. Effective October 1, 1983, the Legislature had amended \u00a7 61-8-402, MCA, requiring the revocation of a driver\u2019s license for one year upon a second or subsequent refusal to submit to a chemical test within five years of a previous refusal. Based on the amended statute, Stiffarm\u2019s license was revoked for one year. Stiffarm argued that the revocation was improper because only one of the offenses upon which it was based occurred after the effective date of the statutory amendment. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Court rejected the argument, concluding that application of the new statute was not impermissibly retroactive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">No sanction was imposed [by the new statute] on the first refusal occurring prior to the effective date. Rather, it served as a condition for imposing the one-year revocation for the subsequent refusal. The statute requires revocation of appellant\u2019s license in response to his refusal in February of 1984 because it was a repetitive refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Stiffarm, </em>217 Mont. at 337-38, 704 P.2d at 77. Similarly, in the present case, no additional sanction was imposed on D.L.\u2019s 1985 conviction by enactment of the new statute alone. Rather, the 1985 conviction was made a condition for termination of D.L.\u2019s parental rights in the event D.L. subsequently neglected his children and thereby necessitated the filing of an abuse and neglect petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b626 D.L. further argues that the application of the statutes affects a \u201cvested right,\u201d and is thus retroactive in nature. A vested right is one that so completely and definitely belongs to a person that it cannot be impaired or taken away without the person\u2019s consent. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1324 (7th ed. 1999). It is well-established in Montana that a parent\u2019s right to care and custody of his child is a fundamental liberty interest which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>L.M.A.T., </em>\u00b6 33. However, in a parental rights termination proceeding, the best interests of the child are of paramount concern and take precedence over the rights of the parent. <em>A.J.E., </em>\u00b6 22. The constitutional protection surrounding family rights is tempered by the State\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>responsibility to protect the welfare of the children. <em>Parens patriae </em>traditionally refers to the role of the state as sovereign or guardian of persons who are under a legal disability, such as juveniles, and stands for \u201cthe principle that the state must care for those who cannot take care of themselves, such as minors who lack proper care and custody from their parents.\u201d <em>Matter of S.L.M., </em>287 Mont. 23, 39, 951 P.2d 1365, 1375 (1997) (citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1114 (6th ed. 1990)). Section 41-3-101, MCA (2003), states the policy of the state with regards to the welfare of children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">(1) It is the policy of the state of Montana to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">(a) provide for the protection of children whose health and welfare are or may be adversely affected and further threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>by the conduct of those responsible for the children\u2019s care and protection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">(4) In implementing the policy of this section, the child\u2019s health and safety are of paramount concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Title 41, Chapter 3 of the MCA provides procedures by which the State may become involved in the care and custody of children in Montana and when the State may remove a child from the parent\u2019s custody or terminate the legal parent-child relationship. <em>See generally </em>Title 41, Chapter 3, parts 3, 4, and 6, MCA. Under these provisions, the child\u2019s custody may be transferred from a natural parent to the State or other third party upon a court order entered after a finding that the child is a youth in need of care. Section 41-3-438(3), MCA (2003). A youth in need of care determination must be based on a finding that the child is abused, abandoned, or neglected. Section 41-3-102(29), MCA (2003). In such a case, the State can intervene without the parent\u2019s consent, and, upon clear and convincing proof, a parent determined by a court of law to be unfit, as defined in \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, must yield his or her vested right in the care and custody of his or her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u00b627  In these proceedings, D.L.\u2019s prior conviction did not require or inevitably lead to his children being abused or neglected and an abuse and neglect petition being filed. Rather, his prior conviction only became relevant as an independent ground for DPHHS to petition for termination of D.L.\u2019s parental rights after his children were abused and neglected. A further reason why the application of the amended statutes does not necessarily \u201cgive the transaction a different legal effect from that which it had under the law when it occurred,\u201d as D.L. argues, is because D.L. was not even a parent in 1985, when he committed the crime in Texas. The amended statutes became effective on October 1, 1999, and D.L.\u2019s first child, M.A.L., was born on November 25, 1999. Thus, as of October 1, 1999, D.L. was on notice, even before his children were born, that his 1985 conviction would present a basis for the termination of his parental rights in the event his children became abused or neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">\u00b628 The District Court relied on persuasive authority from other jurisdictions to support its conclusion that \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a) and 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA, were appropriately applied to D.L. The Court of Appeals of New York, in <em>In re Marino S., </em>795 N.E.2d 21 (N.Y. 2003), addressed the retroactive application of a statute which provided an aggravated circumstance as grounds for termination ofparental rights. There, the State instituted child abuse proceedings against the parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>in August 1997, and filed petitions to terminate parental rights in September 1998. In February 1999, during the pendency of the abuse and termination proceedings, New York passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), and subsequently brought a motion in the underlying abuse proceeding for a finding of \u201caggravated circumstances,\u201d a term introduced by ASFA. The effect of a finding of aggravated circumstances is to dispense with the requirement that an agency responsible for having placed the children in foster care or seeking to terminate parental rights exercise diligent efforts to reunite the parents with the children. The parents challenged the retroactive application of ASFA to their pending proceedings insofar as their termination petitions were amended to include a cause of action for severe abuse based on a felony sex offense. The court determined that the ASFA should be applied retroactively, \u201c[bjecause the statute is remedial in nature and does not impair vested rights ....\u201d <em>Marino S., </em>795 N.E.2d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">\u00b629 We simply note that the facts in <em>Marino S. are </em>different from those in the case at hand because <em>Marino S. </em>truly does involve the retroactive application of the New York statute, since the termination proceeding was in progress when the statute was amended. The difference here is that the statute was amended before the termination proceedings were even begun. Our concern here is only the application of the statutory provisions to factual events <em>preceding </em>the effective date of the statute. Support for our holding herein can be found in the following cases, wherein courts have held that the provisions of the ASFA, or implementing state statutes, were properly applied to facts predating the effective date of the statute and that no improper retroactive application occurred as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b630 The Supreme Court of Texas, <em>in In re A.V., </em>113 S.W.3d 355 (Tex. 2003), held that termination of a father\u2019s parental rights based on the length of incarceration of the father, convicted prior to the enactment of a statute allowing length of incarceration to be used as a legal basis for the termination of parental rights, did not violate the prohibition against retroactive application of the law. The father argued that the statute was unconstitutionally retroactively applied to him, and because the statute was not enacted until 1997, his pre-1997 criminal conviction and imprisonment could not be used to satisfy the subsection\u2019s elements. The court concluded that the statute did not constitute an additional punishment for the father\u2019s criminal conduct, but rather focused on the father\u2019s future imprisonment and inability to care for the child, and noted the State\u2019s duty to protect the safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and welfare of its children and the policy of intervening in the parent-child relationship when necessary. <em>A.V., </em>113 S.W.3d at 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b631 Likewise, the California Court of Appeals <em>in In re Joshua M., </em>66 Cal. App. 4th 458 (1998), held that a denial of reunification services to a father under a statute permitting such denial when the parent was previously unsuccessful in unifying with the minor\u2019s sibling or \u25a0unsuccessful in treatment of a long-standing substance abuse problem did not constitute an unfair retroactive application of a newly created statute, even though the circumstances that activated the statute occurred before its effective date. The California court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that \u2018[a] statute does not operate retroactively merely because some of the facts or conditions upon which its application depends came into existence before the enactment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Armstrong v.

DPHHS initiated the termination proceeding against D.L. on September 13, 2003. Thus D.L. was on notice that his prior Texas conviction for a sexual offense against a child could be used as an aggravated circumstance to justify grounds for termination of his parental rights if he allowed his children to be abused and neglected. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>We conclude that applying the statutes to the conviction which occurred prior to the effective date does not constitute an unlawful retroactive application of \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a) and 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Issue Two</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b633 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by admitting a judgment ofD.L.\u2019s prior sexual offense conviction over the objection ofD.L.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b634 D.L. argues that the District Cotut erroneously admitted the certified copy of the Judgment Adjudicating Guilt pursuant to the hearsay exception set forth in M. R. Evid. 803(22). D.L. contends that the exception in M. R. Evid. 803(22) does not apply because it cannot be determined from the document whether the Texas court accepted a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea, which is excluded by the rule. Furthermore, D.L. argues that the judgment must show the essential facts necessary to sustain the judgment or evidence must be introduced to show such facts, or else the plain meaning of M. R. Evid. 803(22) is violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">\u00b635 The State responds that the exception does apply because D.L. clearly entered a guilty plea, not a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea. The State further argues that it was not required to prove the underlying facts ofD.L.\u2019s criminal conviction or offer more than the certified copy of the conviction. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u00b636 M. R. Evid. 803(22) provides the following exception to the hearsay rule even though the declarant is available as a witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\"><em>Judgment of Previous Conviction. </em>Evidence of a final judgment, entered after a trial or upon a plea of guilty (but not upon a plea of nolo contendere), adjudging a person guilty of a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, to prove any fact essential to sustain the judgment, but not including, when offered by the prosecution in a criminal prosecution, judgments against persons other than the accused. The pendency of an appeal may be shown but does not affect admissibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">\u00b637  The judgment adjudicating guilt specifically states that D.L., after being fully advised by the court and waiving his constitutional rights, entered a guilty plea. There is no evidence suggesting that he entered a <em>nolo contendere </em>plea. In criminal appeals, this Court has consistently held that \u201cprior convictions are presumptively valid, and a defendant who challenges the validity of his prior conviction during a collateral attack has the burden of producing direct evidence of its invalidity.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 188, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 243, \u00b6 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>32 P.3d 750, \u00b6 20 (citation omitted). Further, this Court has held that when DPHHS relied upon a prior conviction to establish an aggravated circumstance, it was not required to present evidence of the circumstance of the conviction. <em>L.M.A.T., </em>\u00b6 36. Here, the certified copy of the judgment adjudicating guilt was properly admitted under M. R. Evid. 803(22), and the State only needed to present the certified copy as evidence of the conviction. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the judgment adjudicating guilt into evidence as proof of an aggravated circumstance pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Issue Three</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b638 <em>Whether the District Court incorrectly concluded thatD.L. \u2019s prior Texas conviction for indecency with a child constituted an \u201caggravated circumstance\u201d under the statute?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\u00b639 D.L. argues that the District Court incorrectly concluded that his prior conviction in Texas for indecency with a child constituted an \u201caggravated circumstance\u201d under \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA. D.L. contends that the Texas crime of indecency with a child is analogous to the Montana crime of indecent exposure, under \u00a7 45-5-504, MCA. He also argues that the State did not introduce clear and convincing evidence that the crime committed in Texas would constitute \u201csexual abuse\u201d as defined by Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b640 The State argues that an aggravated circumstance includes subjecting a child to sexual abuse, and notes that the definition of sexual abuse in Montana law includes indecent exposure.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It contends that the language of the statutes is clear and unambiguous, and thus the District Court correctly concluded that the Texas offense clearly constitutes an aggravated circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">\u00b641 The District Court rejected D.L.\u2019s distinction and concluded that when a court properly finds that a parent has committed an act described in \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA, then \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA, grants the court the authority to terminate the parent\u2019s parental rights. The District Court\u2019s interpretation is not arbitrary and is based on the plain language of the statutes, which are clear and unambiguous. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>set forth earlier, \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA, provides that an aggravated circumstance includes subjecting a child to sexual abuse. Section 41-3-102(22)(a), MCA (2003), defines sexual abuse as \u201cthe commission of sexual assault, sexual intercourse without consent, indecent exposure, deviate sexual conduct, sexual abuse, ritual abuse, or <em>incest...\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b642 In <em>L.M.A.T., </em>the District Court admitted copies of the father\u2019s \u201cJudgment and Sentence and Warrant of Commitment\u201d from Washington State, which provided \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that the father was convicted of attempted rape of a child in the second degree. <em>L.M.A. T., </em>\u00b6 35. This Court held that the plain language of \u00a7 41-3-403(2)(a), MCA (1999) (now \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA), allows a court to conclude that preservation or reunification services are not required if it finds that any of the criteria in the statute are met. We determined that \u201cthe court made the necessary finding that [the father\u2019s] conviction of attempted rape of a child in the second degree qualified as \u2018subject[ing] a child to aggravated circumstances,\u2019 \u201d and that \u00a7 41-3-403(2)(a), MCA (1999) (now \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA) includes \u201csexual abuse\u201d of a child as an example of an aggravated circumstance. <em>L.M.A.T., </em>\u00b6 36. Thus, \u201ca conviction for attempted rape of a child met this definition and the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>L.M.A.T., </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">\u00b643  The facts of <em>L.M.A. T. </em>are similar to the case at hand. D.L. has an out-of-state conviction for the sexual abuse of a child. As this Court previously articulated, \u201cwe must follow the ubiquitous rule under \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, that it is the obligation of the reviewing court, in interpreting a statute or an Act of legislation, to simply ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted.\u201d <em>Montana Power Co. v. Public Service Com\u2019n, </em>2001 MT 102, \u00b6 26, 305 Mont. 260, \u00b6 26, 26 P.3d 91, \u00b6 26 (citation omitted). Since the definition of sexual abuse includes indecent exposure, and D.L. was convicted of at least the equivalent of indecent exposure in Texas, the District Court correctly concluded that D.L. subjected a child to an aggravated circumstance pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Issue Four</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\u00b644 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it terminated D.L.\u2019sparental rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b645 D.L. argues that the District Court abused its discretion by terminating his parental rights based on the commission of a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>that occurred in 1985 and which if committed in Montana would have been a misdemeanor. D.L. contends that the distinction between a misdemeanor and a felony fundamentally relates to the threat level an offender poses to his or her child and thereby relates to whether or not it is reasonable to attempt reunification of the parent and child.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b646  The District Court terminated D.L.\u2019s parental rights based on \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a) and 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA. As stated earlier, these statutes allow termination of parental rights based on the finding of an aggravated circumstance against a child which includes sexual abuse. The court properly admitted D.L.\u2019s Texas conviction of indecency with a child, and this constituted an aggravated circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\u00b647 D.L. claims that the District Court terminated his parental rights \u201csolely\u201d because of his conviction for sexual abuse of a child. However, this is incorrect. In addition to the above evidence, \u00a7 41-3-604(1), MCA (2003), entitled \u201c[w]hen petition to terminate parental rights required,\u201d presumes that if a child has been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, it is in the best interests of the child to terminate the parental rights. D.L. does not dispute that M.A.L., D.L.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and T.L. have been in the State\u2019s care and custody since September 11, 2002-a period of twenty-eight consecutive months to the date of his termination hearing on January 20, 2005. D.L. did not have any significant contact with his children for more than three years. In addition to being adjudicated guilty of the offense in Texas, D.L. failed to complete his court-ordered sex offender treatment plan. The Texas Child Protective Services agency refused to allow A.B. to both remain in Texas with D.L. and keep the children. There was also evidence in the record that M.A.L. claimed that D.L. sexually abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b648  This evidence clearly establishes that maintaining their current placement in a foster home best serves the children\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs. There is substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s findings regarding termination, and it did not abuse its discretion when it terminated D.L.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Issue Five</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\u00b649 <em>Whether the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\u00b650 D.L. argues that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are not supported by substantial credible evidence and are clearly erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>First, D.L. asserts that no evidence was introduced at the hearing to support the court\u2019s findings of fact numbered (1) through (4). Finding (1) identified D.L. as the natural father of the children. D.L. initiated contact with the court by written letter on September 27, 2002, when he first became aware of the youth in need of care action and identified himself as the children\u2019s father. Since this letter was in the record before the court, the court was clearly in a position to make such a finding. Finding (2) identifies the date that the court adjudicated the children as youths in need of care. The District Court is the same court that adjudicated the youths in September 2002, the adjudicatory order is part of the record, and thus this finding is supported by substantial credible evidence. Finding (3) is based upon the District Court\u2019s uncontested findings of fact from the termination hearing of the mother, A.B. Similarly, Finding (4) states when the court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights, and this termination order is also part of the District Court\u2019s record.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b651 Second, D.L. argues that the court\u2019s findings numbered (5) through (11) are erroneous because there was no evidence presented that the documents from Texas concerning the prior conviction were actually referring to him. However, the certified documents all identify and name D.L. as the defendant. Thus it was appropriate for the court to enter these findings. D.L. also claims that these findings are insufficient because the documents the court relied on did not state facts proving that sexual abuse as defined by Montana law occurred. However, the certified copy of D.L.\u2019s adjudication of guilt from the Texas court clearly establishes that D.L. was convicted of a felony sexual offense against a child. D.L. claims that there was no evidence to support the court\u2019s Finding (12), which stated that the children had been in the custody of DPHHS since September 11, 2002. This fact is also in the court\u2019s record.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b652 Third, D.L. argues that Finding (17) is incorrect in stating that the \u201cabove made findings of fact have been proven by clear and convincing evidence,\u201d and he contends that the Texas court documents do not provide clear and convincing evidence that termination of parental rights is appropriate. This Court has explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">[Cjlear and convincing proof is simply a requirement that a preponderance of the evidence be definite, clear, and convincing, or that a particular issue must be clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence or by a clear preponderance of proof. This requirement does not call for unanswerable or conclusive evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>convincing, is somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure-that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><em>L.M.A.T., </em>\u00b6 33 (citing <em>In re E.K., </em>2001 MT 279, \u00b6 32, 307 Mont. 328, \u00b6 32, 37 P.3d 690, \u00b6 32 (citation omitted)). It is the State\u2019s burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that an aggravated circumstance exists, and thus that the termination of parental rights is appropriate. Section 41-3-423(4), MCA. A certified copy of a prior conviction meets the definition of clear and convincing evidence to establish an aggravated circumstance. <em>L.M.A.T., </em>\u00b6 35. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial credible evidence, and its conclusion that D.L.\u2019s prior conviction for a sexual offense against a child constituted an aggravated circumstance is supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Issue Six</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b653 <em>Whether D.L. sufficiently preserved his equal protection argument for appeal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b654 D.L. argues that \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-423(2)(a) and 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA, are unconstitutional and violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States and Montana Constitutions. D.L. contends that the right of a parent to custody of his or her child is a fundamental constitutional right, and that strict scrutiny should be applied to any law that threatens that right. The State asserts that D.L. failed to challenge these statutes on equal protection grounds in the District Court, and thus his equal protection argument is not properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AOr\">\u00b655 It is well-established that this Court will not address an issue presented for the first time on appeal. <em>In re T.E., </em>2002 MT 195, \u00b6 20, 311 Mont. 148, \u00b6 20, 54 P.3d 38, \u00b6 20. We will not fault a District Court for failing to address statutory deficiencies that are not brought to its attention during the proceedings because doing so would encourage litigants to withhold objections rather than raise the issues appropriately in the District Court. <em>T.E., </em>\u00b6 23. As a result, it is necessary to resolve the State\u2019s threshold argument at the outset. The general rule for the necessity of presentation of issues in the lower court for preservation for appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">[WJhere a party fails to raise an issue in the pleadings, does not present argument on the issue during the hearing on the merits of the case, does not move to amend the pleadings to conform to any evidence presented and raises the issue for the first time in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>a post-hearing memorandum which the district court does not address in its order, the issue has not been timely raised and may not be raised on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><em>Nason v.

P. 50(b) motion made after the court entered judgment against him. The State responded to D.L.\u2019s motion by contending that a M. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion was not appropriate under the Rules of Civil Procedure since a jury did not decide the issue of termination of D.L.\u2019s parental rights, and even if the court found that it was applicable to the circumstances of D.L.\u2019s case, he did not meet his burden for prevailing under the Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court denied the motion and held that the motion \u201cmakes substantially similar arguments as those previously made to the Court. The Court has already thoroughly considered and rejected those arguments and will not reconsider them.\u201d Upon review of the hearing transcript, it appears D.L. briefly mentioned a constitutional due process argument during the hearing. However, the District Court did not address D.L.\u2019s argument in its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order, and D.L.\u2019s argument on appeal is that the statutes violate the Equal Protection Clause, which is an argument that he did not raise before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b657 M. R. Civ. P. 50(a) permits a party to move for judgment as a matter of law after the opposing party has been fully heard and prior to the submission of the case to the jury. If such a motion made at the close of evidence is denied, M. R. Civ. P. 50(b) allows the moving party to renew its motion within ten days after the court\u2019s entry of final judgment in the case. Here, D.L.\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion was not properly before the District Court because he was not \u201crenewing\u201d any M. R. Civ. P. 50(a) motion, and regardless, \u201c[a] party cannot raise arguments in its post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) that it did not raise in its pre-verdict Rule 50(a) motion.\u201d <em>Freund v. Nycomed Amersham, </em>347 F.3d 752, 761 (9th Cir. 2003). In D.L.\u2019s reply brief to his M. R. Civ. P. 50(b) motion, he alternatively attempted to change it to a M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) motion to alter or amend. However, the District Court did not address this change in its order denying the motion. Regardless, D.L. could not have raised a new equal protection argument in a M. R. Civ. P. 59(g) motion either, because it is not intended to allow the parties to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>the case under new theories, and cannot be used to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before the judgment was issued. <em>Nelson v.
