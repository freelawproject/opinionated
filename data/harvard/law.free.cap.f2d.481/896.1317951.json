California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), we have carefully reviewed this cause in its entirety, and conclude that there is no arguable merit in the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is therefore ordered that the motion filed by Ray Epps, counsel who ably represented the defendant at trial, for leave to withdraw as court-appointed counsel for appellant is granted and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. See \u2022 Local Rule 20. See also United States v. King, 456 F.2d 1243 (5th Cir., 1972); United States v. Mills, 446 F.2d 1397 (5th Cir., 1971) ; United States v. Minor, 444 F.2d 521 (5th Cir., 1971).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-17\">. The possible issues which could be raised on appeal are as follows: (1) that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a severance; (2) that defendant was denied the presence of counsel at post indictment lineups; (3) that in-court identifications of the defendant were tainted by illegal lineups; and (4) that defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel. An examination of the record reveals that these issues are without merit and that defendant received a fair trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
