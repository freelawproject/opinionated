After a non jury trial the district court concluded that Theriault\u2019s claims were \u201cwithout merit, frivolous and the evidence in support of them totally insufficient.\u201d During the course of the hearing, Theriault was twice cited in contempt, once when he called a witness a \u201cliar\u201d and again when he told the district judge to \u201cstick the whole G\u2014 d\u2014 hearing up your a \u2014 .\u201d The district judge summarily sentenced him to thirty days\u2019 imprisonment for the first contempt and to sixty days\u2019 imprisonment for the second contempt. Theriault appeals from the denial of relief with respect to the jail conditions, and he appeals from the contempt citations. The two appeals were consolidated by this Court by order dated June 15, 1972. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-16\">Theriault was incarcerated in the federal unit of the Mobile City Jail while he was being tried for escape, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751. This particular escape occurred several days after Theriault had been convicted for another escape from federal custody. He was convicted for the second escape as well. During the trial for the second escape, he was cited for contempt on numerous occasions for vilifying the district judge. We have affirmed both convictions and the contempt citations. Theriault v. United States, 5 Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 212 (affirmed the conviction for the first escape, but remanded for resentencing), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 869, 92 S.Ct. 124, 30 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971); United States v. Theriault, 5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 486 (affirmed the new sentence); United States v. Theriault, 5 Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 359 (affirmed the contempt citation and the conviction for the second escape) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-17\">In the present case, Theriault sued pursuant to the \u201cCivil Rights Act,\u201d presumably 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, to relieve allegedly inhumane conditions in the Mobile jail. The district judge held a full hearing allowing Theriault, who represented himself, to interview various officials in the prison. The cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>tion which led to the contempt is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To dramatize his complaints at the jail, Theriault threw his food tray out of the cell, scattering food over the hallway. Then he jumped up on his wash basin and broke it from the wall. When a guard asked what was wrong, he responded that he was too good to eat that type of \u201cslop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">The district judge personally inspected the jail and found the building to be in good repair and all facilities to be in working order and clean. There was an aperture in Theriault\u2019s cell for air and a light. It was \u201cpleasant temperature-wise.\u201d Theriault\u2019s cell was in considerable disarray, but the district judge attributed the disarray and uncleanliness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>to his personal living habits. The menu for the day included beef stew, mustard greens, rice, cornbread, and turnover pies, which the district judge found to be \u201creasonably appetizing and well prepared.\u201d The servings were sufficient to sustain a normal male. Clean linen and coveralls were furnished for the prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">These conditions satisfy the \u201cRegulations Governing Custody and Treatment of Federal Prisoners in Non-federal Institutions,\u201d issued by the United States Department of Justice, and do not violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments. Accordingly, the district judge properly denied Theriault\u2019s claim for relief. See <em>generally </em>Patterson v. Hopkins, 5 Cir. 1973, 481 F.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">The district judge was justified in citing Theriault with contempt for calling the witness a \u201cliar.\u201d By representing himself, Theriault was entitled to as much latitude as is enjoyed by counsel vigorously espousing a client\u2019s cause. <em>See </em>In re Little, 404 U.S. 553, 92 S.C. 659, 30 L.Ed.2d 708 (1972). But Theriault was not properly espousing his cause when he called the witness a liar. As the district judge observed, his \u201cconduct constituted the implementation of a pre-conceived plan to emulate other disruptive trials and was a provocative deliberate and willful attack upon the administration of justice.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">With respect to Theriault\u2019s personal abuse of the district judge in open court and the second contempt citation, we emphasize again what we said in the last <em>Theriault </em>contempt case involving the same district judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-7\">[W]e repeat our comment in another case involving this same defendant that \u201cthe careful, restrained, moderate and responsible way the Judge\u2014 who was not then, nor had he been, engaged in an embroilment or running controversy with Appellant \u2014 handled this situation which was then interfering with the efficient operation of the court comported with Illinois v. Allen, 1970, 397 U.S. 337, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 and Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 1971, 400 U.S. 455, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1258-10\">United States v.
