BROWN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">This appeal involves a single narrow question of law: whether a civilian employee of the Department of the Army, who was wrongfully removed from his position and later ordered reinstated by the District Court, is required to deduct from his back pay his outside earnings <em>from the date of the Court\u2019s reinstatement order to the date of his actual restoration to the </em>payroll<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-17\">On the basis of the briefs and record, we have concluded that the case is appropriate for summary disposition without oral argument. Pursuant to new Rule 18 of the Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Clerk of this Court has been directed to put the case on the summary calendar and notify the parties in writing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Faced with the question stated above, the Court below held (1) that the dismissed employee, Floyd, was entitled to back pay for the period between the date of the Court\u2019s reinstatement order and the date of his actual reinstatement, and (2) that the award was not to be reduced by any \u201cmoney earned by him in private industry\u201d during that period. Of the clear view that this result is erroneous under the Back Pay Act of 1966, 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 5596,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we reverse and modify.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Floyd was removed from his government job in August 1963. Subsequently, in June 1965, he sued for reinstatement. Determining that the removal was wrongful, the District Court on May 4, 1967, ordered that Floyd be reinstated and given back pay. The Government now accepts this ruling. The Court\u2019s order provided also that the Court was retaining \u201cjurisdiction of this matter for further proceedings in regard to back pay and compensation, in the event this matter is not handled to the satisfaction of [Floyd] administratively.\u201d In July 1967, the Government filed a notice of appeal from the reinstatement order, but in August 1967, the appeal was dismissed on the Government\u2019s motion. Eventually, on October 14,1967, Floyd was reinstated to his former position.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In January 1968, Floyd filed a motion to \u201cdetermine and award back pay and allowances,\u201d He contended that the amount of the back pay award as determined by the Government was inadequate, and that he was entitled to a larger amount. In support of this contention, he argued that for the period between May 4, 1967, and October 14, 1967 \u2014 the date of the Court\u2019s order requiring reinstatement and the date of actual reinstatement \u2014 he was entitled to receive his full Government pay \u201cwithout any deductions for money earned by him in private industry\u201d during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Floyd contends, and the Court below held, that once the Court has ordered the reinstatement of the employee, the adverse \u201cpersonal action\u201d is no longer in effect, even though, as in this case, the employee\u2019s actual reinstatement may not be effected for some time thereafter. Concluding that after May 4, 1967, the \u201cpersonnel action\u201d was no longer in effect, the District Court held that there could be no deductions of amounts earned by Floyd through other employment after that date. By this ruling, Floyd was afforded the \u201cwindfall\u201d of double compensation for the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">The result engendered by this construction of the Act cannot be sustained. To the contrary, the plain meaning of the statute is that the period for which deductions for outside earnings are to be made is the same period for which back pay is to be awarded. See note 1, supra. Thus, \u201cthe period for which the personnel action was in effect\u201d cannot be construed to terminate at the entry of the District Court\u2019s reinstatement order. Rather, it must extend to the date of actual reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">To hold otherwise would bring about many incongruities. One would put the Government to the Hobson\u2019s choice: reinstate the discharged employee during the pendency of any appeal, or else face the risk (which indeed became a reality here) that the ultimate loss of the appeal would result in the Government\u2019s losing the benefit of the deduction for outside earnings. In addition to this consequence in appeals, there are also the inevitable administrative delays unavoidable in a big governmental establishment and legitimately related to the process of reinstatement. These and similar factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>would result in unusual burdens to the Government. We do not think that Congress intended to use the Back Pay Act either to sanction Government action or to punish the Government for delays caused by appeal or administrative considerations. We likewise decline to do so. Apart from strange notions of coercive punishment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> any such result would run counter to usual rules of damages which call for full credit to the extent damages have been mitigated. See generally Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 329 (1932); 5 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1041 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is reversed, modified and remanded to require credit for all amounts earned by Floyd through other employment during the period between May 4, 1967 and October 14, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"APt\">Reversed, modified and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">RULES OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">RULE 17</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">DOCKET CONTROL</p>\n<p id=\"Amp\">In the interest of docket control, the chief judge may from time to time, in his discretion, appoint a panel or panels to review pending cases for appropriate assignment or disposition under Rules 18, 19 or 20 or any other rule of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">RULE 18</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">SUMMARY CALENDAR</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">(a) Whenever the court, sua sponte or on suggestion of a party, concludes that a case is of such character as not to justify oral argument, the case may be placed on the summary calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">(b) A separate summary calendar will be maintained for those cases to be considered without oral argument. Cases will be placed on the summary calendar by the clerk, pursuant to directions from the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-18\">(c) Notice in writing shall be given to the parties or their counsel of the transfer of the case to the summary calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-19\">RULE 19</p>\n<p id=\"b781-20\">MOTION TO DISMISS OR AFFIRM Within fifteen days after the appeal has been docketed in this court, the appellee may file a motion to dismiss or a motion to affirm. Where appropriate, a motion to affirm may be united in the alternative with a motion to dismiss. The fifteen day provision may be waived by the court on proper showing of reasonable excuse for delay in filing a motion to dismiss or affirm, upon such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe, or such waiver may be granted sua sponte on the part of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-21\">(a) The court will receive a motion to dismiss any appeal on the ground that the appeal is not within the jurisdiction of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-22\">(b) The court will receive a motion to affirm the judgment sought to be reviewed on the ground that it is manifest that the questions on which the decision of the cause depends are so unsubstantial as not to need further argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-23\">The motion to dismiss or affirm shall be filed with the clerk in conformity with Rule 27 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-24\">The appellant shall have ten days from the date of receipt of the motion to dismiss or affirm within which to file a response opposing the motion. Such response may be typewritten and four copies, with proof of service, shall be filed with the clerk. Upon the filing of such response, or the expiration of the time allowed therefor, or express waiver of the right to file, the record on appeal, motion and response shall be distributed by the clerk to the court for its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>After consideration of the papers distributed pursuant to the foregoing paragraph the court will enter an appropriate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">The time for filing briefs pursuant to Rule 31 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure shall not be tolled or extended by the filing of a motion to dismiss or affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">RULE 20</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">FRIVOLOUS AND UNMERITORIOUS APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">If upon the hearing of any interlocutory motion or as a result of a review under Rule 17, it shall appear to the court that the appeal is frivolous and entirely without merit, the appeal will be dismissed without the notice contemplated in Rules 18 and 19.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">.

The brief filed in this Court on behalf of Floyd contains undertones of this \u201cpunishment\u201d argument. It is true, of course, that to enforce lawful judgments it is sometimes necessary to employ coercive measures, such as contempt proceedings, execution, etc. However, as we have already stated, we do not think that the Back Pay Act was intended to be used as one of these measures.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
