See Murphy v. Houma Well Service, 5 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 804, Part I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">This is an appeal from the denial of a motion to vacate judgment and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-13\">Appellant is serving a three-year sentence for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312, the Dyer Act, having been convicted on his plea of guilty. In his \u00a7 2255 petition in the district court, he alleged that his plea was involuntary and was made in order to receive medical treatment and proper care. He also alleges insanity at the time of commission of the crime and that counsel was rendered inadequate and ineffective due to the failure of the court to inform counsel of appellant\u2019s past history of mental disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-14\">Without holding a hearing, the district court reviewed the transcripts of the arraignment and sentencing, as well as the Rule 20, F.R.Crim.P., removal proceedings, and found that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was voluntarily and understandingly made. The court accordingly denied the \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-15\">Upon examination of the entire record, we find that appellant was carefully and thoroughly questioned as to his understanding and willingness to plead guilty. Appellant represented to the court that he had not been induced to plead guilty, nor had any promises been made to him in exchange for his plea. The district court did not err in finding appellant\u2019s guilty plea was properly accepted by the trial court as voluntarily and understandingly made. Streator v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 395 F.2d 661; Pursley v. United States, 5 Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-16\">The plea of guilty being so entered, appellant cannot raise on motion to vacate the issue of his insanity at the time of the offense. Bell v. United States, N.D.Miss.1966, 265 F.Supp. 311, aff\u2019d 5 Cir. 1967, 375 F.2d 763, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 881, 88 S.Ct. 121, 19 L.Ed.2d 175; Berube v. United States, C.D. Calif.1968, 284 F.Supp. 1, aff\u2019d 4 Cir. 1968, 401 F.2d 773; Davis v. United States, 8 Cir. 1966, 358 F.2d 360; Clay v. United States, 10 Cir. 1962, 303 F.2d 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-17\">As to appellant\u2019s contention that counsel was rendered ineffective by the trial court\u2019s failure to inform him of appellant\u2019s past mental condition, the transcripts conclusively show otherwise. It was appellant\u2019s counsel who, after his first interview with appellant, requested a psychiatric examination on appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-18\">A careful study of the record and transcripts reveals no clear error in the findings and conclusions of the district court and its application of the law. Accordingly, the judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b1268-20\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b1268-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1268-22\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule_12) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
