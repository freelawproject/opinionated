After review, we conclude that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction and thus reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A-V\">\n<em>A. Immigration Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-16\">Akinwale is a native and citizen of Nigeria. In September 1984, Akinwale lawfully entered the United States on an F-l, non-immigrant visa. In May 1987, Akinwale was granted permanent resident status. In March 1993, Akinwale was convicted in state court of trafficking heroin and sentenced to twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment. In January 1995, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) ordered Akinwale to show cause why he should not be deported based on his drug-trafficking conviction, which the INS characterized as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 101(a)(43) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \u201cINA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1308-17\">At his deportation hearing on June 25, 1996, Akinwale, with counsel, conceded his deportability due to his conviction, but requested a waiver of deportation under INA \u00a7 212(c) (1994). The problem for Akinwale was that \u00a7 440(d) of the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24, 1996) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), had amended INA \u00a7 212(c) to expand the types of felonies that rendered an alien ineligible for a waiver of deportation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the June 25, 1996 hearing, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found Akinwale deportable as charged. Due to his drug-trafficking conviction, the IJ also concluded that Akin-wale was statutorily ineligible for a waiver of deportation under INA \u00a7 212(c), as amended by AEDPA \u00a7 440(d). Thus, the IJ denied Akinwale\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) request. Akinwale appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>On March 10, 1997, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision that Akinwale was statutorily ineligible for waiver of deportation under INA \u00a7 212(c), as amended by AEDPA \u00a7 440(d). The BIA also noted that Akin-wale could move to have his proceedings reopened for the limited purpose of challenging the IJ\u2019s deportability determination under <em>Matter of Soriano, </em>Int. Dec. 3289, 1996 WL 426888 (A.G., Feb. 21, 1997). In <em>Soriano, </em>the Attorney General ruled that AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) should be applied to INA \u00a7 212(c) cases pending on AEDPA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>However, the Attorney General recognized \u201cthe remote possibility that an alien who had a colorable defense to deportability may have conceded deportability in reliance on the availability of section 212(c) relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To eliminate that possibility, the Attorney General directed that, upon petition by an alien who had conceded deportability before AEDPA\u2019s April 24, 1996 effective date, that alien\u2019s case should be reopened for the limited purpose of permitting that alien to contest deportability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-4\">Accordingly, on March 26, 1997, Akin-wale requested the BIA to reopen his deportation proceedings. On April 11, 1997, the BIA granted AMnwale\u2019s request and remanded the proceedings to the IJ. On October 3, 1997, the IJ again found Akin-wale deportable and ordered Akinwale deported to Nigeria. Akinwale did not appeal the IJ\u2019s second deportability determination to the BIA, and the time for such an appeal has expired. Thus, Akin-wale\u2019s administrative proceedings are concluded, and Akinwale remains subject to a final deportation order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-5\">\n<em>B. Section 2211 Habeas Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-6\">On February 1, 1999, Akinwale filed his \u00a7 2241 habeas petition asserting that the BIA erred in applying AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) retroactively to his \u00a7 212(c) request. Akinwale asked the district court to issue a writ requiring the BIA to reopen his deportation proceedings and reconsider his \u00a7 212(c) request. In April 1999, the district court dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, but later granted a certificate of appealability on the jurisdictional issue. Thus, we now review whether the district court had jurisdiction over Akinwale\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1309-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-11\">To answer this jurisdictional issue, we first outline the provisions of the AED-PA and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), relevant to review of final deportation or removal orders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We then examine this circuit\u2019s decisions addressing \u00a7 2241 habeas jurisdiction in the post-AEDPA and IIRIRA era. Finally, we outline why the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over Akin-wale\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition under the particular circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-12\">\n<em>A. AEDPA and IIRIRA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1309-13\">Prior to the enactment of AEDPA and IIRIRA, INA \u00a7 106(a)(10) provided that aliens held \u201cin custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review thereof by habeas corpus proceedings.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(10) (repealed 1996). In addition, this Court had recognized that aliens could challenge deportation proceedings through a petition for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Orozco v. INS, </em>911 F.2d 539, 541 (11th Cir.1990). In 1996, however, both AEDPA and IIRIRA restricted certain judicial review in immigration cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>Specifically, AEDPA \u00a7 401(e) repealed former INA \u00a7 106(a)(10), which had permitted in-custody aliens to obtain judicial review of a deportation order through ha-beas corpus proceedings. In lieu thereof, Congress enacted AEDPA \u00a7 440(a), which restricted judicial review as follows: \u201cAny final order of deportation against an alien who is deportable by reason of having committed [certain crimes that carry a deportation consequence under the INA] shall not be subject to review by any court.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(10) (repealed by IIRIRA). AEDPA \u00a7 440(a) became effective on April 24,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-4\">Subsequently, IIRIRA replaced AEDPA \u00a7 440(a) with a new structure for judicial review. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 306. IIRIRA, which became effective on April 1, 1997, contains two sets of provisions relating to review of final deportation orders: the transitional rules and the permanent rules. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4); <em>Alanis-Bustamante v. Reno, </em>201 F.3d 1303, 1306 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Richardson v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1311, 1313 n. 2 (11th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 1529, 146 L.Ed.2d 345 (2000). As summarized in <em>Alanis-Bustamante, </em>Congress has now divided deportation or removal cases into these three categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-6\">(1) Proceedings that culminated in a final order before October 31, 1996 are governed by AEDPA \u00a7 440(a);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-7\">(2) Proceedings that culminated in a final order after October 31, 1996, but that commenced before April 1, 1997 (the effective date of IIRIRA) are governed by the INA as amended by the special transitional rules of IIRIRA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1310-8\">(3) Proceedings that commenced after April 1, 1997 are governed by the provisions of the INA as permanently amended by IIRIRA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1310-9\"><em>Alanis-Bustamante, </em>201 F.3d at 1306-07. Furthermore, four recent cases in this circuit address the availability of \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction post-AEDPA and IIRIRA: <em>Innab v. Reno, </em>204 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Alanis-Bustamante v. Reno, </em>201 F.3d 1303 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Mayers v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir.1999); <em>Richardson v. Reno, </em>162 F.3d 1338 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(\u201cRichardson I </em>\u201d), <em>vacated, </em>526 U.S. 1142, 119 S.Ct. 2016, 143 L.Ed.2d 1029 (1999) (mem.), <em>on remand, </em>180 F.3d 1311 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(\u201cRichardson II\u201d), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 1529, 146 L.Ed.2d 345 (2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-13\"><em>Mayers, Innab, </em>and <em>Alanis-Bustamante </em>are transitional rule cases, and <em>Richardson </em>is a permanent rule case. As outlined later, we conclude Akinwale\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is governed by the transitional rules. Thus, we discuss <em>Richardson </em>only briefly and then focus more on <em>Mayers, Innab, </em>and <em>Alanis-Bustamante.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1310-14\">\n<em>B. Richardson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1310-15\">The removal proceedings in <em>Richardson </em>did not commence until October 1997\u2014 after IIRIRA\u2019s effective date of April 1, 1997. Section 306(a)(2) of IIRIRA contains IIRIRA\u2019s permanent rules and enacts INA \u00a7 242. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. In <em>Richardson I, </em>this Court held that INA \u00a7 242 allows for judicial review in only the federal court of appeals and only after entry of a final order of deportation. <em>Richardson I, </em>162 F.3d at 1378-79. In <em>Richardson I, </em>this Court further held that IIRIRA thus eliminated the district courts\u2019 \u00a7 2241 habeas jurisdiction to review immigration decisions in permanent rule cases. <em>Id. </em>In reaching this decision, <em>Richardson I </em>relies on several IIRIRA provisions, such as INA \u00a7\u00a7 242(g), 242(b)(2), and 242(b)(9). <em>Id. </em>at 1356-79. After <em>Richardson I, </em>the Supreme Court decided <em>Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, </em>525 U.S. 471, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999) <em>(\u201cAmerican-Arab </em>\u201d), and held that INA \u00a7 242(g) applies to only three discrete immigration decisions of the Attorney General \u2014 decisions to \u201ceom-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>menee proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.\u201d <em>American-Arab, </em>525 U.S. at 482, 119 S.Ct. at 943. On June 1, 1999, the Supreme Court issued a one-paragraph order remanding <em>Richardson I </em>for reconsideration in light of <em>American-Arab. Richardson v. Reno, </em>526 U.S. 1142, 119 S.Ct. 2016, 143 L.Ed.2d 1029 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-4\">On remand, this Court in <em>Richardson II </em>reaffirmed its prior conclusion that in permanent rule cases, IIRIRA allows judicial review in only the court of appeals after a final deportation order and eliminates district courts\u2019 \u00a7 2241 habeas jurisdiction \u201cover challenges to removal orders, removal proceedings, and detention pending removal.\u201d <em>Richardson II, </em>180 F.3d at 1315. This time we relied on INA \u00a7\u00a7 242(b)(9) and 242(b)(2), along with the overall revisions throughout INA \u00a7 242. <em>Id. </em>On March 27, 2000, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in <em>Richardson II. See Richardson v. Reno, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 1529, 146 L.Ed.2d 345 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-6\"><em>C. Mayers, Innab, </em>and <em>Alanis-Busta-mante</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-7\">The availability of \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction in transitional rule cases, however, was addressed by this Court in <em>Mayers, Innab, </em>and <em>Alanis-Bustamante. Mayers </em>stresses that whereas <em>Richardson I\u25a0 </em>involved IIRIRA\u2019s permanent rules, <em>Mayers </em>concerns the different transitional rules. 175 F.3d at 1297-98 &amp; nn. 9 &amp; 11.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Mayers </em>then addresses whether \u00a7 2241 habeas jurisdiction survives the enactment of AED-PA, as modified by IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules. <em>Id. </em>at 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"b1311-10\">The <em>Mayers </em>Court held \u201cthat for aliens whose petitions fall within the purview of IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules and who seek review of a final order of deportation, AEDPA\u2019s elimination of \u00a7 106(a)(10)\u2019s grant of habeas jurisdiction does not extend to eliminate the federal habeas jurisdiction previously available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. The <em>Mayers </em>Court stated that \u201c[i]t is important to emphasize ... that in exercising habeas corpus jurisdiction in this case, we do not decide whether every statutory claim raised by an alien is cognizable on habeas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. Instead, the <em>Mayers </em>Court addressed its holding only to the exercise of habeas corpus jurisdiction \u201cover the claims of petitioners here on the question of whether AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) applies to pending cases to deprive petitioners of the ability to apply for a waiver of deportation under \u00a7 212(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300-01. The <em>Mayers </em>Court \u201cdecline[d] to make a broad statement about the scope of habeas corpus relief available to criminal aliens in IIRIRA transitional cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301 n. 17. The <em>Mayers </em>Court \u201cfurther note[d] again that our exercise of habeas corpus jurisdiction in this case is informed by the facts that [the petitioners] were unable to obtain any judicial review and are challenging final orders of deportation, not interim discretionary decisions by the INS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1311-11\">After <em>Mayers, </em>this Court addressed the availability of \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction in two more transitional rule cases. <em>See Innab v. Reno, </em>204 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Alanis-Bustamante v. Reno, </em>201 F.3d 1303 (11th Cir.2000). In both cases, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>BIA had affirmed the IJ\u2019s determination that the alien was statutorily ineligible for waiver of deportation under INA \u00a7 212(c) as amended by AEDPA \u00a7 440(d), the administrative proceedings were concluded, the alien was subject to a final deportation order, and the alien\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenged the retroactive application of AED-PA \u00a7 440(d) to a \u00a7 212(c) request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1312-4\">There is one feature in <em>Mayers </em>and <em>Innab </em>that is arguably different from <em>Alanis-Bustamante. </em>Before filing their \u00a7 2241 petitions, the aliens in both <em>Mayers </em>and <em>Innab </em>had filed a petition for direct review of the BIA\u2019s decision which this Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. As noted above, <em>Mayers </em>expressly states that the exercise of \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction there was informed by the fact that the aliens had sought but been denied judicial review in this Court. 175 F.3d at 1301. The <em>Alanis-Bustamante </em>decision does not indicate that the alien ever filed a petition for direct review of the BIA\u2019s decision in this Court or had such a petition dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. However, even if the alien in <em>Alanis-Bustamante </em>had filed a petition for direct review of the BIA\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) decision, his petition would have faced the same obstacle as the petitions for direct review in <em>Mayers </em>and <em>Innab. </em>Section 309(c)(4)(G) of IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules provides that \u201cthere shall be no appeal permitted in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable by reason of having committed [an aggravated felony].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101, Historical and Statutory Notes (1999). At the time the alien in <em>Alanis-Bustamante </em>would have filed a petition for direct judicial review in this Court, we had not yet decided <em>Lettman v. Reno, </em>168 F.3d 463 (11th Cir.1999), <em>vacated in part, </em>185 F.3d 1216 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Lettman, </em>we held for the first time that this restriction in \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G) does not bar judicial review in this Court regarding whether the petitioner is an alien or de-portable. <em>Id. </em>at 465. <em>Lettman </em>explains that \u201cwe have jurisdiction to decide whether we have jurisdiction; but our jurisdiction disappears if [the alien] is deportable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, prior to <em>Lettman, </em>this Court was dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction such petitions for direct review by aliens deportable due to aggravated felonies in transitional rule cases. For example, in <em>Mayers, </em>we expressly pointed out that this Court had dismissed that alien\u2019s petition for direct review of the BIA order in an unpublished, two-sentence decision prior to the published decision in <em>Lettman v. Reno, </em>168 F.3d 463 (11th Cir.1999). <em>Mayers, </em>175 F.3d at 1294 n. 6.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1312-9\">In summary, the common threads in <em>Mayers, Innab, </em>and <em>Alanis-Bustamante, </em>supporting the exercise of \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction are: (1) that IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules apply; (2) that before filing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>\u00a7 2241 petitions, the alien\u2019s administrative proceedings were concluded and the alien was subject to a final deportation order; (3) that the alien\u2019s petition for direct review of the BIA\u2019s decision was dismissed by this Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the <em>pre-Lettman </em>time period or the alien would likely have faced that same obstacle in filing a petition for direct review in this Court during that same time period before <em>Lettman; </em>and (4) that the alien raised the same statutory issue about the retroactive application of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d). <em>Innab, </em>204 F.3d at 1320-21; <em>Alanis-Bustamante, </em>201 F.3d at 1308 n. 10 &amp; 1311 n. 16; <em>Mayers, </em>175 F.3d at 1301.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-4\">\n<em>D. Jurisdiction over Akinwale\u2019s \u00a7 2211 Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">We now apply the principles of these recent decisions to Akinwale\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. Akinwale\u2019s deportation proceedings began in January 1995, and his final deportation order was not entered until 1997. Thus, IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules apply because Akinwale was in deportation proceedings before April 1, 1997, and received a final order of deportation on or after October 31, 1996. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4); <em>Alanis-Bustamante v. Reno, </em>201 F.3d 1303, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Lettman v. Reno, </em>168 F.3d 463, 464, <em>vacated in part, </em>185 F.3d 1216 (11th Cir.1999). Akinwale\u2019s administrative proceedings are also concluded, and Akinwale is subject to a final deportation order. Because the BIA affirmed the denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief to Akin-wale in 1997, and that denial was well prior to our 1999 <em>Lettman </em>opinion, Akinwale would likely have faced the same obstacle as the petitioner-aliens in <em>Mayers, Innab, </em>and <em>Alanis-Bustamante </em>in filing a petition in this Court for direct review of the BIA\u2019s \u00a7 212(c) decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-9\">Finally, Akinwale raises the same issue as the petitioners in <em>Mayers, Innab, </em>and <em>Alanis-Bustamante: </em>the BIA\u2019s retroactive application of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) in finding him statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c). <em>Mayers, </em>175 F.3d at 1301; <em>Innab, </em>204 F.3d at 1321; <em>Alanis-Bustamante, </em>201 F.3d at 1308. Thus, we conclude that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to review Akinwale\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s retroac- \u25a0 tive application of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) to his \u00a7 212(c) request. Like the Court in <em>May-ers, </em>in allowing Akinwale to seek habeas review under \u00a7 2241, \u201cwe do not decide whether every statutory claim raised by an alien is cognizable on habeas.\u201d <em>Mayers, </em>175 F.3d at 1301. We decide only that habeas review is appropriate here because the circumstances in Akinwale\u2019s case are virtually identical to those in <em>Mayers, In-nab, </em>and <em>Alanis-Bustamante.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">Now that we have answered the jurisdictional question, we point out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number><em>Mayers </em>also held that AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) does not apply retroactively. <em>Mayers, </em>175 F.3d at 1304. Thus, for Akinwale, the next issue is whether, even under pre-AEDPA \u00a7 212(c), the BIA erred in finding Akin-wale statutorily ineligible for this type of relief. There is some indication in the record that the length of time AMnwale has served on his drug-trafficking sentence or the nature of his offense may make him ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief even under pre-AEDPA law. However, we do not decide this issue. The district court is in the best position to answer this question in the first instance as the case proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">Accordingly, we reverse and vacate the district court\u2019s April 13, 1999 order dismissing Akinwale\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">REVERSED, VACATED, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1308-13\">. The pre- and post-AEDPA versions of INA \u00a7 212(c) are discussed at length in <em>Alanis-Bustamante v. Reno, </em>201 F.3d 1303, 1305 n. 6 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1309-7\">. We note that Akinwale's \u00a7 2241 petition states that he requested the BIA to reopen his deportation proceedings a second time on November 27, 1998, but that request was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1309-8\">. We review issues of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. See Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1295 (11th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 2657, 147 L.Ed.2d 272 (2000); <em>Mayers v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 1289, 1295 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1309-17\">.Under IIRIRA, deportation orders are now called removal orders. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1310-10\">. <em>Innab, Alanis-Bustamante, Mayers, </em>and <em>Richardson II </em>were all decided after the district court's order dismissing Akinwale's \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Therefore, the district court was without the benefit of these decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1311-8\">. Similarly, <em>Richardson II, </em>which was decided after <em>Mayers, </em>also emphasizes that <em>Mayers </em>was decided under IIRIRA's transitional rules rather than the permanent rules applicable in <em>Richardson. See Richardson II, </em>180 F.3d at 1315 n. 6. Therefore, most of IIRIRA\u2019s revisions to the INA, including INA \u00a7 242(b)(9), relied on in <em>Richardson I </em>and <em>II, </em>did not apply in <em>Mayers. See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1311-9\">. Similar to <em>Mayers, Richardson II </em>observes that certain factors were crucial to Mayers's decision about the availability of \u00a7 2241 habe-as relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFGb\">(1) the aliens [in <em>Mayers </em>] were subject to a final deportation order after BIA review; (2) the aliens first had filed a petition for judicial review under the INA in the court of appeals before filing a \u00a7 2241 petition; and (3) the aliens had been unable to obtain any judicial review whatsoever in the court of appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ1\"><em>Richardson II, </em>180 F.3d at 1316 n. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1312-5\">. The dismissal of the petition for direct review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in <em>Innab </em>was on July 16, 1998, prior to <em>Lettman. See Innab, </em>204 F.3d at 1320. The time period when Alanis-Bustamante would have filed his petition for direct review in this Court was also 1998. <em>See Alanis-Bustamante, </em>201 F.3d at 1306. The BIA\u2019s affirming the denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief to Akinwale was in 1997, also well prior to <em>Lettman.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1312-6\">. For post <em>-Lettman </em>cases, we point out that in <em>Lettman, </em>this Court had to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1312-7\">decide whether Section 309(c)(4)(G) prevents appeal (thereby depriving us of jurisdiction) when the BIA decides an alien is deportable or whether we have jurisdiction to decide if an alien is deportable. If the BIA\u2019s determination is binding on us, then we must dismiss this appeal. If we can decide whether [the alien] is deportable, then we retain jurisdiction until we conclude he is deportable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avn\">168 F.3d at 464-65. Whether an alien is deportable and whether he should be granted discretionary \u00a7 212(c) relief from such de-portability are two separate issues. Thus, even post <em>-Lettman </em>aliens may still face a \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G) obstacle in seeking review of certain issues regarding the BIA's denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief through a petition for direct review in this Court in transitional rule cases. <em>Cf. Galindo-Del Valle v. Attorney General, </em>213 F.3d 594 (11th Cir.2000) (involving the judicial review restriction in INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), which is similar to \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G)). However, that question is not directly before the Court in this appeal, and nothing in this opinion should be construed as suggesting any answer to that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">. Now that <em>Lettman </em>provides for at least some amount of direct judicial review of certain issues in this Court regarding the BIA\u2019s decision about an alien\u2019s deportability, we note that this Court has not addressed whether a petitioner-alien is required to exhaust his administrative remedies by appealing those issues to the BIA and then petitioning for direct review in this Court before filing a \u00a7 2241 petition in transitional rule cases. However, we do not have to answer that question here because we find that the particular circumstances of this case are more similar to, and thus controlled by, <em>Mayers, Innab, </em>and <em>Alanis-Bustamante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">. Akinwale\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition appears to challenge only the denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief from deportation. However, to the extent that Akinwale seeks review of the determination that he is deportable under the INA, it appears that his claim may possibly be procedurally barred in a \u00a7 2241 petition, as the Government contends. Akinwale appealed the denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief to the BIA, but failed to appeal the IJ\u2019s second deportability determination to the BIA, and thus failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Galindo-Del Valle v. Attorney General, </em>213 F.3d 594, 598 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Mullen-Cofee v. INS, </em>976 F.2d 1375, 1380 (11th Cir.1992), <em>as amended, </em>986 F.2d 1364 (11th Cir.1993). The district court is in the best position to resolve this issue in the first instance. Thus, we leave for the district court on remand to determine whether Akinwale is challenging the deportability determination, and if so, whether that challenge is barred by his failure to appeal to the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
