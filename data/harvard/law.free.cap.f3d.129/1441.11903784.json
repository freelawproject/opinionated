Because we find substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s decision, we deny Lorisme\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-25\">In February 1992, petitioner Lorisme fled his hometown of Fond Palmiste, Haiti, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>the United States naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Members of the Ton Ton Mae-oute (Maeoutes), militant opponents of then-ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, had arrested Lorisme earlier that day at his church for singing a religious song with the words: \u201che is in the air, he\u2019s coming, he\u2019s coming up and he is coming down.\u201d The Maeoutes interpreted \u201che\u201d to mean Aristide and considered the song, despite Lorisme\u2019s lack of affiliation with any political organization, an expression of support for Aristide\u2019s return to power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-4\">As the Maeoutes led Lorisme away from the church, Lorisme convinced them that he needed to reheve himself. Proceeding toward the brush, Lorisme escaped to the coast where he soon boarded a boat for Cuba. Lorisme-\u2019s wife and children remained in Haiti.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1533-5\">After paroling Lorisme into the United States, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated deportation and exclusion proceedings against Lorisme in mid-1995. Lorisme, through counsel, admitted to the INS\u2019s charge of excludability but applied for asylum and withholding of deportation. As grounds, Lorisme expressed fear that, if returned to Haiti, he would suffer retaliation for his escape and his reputation as a supporter for Aristide, who returned to power in October 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-6\">The IJ conducted a hearing at which only Lorisme testified. Lorisme\u2019s counsel, however, introduced sixty-six exhibits into evidence, most of which were newspaper articles, editorials, agency reports and press releases regarding the current political and human rights conditions in Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ orally denied Lorisme\u2019s application in its entirety. Specifically, the IJ found that Lor-isme failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of any of the five statutory grounds for asylum, including political opinion. The IJ expressed concern over Lorisme\u2019s credibility and the lack of physical harm the Mac-outes inflicted upon Lorisme during his arrest. He also rejected the bulk of Lorisme\u2019s exhibits because they were not specific as to the Haitian region where Lorisme lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-11\">On administrative appeal, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s order and dismissed Lorisme\u2019s appeal. The BIA agreed with the IJ that Lorisme did not suffer past persecution in Haiti. The BIA also concluded that Lorisme did not have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion or any of the other statutory grounds for asylum. Unlike the IJ, the BIA did not support its conclusion with a determination that Lorisme lacked credibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, the agency reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1533-12\">We find that the political changes in Haiti, including the dismantling-of Haiti\u2019s military government and Aristide\u2019s return to power in 1994, which were discussed at [Lorisme\u2019s] hearing, are sufficient to resolve any questions of a well-founded fear of persecution raised in this case. While the record contains sufficient evidence that Haiti has experienced some general strife even after Aristide\u2019s return to power, [Lor-isme] has not provided any evidence to indicate that the current Haitian government seeks to harm him or that it is unable or unwilling to protect him from any individuals or groups who may seek to harm him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1533-13\"><em>In re Cereste Lorisme, </em>No. A72 028 494\u2014Miami, at 2 (B.I.A. Nov. 4, 1996) (unpublished) <em>(per curiam). </em>Finally, like the IJ, the BIA rejected Lorisme\u2019s request for withholding of deportation because he failed to satisfy the lower burden of proof required for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-14\">One member of the BIA filed a concurring and dissenting opinion. The board member concurred with the majority\u2019s finding of no past persecution. Unlike the majority, however, she believed that Lorisme did, in fact, have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion. First, she characterized Lorisme\u2019s lack of physical harm as non-determinative. She also deemed the IJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>and BIA\u2019s reliance on improving conditions in Haiti as inappropriate administrative notice \u201cbased only upon an understanding of popular media accounts.\u201d <em>In re Cereste Lorisme, supra, </em>at 3 (Rosenberg, Bd.Mbr., dissenting). The board member pointed to a 1990 intra-INS memorandum regarding asylum policy on Eastern European and Soviet aliens and a 1994 intra-INS memorandum applying a similar policy to Haitian aliens. She also relied on a contemporaneous report that the Department of State issued, advising that efforts to disarm completely the Mae-outes were of limited success.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-4\">Next, the board member criticized the majority for overlooking Haiti\u2019s recent political unrest in analyzing the reasonableness of Lorisme\u2019s fear \u2022 of persecution. She noted that Lorisme\u2019s lack of prominence or celebrity status would assure him little protection. Finally, the board member concluded that the majority abused its discretion in failing to \u201cgive adequate weight\u201d to documentary evidence, such as a United Nations\u2019s press release and an \u201carticle\u201d in the Miami Herald, which Lorisme had submitted. <em>In re Cereste Lorisme, supra, </em>at 4-5 (Rosenberg, Bd.Mbr., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-5\">II. ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-6\">The issue we discuss is whether reasonable, substantial and probative evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision to uphold the IJ\u2019s order denying petitioner Lorisme\u2019s request for asylum for failure to establish a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-7\">III. CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-8\">Lorisme, proceeding without counsel before this court, adopts and incorporates the arguments of the dissenting board member as his own.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, he does not challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusions regarding past persecution or withholding of deportation. Rather, Lorisme appeals only that portion of the majority opinion addressing fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-11\">The INS contends that the BIA did not take \u201cadministrative notice\u201d of changed conditions in Haiti. Rather, the INS argues that substantial evidence in the record, including a Department of State profile, supports the BIA\u2019s finding that political conditions for Aristide supporters significantly improved after his return to power. These changes, the INS claims, included the disarming and dismissing of the Macoutes and local arms of the Haitian government loyal thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-12\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-13\">The INA provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[t]he Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien ... if the Attorney General determines that such alien is a refugee within the meaning of section 1101(a)(42)(A) of [Title 8].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). As relevant to Lorisme, a \u201crefugee\u201d is \u201cany person who is outside of any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself ... of the protection of, that country because of ... a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Both this court and the Supreme Court have emphasized that \u201can alien who satisfies the [applicable standard for asylum] does not have a <em>right </em>to remain in the United States; he or she is simply <em>eligible </em>for asylum, if the Attorney General, in [her] discretion, chooses to grant it.\u201d <em>Martinez-Benitez v. INS, </em>956 F.2d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 443, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 1219, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)). As such, we review the BIA\u2019s decision under the deferential substantial evidence test. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (providing that the reviewing court must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d ); <em>Perlera-Escobar v. Executive Office for Immigration, </em>894 F.2d 1292, 1296 (11th Cir.1990) <em>(per curiam </em>).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We must defer to the BIA unless \u201ca reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-4\">After a review of the record before the BIA, we conclude that substantial evidence supports its decision. First, the implication that the BIA placed dispositive weight on Lorisme\u2019s lack of physical harm lacks merit. The IJ is the only adjudicator to mention this factor, and it is one of many in his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-5\">Next, contrary to the dissenting board member\u2019s view, the majority did not take administrative notice of improving conditions in Haiti after Aristide\u2019s return. The phrase \u201cadministrative notice\u201d does not appear anywhere in the majority\u2019s opinion. Rather, the opinion states, and the record reflects, that the parties \u201cdiscussed\u201d Haiti\u2019s condition at the hearing before the IJ. <em>In re Cereste Lorisme, supra, </em>at 2. If the BIA had truly taken administrative notice, the parties would have had little need to discuss anything since the subject matter would not have been subject to reasonable dispute. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R.Evid. 201(b) (defining a \u201cjudicially noticed fact\u201d as one \u201cnot subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-6\"> Even if the BIA took some measure of administrative notice, it is not inappropriate. The record contains substantial, corroborative evidence of Haiti\u2019s improving conditions. Nearly all of the documents that Lorisme submitted make reference to this notion. While many of these documents focus on the political unrest in Haiti, even after the return of Aristide, it is not for this court to re-weigh the evidence. <em>See Martinez-Benitez v. INS, </em>956 F.2d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.1992). We do, however, note that the dissenting board member\u2019s belief that the majority relied on \u201cpopular media accounts\u201d appears disingenuous in light of her reliance on an editorial, which she labeled an \u201carticle.\u201d <em>In re Cereste Lorisme, supra, </em>at 5 (Rosenberg, Bd.Mbr., dissenting). Additionally, as the dissenting board member recognized, other circuits have expressly authorized the use of administrative notice. <em>E.g., Kapcia v. INS, </em>944 F.2d 702, 705-706 (10th Cir.1991) (approving the BIA\u2019s administrative notice of the Solidarity becoming a part of the Polish coalition government); <em>Kaczmarczyk v. INS, </em>933 F.2d 588, 593-97 (7th Cir.) (approving the BIA\u2019s administrative notice of political changes in Poland so \u201cas to render unsupportable the petitioners\u2019 fears of future persecution\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 981, 112 S.Ct. 583, 116 L.Ed.2d 608 (1991). <em>But cf. Vallecillo-Castillo v. INS, </em>121 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that administrative notice of changed conditions alone will not rebut the presumption of well-founded fear of future persecution once the alien has proven past persecution). Indeed, in another Haitian asylum ease, the former Fifth Circuit arguably approved of the BIA\u2019s ability to take administrative notice of the country\u2019s political conditions. <em>See Coriolan v. INS, </em>559 F.2d 993, 1002-1003 (5th Cir.1977) (instructing the INS, on remand, to evaluate the opinion of Amnesty International because \u201cnewspaper clippings ... can be admissible to demonstrate probable persecution\u201d and the BIA \u201cis even prepared to take administrative notice of a nation\u2019s political conditions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-9\">Although we find substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s decision, we disagree with its finding that Lorisme did not provide any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>evidence to indicate that the current Haitian government is unable to protect him from any individuals or groups who may seek to harm him. Numerous documents, including some referenced in the dissent, speak of the new government\u2019s struggles to disarm and neutralize rural militant groups such as the Macoutes. As Lorisme conceded at the hearing before the IJ, however, these documents discuss \u201cgeneral conditions in the country,\u201d the most recent of which regard, violence surrounding the June 1995 elections. Counsel for Lorisme also admitted that none of the documents specifically addresses the political conditions in Fond Palmiste or other parts of Lorisme\u2019s home region. We have upheld BIA decisions denying asylum to petitioners who introduced far more specific and probative evidence of future persecution. <em>See Nkacoang v. INS, </em>83 F.3d 353, 355 (11th Cir.1996) (denying a South African alien\u2019s petition for review despite evidence that the South African police visited his family\u2019s home the day after they received a telephone call from the alien, who had participated in anti-apartheid activities and was affiliated with anti-apartheid political organizations). Given the characteristics of Lorisme\u2019s documentary evidence, a reasonable fact finder could have found the evidence of improved political conditions more credible than the evidence of Haiti\u2019s inability to protect Lorisme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the BIA properly upheld the IJ\u2019s order (1) denying Lorisme\u2019s application for asylum and (2) denying Lorisme\u2019s request to withhold deportation. Accordingly, we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision and deny Lorisme\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1533-8\">. One of Lorisme\u2019s sons fled to Cuba with Lor-isme, but federal officials later sent him back to Haiti.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1533-15\">. Indeed, the BIA noted that substantial evidence did not support the IJ's conclusion that Lor-isme\u2019s testimony was not credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1534-9\">. We reject the INS\u2019s contention that Lorisme abandoned his petition for review when he adopted the board member\u2019s dissent as his argument. We read liberally briefs filed <em>pro se. See </em>Finch v. City of Vernon, 877 F.2d 1497, 1504 (11th Cir.1989). Had Lorisme written the dissent himself, its contents would clearly satisfy the citation requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(6). The fact that Lorisme, Creole speaking and illiterate, chose to adopt this official's position as his own is perfectly acceptable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1535-7\">. We recognize that Congress repealed section 1105a, effective September 30, 1996. Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, \u00a7 306(b), 110 Stat. 3009. The new judicial review provision can be found in the amendments to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. As the INS correctly points out, however, the repeal and amendments do not apply to the instant petition as Lorisme was still in exclusion and deportation proceedings within 180 days of the effective date.
