GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">Deborah Ann Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d) has moved to dismiss Yong Un Hong and Kyong-Sim Hongs\u2019 (the \u201cHongs\u201d) appeal on the grounds that the Hongs failed timely to order a trial transcript. The Court Clerk of the Fifth Circuit sent the Hongs a letter giving them 15 days from the date of the letter (July 28, 1997) to send the docketing and filing fees for the appeal in this case to the district court clerk and to make arrangements with the court reporter to order and pay for the trial transcript. On August 11, within the 15-day period, the Hongs timely notified the Court Clerk that they had paid the fees and had made arrangements to order and pay for the trial transcript; in fact, they had not ordered and paid for the transcript until August 15, after the 15-day period had run. The Hongs nevertheless contend that the trial transcript should be considered to have been timely ordered because under Fed. R. App. P. 26(c), they should receive three additional days to respond to the court clerk\u2019s letter as the letter was served by mail and it was postmarked the day after it was dated. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 26(c) &amp; advisory committee\u2019s note (1996) (stating that if a party served receives service after the date indicated on the letter, it has three additional days to respond). If Rule 26(c) applies, then Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss the Hongs\u2019 appeal must be denied because the Hongs ordered the trial transcript within that additional three-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-20\">Although we have not specifically decided whether Rule 26(c) applies to permit additional time to file trial transcripts, we have decided similar cases under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e), upon which the pre-1996 version of Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>26(c) was based.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Lauzon v. Strachan Shipping Co., </em>782 F.2d 1217, 1220 (5th Cir.1985), we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-4\">[t]he fact that notice is to be served by mail is not dispositive. The correct inquiry is whether the required actions must be performed within a prescribed period' of <em>filing </em>or of <em>service. If </em>the act is to be taken after filing, the time for action begins to run from that date. If the act is to be taken after service, the three day extension of either Fed. R.App. P. 26(c) or Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e) applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-5\"><em>See also Speck v. United States, </em>No. 93-5144, 1994 WL 745411, at *1 (Fed.Cir. Apr. 20, 1994) (order) (holding that Rule 26(c) applies only where'a party is required or permitted to do something after being served with a paper by a party, not to a time period prescribed by court order).. In this case, the Court Clerk\u2019s letter prescribed a 15-day period for the Hongs to pay the docketing and filing fees and to order and pay for a trial transcript, running from the date of the letter. Because the Hongs\u2019 time for filing a response ran from the date of the Clerk\u2019s letter, not from the date of its receipt, this case is analogous to those eases in which the time for action begins at the date of filing. Accordingly, under case law prior to 1996, neither Fed. R. Crv. P. 6(e) nor Fed. R.App. P. 26(c) would apply to permit a three-day extension of time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The advisory committee\u2019s note to the 1996 amendments to Rule 26(c) state that the main purpose of the 1996 changes was to accompany changes in Rule 25 that permit service on a party by a commercial carrier. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26 advisory committee\u2019s note (1996). Neither the revised text of Rule 26(c) nor the accompanying advisory committee\u2019s note indicates that the changes were intended to allow a three-day extension of time for court prescribed periods of time for filing, and no courts of which we are aware have held that the 1996 amendments to Rule 26(c) made such a change. Had the advisory committee intended to expand dramatically the reach, of Rule 26(c) by making it also apply to court-ordered periods of time for filing, some mention of such an intention would appear in either the revised text of the rule or the committee\u2019s note. Accordingly, we hold that our pre-1996 case law interpreting Fed. R.App. P. 26(c) by reference to Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e) is still valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Thus, we conclude that the Hongs\u2019 trial transcript was not timely prdered. We do npt reach the question of whether. \u201cgood cause\u201d might exist to. enlarge the period for filing the transcript under Fed. R.App. P. 26(b) because Rule 26(b) only applies \u201cupon motion\u201d of a party. The Hongs have not made any such motion, so we therefore must grant Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">IT IS ORDERED that motion of appellee to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion of appellee to dismiss the appeal as frivolous is DENIED AS MOOT. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that appellant\u2019s motion for award of attorney\u2019s fees is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. Prior to 1996, Rule 26(c) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5Ge\">[w]henever a party is required or permitted to do an act within a prescribed period after service of a paper upon that party and the paper is served by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ5\">Rule 26(c) now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acs\">[w]hen a party is required or permitted to act within a prescribed period after service of a paper upon that party, 3 calendar days are added to the prescribed period unless the paper is delivered on the date of service stated in , the proof of service.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A-y\">. Even assuming that the date of the Court Clerk\u2019s letter should be the' date that it was postmarked, the Hongs\u2019 ordering of the trial transcript still would not be within the 15-day period. Thus, we do not decide whether the 15 days should begin on the date the letter was dated or the date it was postmarked.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
