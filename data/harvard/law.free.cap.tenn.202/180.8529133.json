To rewrite the opinion would serve no useful purpose and we, therefore, adopt his opinion as the opinion of this Court. <em>Boillin-Harrison Co. v. Lewis </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>182 Tenn. 342, 345, 187 S.W.2d 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">\u201cComplainant\u2019s suit is for a declaratory judgment upon the question of whether or not it, as a chain store corporation, owning and operating both a wholesale division, consisting of a central warehouse, and a retail division, consisting of 42 retail stores, or outlets, is entitled to the privileges of a \u2018wholesale dealer and job<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ber\u2019 under the provisions of Section 67-3106 T.C.A., and particularly the compensation allowed such wholesale dealers and jobbers thereunder for selling and affixing tobacco stamps to tobacco products.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u201cComplainant is a single corporation and owns and maintains a central warehouse, which it operates in a manner which is, with one exception, identical to that of a wholesale seller or distributor of products; the single exception being that while it is willing to sell to other retail outlets than its own, the facts are it has never made any such sales and does not plan or expect to make any in the future. It also owns and operates forty-two retail stores or outlets in various locations in Tennessee, through which it distributes the products it buys from manufacturers to the consuming public. Its manner of operation, between its wholesale and retail divisions, is described by its president in his deposition, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">\u00a3&lt; \u2018Q. Will you please briefly just explain your method of operations between your wholesale house, and your retail outlets? A. Well, of course our wholesale house received all of our merchandise that we purchase from manufacturers, supplies and processors. We receive that merchandise in trailer loads, car loads and of course some L.C.L., that is less than car load shipment. It is maintained there under a rather modern and rigid control of I.B.M. machinery, which tells us at all times exactly how much merchandise we have in that warehouse, when it moves, what merchandise is on the road coming to us \u2014 in fact, what contracts are made for the year against which we withdraw these various products.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u201c \u2018As the merchandise is maintained and cared for at this warehouse, we receive from our retail stores an order sheet that has been filled out by them, pre-imprinted, and as we receive, this order sheet, through a rather interesting- and intricate process of the I.B.M. machinery, we are able to transpose that order onto a punch card, and this punch card is our part of that particular item from there on to its destination at the retail store level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201c \u2018It serves as our billing unit, our inventory control from the warehouse to the retail store level. We are no different from the average wholesale jobber to other retail stores. They receive their merchandise as we do, and in many cases from just about the same manufacturers and suppliers and producers. They do not all use the punch card control method. I believe K.M.C. Company in town does, but they still receive their merchandise as we do, and they distribute their merchandise or similar products and similar retail stores, just as we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201c \u2018Q. In other words, when one of your retail stores need an item, they will send an order in to the wholesale department? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\u201c \u2018Q. And that order is filled? A. Those instructions come from the manager of our stores. We wait for instructions just like a wholesale jobber would wait instructions from the retailer perhaps that turns his order in to a jobber salesman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">\u25a0 \u201c \u2018Q. When merchandise is issued to the retail store, is that merchandise charged to that particular store? A. Yes, wo must have an account of every one of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>stores, and if the load of merchandise, for instance, goes to our uptown stores, some two blocks away from this point, it is charged to that store, which is known as Store No. 1.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u201cComplainant thus distributes practically all of the products it sells, its president estimating that less than ten per cent of its total products are purchased by its retail outlets directly from suppliers or manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Complainant makes no retail sales from its wholesale warehouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u201cOn May 3, 1954, complainant applied to the defendant, Commissioner, for a permit or license to sell cigarettes as a wholesale dealer, and which license would entitle complainant to receive the compensation allowed wholesalers and jobbers for selling cigarette stamps. On June 7, 1954, the defendant, Commissioner, having sought and obtained the opinion and advice of the office of the Attorney-G-eneral of the State of Tennessee approved complainant\u2019s application and issued it such permit or license. Complainant exercised the privileges accorded it by such permit, or license, from June 7, 1954, but shortly before the filing of the original bill in this cause it was advised by the defendant Commissioner, that his previous action in granting the license, or permit, was in error, and that he did not intend to renew complainant\u2019s wholesale distributor\u2019s license or permit. The record shows that the defendant Commissioner, took this latter action upon the advice of the Attorney-General\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u201cThe office of the Attorney-General, with commendable frankness, concedes its earlier advice to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ant, Commissioner, and its change of opinion and later advice to Mm regarding complainant\u2019s status as a wholesale distributor. That office very properly has joined with the defendant Commissioner in submitting this matter for declaratory judgment with respect to the subject matter of this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u201cThat the question involved is serious and real and one proper for judicial determination is indicated by the fact that it involves the determination of whether or not the Court, through statutory construction, should elide the word \u2018only\u2019 from the statute defining wholesale dealers and jobbers, Section 67-3101(f), T.C.A., providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201c \u2018The term \u201cwholesale dealer and jobber\u201d means persons, firms or corporations who sell at wholesale only any one or more of the articles taxed herein to licensed retail dealers for the purpose of resale only.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u201cThis problem of statutory construction is always a difficult one.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">\u201cThe complainant\u2019s attack upon the action of the defendant Commissioner, and the statutory authority under which he acted is two-pronged. The complainant first says that the defendant Commissioner\u2019s, act in refusing to renew its permit was wrongful because under the statute it is a \u2018wholesale dealer and jobber\u2019 within the meaning thereof, and as such is entitled to a renewal of its license, or permit. But, says the complainant, if it is not correct in this contention, and if the statute be construed so as to exclude complainant from the definition of a \u2018wholesale dealer and jobber\u2019 thereunder and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\u00fcie privileges resulting therefrom, then the act, itself, is violative of Article I, Section 8, and Article XI, Section 8, of the Constitution of Tennessee, and also the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, because it discriminates against complainant and in favor of other wholesale dealers similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u201cThe defense made is that the complainant is not a wholesaler under any possible construction of the statute, because it is not engaged in selling one or more of the articles taxed to licensed retail dealers for the purpose of resale only, and that a construction of the Act which excludes complainant as a wholesaler does not render the same unconstitutional for the reasons assigned, because the classification in the taxing statute is a reasonable one upon a ground which has been recognized and sustained by the Supreme Court of Tennessee in <em>Great Atlantic </em>&amp; <em>Pacific Tea Co. v. McCanless, </em>178 Tenn. 354, 157 S.W.2d 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u201cIn that case the Court considered an attack upon the constitutionality of the Act upon the ground that it violated Article I, Section 8, and Article XI, Section 8 of the Constitution of Tennessee, because it discriminated against retail dealers and in favor of wholesale dealers. The complainant in that case was a corporation which operated numerous chain stores and sold tobacco products \u2018at retail as well as at wholesale.\u2019 The Court commented at page 356 (of 178 Tenn., at page 843 of 157 S.W.2d), \u2018being a retail store, it does not come within the provision of the above quoted statute. \u2019 In sustaining the constitutionality of the Act in that case, and in finding the classification reasonable, the Court said at page 357 (of 178 Tenn., at page 844 of 157 S.W.2d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>\u25a0\u201c 'Applying these \u25a0 principles of constitutional law ...to- the facts of the cause under consideration, several reasons.occur to us as to the object which the Legisla-- \u2022 ture had in mind in the enactment of this statute. Prior ' -to. the enactment of this statute other plans had been tried out by the Legislature, which evidently had proven unsatisfactory. Apparently this latter plan could be executed more economically and more efficiently than the preceding one. In the next place, a wholesaler, as a rule, purchases in much larger quantities than a retailer, and that in and of itself is a well-established principle in our commercial life that entitled him to a discount. Finally, it appears from our taxing statutes that the Legislature in this State has uniformly placed retail and wholesale merchants in different classes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-3\">\u201cThe complainant\u2019s contention, that the word 'only\u2019 should be elided from the statutory provision defining a wholesale dealer and jobber, is upon the ground that unless it is eliminated the Act will be obnoxious to the Constitution and that its elimination will not subvert or destroy the legislative intent in enacting the statute. It contends that the taxing statute in question must be read in <em>pari materia </em>with the Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, Section 69-401, et seq., T.C.A. That Act passed to prevent unfair competition in the sale of cigarettes, both at wholesale and at retail, and it includes a definition of 'wholesaler\u2019 as \u2018any chain of stores retailing cigarettes to the consumer, provided at least seventy-five per cent (75%) of its purchases are made direct from the manufacturer; * * *\u2019. The complainant, in these contentions, is met with two difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u201cThe first is that it is not necessary to elide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>word in question in order to adopt a construction which will save the constitutionality of the Act. The classification in the statute which was found reasonable and upon which the constitutionality of the Act was sustained in <em>Great Atlantic </em>&amp; <em>Pacific Tea Co. v. McCanless, supra, </em>is the same classification 'which would apply to complainant and exclude it as a wholesaler, if the word \u2018only\u2019 i\"s not elided. The Court can find no distinction between the two cases on the constitutional question. In <em>Great Atlantic </em>&amp; <em>Pacific Tea Co. v. McCanless, supra, </em>the complainant was a chain store operator selling at both wholesale and retail and failed to qualify as a wholesaler within the meaning of that term as defined in the Act. It contended that the Act was discriminatory against it as a retailer and in favor of wholesalers. The Court held to the contrary. In this cause, if complainant is not a wholesaler under the Act, (and it cannot he if the word \u2018only\u2019in the statutory provision is given its ordinary meaning and effect) then it is a retailer. Therefore, the reason for eliding the word \u2018only\u2019 in that statutory provision does not exist, as contended by complainant. Nor does the difference in definition of wholesaler in the tobacco tax statute and the Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, if the same be construed in <em>pari materia, </em>create an ambiguity or do violence to the doctrine that statutes upon the sam\u00e9 subject will he construed so as to-make a scheme adopted hv the Legislature consistent and uniform in its operation. It can hardly he said that the lawmakers had in mind a scheme or plan for classifying tobacco sellers which was to prevail throughout the two Acts in question. One is a taxing statute, the other a regulatory measure. One derives revenue for the State, the other purportedly protects tobacco dealers from unfair ciga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>rette competition. It is true that the latter Act includes a definition of wholesaler as any person who is permitted to sell cigarettes at wholesale under the Tobacco Tax Law and makes specific reference to the taxing statute. By this reference it was the obvious purpose of the Legislature to include in the definition of wholesaler in the Unfair Cigarette Sales Law all persons who classified as wholesalers under the Tobacco Tax Law. The Court can find nothing in the two statutes, however, to indicate that the Legislature intended the converse to apply, and the Court is of the opinion that the definition of wholesaler in the Unfair Cigarette Sales Law may not be used to enlarge the definition of that term in the Tobacco Tax Law. Had the Tobacco Tax Law made reference to the definition of wholesaler in the Unfair Cigarette Sales Law, the situation presented would be entirely different. The only purpose in construing statutes in <em>pari materia </em>is to find the legislative intent which must always prevail, and the Court is of the opinion that the Legislature intended in the Tobacco Tax Law to classify as wholesalers only those persons who engaged exclusively in wholesale transactions; whereas, in the Unfair Cigarette Sales Law it intended to include all wholesalers under the taxing statute and in addition other persons such as retail chain stores, etc., as defined therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u201cThe next difficulty with which complainant is confronted is that, in this Court\u2019s opinion, the Legislative intent and purpose in enacting the statute in question cannot -be preserved if the word \u2018only\u2019 is elided therefrom. The Doctrine of Elision is applied where, and only where, in a statute containing an unconstitutional provision there is a reasonable presumption that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Legislature would have passed the Act without the invalid provision. On this question our Supreme Court had said in <em>City of Nashville v. Browning, </em>192 Tenn. 597, at page 605 (241 S.W.2d 583, at page 586):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">\u201c \u2018In determining whether part of an act can stand where another part has been held unconstitutional, a different rule as to presumption is recognized from that which obtains where the whole act is being considered. The general rule that legislative acts are primarily presumed to be constitutional, and that all intendments are to be made in favor of the act to give it effect according to the intent of the lawmaking power, does not apply in such cases, as the upholding of part of an act is not favored; and where a part has been held unconstitutional, and the remaining portion comes up for consideration as to whether it can stand as an independent proposition, the presumptions are generally against it, and it will not be sustained unless that which remains is complete in itself and capable of being executed in accordance with the apparent legislative intent wholly independent of that which was rejected.\u2019 Lewis\u2019 Sutherland Statutory Construction, Vol. 1, p. 583; <em>Malone v. Williams, </em>118 Tenn. 390, 465, 103 S.W. 798.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">\u201c \u2018The Doctrine of Elision is applied with hesitation, <em>Mensi v. Walker, </em>160 Tenn. 468, 26 S.W.2d 132.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201c \u2018Not only is there no presumption that the Legislature would have passed the statute as elided, but there is the contrary presumption that the Legislature would not have passed the statute as elided, <em>Life </em>&amp; <em>Casualty Ins. Co. of Tenn. v. McCormack, </em>174 Tenn. 327, 334, 125 S.W.2d 151.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>\u201c \u2018The rule that the Court can only apply the Doctrine of Elision where there is a reasonable presumption that the Legislature would have passed the Act without the invalid provision, is laid down in a number of other Tennessee cases: <em>Williams v. State, </em>155 Tenn. 364, 292 (293) S.W. 757; <em>Heymann v. Hamilton Nat. Bank, </em>151 Tenn. 21, 266 S.W. 1043; <em>Edwards v. Davis, </em>146 Tenn. 615, 244 S.W. 359; <em>Richardson v. Young, </em>122 Tenn. 471, 125 S.W. 644 (664); <em>Reelfoot Lake Levee Dist. v. Dawson, </em>97 Tenn. 151, 179, 36 S.W. 1041, 34 L.R.A. 725; <em>Franklin County v. Nashville, C. </em>&amp; <em>St. L. Railroad, </em>80 Tenn. 521, 531; <em>Neely v. State, </em>63 Tenn. 174, 175; <em>Bouldin </em>&amp; <em>Saunders v. Lockhart, Chr., etc., </em>62 Tenn. 262, 280.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u201cIt cannot be reasonably presumed that the Legislature would have passed the Act in question here without the word 'only\u2019 included therein. If it had done so it would have destroyed its entire scheme of limiting the compensation to wholesalers only for affixing tax stamps. With the word \u2018only\u2019 elided, any person, firm, or corporation who sells taxed articles at wholesale, regardless of any other type sales they might make would be entitled to the privileges limited to wholesalers under the Act as written. If the word \u2018only\u2019 be properly elided, then the complainant in <em>Great Atlantic </em>&amp; <em>Pacific Tea Co. v. McCanless, supra, </em>would be entitled to a wholesaler\u2019s permit or license as would all persons who happen to conduct wholesale transactions as a part of their business. This Court is not authorized in construing a statute to adopt a construction which will fit the exigencies of one litigant\u2019s situation. The proper construction of a statute must be arrived at from a consideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Act itself and not from its application to a particular set of facts; and if a portion of tire statute must be elided in one case, it must likewise be elided in all cases alike. Tbe legislative intent properly arrived at must meet 'the test of universal application. With this in mind, the Court cannot say that the Legislature would have passed the statute without the word \u2018only\u2019 therein, and thereby conferred the privileges of compensation for affixing tax stamps to all who, as a part of their business, conducted wholesale transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u201cThis Court is of the opinion, therefore, and will declare by decree that complainant is not a \u2018wholesaler dealer and jobber\u2019 within the meaning of Section 67-3101 (f) T.C.A.; that it is not entitled to the compensation allowed wholesale dealers and jobbers for selling and affixing stamps to tobacco products as provided in Section 67-3106, T.C.A.; and that the Act in question is not violative of Article I, Section 8, and Article XI, Section 8, Constitution of Tennessee, or the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\u201cDecree accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We have read with interest the excellent briefs herein, the authorities there cited and have made an independent search and investigation of the authorities.
