Justice TomliNSON</author>\n<p id=\"ABVR\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">The appeal of Cloyd is from a conviction of violating T.C.A. see. 39-3001 reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">\u201c39-3001. Obscene books, ballads or pictures \u2014 Misdemeanor. \u2014 If any person print, publish, import, sell or distribute any book, pamphlet, ballad, or printed paper containing obscene language or obscene prints, pictures, or descriptions, manifestly tending to corrupt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the morals, or introduce the same into any family, school, or place of education, or have the same in his possession for the purpose of loan, sale, exhibition, or circulation, or with intent to introduce the same into any family, school, or place of education, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">It was amended subsequent to the alleged commission of this offense by a 1957 Act, with which we are not here concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">A Captain in the Inspector General\u2019s. Department of the United States Army saw some obscene pictures and vile printed matter in the possession of some person in his command. As a result, this Captain, whose name was Fuhr, went to a public place of business in Knoxville known as Lockett\u2019s. He expressed a wish to buy some such pictures and literature. His testimony is that after some hesitation Cloyd, in charge of the store at the time, sold him six booklets containing pictures and printed matter, and for each of which six booklets he paid this clerk $2. The next day he took them to the Safety Director for Knoxville, turned them over to him and was reimbursed the $12 paid for them the day before. They are in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">This Captain positively identifies plaintiff-in-error as the person who sold him these booklets. Cloyd denies this, and in support of that denial says that his hours on duty did not commence until 4:00 P.M. each day, whereas this Captain testified that he bought these booklets at 1:00 P.M. Cloyd says he was not there at 1:00 P.M. He is corroborated by this by his employer, Lockett. The bill of exceptions is in narrative form, and rather skimpy. But it is true that the foregoing sharply drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>issue of fact was decided by the jury in favor of the credibility of the Captain. Its finding on this score is final here.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\">One ground of the motion for a new trial is that \u201ccertain .evidence was improperly submitted to the jury\u201d. Assignment of error No. 2, relying upon the foregoing ground of a motion for a new trial, is that the Trial Court erred in permitting introduction of certain evidence of a subsequent raid some weeks after the foregoing alleged sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">We cannot consider this assignment of error because Rule 14(5), 185 Tenn. 868-869 provides that errors in the admission of testimony will not constitute a ground for reversal \u201cunless it affirmatively appears that same was specifically stated in the motion made for a new trial in the lower court * * *.\u201d The statement in the motion for a new trial that \u201ccertain evidence was improperly submitted to the jury\u201d is not by any means a specific statement of the evidence objected to. Read <em>Ferguson v. State, </em>166 Tenn. 308, 311, 61 S.W.2d 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Based on the fact that the testimony of Captain Fuhr is not corroborated by other testimony, it is insisted that the conviction is not supported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">This insistence overlooks the fact that plaintiff-in-error was violating the law independent of Captain Fuhr. He was possessing this obscene literature for the purpose of sale, exhibition, circulation, etc. Applicable here is the rule last repeated, perhaps, in <em>Goins v. State, </em>192 Tenn. 32, 39, 237 S.W.2d 8, 12, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">\u201cThe purpose of the detective or governmental agent is not to solicit the commission of, not to create, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>an offense, bnt to ascertain if the accused \"is ei\u00ed\u00bf in an unlawful business, or to entrap the a\u00e9f\u00e9\u00bf\u00cd\u00cdk,l\u00cdt''M&gt; the act of committing an offense which he has reasbii-1 able grounds to believe the accused has- \u00a1commenced, or is about to commence.\u201d /\u2022- .I</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Another assignment of error is that1 \u2022\"Ti'C\u2019.A. sdc1.1-39-3001 violates the 14th amendment to tl\u00ede ifedef\u00e1l C\u00f3li1-\u2019 stitution in that it is, so the brief says, \u201c a1 fiddle 'pocf^e5\u201d* of an uncertainty.
