The counsel for the motion contends that the provisions of Section 1156 apply to causes for new trials which have been developed during the trial of the case itself, and not to the present motion, on the ground of <em>after </em>discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">It would seem to be reasonable and just not to apply the provisions of this section to a party who had discovered facts which it is supposed would reverse the judgment, when the discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>is made after the term had adjourned, and after the ten days from the verdict had expired, provided that due diligence had been used to procure the testimony, but without success \u2014 but to allow him a new trial.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4x\"><em>Preston &amp; Brown, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVLv\"><em>A. S. Hartwell, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"AOb\">Honolulu, February 18th, 1879.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">This was allowed in the case of <em>Lipoa vs. Dowsett, </em>3 Hawn., 623, where the verdict was rendered October 13, 1874, and the motion filed in the opening days of the January term following. In that case the defendants discovered, between the terms, an unrecorded deed necessary to his case, among the grantor\u2019s archives, and a new trial was allowed. But the point now made was not taken in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">I am unable to find authorities upon the question as to the limit of time within which such motions may be made, as it is a matter of statutory regulation in most countries. In the old Digests I find it said that it is never too late to move for a new trial, on a discovery of new facts, if it be done in a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">See Harrison\u2019s Digest, p. 3962.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In the absence of any statutory provision in this Kingdom limiting the time, I think it would be reasonable to entertain such a motion at the next term after the judgment, provided that the judgment had not been executed, or the status of the party (in whose favor the judgment was given) with reference to the land, remained unaltered. In this case, as I am informed that the defendant had surrendered possession to the grantee of plaintiff before the motion was filed, it is too late and I must deny it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
