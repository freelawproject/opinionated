Pukila conveyed his interest to the plaintiff, Kale Aihonua, by deed dated 1st December, 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">The defendant Ahi claims under a lease from Hookano,.who is the grantee of one Hiwauli, who was the son of Nalu, who was the son of Mauolonui or Mauwalenui, a sister of Hiki the patentee, that is, a grandnephew of Hiki.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Kamali, the other defendant, is in possession of the house-lot which he claims under a deed from Moa, the widow. The defendants claim that Hiwauli, being a grandson of the patentee\u2019s sister, is a nearer relative of Hiki than Napoe, who is, as I have said, a son of Nahina, the half-brother of Hiki; both Hiki and Nahina have the same mother Kawaa, and Nahina\u2019s father being Kuuke, and Hiki\u2019s father being Kanemakai.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Kindred of the half-blood inherit equally with those of the whole blood in the same degree, Civil Code, Section 1454. And by Section 1448 of the Civil Code, \u201cIf an intestate dies leaving no issue, nor father nor mother, his estate descends, one-half to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>his widow and the other half to his brothers and sisters, and to the children of any deceased brother or sister by the right of representation.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGd\"><em>W.

Holokahiki, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"AtV\">Honolulu, July 31st, 1883.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">On the death of Hiki, therefore, one-half of his estate descended to his widow Moa, and the other half to Napoe, who was the child of Nahina, the deceased\u2019s half-brother. The statute does not say \u201cto the children and heirs\u201d of. a deceased brother or sister; if it did, Hiwauli, as the grandson of Hiki\u2019s sister, would inherit equally with Napoe. Napoe is one degree nearer Hiki than Hiwauli, and inherits to his exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Judgment must be rendered for the plaintiff for one undivided half of both these parcels of land, with $50 and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
