The mittimus, in describing the offense, is correct as far as it goes, but leaves out the words of aggravation, <em>i.e., </em>that the prisoner was armed with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">It is urged upon me that the mittimus is a \u201crecord\u201d of this Court, that it imports verity upon its face, and that resort cannot be had to any other part of the record to ascertain the real character of the offense for which the prisoner was tried and of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">I consider that the mittimus is a \u201cprocess\u201d and no part of the \u201crecord\u201d of a case. No copy of it is kept in the record. It is the authority by which the officer holds the prisoner. In cases where full light is not afforded by the mittimus, I think resort may be had to the record itself to ascertain what the sentence of the Court was. In the case of the <em>People vs. Cavanagh, </em>2 Parker\u2019s Cr. Reports, p. 650, it was held that \u201cwhen on <em>habeas corpus </em>it becomes material to know of what particular misdemeanor the. prisoner was convicted, in order to determine whether the commitment was legal, resort may be had to the record,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In the case before me, the mittimus, as I have said, omits words which are necessary to completely describe the offense, and which the return of the Marshal shows in full. I cannot say upon this showing that the prisoner has received an illegal sentence, and that, therefore, his detention is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">It is true that there have been several instances where a prisoner has been discharged, the mittimus appearing to express an illegal sentence upon its face, but this was upon the assump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>tion that it corresponded with the judgment of the Court whence it proceeded and that this was itself illegal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqo\"><em>A. S. Hartwell &amp; F. M. Hatch, </em>for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AZg\"><em>Attorney-General Preston, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"AWqm\">Honolulu, June 20th, 1882.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Suppose, however, a case where the sentence of the Court was shown to be illegal and not warranted by the law, but the mittimus showed a legal sentence, would not the prisoner be entitled to be discharged upon <em>habeas corpus? </em>I think he would.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">I think it is requiring too much to insist that there shall be spread upon the mittimus the particulars of the indictment. To illustrate, there is a description of burglary where, if a person enters the dwelling-house of another in the night, even if no breaking be committed to obtain entry, but where a person not a party to the burglary is resident within such house, the offender being armed with a dangerous weapon at the time of entering or at any time while he is within the house, for which offense there is a punishment prescribed of imprisonment at hard labor not more than twenty years. I think it would be sufficient to describe this offense in the mittimus as burglary, and a failure to put therein any one of the somewhat complicated ingredients of the offense described in Sec. 12 of Chap. XIV., of the Penal Code, would not entitle a prisoner to be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">It appearing from the return that the prisoner is held under a valid sentence of a Court of competent jurisdiction having present legal force, I do not feel authorized to discharge him. He is therefore remanded to the custody of the Marshal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
