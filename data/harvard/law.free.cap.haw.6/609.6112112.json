The defendant submits on demurrer whether the covenants in the deed govern the grantor\u2019s <em>komokino </em>right or whether they are qualified by and limited to the words \u201cright, title and interest.\u201d Did the grantor covenant to maintain a perfect right and title or the right and title which he had ?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">Some cases stating the law governing this matter are the following: <em>Sweet vs. Brown </em>12 Met., 175. \u201cThe warranty is of the premises which were granted and conveyed by the deed. But that was \u2018all my right title and interest in and to that parcel of real estate, situate,\u2019 etc. It was not a grant of certain land in general terms, but of his title and interest in such lands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>and this particularly and fully expressed.\u201d <em>Allen vs. Holton, </em>20 Pick., 458; <em>Blanchard vs. Brooks, </em>12 Pick., 47, 66; <em>Ballard vs. Child, </em>46 Me., 152.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Avb\"><em>S. B. Dole, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ai54\"><em>Kinney &amp; Peterson, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"AnW\">Honolulu, April 27th, 1886.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The covenants in a deed are restricted to the grant, and if the grantor conveys only his own right and title in the premises he is not liable upon his covenants of warranty even against persons claiming under his own previous conveyances. In <em>Hubbard vs. Althorp, </em>3 Cush., 419, the Court, referring to some of the above cited cases, say \u201cit is unnecessary to consider particularly the effect of a covenant of warranty in a deed, when the only thing described in the premises is the right, title and interest of the grantors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">It seems to me that no other principle could be supported by reason or authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">It was held in this Court by a single Justice and not appealed to the Court in Banco, in <em>Nakeu vs. Hiwauli, ante, </em>page 596, that the warranty extended only to the matter set forth in the grant, which was that the grantor sustained a certain relationship to the deceased patentee, and covenanted for that right, whatever it might be. It is to be observed that the deed contains no covenant of seizin of anything, and it contains no description by metes and bounds of any premises. Only the words \u201cmy right, title and interest to the <em>komokino </em>right for the said blacksmith\u2019s shop,\u201d are given to define any supposed right to the site of the shop. This is simply unintelligible. A covenant must covenant something having a precise and legal meaning. The conveyance or bill of sale of one blacksmith shop is not, I think, qualified by the words, \u201cright, title and interest,\u201d and the warrant is to defend the sale of that property. The plaintiff\u2019s declaration I hold to be good for that and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">He may amend on payment of all costs to the present time, otherwise the whole demurrer is sustained and the complaint dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
