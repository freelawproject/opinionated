The making of the note and the promise to pay is laid in apt words, and. a copy of the note is annexed to the declaration and made part thereof. The <em>ad damnum </em>is laid at $1200. \u25a0 The note is for $750.21 and interest at ten per cent, per annum; and the principal and interest since September 28th, 1883, when the note was made, would nearly come up to the <em>ad damnum. </em>The amount of the <em>ad damnum </em>laid cannot affect the. case, provided only that the plaintiff can recover no more than he asks for, and he cannot recover in this case, except for principal and interest and costs.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AS0\"><em>Ashford &amp; Ashford, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A_s2\"><em>W. R. Castle, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"AA4\">Honolulu, March 5th, 1887.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">I do not think the declaration is demurrable on the ground stated. The objectionable phrase which names the action may be treated as surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">I therefore overrule the demurrer with costs. Defendants may answer over in four days, and the answer must conform to the Statute of 1876.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
