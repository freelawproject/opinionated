S. A., and carrying on business at Heeia, Koolaupoko, Island of Oahu,\u201d all the property comprising the Heeia Plantation, in consideration of the sum of one dollar, and for other good and valuable considerations, which Mr. McKeague says was the issuance to him of 40,000 shares of the stock of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">The plaintiffs, then, are a foreign corporation carrying on business in this Kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Section 1 of Chap. XI of the laws of 1878, entitled \u201cAn Act Providing for the Service of Process on Foreign Corporations,\u201d requires that there shall be filed in the Department of the Interior within twenty days after commencing to do business in this Kingdom, a designation of some person residing in the principal place of business of the corporation in this Kingdom, upon whom process by authority of or under any law of this Kingdom may be served; and in Section 2 of this act it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>provided that every corporation failing <em>to </em>comply with the provisions of the first section \u201cshall be denied the benefit of the laws of this Kingdom.\u201d The plaintiffs have not complied with this law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Auy\"><em>J. M. Davidson, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AzY\"><em>F. M. Hatch, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"ADS\">Honolulu, January 3d, 1883.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In my opinion this 2d section debars the plaintiff from the right to bring an action in the Courts of this Kingdom in its corporate capacity. It would be manifestly unjust to allow a corporation, which has no legal existence under our laws and which has not designated any person to represent it, upon whom service of process can be validly made, to bring suits, and the statute is clear and explicit that a corporation in such case shall be denied the benefit of the laws of this Kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"Ali\">The King alone has this immunity in this Kingdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The plaintiffs, therefore, cannot maintain these actions and are nonsuited.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
