The plaintiff disclaims as to seven 18-100th acres, being the mauka half, which he admits is-held by the defendant under a lease for twenty years from Kaihe, the patentee, dated September, 1866.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">As to the remaining half, plaintiff claims title under , a lease for eight years from the 10th of October, 1883, dated the 28th of March, 1883, recorded the 26th of May, 1883, from Kailinoe (w.). and her husband Wm.-Needham, and Kaanaana; the.-heirs .at law of Kaanaana 1st, deceased, the grantee of Kaihe by'deed dated October 24, 1866.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">It is in evidence that Kailinoe, lessor of plaintiff, was-born in 1864, of the parents Kaanaana 1st (w.) and Kalawa, and that Kaanaana, the other lessor of plaintiff, was born March 15th, 1866. This last-mentioned person therefore came of age on the 15th of March, 1884. The defendant holds by virtue of a lease from said Kalawa, made on the 9th of December, 1880, for the term of ten years from the 10th of October, 1883, a former lease from the same party having expired on the 10th of October, 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Kalawa was entitled to an estate by the curtesy in the land which his children Kailinoe and Kaanaana inherited from their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>mother, Kaanaana 1st, deceased.

Real Property, p. 307, Ed. of 1860.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">I think that a lease of the land to a third party and notice to quit by him is a sufficient disaffirmance by the heirs of Kaanaana 1st, of the lease to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The lease of the tenant by the curtesy, defendant\u2019s lessor, expired as to one undivided half of the land, on the attaining of the majority of Kaanaana in 1882. A notice to quit was necessary as a pre-requisite to the suit. This was not given until early in October, 1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The estate of the defendant\u2019s lessor of the remaining half (Kailinoe\u2019s) of the land had not expired when the suit was begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Judgment must therefore be for the plaintiff for one undivided half of the makai seven acres; as to the other half, the suit was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">Damages $1.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
