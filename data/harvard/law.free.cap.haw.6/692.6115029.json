Lindsey, E. R. Lindsey and J. E. Lindsey, it is contended that this devise, under the \u201cRule in <em>Shelley\u2019s Case,\u201d </em>gave an estate in fee to Mrs. Lindsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The rule referred to: \u201cWhere the ancestor takes an estate of freehold and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited, either mediately or immediately to his heirs, or the heirs of his body, the word \u2018heirs\u2019 is a word of limitation and not of purchase; so that the ancestor takes the whole estate comprised in the term, that is to say, in the first case an estate in fee simple, in the second an estate in fee tail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">I am of opinion that the rule does not apply in this case; the limitation is not to the heirs of the ancestor (Mrs. Lindsey), but to the children of the testator and of the ancestor, and comes within <em>North vs. Martin, </em>6 Sim., referred to in Tudor\u2019s Leading Cases in Real Property and Conveyancing, etc., p. 614, where the word heirs was construed to mean children, and so to take it out of the operation of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">I therefore declare that Mrs. Lindsey took an estate for life only in the property.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
