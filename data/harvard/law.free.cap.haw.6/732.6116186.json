Section 855 Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\u2022 What is this writ of <em>habeas corpus? </em>In many of the United States there are statutes defining its nature and force; but they are all essentially alike, and are all in substance the same with the English Statute of 81 Car. II.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">It is unnecessary to refer to the different writs of <em>habeas corpus ad testificandum, ad satisfaciendum, </em>etc., which are so named to denote the purpose for which they were issued. The writ always intended, if not otherwise described, is the. writ <em>ad subjiciendum et recipiendum, </em>which was designed to release persons from illegal confinement. The writ was known in English , law long anterior to Magna Charta, which secured the acknowledgment of common rights, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">\u25a0 39. <em>\u201cNullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur aut dis-saisiatur aut utlagetur, aut aliquo modo destruatur; nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terrae.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>40; <em>\u201cNulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, aut diferemus, rectum aut </em>justitiam.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">39. \u201cNo freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or dispossessed, or outlawed, or banished, or in any manner destroyed; nor'will we convict or sentence him, except by lawful judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">40. \u201cTo none will we sell, to none will we deny or postpone, right or justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Lord Chatham, in speaking of- these words in the' House of Peers, used this memorable language: \u201cThey (your ancestors) did not say these are the rights of the great barons, or these are the rights of the great prelates. No, my lords: they said, in the simple Latin of the times, <em>Nullus-liber homo, </em>and provided as carefully for the meanest subject as for the greatest. These are uncouth words, and sound but poorly in the ears of scholars; neither are they addressed to criticism of scholars, but to the hearts of freemen. These three <em>words </em>\u2014 Nullus <em>liber </em>homo\u2014 have a meaning which interests us all; they deserve to be remembered, they deserve to be inculcated' in our minds \u2014 they are worth all the Classics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">After the Charter of Runnymede, the Petition of Right and the Bill of Rights were secured, and the three together form \u201cThe Bible of the English Constitution.\u201d' In 1679 the <em>Habeas Corpus </em>Act of 31 Car. II. was passed. The Act of 56 George III. extended the power of the writ, and enabled the Judge before whom the writ is returned to inquire into the truth of the facts alleged therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">It is common to speak of the <em>privileges </em>thus secured; but no sound jurist or thinker ever admitted that these privileges were anything but common rights under the law of England. The rights of persons in this Kingdom under writs of <em>habeas corpus </em>are, in my opinion, as fully secured by Constitutional' and Statutory provisions as if the famous English guaranties and enactments, with merely verbal alterations, were spread upon our statute books. The writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>enjoyed-here is the same in .substance with the original writ as secured and- vivified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>by the English Acts, Bills and Charters. Anything less than this would make the provisions therefor in our Constitution and Statutes hollow and meaningless, and be contrary to sound rules of legal construction. I must, therefore, be guided by these lights, and by the decisions of English and American Courts, concerning the law of <em>habeas corpus; </em>and I think the practice of this Court has never been opposed to this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">By the Act of 31 Car. II. persons committed or detained for any crime but treason or felony (if they are not persons convict or in execution by legal process) have a right to be brought before the Court on <em>habeas corpus, </em>and the Court within two days must discharge the prisoner, \u201cunless it shall appear that he is detained upon a legal process, order or warrant out of some Court that hath jurisdiction.\u201d The true rule to be gathered from the authorities is, that the function of this writ does not supersede the functions of Writs of Error and Certiorari, Bills of Exceptions and Appeals. The alleged errors of a trial should be reconsidered only by the Appellate Court authorized by law to review them. No power is given, and perhaps none exists, to review the decision of a Judge discharging a prisoner on <em>habeas corpus. </em>Hence the necessity of exercising jurisdiction in such cases with discretion, and according to established principles. The Court will rarely use the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>to effect a reversal of judgment rendered by a Court of competent jurisdiction, the mittimus showing a <em>prima facie </em>legal conviction. The officer\u2019s return, or the record brought up on <em>certiorari, </em>ought to show these legal requirements. If the process is merely voidable, and not actually void, it is regarded as good authority for the confinement of the prisoner until the judgment shall be reversed by the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The petitioner\u2019s plea to the officer\u2019s return neither in legal intendment traverses, nor confesses and avoids, the facts alleged; but it is a demurrer to the legality of the imprisonment. It is claimed that the imprisonment, either at hard labor or otherwise, is illegal:</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">1. Because the mittimus is not duly authenticated as the process of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>2. Because the law does not authorize the imposing of costs as part of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">3. Because the mittimus does not order the Marshal to imprison at hard labor or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">4. Because the law gives the Marshal no discretion or authority to imprison at hard labor or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The first objection has no force, and was in fact not insisted upon. No statute requires the process to bear teste of the presiding Justice; the seal of the Court, with the official signature of the Clerk and the signature of the Justice of the Court who in fact presided, are sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The statute penalty for this offense is a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisonment at hard labor for a term not exceeding six months. A \u201cfine of $300, with $77 costs of Court,\u201d is a sentence within this statute. If the mittimus should command the Marshal to imprison until the payment of an extreme fine of $500 and $77 costs, the statute, perhaps, might sanction such order. The provision for the discharge of a poor convict at the end of one year, if he is unable to pay the \u201cfine, or fine and costs only, or either of them,\u201d for .which he \u201cshall have been imprisoned,\u201d would seem to imply the power to adjudge payment of costs. (Sec. 2, Ch. LI., Comp. Penal Code.) So does Sec. 5, 76., which makes the officer liable if he allows the escape of any person undergoing \u201csentence of Court for payment of any sum as a fine, forfeiture or costs.\u201d On the other hand, Sections 6 and 7, 76., provide for execution to issue on the convict\u2019s property for costs, and that if they are not paid by him or out of his property, they \u201cshall be paid out of the Treasury of the Kingdom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">I will not, however, volunteer an opinion on facts not before me; if such a case should arise, it would properly be reviewable on error to the Full Court. By Section 2 of the same Chapter of the Penal Code, \u201cwhen a fine is not paid immediately following the offender\u2019s conviction he shall be committed to prison, there to remain at hard labor or otherwise, in the discretion of the Court or magistrate, until such fine is paid, or collected out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>the offender\u2019s property.\u201d It may be inferred from this mittimus that the fine was not paid; but imprisonment at hard labor cannot be inferred. Nothing can be presumed against the liberty of the person. The discretionary power of the Court to commit the offender to prison, \u201cthere to remain at hard labor or otherwise,\u201d was not exercised in this instance, and it is not a power which can be delegated to another. The power to pronounce the entire sentence, or to try the prisoner, may as well be delegated. The authority of the Marshal to hold this prisoner as he is doing is not\u2019under this mittimus. Is it under the general law?</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">\u25a0 The Civil Code provides: \u201cWhen any person shall be sentenced to pay a fine, and to be imprisoned until such fine is paid, the time of his imprisonment shall be deemed to discharge his fine at the rate of twenty-five cents a day.\u201d (Section 221.) \u201cEvery person who shall be fined for a violation of any provision of the revenue laws shall, in case he fail to pay such a fine, be imprisoned at hard labor until such fine be paid or remitted, or until he shall have earned a sum equivalent to such fine.\u201d (Section 685.) It is enough to say of these statutes that this case comes under neither of them.- This is not a case of violation of revenue laws. A sentence of fine and imprisonment is expressly provided for in the former section, and no power is there given for the Courts to \u2022 extend a sentence beyond the penalty affixed by law for each particular offense, nor for the Marshal to execute a sentence never pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">By Section 206 of the Civil Code, the Minister of the Interior, with the approval of the King in Cabinet Council, \u201cmay prescribe rules and regulations for the government and discipline\u201d of prisoners. It was suggested that the prison rules authorized the Marshal to imprison Apuna at hard labor; but the suggestion was withdrawn on subsequent examination of the rules themselves. In regard to this portion of the argument, in which it was urged upon the Court that judicial knowledge must be taken of the existence and nature of such rules, I feel bound to say that I am aware of Constitutional provisions which make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>void any rules going to the extent suggested. The discipline of convicts does not include the power to attach penalties not prescribed by statute and imposed by the Court. It is a right of every accused person to know beforehand what penalty- may be imposed by law for the crime charged. It is the right of a person convicted of crime to be informed in open court of the sentence imposed. The statutory power to restrain and govern prisoners has been exercised, however, only within its proper legal limits. \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AFZ\"><em>R. H. Stanley, </em>for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A_5\"><em>S. H. Philli-ps </em>(Attorney-General), for the Marshal.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"ACD\">Honolulu, November 17, 1869.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">I find no authority, therefore, for the Marshal to execute a sentence of imprisonment at hard labor in this case. Nor have I any power to remand the prisoner, in order that such a sentence may be imposed, if deemed proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The petitioner\u2019s counsel argued that a sentence of imprisonment could not have been passed' which should exceed the limit of six months, or which, by force of other statutes, should work imprisonment exceeding six months. The question is not properly before me now, but it should be carefully considered by magistrates, in like cases, in determining what sentence to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Let an order be made discharging the prisoner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
