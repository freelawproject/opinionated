The case is submitted on the papers filed and the notes of evidence taken by the Police Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-16\">In the lease referred to, the plaintiff demises to the defendant for the term of ten years from the 1st January, 1874, a certain tract of land in Makana, Koolauloa, Oahu, at the annual rental of $150. After the \u201cIn testimony\u201d clause, the following words were written before the execution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u201cKoe nae elua loi, 1 no Malia, 1 no Kulaai, i hoolimalima ia e Ahuna.\u201d This would be translated: \u201cReserving, however, two kalo patches, one of Malia\u2019s and one of Kulaai\u2019s, which are leased by Ahuna.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">It is claimed that as these kalo patches are not the property of the plaintiff, and formed no portion of the estate demised, he could in no sense \u201creserve\u201d them, especially as they are described in the clause itself as being \u201cleased by Ahuna,\u201d' the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Certainly here is a \u201cpatent ambiguity,\u201d for this clause is so defectively expressed that no Court could gather the intention of the parties from it. It is not a \u201clatent\u201d ambiguity, for it is not the case of a clause intelligible in itself, which extrinsic circumstances have rendered doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The defendant contends that the evidence submitted is inadmissible under the well-known rules that \u201cparol contemporaneous evidence is inadmissible to contradict or vary the terms of valid written instruments,\u201d and that in cases of patent ambiguities, \u201cthe declaration of the party cannot be admitted to explain his intention, but the clause will be void for uncertainty.\u201d But to every rule there are exceptions; and to the rules above quoted, a well-known exception is that parol evidence may be admitted of. the surrounding circumstances, \u201cso that the Court may be placed, as nearly as possible, in the situation of the party whose written language is to be interpreted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">1 Greenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7295a : \u201cEvery deed ought to be so construed, if it can, that the intent of the parties may prevail and not be defeated.\u201d <em>Worthington vs. Hylyer, </em>4 Mass., 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">It is not until the Court, \u201cplacing itself in the situation in which the contracting party stood at the time of executing the instrument, and with full understanding of the force and import of the words, cannot ascertain his meaning and intention from the language of the instrument thus illustrated;\u201d that it is a case of hopeless uncertainty and the instrument inoperative and void. 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7300.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The evidence, therefore, of a previous lease between the same parties, of the same land, in which Ahuna by a special after-written covenant gives to Kaehukukona the use of those kalo patches of Maluaai\u2019s and Maria\u2019s, for the full term of the lease, <em>i.e., </em>four years from the 1st of January, 1873, is admissible. And the testimony that plaintiff was in possession of these patches at the time of the execution of the new lease is also admissible, for the evidence is merely explanatory of the circumstances in which the plaintiff was situated with reference to the two kalo patches.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Now, the plaintiff reserved \u201chis houses and their foundations,\u201d which were in his possession, and why not reserve the two lois, <em>i.e., </em>the Kaluaai loi and the Maria loi, leased by Ahuna of them, also in plaintiff\u2019s possession, and which he was holding as a sub-tenant by virtue of the former lease?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">It is not an artistic use of language to apply the word \u201creserve\u201d to what was not the lessor\u2019s property, but he had the right of possession of the property under the former lease, and what he meant was that he should retain these lois as long, of course, as Ahuna\u2019s could bind them, that is during the continuation of his leases from Kaluaai and Maria. It was necessary to insert such a provision if he wished to retain them, for he could not continue to hold these lois under the first lease, as the making of the new lease would operate as a surrender of the former one.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The clause retaining these lois expressed, in fact, an additional consideration for the lease itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The defendant, therefore, has no right to deprive the plaintiff of his use of these kalo patches, and is liable in damages for so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The testimony shows that the crop of kalo had been taken by the plaintiff from the patches at the time the lease under consideration was made, so the measure of damages is what the use of these lois was reasonably worth, not what he could obtain for them to lease them, but what he could reasonably have made keeping them in his possession and expending his own labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>upon them, remembering, also, that this is not an action to recover their possession.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AG2\"><em>A. S. Hartwell, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AEF\"><em>R. F. Bickerton, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"A_X\">Honolulu, February 12th, 1877.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">The estimates of value of these patches do not always agree, and they are not very certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Without recapitulating this evidence or commenting upon it, I find for the plaintiff in the sum of $100 and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
