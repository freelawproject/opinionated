No evidence was given of rents and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">This is not a claim to buildings erected on another\u2019s land by permission of the owner, with an understanding that they may remain the property of the person who erected them, and subject to removal by him at his option. At the date of Kaaua\u2019s deed, in 1868, he had no title to the premises to convey, nor could he\u2019 \u25a0give a license for buildings erected thereon.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>S. B. Dole, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AfH\"><em>A. F. Judd, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"A-4\">Honolulu, 15th February, 1872.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b83-3\">The building here in question is a two-story wooden building, erected during the lifetime of the said Nahinu, and is no more to be regarded as personalty because it was occupied by natives than if occupied by foreigners. To declare that a permanent structure of this kind is personal property because natives in former times frequently removed their house frame to another locality, would be to define real and personal property, not by its inherent nature, but by the views of those who held it. Such an adjudication would involve us in a changeable and contradictory system of law. The only safe way is to regard real and personal property as defined, by our statutes, Sections 483 and 484 of the Civil Code, to intend and mean the same kind of property so designated in American, English, and Continental law.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Judgment is ordered for the plaintiffs for the title shown, <em>i.e., </em>one undivided fourth in the premises claimed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Had the defendant rested his claim upon his two undivided fourths in the real estate, costs would have gone in his favor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
