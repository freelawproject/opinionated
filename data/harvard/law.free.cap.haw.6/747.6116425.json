That on or about the 26th of April,-1886, each of said notes being then unpaid, said defendants loaned and advanced to said Afu the further sum of $178, upon the representation of said Afu that he was pressed by Messrs. Hyman Brothers for payment of a debt to them amounting to $120,. the balance of said sum of $178 having been intended by the parties to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Afu\u2019s indebtedness to defendants (including interest on previous loans) to $1200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-4\">4. That Afu discharged said obligation to Hyman Brothers with the money so advanced by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-5\">5. That it was agreed between said defendants and Afu, at the time the last named loan was made (to wit, on or about April 26th, 1886), that Afu should secure defendants in the premises by giving them a mortgage of his stock-in-trade and store furniture at Wailukuj.and that said parties came to Honolulu by the first conveyance thereafter, and had such a mortgage drawn and executed by Afu on May 1st, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-6\">6. That said parties then returned to Maui, when defendants placed Afu in charge of said mortgaged premises as their agent, under the terms of said mortgage (which is hereby referred to and made a part hereof), and that said Afu continued so in charge as salesman, and on June 17th, 1886, paid to defendants, as proceeds of sales of the property so mortgaged, the sum of $236.90, which was then, and still is, the only payment or amount of money received by said defendants on account of said amounts so by them loaned and advanced as aforesaid, or any of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-7\">7. That on the 21st day of June, 1886, Messrs. Hoffschlaeger &amp; Co., of Honolulu, petitioned this Honorable Court to have said Afu adjudged a bankrupt, and said Afu was so adjudged on, to wit, the 28th day of June, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-8\">8. The plaintiff was elected assignee of the estate of said Afu on July 13th, and qualified on July 14th, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-9\">9. The records in the cases of <em>Bankruptcy of Afu, </em>and <em>See Hop &amp; Co. vs. J. H. Soper et al., </em>are referred to, and made a part of this statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-10\">10. That plaintiff has, to wit, February 16, 1887, duly demanded payment of said sum of $236.90 from said defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-11\">The question is: can the plaintiff recover, in view of the foregoing facts, upon the pleadings herein, or whether defendants shall take judgment upon their set-off or counter-claim herein?</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b762-12\">Honolulu, April 18, 1887.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>Whiting &amp; Creighton, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A_7b\"><em>Ashford &amp; Ashford, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AES\">May 7, 1887.</decisiondate>\n<seealso data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"Ag1a\">See <em>See Hop &amp; Co. vs. ParJce, ante, </em>688.</seealso>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b763-3\">Decision of</p>\n<author id=\"AMRj\">McCully, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">This case is submitted to the Court, the jury being waived, on an agreed statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Upon consideration of them and of the records referred to, I think judgment should be for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The finding of the Court in the case of <em>See Hop &amp; Co. vs. Soper </em>(in Banco, January Term, 1887: see VII Hawn.) was, that the giving of the mortgage, found to be fraudulent, was in itself an act of bankruptcy. The payment of this amount ($286.90) was directly in pursuance of the mortgage and the possession thereunder. This fact will distinguish this payment from payments which might be made by a person actually insolvent to creditors not colluding with him in a fraudulent transfer of his whole property. The diligence and assiduity of a creditor who secures payments from a debtor, who afterwards becomes bankrupt, is a different thing from the receipt of realizations from property transferred by fraud, which itself works bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">I do not regard the payment of money under the former circumstances as such a \u201ctransfer of property\u201d as contemplated by Section 14 of the Bankruptcy Act (1884) ; but the act in question is the payment of money received for property so transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
