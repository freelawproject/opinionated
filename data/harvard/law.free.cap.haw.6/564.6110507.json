R. Castle, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"Ay1\">Honolulu, March 23d, 1885.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">One Ho Sam had an execution against Ah Hong, issued October 30, 1884, upon judgment confessed and entered October 29, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The executions of plaintiff were subsequent to that of Ho Sam on the same day. The plaintiff\u2019s attachments were levied long prior to the issuing of Ho Sam\u2019s execution. .</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The question is as to priority of lien between- prior attachments and a subsequent execution. Section 1124 of the Civil Code provides that in all cases of attachments, \u201call after leases, mortgages, sales,' bequests, assignments, trusts, or other conveyances of said property (attached), until the dissolution of the process, shall be void in law as against the plaintiff in such cases.\u201d Section 1021 of the Civil Code provides: \u201cEvery officer receiving a writ of execution issued in due form by any Court, or justice, shall note thereon the day and hour of its receipt, and he shall give priority in levying upon property of the defendant in execution, to the writs received by him according to the order of time in which they are received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The object of an execution is to collect the money on a judgment by a levy on and subsequent sale of property of the defendant in the execution. Such a sale would be void as to any prior attachments under Section 1124, until the dissolution thereof, and if the sale under such execution would be so void, then the execution itself must be postponed to the lien of the attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s attachments were never dissolved. This necessitates judgment for the plaintiff for the amount he claims and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">In analogy to the laws of many of the United States, the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent executions might be held, if necessary, to relate back to the time of the issue of the attachments on their judgments respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Let judgment be entered for the amount claimed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
