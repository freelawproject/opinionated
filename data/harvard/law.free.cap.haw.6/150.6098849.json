So that it is evident that the infant Kama Aho, by right of his mother, is tenant in common of the land with his aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">\u25a0 The bill goes on to recite that Ahuna, one of the defendants, with the consent of the other defendant \u2014 who is, or has been as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>said before, tenant in common of the land \u2014 has cultivated several crops of kalo and disposed of them to his sole use, and has a crop of kalo now matured; and that both of these defendants refuse to deliver over any part of the kalo now on the land, and to account for any part of the preceding crops, and the prayer is: \u201cThat the defendants deliver over to the plaintiff his just share of the present crop, and account for his just share of the former crops, and that a partition be made of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u25a0\u25a0 It appears by the answer and proofs that the mother of Kalemela and Naaleokahualoa was alive until very lately, and that all the cultivation which the defendant (Ahuna) did, except the crop that is now in the ground and one before, were cultivated by the permission of the said mo'ther; so that the whole matter is reduced to the crop now in the ground and the one preceding.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The plaintiff says that he is entitled to the profits of the land after his mother-in-law\u2019s decease and during his wife\u2019s life-time, that is, for one. crop, by virtue of his marriage, and that she could not make a will which, after her decease, would bar him of his curtesy during his son\u2019s minority. The statute regarding the right of married women to make wills reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u25a0 Civil Code, Sec. 1464: \u201cAny married woman may dispose by will, of all property belonging to her in her own right, in like manner as a person under no disability might do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u25a0 And the statute regarding a husband\u2019s curtesy in the wife\u2019s estate reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Civil Code, Sec. 1286: \u201cProvided, that in case his wife shall first die, the husband legally married as aforesaid, shall cease to have control over the immovable and fixed property of his wife, and the same shall immediately descend to her heirs as if she had died sole, unless there happen to be legitimate issue of the:m\u00e1rriage within the age of legal majority; in which case the husband shall continue to enjoy a curtesy in said immovable or fixed property, until such issue shall attain- majority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>when the same shall descend to the heir or heirs of the body of the wife.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AKv\"><em>A. S. Hartwell, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A7f\"><em>S. B. Dole, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"Aqq\">February 13, 1875.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b166-3\">The proofs disclose the facts that the plaintiff and his deceased wife Kalemela lived apart; that by her authority whilst so living apart from her husband, Ahuna, one of the defendants, cultivated the patches which were her property, and in consideration thereof supplied Kalemela with the necessaries of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">To this occupation and use of the land the husband did not object. It was a natural and reasonable use of the land under the circumstances, and the husband must be presumed to have assented to the disposition which the wife made of the property. This will certainly dispose of the crop which preceded that now in the ground, and the tenancy with the consent of the husband is established. The defendant Ahuna commenced to plant the crop now standing under the arrangement above indicated, and during the year Kalemela died. It will follow that the tenant is entitled to such time as is necessary for his crop to mature and be gathered; and the plaintiff again must be presumed to have assented to the crop being put in by the defendant on the terms agreed by the wife, and consequently can have no interest in the crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">This view of the case renders it unnecessary to decide in this case whether the curtesy of the husband is barred by the will of the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The land should be divided between Naaleokahualoa and the infant son of Kalemela; and the defendant, Ahuna, should remove his kalo from the infant\u2019s portion as soon as possible. John E. Barnard, Esq., and Curtis J. Lyons, Esq., are appointed commissioners to divide the land. Thus it will be seen that the question of right by curtesy does not affect this case, and the plaintiff being guardian for his son, it probably will not arise between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Costs to be divided equally between the parties, one half to the plaintiff and one half to the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
