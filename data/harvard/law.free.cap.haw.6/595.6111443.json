AUSTIN, Assignee in Bankruptcy of J. P. Amaral <em>vs. </em>CHAS.

Section 12 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1884, authorizes the assignee to bring suits for debts due the bankrupt, and also any suit which has for its object the recovery of any portion of the bankrupt\u2019s property. But assignees can take only such choses in action as are of an assignable nature. An action for assault or for seduction could not pass to executors or assigns; and we may say generally that no action of which the gist consists of injury to the feelings or in which injury or insult is an aggravation, can be assigned, voluntarily or by operation of law. The allegation here is of injury to the bankrupt\u2019s credit, whereby he was driven into bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">In <em>Brewer vs. Dew, </em>11 M. &amp; W., 625, in an action of trespass brought by assignees in bankruptcy for seizing and taking-.the.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>bankrupt\u2019s goods under a false and unfounded claim of debt by which he was annoyed and prejudiced in his business, and believed by his customers to be insolvent, and certain lodgers left his house: Held not to pass to assignees in bankruptcy under the statute that all the personal estate and effects of the bankrupt vest absolutely in the assignees, and the act is construed beneficially for creditors. The test in this case was that under' the declaration the jury might give vindictive damages beyond the actual injury to the property.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5vp\"><em>The Plaintiff and F. M. Hatch, for </em>plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A9I\"><em>L. A. Thurston, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate id=\"AWJ\">Honolulu, August 22d, 1885.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The assets pass to the assignees. They may bring action for goods taken away or injured. But the bankrupt\u2019s commercial credit is not among his assets, and the assignees cannot bring action for an injury to it. The complaint alleges a special damage for which only the person injured can bring action. <em>Clark vs. Calvert, </em>8 Taunt., 742; <em>Howard vs. Crowther, </em>8 M. &amp; W., 601; <em>Spence vs. Rogers, </em>11 M. &amp; W., 191; and <em>Rogers vs. Spence, </em>12 Clark &amp; Fin., 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The demurrer is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
