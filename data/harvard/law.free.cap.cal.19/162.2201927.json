In his petition, Ludekins set forth that during the year 1857, and a part of 1858, he was engaged in merchandizing in the city of Sacramento, as a member of the firm of Ludekins, Yesaria &amp; Co.; that said firm, in order to carry on their business, were compelled to purchase goods on time of merchants in San Francisco and elsewhere, and trade being dull, became largely involved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">In his schedule he describes the debt due plaintiff as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\"><em>\u201c </em>List of liabilities due from Ludekins, Yesaria &amp; Co.

The first is headed \u201c List of Liabilities,\u201d and concludes thus: \u201c Total amount of liabilities, $2,614.68.\u201d The second is headed \u201c Schedule of Assets,\u201d and concludes: <em>\u201c </em>Total, $5,964.48,\u201d following which is a statement of household furniture claimed as exempt.

On the twenty-ninth day of October, 1859, the plaintiffs commenced suit in the Twelfth District Court upon the judgment which they had recovered in the Sixth District Court. In this complaint the plaintiffs aver merely that a judgment was recovered by them as above stated, and that it still remained due and unpaid. The defendant answered by setting up his discharge in insolvency, and also contended that no action could be maintained in one District Court upon a judgment recovered in another District Court in this State, without showing some special circumstances. The Court below decided both these questions against the defendant, and gave judgment for the plaintiffs. Defendant then moved for a new trial, which being overruled, he appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-7\"><em>Geo.

The judgment did not merge and extinguish the note so as to prevent the indebtednesss being described in its original form. <em>(Dresser </em>v. Brooks, 18 Barb. 429 ; <em>Imlay </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>14 Cal. 176 ; <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Strode, </em>7 Id. 431.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number><em>M. Compton, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-4\">Proceedings in insolvency are unknown to the common law, or to the general jurisdiction of any Court. They are a mere privilege created by statute, and like all statutory proceedings in derogation of the common law, must be strictly pursued. (<em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>5 Cal. 195 ; 5 Bac. Abr. 389 ; <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Strode, </em>7 Cal. 478 ; <em>Judson </em>v. <em>Atwill, </em>9 Id. 477 ; <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Kohlman, </em>8 Id. 44 ; In the matter of Wend. 19 John. 153.) Applying these principles to this case, respondents contend that the insolvent Court had no jurisdiction either of the subject matter or of the creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-5\">I. The Court had no jurisdiction of the subject matter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-6\">The papers which conferred jurisdiction were fatally defective in not stating the necessary facts. These are special proceedings. <em>(Harper </em>v. <em>Freelon, </em>6 Cal. 76.) The District Court, in taking cognizance of them, is not acting as the District Court at all, but merely as a special commission, and is therefore an inferior Court. In cases where the proceedings of Courts of inferior jurisdiction are concerned, the jurisdiction will not be presumed. <em>(Mills </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>19 John. 33 <em>; Racock </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>1 Sand. 73, 74, <em>passim ; Yates </em>v. <em>Lansing, </em>9 Johns, 437 ; <em>Bridge </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>4 Mass. 641 ; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Howard,, </em>10 Conn. 514 <em>; Rex </em>v. <em>Oakley, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Adol. 307.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-7\">It was necessary, therefore, that the insolvent should state in his papers distinctly every fact which was necessary to give the discharging officer jurisdiction. <em>(Salter </em>v. <em>Tobias, </em>3 Paige, 338 ; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>3 Wend. 247 ; <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>1 Conn. 316 ; <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Stearns, </em>19 John. 41 ; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Stafford, </em>1 Caines, 349 ; <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 John. 300.) In these cases, \u201c the petition, schedule and affidavit are the pleadings on the part of the petitioner, who is the plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Kohlman </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>6 Cal. 320.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-8\">The papers are fatally defective, and show that the Court had no jurisdiction in the first instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-9\">1. The insolvent petitioned the Court instead of the Judge \u201c having original jurisdiction.\u201d (Wood\u2019s Dig. 496, sec. 2.) 2. The petition is not signed by the insolvent, but by an attorney. (Id. 501, sec. 5.) 3. The schedules are not signed by the insolvent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>(Id. sec. 3.) 4. The schedule of losses is insufficient. There is no list of losses. (Id. 496, sec. 3.) The statement that he \u201c has lost large amounts by bad debts, as well as by the depreciated condition of -business, high rates of interest' and heavy expenses, as mentioned in the petition herewith filed,\u201d is wholly insufficient and not a compliance with the law. It is not a list either in law or fact, or in the common acceptation of the term; it is a vague, unmeaning and contradictory statement. List is <em>\u201c </em>to enroll, to register; a catalogue.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Dic.) This means that there should be an enumeration of the various items constituting the aggregate or sums total. The provision of the statute is strict. Its object was to prevent fraud. 5. There is no averment in the petition that the debts set forth and described were not created in whole or in part for public funds, or property of whatever nature or kind; or as an unfaithful depositary.; or for funds received by him as a banker, broker or commission merchant; or for money, goods or effects received by him in a fiduciary capacity. (Wood\u2019s Dig. 500, sec. 30 <em>; Sackett </em>v. <em>Andross, </em>5 Hill, 327 ; <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>5 Cal. 195 ; <em>Maples </em>v. <em>Burnside, </em>1 Denio, 332 ; <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Schuyler, </em>2 Id. 73 ; <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>6 Ely, 67 ; <em>Salters </em>v. <em>Tobias, </em>3 Paige, 338 ; 7 Johns. 75 ; 1 Conn. 316 ; 3 Wend. 247 ; 6 Id. 433.) This is a matter of allegation and not of proof. <em>(Stuart </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>16 Cal. 501.) These are jurisdictional matters, and are defects that may be taken advantage of at any stage of the proceedings. (Bacon v. <em>Page, </em>1 Conn. 404.) The question of jurisdiction is always open. <em>(Elliott </em>v. <em>Peirsol, </em>1 Pet. 328 ; <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>4 Conn. 382; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>6 Pick. 232; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Toucey, </em>7 Conn. 64 <em>; Glenn </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Gill &amp; John. 493.) 6. The insolvent did not file his books with the insolvent Court as required by section seven of the act. It is a prerequisite, the omission of which will debar the discharge. (Wood\u2019s Dig. 497 ; <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>His Creditors, </em>8 La. 391; <em>Montesqui </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>4 Id. 55 ; Id. 200.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">II. The Court had no jurisdiction of the creditors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\">1. The notice to the creditors is insufficient. They are not cited to appear within thirty days from the date of publication. (Sec. 8.) There is no time mentioned on the return day of the notice for them to appear. The notice summoning them to appear does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>run in the name of the People of the State of California. (Const, of Cal. art. VI, see. 18.) By the Constitution of this State, \u201c the style of all process shall run in the name of the People of the State of California.\u201d By the same Constitution, <em>\u201c </em>no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\u201d (Art. XI, sec. 8.) The notice in this case summoning the creditors to appear must be regarded as a process. It is equivalent to a summons and performs the same office. <em>\u201c </em>Process is the means of compelling the defendant to appear in Court.\u201d (2 Chitty\u2019s Blackstone, 13, title Process.) This is the only means by which the creditors are brought into Court, and unless it is a process it is nothing at all, and the Court cannot acquire jurisdiction over the creditors. If it is a process it must run in the name of the People of the State of California. Indeed, the act itself regards the notice in the character of a summons. (Sec. 10.) 2. There was no assignee appointed. This is a condition precedent. (Sec. 1.) 3. The record does not show that the creditors met on the return day, or ever refused to appoint an assignee; nor does it show that an assignee was ever appointed by the Court or creditors, and there is no other mode for the appointment of an assignee. It follows therefore that no legal assignment of the insolvent estate was ever made, as required by sections one and eighteen of the act. <em>\u201c </em>All assignments executed for the benefit of creditors are void, if not made in conformity to the statute of May 4th, 1852, entitled 'An Act for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors and Protection of Creditors.\u2019\u201d (Ch<em>eever </em>v. Hayes, 3 Cal. 471.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-5\">III. The discharge is void, because no judgment of discharge was ever entered or docketed as required by law. (Prac. Act, sec. 204.) A discharge under the insolvent act is not a mere chamber order, but a judical act of the Court. <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>McIl</em>hany, 6 Cal. 286.) The paper filed and signed by the Judge, purporting to be a discharge, is, therefore, nothing more than a chamber order and not the act of the Court. The insolvent could only be discharged in open Court and by judicial act of the Court. <em>(Hall </em>v. Hudson, 28 Ala. 284; <em>Lentilhon </em>v. <em>City of New </em>York, 3 Sandf. 721; <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>1 Davies, 381.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b167-6\">IV. The statement of indebtedness by the insolvent is not suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ficient. In cases of bankruptcy, fraud is presumed on the part of the insolvent, contrary to the general rule. <em>(Menpez </em>v. Lalmsay, 1 Mart. La. R. 734.) Even as a question of pleading, the statement is defective. If the statement is susceptible of constructions, the one most against the party pleading must be adopted. (1 Chitty\u2019s Plead. 514, 522.) Averments are necessary to avoid intendments against the pleader. (Mitf. Plead. 240.) As a question of statutory construction, statutes of this description which are intended to deprive the creditor of all remedy for the recovery of an honest debt should be strictly construed, and should not be extended by implication beyond the fair and legitimate meaning of the terms used by the Legislature. The Legislature not only intended that the insolvent should give \u201c the names of the creditors, the amount due to each creditor and the cause and nature of such indebtednes,\u201d but \u201c when it accrued; \u201d and also, \u201c a statement of any existing judgment.\u201d (Wood\u2019s Dig. 426, sec. 3.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-4\">The case of <em>Imlay </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(14 Gal. 173) and the one at bar are widely different. In the former, the judgment was obtained in the interim and during the pendency of the insolvent proceedings. In this case, the judgment was obtained on the twenty-fifth day of June, 1858, and more than three weeks prior to the filing of the insolvent proceedings, and was an existing judgment debt at that very time, and no judgment is set up or even alluded to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-5\">Our statute limits the discharge to such debts and liabilities as are owing at the time of the application and named in the schedule attached to the petition. (Wood\u2019s Dig. 500, sec. 24.) And so the case of <em>Imlay </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>decides. This debt was a judgment debt and contract before the filing of the insolvent proceedings. \u201cJudgments are contracts,\u201d says Parsons on Contracts, vol. 1, p. 7. If it was a judgment contract, then, and existed prior to the filing of the proceedings in insolvency, it -was incumbent on the insolvent to set forth the judgment, and the time when it was rendered, (or created) or it cannot be effected by the discharge. (See secs. 3 and 24 of the Act.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-6\">V. If the judgment upon which this action was founded was the origninal debt in a new form, the original debt was lost on the third of June, 1858, (twenty-one days before the insolvent pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ceedings were filed) and merged in this judgment. As the statute has in view only such debts as existed at the time of the application and the form in which they then existed, this debt cannot be affected by the discharge. The judgment not only operated as a bar by way of merger to the suit brought upon the original cause of action, but could only be declared on in debt as an obligation of record and not in assumpsit. <em>(Bank of U. S. </em>v. <em>Merchant\u2019s Bank, </em>7 Grill, 415 ; <em>Napier </em>v. <em>Gideon, </em>1 Spear\u2019s Eq. 214 ; <em>Colt\u2019s Estate, </em>4 W. &amp; S. 314 ; <em>Andrew </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>9 Johns. 162 ; <em>Boston India Rubber Factory </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>14 Vt. 92 ; Am. Lead. Gas. 713.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-4\">VI. The insolvent having made the statement in the schedule that the debt then set out was a promissory note in suit, he is bound by that statement, and is now estopped from controverting it, or from insisting that it exists in any other form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\"><em>Moore, </em>for Appellant, in reply to the defendant\u2019s brief, took substantially the positions contained in the opinion of this Court on the petition for rehearing.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-6\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AKh\">Field, C. J. and Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The only point we think it necessary to notice- is, whether the record of the insolvent proceedings of defendant was fatally defective, in this, that the schedule described the debt as a note of a certain tenor in suit in a certain Court, when, in fact, the debt had passed into judgment a short time before the filing of the insolvent petition. We think this variance not fatal. The direction of the statute is to require the petitioner to describe and identify the indebtedness; and a mistake as to the condition of that indebtedness\u2014as \"whether reduced to judgment or not\u2014is not of essential importance, if the indebtedness be so described as that the holder of it can readily identify it. We think this could easily have been done by the description given in the schedule. If suit were pending in a distant county, it might be impossible for the insolvent to know at the time of filing the petition whether judgment had been taken or not; and we see no loss or injury to the creditor by a designation of the indebtedness in this form. Indeed, it fulfills all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>substantial purposes of the requirement. (See <em>Imlay </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>14 Cal., and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">2. There is nothing in the point that suit could not be brought in one District Court on a judgment recovered in another. (See <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Hoy, </em>in this Court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">It is not necessary to notice the other points.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"b170-7\">On petition for rehearing, Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AtO\">\u2014Field, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Petition for rehearing. Upon the main question passed upon in the opinion, which was the effect of the variance in the form of indebtedness described in the defendant\u2019s petition in bankruptcy from that in proof\u2014a judgment instead of a note\u2014we adhere to our conclusion that, under the circumstances, this mistaken description did not avoid the bankrupt\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Many technical questions are made by the respondents\u2019 counsel, and as it is deemed important as matters of practice that they be now settled, we propose briefly to notice them.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">1. The first objection to the insolvent proceedings offered in evidence and ruled out is, that the District Court, before which the proceedings were taken, had no jurisdiction, in this : that the petition is addressed to \u201c the Court, and not to the Judge.\u201d This exception is entirely too technical. The District Court has jurisdiction of the matter, and the Judge constitutes the Court; and as this is not a chamber proceeding, it is difficult to see why this address is not sufficient. Indeed, the words \u201cJudge\u201d and \u201c Court\u201d are in this and other places used as convertible terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">2. That the petition is not signed by the insolvent, but by an attorney. The answer is, that the statute does not require any signature of the insolvent to the petition. It must be verified by him, but may be signed as any other pleading. The thirty-third section (Wood\u2019s Dig. 497) does not touch this point; that section merely providing that an agent <em>shall not make </em>the application, oath, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">3. That the schedules are not signed by the insolvent. All the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>lists of assets, losses and liabilities are made out together, and signed by the insolvent. This is enough, at least, to protect the proceeding from collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">4. Notice to creditors insufficient. Several points are taken in this connection, but they are not sustained by the record. The notice is not process, and if it were, the form of its address is not a fatal error going to the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">5. That the schedule of losses is insufficient. We see no fatal defect in this respect. But it is not necessary to go into this matter, or the subsequent errors assigned ; for, upon the theory of the respondents\u2019 counsel, that the District Court, in matters of insolvency, is in the exercise of a special jurisdiction, and that the strict rules applicable to such Courts apply, it is clear that the Court acquires its power to act by the filing of the petition, or at most, by the petition <em>and notice; </em>and that after this, the acts of the Court are movements within the jurisdiction, and not conditions to it.
