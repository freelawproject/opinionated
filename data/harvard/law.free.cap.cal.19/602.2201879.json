Plaintiff filed a counter statement, but afterwards, at a meeting of the parties before the Judge at chambers to settle the statement, informed the Judge and defendants that the statement need not he settled, as he would consent to a new trial; whereupon, defendants gave notice of a motion to withdraw their motion or proceedings for new trial.

May 20th, 1861, in vacation and before the Judge at chambers, the parties met to have the statement settled, when plaintiff informed defendants\u2019 attorney and the Judge that \u201c no statement need be settled, for the reason that he would consent to the order granting a new trial. Whereupon, the defendants gave notice and filed a motion withdrawing their motion for new trial. The proceedings were then adjourned till Saturday, May 25th, 1861; \u201d at which time the Judge refused to permit defendants to withdraw \u201c the motion for new trial,\u201d set aside the judgment and granted a new trial.

J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac1\">This is an appeal from an order granting a new trial. The plaintiff recovered a judgment, and the defendants gave the proper notice, and filed a statement of their grounds. The plaintiff filed a counter statement, but afterwards consented that a new trial might be granted. The defendants, upon receiving notice to that effect, asked leave to withdraw their proceedings, which was refused. A new trial was granted against their objections, and the appeal is taken by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We are satisfied that the order was irregular and should be reversed. The defendants had a right either to move or not to move upon the notice which had been given. Neither the plaintiff nor the Court had the power to control them in that respect. Choosing to abandon their proceedings, it was undoubtedly competent for them to do so. The order seems to have been based upon the idea that a motion was actually pending. This was not the case; and even if it were, the defendants had a right to withdraw it. All that had been done, however, was to give the notice and file a statement. The motion was never, in fact, made.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
