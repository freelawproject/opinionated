That on the twenty-first day of January, 1851, Jos\u00e9 Bolcoff was seized in fee and in possession of the Rancho Refugio, of which the premises in controversy are part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">2. That on that day said Jos\u00e9 executed to plaintiff a mortgage upon one league square of the Rancho Refugio, embracing the premises in controversy, to secure the payment of $4,600 with interest at five per cent, per month, money then due plaintiff from said Jos\u00e9\u2014the mortgage being acknowledged and recorded in February, 1851.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">3. That on October 8th, 1851, said Jos\u00e9 Bolcoff conveyed to Juan and Francisco Bolcoff all his interest in the Rancho Refugio, which conveyance was acknowledged and recorded in November following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">4. That Nov. 16th, 1852, said Jos\u00e9, Juan and Maria Candida Bolcoff executed and delivered to Baldwin and Ramsey an agreement to sell and convey to them eighty acres of the Rancho, forty acres of which were on the east side of a Laguna, and \u201c on which Baldwin\u2019s house now stands,\u201d and the other forty acres were to be located on the other side of the Laguna under the direction of Baldwin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-9\">5. That they entered into possession of the land in controversy and continued to occupy it until Oct. 18th, 1853, when they executed and delivered to defendant Parsons a conveyance of all their interest in one of the forty acre tracts described in said agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-10\">6. That Ramsay, on the eighteenth of October, 1853, sold and conveyed to Baldwin all his interest in the remainder of his possession in the Rancho; and on the twentieth of December, 1855, Baldwin sold his interest in the Rancho to defendant Dunlap, who then entered into and still remains in possession of a part of the land in controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-11\">7. That Juan and Francisco Bolcoff, on the twenty-fifth of November, 1852, conveyed to defendant Parsons a portion of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>described in the complaint, being forty acres adjoining the two forty acre tracts of Baldwin and Ramsay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-4\">8. That on the nineteenth of March, 1853, an accounting was had between Juan and Francisco Bolcoff and the plaintiff of the amount due on said mortgage of January 21st, 1851, and the amount was found to be $7,008, for which sum a new note was given plaintiff by said two Bolcoffs, drawing interest at three per cent, per month, secured by a mortgage made by them of a portion of the Rancho Refugio, including the premises described in the complaint and in possession, at commencement of this suit, of defendants Parsons and Dunlap, the old mortgage being satisfied of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">9. That on the thirteenth of April, 1855, plaintiff brought a suit against Juan and Francisco Bolcoff and Parsons to foreclose said last named mortgage, and a decree of foreclosure was entered against defendants July 2d, 1855, and ordering the. land sold to pay the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">10.

C. Willson, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b297-13\">I. The facts found and the conclusions of law stated do not warrant the judgment, because a legal title in defendant is not nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>essary to defeat an ejectment. <em>(Garner </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>9 Cal. 268; <em>Arguello </em>v. <em>Edinger, </em>10 Id. 150.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-4\">II. The contract under which defendant claims possession was entered into prior to the date of the mortgage under which plaintiff claims, and he took the land subject to defendant\u2019s equitable lien. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Dopkins, </em>3 Cal. 391.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">III. Under said contract the defendant was entitled to possession until the Bolcoffs therein named gave him a sufficient deed; and the possession of Baldwin and Ramsay, under whom defendant claims, at the time plaintiff took the mortgage in 1853 and released the one executed in 1851, of itself gave plaintiff notice of their equity. <em>(Bird </em>v. <em>Dennison, </em>7 Cal. 297; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>8 Id. 461.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">IV. Although defendant was a party to the foreclosure suit, the decree embraced no interest acquired by defendant prior to the date of the mortgage in 1853, while defendant\u2019s interest under said contract or bond was of date 1852.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-7\">[The above points are inserted as if presented on the argument of the case, while in fact there was no appearance for appellant; but these points, with the authorities, were embodied in the statement on appeal, and are therefore inserted.\u2014Rep.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-8\"><em>R. F. Peckham, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-9\">The judgment of the Court was correct.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-10\">1. The agreement between Bolcoff and Baldwin and Ramsay was to convey the whole premises. Two of the parties, Jos\u00e9 and Maria A. Bolcoff, had nothing to convey. Juan Bolcoff had only an undivided half of the land. Francisco Bolcoff, who had the other half, was not a party to said agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-11\">2. The- equitable relief to a legal cause of action in ejectment should be a cross bill or counter claim to have plaintiff declared a trustee for defendant, and, in a case like this, for a performance. No performance is prayed in this Court; and if so, could not be .granted, because the proper parties are not before the Court. Appellant\u2019s remedy, if any, was by bill against the proper parties for a specific performance and a stay of proceedings until the same \u00ab.could have been heard'.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>3. There is no finding that the agreement was ever recorded, or that plaintiff had- actual notice thereof, or that Baldwin or Ramsay were in the possession\u2014actual, open or notorious\u2014of any land in said agreement at or before the mortgage to plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-6\">4. There were two separate forty acre tracts of land comprised in the agreement. One was described as forty acres on the east side of the Laguna, and on which Baldwin\u2019s house now stands, (then stood) ; the other forty acres to be located by the County Surveyor. There is no finding as to which of the forty acre tracts was conveyed by Baldwin and Ramsay to Parsons, or that any portion of it is within the premises demanded, or that there was ever any location by the County Surveyor, or that Baldwin ever had a house on the land in controversy, or that there is a Laguna either on, or east or west of the premises in controversy.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b299-7\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the</author>\n<p id=\"A3q\">Field, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The decree is affirmed. Although an equitable defense may be set up to an action of ejectment, as is the settled law. in this Court, yet all the elements going to constitute such a defense as against the legal title should be distinctly set up and proved. We see nothing in the findings, to which we are restricted by the manner in which this defense is presented, to show such notice of the claim of the appellant Parsons, either by possession or otherwise, as would entitle us to pronounce in its favor. Such facts should have been distinctly found by the findings, as to show the defendant\u2019s equity as against the plaintiff\u2019s claim. This does not seem to be the case, and we must therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
