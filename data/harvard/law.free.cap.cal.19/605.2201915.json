Defendant\u2019s attorney spoke to the counsel in the cause on trial, and was informed that the cause would occupy till the usual recess. He also spoke to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and told him that he wished to leave the Court for a short time ; and was informed by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney that the plaintiff was ready for trial, and if the defendant\u2019s attorney left, it would be at his own risk. The defendant\u2019s attorney then left the Court to attend to some private business of his own, first directing his son to remain in Court, and to come for him (defendant\u2019s attorney) immediately on the close of the evidence in the case on trial. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>son, at the conclusion of the evidence in the case on trial, endeavored to find the attorney, but failed to do so in time, not having gone to the place where his father instructed him he would be found. The action was tried in the absence of defendant\u2019s attorney, and a verdict rendered for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-4\">\u201c Defendant now appears on affidavits, which, with the counter affidavits of plaintiff, show the above facts, and a- general affidavit of merits to set aside the verdict and judgment rendered herein, and for leave to come in on a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-5\">\u201c I do not think the whole affidavits show such surprise, inadvertence or excusable neglect as would justify setting aside the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">\u201c The Court waited some time for defendant\u2019s attorney, and sent an officer to his office for him, but he could not be found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-7\">\u201c The case of <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Collyer </em>(2 E.

The application was addressed to the legal discretion of the Court; and upon the affidavits before us, we cannot undertake to say that this discretion has been improperly exercised. The recent case of <em>Haight </em>v. <em>Green </em>is decisive of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
