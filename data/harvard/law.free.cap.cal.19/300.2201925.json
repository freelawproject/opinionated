There is nothing in the record showing that the demurrer was ever acted upon. Defendants subsequently answered, and after evidence on both sides, a verdict was rendered for plaintiffs, upon which they had judgment. Defendant moved for a. new trial mainly upon the ground that the complaint did not contain a sufficient description of the premises to support the judgment. Judgment set aside, and new trial granted on the ground, as stated by the Judge below in his opinion, that the land was not described by \u201c metes and bounds \u201d as the statute requires. From the order granting a new trial plaintiffs appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>William, C.

If the premises were defectively described, the point should have been raised by special demurrer. (Practice Act, secs. 41, 42 ; <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>5 Cal. 40 ; <em>Boll </em>v. Better, 16 Id. 432.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\">II. The description was sufficient to support the verdict and judgment. (Cases above; <em>United States </em>v. Sutherland, 19 \"How. 263 ; , <em>Stanly </em>v. <em>Green, </em>12 Cal. 432.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-6\"><em>John Reynolds, </em>for Respondent, argued that the demurrer filed was sufficient to raise the question of the insufficiency of the description ; and that this Court will not interfere with the action of the Court below in setting aside the judgment, citing Practice Act, sec. 58; <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Boss, </em>16 Cal. 357; <em>Weddle </em>v. <em>Stark, </em>10 Id. 301; <em>Cappe </em>v. <em>Brizzolara, infra.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b301-7\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"Aq\">Field, C. J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The verdict and judgment were set aside by the Judge below, upon the ground that the premises were not sufficiently described. The complaint describes the land sued for in this wise : \u201cAll that certain tract or parcel of land situated in Napa county, consisting of a preemption claim of one hundred and sixty acres of land, and commonly known as the Soda Springs, and embracing said improvements thereto belonging, and being about five miles from Napa in a northerly direction.\u201d It is true, the statute requires the premises to be set out in the complaint by metes and bounds; but this is only a directory provision, for a failure to comply with which the pleading is liable to a special demurrer. If the premises are described otherwise sufficiently to identify them according to the general rules on the subject, the plaintiff may, after verdict, take judgment, and the defendant cannot set it aside on motion, on account of this defect, any more than for any other defect of pleading on which a special cause of demurrer could be assigned. <em>Prima facie </em>the premises are sufficiently described to make the complaint a good foundation for a judgment, and the Court erred in setting aside the judgment for this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Order reversed, and judgment to be entered on verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
