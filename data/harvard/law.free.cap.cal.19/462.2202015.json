HAGER.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b462-4\">In this case\u2014suit for delinquent taxes in Colusa county under the Act of 1860, (Stat. 1860, 246)\u2014the complaint having set forth various items, as State tax, General County Bund, School, Building, Indigent Sick and Contingent tax, demurrer was filed and overruled, and answer filed. Plaintiff then moved, without notice to defendant, to strike out answer. Granted, and judgment at once entered for plaintiff for the full amount claimed : <em>Held, </em>that, as there appears to be no authority for levying the Contingent and Building tax, the complaint shows no cause of action as to these items, and that the judgment is thus far unauthorized and will be set aside.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b462-5\">Cause remanded, with permission to defendant to set up any defense he may have.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b462-6\">Appeal from the Fifteenth District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">The case demands no further statement of facts than appears from the opinion and the syllabus. Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-8\"><em>A. C.

J. and Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">The judgment by default in this case is erroneous. The judgment is for, among other things, Contingent tax, and, for the year 1859, for Building tax, levied by the Board of Supervisors. We have been referred to no authority for levying these items, and yet judgment is given for them. The judgment, so far, is wholly unauthorized\u2014the complaint showing no cause of action as to those items. As judgment was rendered in the absence of defendant, we think it best to remand the case, that he may set up his defense, if he has any, except as above indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
