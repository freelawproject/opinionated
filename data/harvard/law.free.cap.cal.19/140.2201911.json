The right of trial by jury in all common law actions is secured by the Constitution of this State.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b140-11\">A point as to waiver.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b140-12\">Appeal from the Sixth District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-13\">Suit to recover $3,850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-14\">The complaint contains nine ordinary assumpsit counts, for work, labor and services, and money paid, laid out and expended by A. Keefer for defendant\u2014the amount being assigned by Keefer to plaintiff. The work and labor counts were for taking charge of and protecting from trespassers the timber on a ranch owned by defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ant, building fences and bridges, constructing roads leading to a toll bridge, cutting and stacking hay, etc. The counts for money paid, etc., were: one for purchasing a yoke of oxen, and another general count. The answer consisted of a general denial, and of eight counter claims, for money loaned by defendant to Keefer, use and occupation of a house and tract of land, tolls due, hire of oxen, cows, mules and other chattels, timber cut and carried by Keefer from defendant\u2019s land with his permission, crop of grass sold, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-4\">The cause, when called regularly to be set for trial, was referred by order of Court, without any motion to that effect by either party, to a referee for trial; defendant excepting. The cause was heard by the referee, both parties appearing and introducing evidence. On the hearing, a stipulation was entered into between the parties, to the effect that certain testimony taken on a previous trial of the cause by a reporter \u201c may be used in evidence before said referee; and the objections and exceptions therein may be considered as made and taken before said referee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">Judgment was entered on the report of the referee in favor of plaintiff for $2,335.

The case is strictly at law. It is neither a bill in equity nor an action of account. The defendant was entitled to a trial by jury. (Const, of Cal., art. I, sec. 3 ; <em>Smith </em>v. Pollack, 2 Cal. 92 ; <em>Russell </em>v. Elliott, Id. 245 ; <em>Cahoon </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>5 Id. 294.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-8\"><em>E. B.

Had defendant negatively tried the case before the referee so as to protect his rights, it is not insisted that this would have amounted to a waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>of his constitutional right to a jury; but when he affirmatively stipulated to make a large mass of evidence, previously noted by a reporter, proper evidence before the referee, he then, by his own express sanction, indorsed the reference ; gave respondent to understand that he accepted that mode of trial, and waived his objection thereto. He had as much right to do this, as he had to try the case before eleven jurors or a less number. (7 How. Pr. R. 42; 3 Comst. 511 ; <em>Lee </em>v. Tillotson, 24 Wend. 557 ; 6 Hill, 48 ; 5 Id. 468 ; <em>Ubsdell </em>v. <em>Root, </em>3 Ab. Pr. R. 142.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b142-4\">Cope, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"Axh\">Baldwin, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">This case was tried by a referee, and upon his report a judgment was entered for the plaintiff. The order of reference was made without the consent and against the objection of the defendant. The action is an ordinary suit at law for the recovery of a debt, and in such cases the parties are entitled to a trial by jury, if they desire it. The ground of the reference was, that a trial of the case would require the examination of a long account; and the Court acted no doubt upon the supposition that the statute afforded the requisite authority for the order. But the Constitution provides, that \u201c the right of trial by jury shall be secured to all, and remain inviolate forever; \u201d and if such a construction of the statute could be maintained, we do not see why this right might not be entirely swept away by legislative enactment. The framers of the Constitution regarded the right of the citizen in this respect as too sacred and valuable to be intrusted to the guardianship of the Legislature, and the provision referred to was intended as a restriction upon legislative authority. We have repeatedly held, however, that this provision of the Constitution did not extend to equity causes, but was limited in its operation to those cases in which the right of trial by jury previously existed. An intentional violation of the Constitution on the part of the Legislature is not to be presumed, and by construing the statute as solely applicable to proceedings in equity, we avoid even a seeming conflict between the two instruments. We have no doubt that this construction is in accordance with the inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tion of the Legislature ; but whether it is or not, it is certain that no other effect can be given to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The point that the defendant subsequently waived his objection to the reference, is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
