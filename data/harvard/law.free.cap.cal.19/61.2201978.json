Davis was also to purchase of plaintiff a mule team and harness for 81,000, to have the use of the team\u2014though the possession was to remain in plaintiff until the team was paid for. Davis delivered some lumber, but not within the time, nor in the quantity <em>agreed; </em>he also delivered other lumber on general account, and plaintiff advanced money from time to time. Davis then called on plaintiff for a settlement of their accounts, stating that he wished to' know whether the team was paid for, so that he could sell it. l\u00edo settlement was <em>made; </em>but in speaking of selling the mules to defendant, plaintiff said to Davis, \u201c Let Urton have them.\u201d Davis subsequently sold the mules to Urton, and plaintiff now sues for them: <em>Held, </em>that this remark, taken in connection with the accompanying circumstances, was an assent and authorization of a sale to Urton by Davis of the property as that of Davis, and upon such terms as they might agree on. See facts.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b61-5\">Appeal from the Fifteenth District. \u2018</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">Replevin for four mules and their harness, with damages for their detention\u2014the complaint alleging, among other things, that defendant had conspired with one Davis, and Requa, the teamster of plaintiff, and thus wrongfully got possession. The answer denies the allegations of the complaint, and sets up title to the property by purchase from Davis. The case was tried by the Court, and the following facts were found, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-7\">Plaintiff being the owner of the mules, entered into a contract in March, 1859, with Davis, by which he, Davis, agreed to deliver to plaintiff, at Oroville, 40,000 clear No. 1 Sugar Pine lumber, of various descriptions, for which plaintiff agreed to pay thirty-eight dollars per 1,000. Davis was to commence the delivery of the lumber on or before the first day of May following, in quantities not less than 5,000 per month and of not more than 10,000 per month. Plaintiff agreed to pay for the same as follows: two-thirds of the amount payable in three months from the day the whole 40,000 was delivered, and the balance in four months from delivery. In addition, it was also agreed by the party of the first part, that he would purchase of plaintiff the mule team and harness in controversy, and a wagon, for which he agreed to pay plaintiff $1,000. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Plaintiff agreed that Davis might have the use of the team, with a competent driver to be furnished by plaintiff, to be used by Davis in connection with his saw mill\u2014it being understood that the possession of the team was to remain in plaintiff until paid for by Davis. There were some other covenants in the contract which are not material to the issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\">Under this contract, the team was sent by plaintiff to the mill of Davis, in care of a driver provided by plaintiff, and Davis commenced delivering lumber under his contract. He also delivered to plaintiff lumber of a different kind and of different quality on general account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">The contract for the delivery of the Sugar Pine lumber was not fulfilled by Davis ; and not sufficient of lumber on general account was delivered, over and above the advances made by plaintiff, to amount to $1,000. In the mean time, during the winter of 1859-60, the teamster first employed by plaintiff had left, and another man had been employed by Davis to drive the team. About the first of July, 1860, Davis sold the team and harness to defendant, Urton, <em>to satisfy a debt </em>of seven or eight hundred dollars due from Davis to Urton\u2014the latter also paying some cash; and plaintiff brings suit to recover the team or their value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">The value of the mules, with the harness, is eight hundred and fifty dollars. The use of the team since action commenced is of the value of one hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">There is no direct covenant in the contract in evidence that plaintiff agreed to sell the team to Davis, but only an implied contract that he would sell when Davis had paid or was ready to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-8\">At the time Davis sold the team to Urton, he, Davis, was solvent; but by the loss of some large debts since that time he is now totally insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-9\">Davis, a short time before he sold to Urton, called upon plaintiff for a settlement of their accounts, stating that he had a chance to sell the team to Urton, and wished to know if the mules had been paid for so that he could sell them. Plaintiff said he had not time to settle then ; that his clerk was out, and the books could not be had; but that Davis could \u201c let him have them,\u201d alluding to the proposed sale to Urton. <em>No </em>settlement was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Upon these facts, the Court below held that the terms of the contract were independent covenants ; and hence, that plaintiff never agreed to sell to Davis, and therefore, defendant, who stands in no better position than his vendor, cannot recover; that Davis did not perform any one of the covenants was to make himself a creditor of plaintiff to the value of the team; and further, even if the contract is to be construed as an entirety, and if it can be implied therefrom that plaintiff agreed to sell to Davis, still that this covenant was executory, and no sale was in fact made. The Court also held that the conversation between plaintiff and Davis did not authorize the latter to sell the team as his own property to pay a preexisting debt; but was, at most, an authority to sell in the usual way as agent of plaintiff. Judgment for plaintiff for return of the property, or its value, (eight hundred and fifty dollars) with one hundred dollars damages for detention in case return could not be had. Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-4\"><em>H. O. &amp; W. H. Beatty </em>and <em>George Barstow, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-5\"><em>Jos. E. N. </em>Lewis, for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b63-6\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"A6v\">\u2014Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We put a different construction on the facts found by the learned Judge below from that placed on them by him. If Davis called on the plaintiff to know whether the mules had been paid for, so that he might sell them to defendant\u2014there being unsettled accounts between the plaintiff and Davis\u2014and plaintiff then said to Davis, <em>\u201c </em>Let Urton have them,\u201d taking this remark in connection with the accompanying circumstances, it would seem to be an assent and authorization of a sale to Urton by Davis of the property as that of Davis, and of course, upon such terms as Davis and Urton might agree on.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Judgment reversed arid cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
