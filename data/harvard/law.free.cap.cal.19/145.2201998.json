C. Harding, Constable of the second township of the city and county of San Francisco, from executing a deed to the defendant Wickware of certain land of plaintiff, which land had before that time been sold by said Harding at a Constable\u2019s sale, by virtue of an execution issued upon a judgment rendered in the second township Justice\u2019s Court of San Francisco, in favor of one George W. Tyler, and against the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-9\">At this sale, the defendant Wickware purchased the lot, and the time of redemption was about to expire when the plaintiff commenced this suit. The case was tried by the Court without a jury, and the Court found as a fact that the said Constable had levied upon and sold the said land of plaintiff under said execution, but that no transcript of the said Justice\u2019s judgment had ever been filed in the County Recorder\u2019s office; and that as a conclusion of law said sale was void ; and that the certificate of sale of the Constable, on file in the Recorder\u2019s office, was a cloud upon the title of plaintiff, and decreed a perpetual injunction. Defendants appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>John F. </em>Swift, for Appellants, to the point, that the judgment is not sustained by the facts found, and that land may be levied on and sold under execution on a judgment, whether the judgment be a lien on such land or not, and hence, that there was no necessity for filing a transcript of the Justice\u2019s judgment in the Recorder\u2019s office in this case, cited : Prac. Act, tit. 7, also sec. 599-602 ; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 429-439, and notes ; <em>Carey </em>v. Cornelius, (1 Barb. Ch.

J. and Baldwin, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The findings in this case do not support the judgment. The proposition is, that real estate of a judgment debtor cannot be sold in satisfaction of a judgment rendered by a Justice of the Peace, unless a transcript of the judgment has been filed in the office of the Recorder of the county, so as to become a lien upon the property. No such proceeding is necessary, except as to property situated in a different county; with reference to property in the same county, the provisions for the enforcement of the execution are identical with those relating to the District Court. (Prac. Act, sec. 602.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
