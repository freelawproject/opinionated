In July following, an order was made granting a new trial, and from the order the defendant appealed to this Court. Pending the appeal, the Court below proceeded, against the objection of the defendant, and tried the cause a second time; and its action in this respect constitutes one of the grounds upon which a reversal of-the judgment rendered upon the last trial is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">We think the ground mentioned sufficient. The appeal taken from the order granting the new trial was perfected by an undertaking for damages and costs under the three hundred and forty-eighth section of the Practice Act. The verdict having been in favor of the appellant, no other undertaking was required to obtain a stay of proceedings pending the appeal. (See sec. 356.) It was error in the Court below to proceed with a second trial until that appeal was determined in this Court. The judgment must therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
