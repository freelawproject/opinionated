The case was decided at the January term, 1861, and is reported in 17 Cal. 417. The remittitur having been issued and the cause called for trial in the Court below, it was discovered that the judgment of the Supreme Court, as entered, affirmed the <em>judgment </em>below, instead of the <em>order </em>granting the new trial; whereupon the Court below stopped proceedings. Respondent subsequently\u2014at the July term, 1861\u2014moved the Supreme Court to amend its judgment by making it read,\u201c the order of the District Court, granting a new trial, is affirmed,\u201d instead of\u201c the judgment is affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-8\"><em>Geo. R. </em>Moore, for the Motion, cited <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Aguirre (1 </em>Cal. 447). .</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-9\"><em>Wm. H.

J. and Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">The entry here of the affirmance of the judgment was, as clearly appears from the context, designed to apply to the order granting the motion for a new trial. This error\u2014if it be one, taking the whole proceeding together\u2014is readily corrected by the record; and all Courts have the power to amend clerical errors and enter a judgment <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>when the record itself discloses the error; and this though the term has elapsed at which the entry was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">Ordered that the motion to amend be granted, but without costs on the motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
