Trial by <em>Johnson, </em>J., who made certain findings of fact and rulings of law and returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the amount of $3,723.52. Defendant excepted to certain rulings and findings of the trial court and its denial of defendant\u2019s motion to set the verdict aside. Defendant\u2019s exceptions were reserved and transferred by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Plaintiff had pastured 28 bred heifers in a pasture in Tilton on the farm owned by Arthur Wyatt. He was informed that they were missing and recovered them all over a period of several months. Plaintiff testified that all of the recovered cows were so affected by being chased by dogs that they were of no further value as milk cows and therefore had to be destroyed by being sold for beef.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Defendant company claims that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the cows had been attacked by dogs. The evidence regarding the attack by dogs was largely circumstantial, but it was uncontroverted and the totality of circumstances supported the trial court\u2019s findings. Plaintiff\u2019s witnessing of one of the cows being chased by a dog, his opinion that all of the cows had the appearance of having been chased by dogs, the testimony of an experienced dairy farmer that the plaintiff\u2019s cows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>he saw had undoubtedly been \u201crun by dogs\u201d; the \u201cwild\u201d, \u201cragged\u201d and \u201cscarfed\u201d condition of the cows when finally retrieved, the previous pasturage of the cows in the same field without incident and plaintiff\u2019s inability to put the cows back into milk production, permit sufficient inferences to support a finding that all of the cows were attacked by dogs. <em>See Wescott v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>111 N.H. 10, 12, 273 A.2d 684, 685-86 (1971); <em>Eichel v. Payeur, </em>107 N.H. 194, 196, 219 A.2d 287, 288 (1966); <em>Streeter v. New Eng. Box Co., </em>106 N.H. 146, 148, 207 A.2d 423, 424 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The plaintiff gave three of the recovered cows to a man who assisted in their recapture, sold eleven to a party who sold them for beef and traded the remaining fourteen to the same party for two milk cows. The insurance company claims that the loss to the plaintiff resulting from being unable to return the cows to milk production and having to dispose of them on salvage terms was not a loss within the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The pertinent provision of the insurance policy reads as follows: \u201cIn consideration of an additional premium ... this policy is extended to insure against death or destruction to livestock, directly resulting from or made necessary by ... d. Attack by dogs or wild animals .. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The trial court found that \u201cthe plaintiff acted in a commercially reasonable manner in disposing of the cattle\u201d and that the words in the policy \u201cmade necessary by\u201d included actions that were commercially reasonable. Applying the well-established rule in this State that language in an insurance policy means \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the insured would understand the policy to mean\u201d <em>(McCaffery v. St. Paul Fire Ins. Co., </em>108 N.H. 373, 375, 236 A.2d 490,492 (1967)), we cannot accept the meaning read into the policy by the trial court and if this were the sole basis for the verdict, we would sustain defendant\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">However, the trial court went on to find \u201cthat for all intents and purposes, the cattle had been destroyed as valuable milk cows.\u201d This finding was supported by the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>dence since the trial court was entitled to accept the opinion of the plaintiff who had seen all the cows and an experienced dairy farmer who had seen some of the cows in preference to the opinion of a veterinarian who had seen none of the cows. <em>See Atherton v. Concord, </em>109 N.H. 164, 166, 245 A.2d 387, 389 (1968); <em>Streeter v. New Eng. Box Co. </em>106 N.H. at 148, 207 A.2d at 424 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Unlike the policy in the case of <em>Donnelly v. Underwriting Members of Lloyds, </em>51 Cal. App. 2d 739, 117 P.2d 419 (1941), this policy contains no provisions defining or limiting the meaning of the word \u201cdestruction\u201d. The insured was a dairy farmer who specifically insured his cattle as dairy cows. The trial court found that after being chased by dogs the cattle were no longer of value as milk cows, in other words that they had been rendered useless for their intended purpose. \u201cAs used in policies of insurance... and under various statutes, this term [destroy] is often applied to an act which renders the subject useless for its intended purpose, though it does not literally demolish or annihilate it.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 535 (4th ed. rev. 1968); <em>Roberts v. Commercial Cas. Ins. Co., </em>168 F.2d 23, 25 (6th Cir. 1948); <em>George v. McManus, </em>27 Cal. App. 414, 416, 150 P. 73, 74 (1915). We are of the opinion that a reasonable man in the position of the insured would have understood that when his cows were rendered useless as milk cows they were destroyed and we hold the policy covered plaintiff\u2019s loss. <em>See Concord v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>110 N.H. 497, 499-50, 272 A.2d 588, 590 (1970). The fact that the trial court incorrectly held that the slaughter of the cows was \u201cmade necessary\u201d by the attack of the dogs does not vitiate the verdict where as here there are other findings that support it. <em>See Sargent v. Ross, </em>113 N.H. 388, 399, 308 A.2d 528, 535 (1973); <em>Morley v. Clairmont, </em>110 N.H. 12, 14, 259 A.2d 136, 137 (1969); <em>Hood &amp; Sons v. Boucher, </em>98 N.H. 399, 404, 101 A.2d 466, 469-70 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Defendant further argues that the verdict is excessive since there was evidence that only eleven of plaintiff\u2019s cows were slaughtered for beef. Since we have determined that the \u201cdestruction\u201d of the cows occurred when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>were rendered useless as milk cows and the verdict made allowance for the salvage amounts plaintiff received for the cows the argument cannot be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled; judgment for the plaintiff</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-6\">Kenison, C.J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
