He attached to his petition a copy of the complaint and waiver of indictment and a copy of the order of committal. The copy of the complaint and waiver of indictment shows that the plaintiff was charged under RSA 580:1 with wrongfully obtaining the sum of $99.75 in United States currency and coins by the \u201cfalse and fraudulent pretenses\u201d of negotiating as payable to him a check he had stolen from another. The copy of the order of committal shows that plaintiff pleaded guilty to \u201clarceny by false pretenses as set forth in a Waiver of Indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The plaintiff asserts in his petition that he pleaded \u201cguilty to larceny by false pretenses as stated in [the order of committal] (exhibit 1) and. .. that as stated in the [complaint and waiver of indictment] (exhibit 2) that the value was $99.75, which is punishable under RSA 582:4 not RSA 580:1....\u201d and that \u201cthe maximum penalty by virtue of RSA 582:4 \u2014 Larceny by false pretense \u2014 is a term of not more than one year .. . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\">When the plaintiff pleaded guilty on March 15, 1973 (which was prior to the adoption of the Criminal Code, RSA ch. 637 (Supp. 1973)), the crime of obtaining property by false pretenses and the crime of larceny were separate offenses, prohibited by different statutes and punishable by different terms of imprisonment. RSA 580:1 (1955); RSA 582:4, as amended by Laws 1955, 175:3; <em>State v. Watson, </em>41 N.H. 533, 537 (1860); Report of Commission to Recommend Codification of Criminal Laws 60 (1968). <em>See generally </em>R. Perkins, Criminal Law 306, 319-21 (2d ed. 1969). Proof of the value of the property is essential in determining the class of larceny, but is not essential in establishing that property was obtained by false pretenses. <em>State v. Story, </em>97 N.H. 141, 148, 83 A.2d 142, 148 (1951). <em>See generally </em>R. Perkins, <em>supra </em>at 238, 273-75 (2d ed. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus and the attachments to it indicate that the plaintiff pleaded guilty to the offense of \u201clarceny by false pretenses\u201d under RSA 580:1. <em>Cf. State v. Ellsworth, </em>100 N.H. 301, 303, 124 A.2d 203, 204 (1956). The term of imprisonment authorized by RSA 580.T for the offense of false pretenses was not more than seven years. Plaintiff\u2019s sentence of three to five years was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
