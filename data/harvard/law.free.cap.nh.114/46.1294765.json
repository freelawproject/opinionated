A hearing before the district court resulted in a verdict for the defendant. After the trial, the plaintiff\u2019s motion to set \u00e1side the verdict \u201cas being contrary to the evidence\u201d was denied subject to exception. Some twenty-eight days after the evidence was closed, the plaintiff requested the court for specific findings of fact and rulings of law. This too was denied, and the plaintiff excepted. However, the court of its own motion did make certain findings and rulings. All questions of law raised by the foregoing exceptions were reserved and transferred by <em>William J. O\u2019Neil, </em>district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">The record discloses that no written transcript of any of the proceedings before the court was requested or made. In this situation, no question as to the sufficiency of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>dence to sustain the verdict can be raised, and the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the denial of its motion to set aside the verdict is overruled. <em>Ray v. Sanborn, </em>99 N.H. 438, 113 A.2d 488 (1955). <em>See also Gobbi v. Moulton, </em>108 N.H. 183, 230 A.2d 747 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The district courts have not promulgated rules regarding the filing of requests to be approved by the supreme court under RSA 502-A:19-a (Supp. 1972). However, it is unreasonable to conclude that the intent of RSA 502-A:17-a (Supp. 1972), was to allow a party an indefinite time within which to request the court to make findings and rulings upon a transfer to the supreme court. <em>Glover v. Baker, </em>76 N.H. 393, 413, 83 A. 916, 929 (1912); <em>Hill v. State, </em>107 N.H. 56, 61, 217 A.2d 502, 505 (1966). In denying the plaintiff\u2019s request, the district court reasonably relied upon Superior Court Rule 67 which the Manchester District Court had adopted. This specifies that all requests \u201cmust be submitted to the Presiding Justice at the close of the evidence.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s exception to the court\u2019s action is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">An examination of the entire record, including the exhibits, discloses no error, and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
