Is a ballot cast by means of a voting machine a \u2018written ballot\u2019 within the meaning of Part II, Article 100 (c) of the New Hampshire Constitution?</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b780-10\">\u201c2.

If the answer to the first question be in the affirmative, and the answer to the second question be in the negative, will votes cast through the use of voting machines at the 1974 biennial election be invalid for the purpose of determining the passage or failure of the constitutional amendments proposed?\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b780-12\">The following answers were returned:</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b780-13\">\n<em>To His Excellency the Governor and the Honorable Council:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">The first question, submitted by the Governor and Council this morning, is as follows: \u201c1. Is a ballot cast by means of a voting machine a \u2018written ballot\u2019 within the meaning of Part II, Article 100 (c) of the New Hampshire Constitution?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">Our answer to this question is \u201cYes\u201d. The purpose of the constitutional requirement of a \u201cwritten ballot\u201d is to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the secrecy and integrity of the voting process and to provide a method of voting other than by voice or show of hands. The use of a voting machine is consistent with this purpose. Annot., 66 A.L.R. 855 (1930); <em>cf. Nichols v. Minton, </em>196 Mass. 410, 82 N.E. 50 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The second question submitted by the Governor and Council is as follows: \u201c2. If the answer to the first question be in the affirmative, will the use of voting machines for the purpose of balloting on proposed constitutional amendments at the 1974 biennial election constitute the employment of \u2018substitute ballots\u2019 as permitted by RSA 59:21?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Our answer to this question is \u201cYes.\u201d RSA 59:21 provides for the use of substitute ballots in lieu of official ballots \u201cin order that no voter shall be deprived of the right to vote for the lack of a ballot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">It has been represented that a ballot which would comply with all the requirements (RSA 68-A:7; RSA ch. 59) cannot be placed in the voting machines in the city of Portsmouth in time for use at the biennial election tomorrow. It is further represented that the ballot which is presently in the voting machines conforms in every respect with the official ballot except for the color and possibly the exact size of the type provided for in the resolution adopted by the Constitutional Convention of 1974. <em>See </em>N.H. Jour. Const. Conv. 280 (1974); RSA 59:12; RSA 68-A:7.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">\u201cStatutes regulating the form of ballots are generally regarded as directory rather than mandatory. Annot., 165 A.L.R. 1263, 1264 (1946); 3 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 12.14, at 109-10 (3d ed. rev. 1963). They provide a convenient and uniform method for voting, but should not be applied to disenfranchise voters because of technical irregularities.\u201d <em>Keene v. Gerry\u2019s Cash Mkt., Inc., </em>113 N.H. 165, 304 A.2d 873 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">In view of our answers to questions number 1 and number 2 it is unnecessary to question number 3.</p>\n<judges id=\"b781-10\">Frank R.
