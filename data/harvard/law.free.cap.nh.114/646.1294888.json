The automobile, a 1967 Mercury, was owned by defendant Patten\u2019s Enterprises, Inc., a used automobile dealer, bore \u201cdealer\u201d registration plates issued to Patten\u2019s, and was operated by defendant Virginia Booth, an adult daughter of the principal officer and stockholder of Patten\u2019s. The automobile had been loaned to Virginia by her father some seven months before the accident for her exclusive personal use unrelated to the business of Patten\u2019s, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>allegedly in violation of RSA 260:49 and 52 regulating the issuance and use of \u201cdealer\u201d plates, and providing in part as follows: \u201cA manufacturer or dealer shall not loan number plates which have been assigned to him under these provisions to a subagent or to any other person.\u201d RSA 260:49. \u201cA dealer may use his motor vehicles ... registered under his dealer\u2019s registration.. . for his pleasure purposes, but shall not rent or otherwise use or permit to be used motor vehicles ... so registered, except for demonstration purposes or service in connection with his motor vehicle . . . business.\u201d RSA 260:52.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The plaintiffs brought these actions on the case to recover damages arising out of Lou Ann\u2019s injuries. Defendant Patten\u2019s Enterprises, alleging on the basis of a deposition of defendant Booth that the relationship between the defendants was that of bailor-bailee, and that \u201cthe negligence of the bailee is not attributable\u201d to the bailor, moved for a dismissal as to Patten\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. In reply, the plaintiff alleged that Patten\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. is responsible for Lou Anne\u2019s injuries \u201cby reason of Patten\u2019s improper loaning to Booth of a dealer registered vehicle with dealer plates in violation of RSA 260:49 and 52.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">By agreement of the parties the following question was reserved and transferred without ruling in advance of trial <em>byJohnson, </em>J.: \u201cwhether, in the event the jury returns verdicts for the plaintiffs against the defendant, Virginia A. Booth, the defendant, Patten\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. can be held liable to the plaintiffs in the amount of such verdicts if it is found that Patten\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. violated RSA 260:49, and/or 52.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In this jurisdiction the law regarding the imposition of civil liability for violation of a statute is well settled. \u201cThe violation of a statute or ordinance becomes an actionable wrong only when the consequences contemplated by the provision in question have actually resulted from its violation. If none of the consequences which the enactment was designed to guard against have resulted from its breach, such a breach does not constitute an actionable wrong even though some other injurious consequence has resulted. It is not enough for a plaintiff to show that the defendant neglected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>a duty imposed by statute and that he would not have been injured if the duty had been performed. He must go further and show that his injury was caused by his exposure to a hazard from which it was the purpose of the statute to protect him.\u201d <em>Flynn v. Gordon, </em>86 N.H. 198, 200, 165 A. 715, 716 (1933); <em>Martin v. Kelley, </em>97 N.H. 466, 469, 92 A.2d 163, 166 (1952); <em>see Moulton v. Groveton Papers, </em>112 N.H. 50, 52, 289 A.2d 68, 71 (1972); <em>Vassillion v. Sullivan, </em>94 N.H. 97, 101, 47 A.2d 115, 118 (1946); <em>Fontaine v. Charas, </em>87 N.H. 424, 426, 181 A. 417, 418 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the liability of Patten\u2019s Enterprises, Inc., is founded on Patten\u2019s alleged violation of RSA 260:49 and 52. <em>Clark v. Hampton, </em>83 N.H. 524, 145 A. 265 (1929), held that the general purpose of the motor vehicle regulatory measures contained in what is now RSA ch. 260 is to provide revenue and to facilitate the identification of vehicles. <em>See Bosen v. Larrabee, </em>91 N.H. 492, 23 A.2d 331 (1941). Plaintiffs allege no injury arising from difficulty in identification of the automobile. They complain of no injury causally related to the alleged violation of sections 49 and 52. Adoption of the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions would reincarnate and extend the \u201cdiscredited doctrine of <em>Johnson v. Railroad, </em>83 N.H. 350 [143 A. 516 (1928)], which was overruled in <em>Vassillion v. Sullivan, </em>94 N.H. 97 [47 A.2d 115 (1946)].\u201d <em>Gorman v. New England Tel. </em>&amp; <em>Tel. Co., </em>103 N.H. 337, 340-41, 172 A.2d 372, 374 (1961); <em>see Fuller v. Sirois, </em>97 N.H. 100, 82 A.2d 82 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The transferred question is answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b716-8\">Grimes, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
