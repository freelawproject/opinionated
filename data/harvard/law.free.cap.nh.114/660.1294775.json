A trial by jury resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of his motions for nonsuit, a directed verdict, and to set aside the verdict were transferred by the Presiding J ustice <em>(Flynn, </em>J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The only issue presented is whether there was evidence which warranted a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from the defendant\u2019s negligence. In passing upon motions for nonsuit and directed verdict the court is \u201cobliged to consider the evidence for the plaintiff as true\u201d <em>(Leonard v. Manchester, </em>96 N.H. 115, 117, 70 A.2d 915, 917 (1950)), and to determine whether \u201cconstrued most favorably to the plaintiff, [it] would permit a jury to find in [his] favor.\u201d <em>Muzzey v. Rockingham County Trust Co., </em>113 N.H. 520, 521, 309 A.2d 893, 894 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The plaintiff, an adult accompanied by three minor children, two of whom were 11 years of age and one was 9, hired horses at the defendant\u2019s stable and set out upon a trail ride through woods on the defendant\u2019s property. The only witnesses to testify were the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s son. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence indicated that when the horses were furnished, the plaintiff acknowledged to the defendant\u2019s agents that he \u201chad been on a horse before\u201d, but no inquiry was made into his competency or the experience of the youngsters with him. At the trial the plaintiff testified that he had not \u201cridden a horse in seven to eight years\u201d and that none of the children to his knowledge had had any experience whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The riding party was led by the defendant\u2019s 15-year old son. It proceeded over a woods trail at a slow pace until a logging road was reached. The evidence as to what occurred thereafter was in conflict because the defendant\u2019s son testified that he was not present when the plaintiff was injured but that he had gone to the rear after the fifth horse which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>had turned back on the trail. Accepting the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as true, it could be found that the son, who was leading the party, inquired at the logging road if the group wanted to run the horses back to the stable. The plaintiff responded in the negative because he didn\u2019t know the horses and didn\u2019t know \u201cjust what they would do when they started to run\u201d. The leader nevertheless started to run, and according to his own testimony \u201ccantered or loped\u201d for about 200 feet. The plaintiff\u2019s horse, which was third in the line of five, thereupon \u201cacted up\u201d by rearing three times. On the third time, the plaintiff undertook to dismount by sliding off the horse and \u201cthe horse just sat down on [the plaintiff\u2019s] leg\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">It is not disputed that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff to exercise reasonable care for his safety. <em>Christian v. Elden, </em>107 N.H. 229, 233, 221 A.2d 784, 788 (1966); <em>Stevens v. Bow Mills Methodist Church, </em>111 N.H. 340, 283 A.2d 488 (1971); <em>see </em>W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 61, at 392-93 (4th ed. 1971). The jury could reasonably find that the defendant\u2019s agent was negligent, either because of his abandonment of the inexperienced group by loping on ahead and leaving the party with unfamiliar horses, or because of his disregard of the plaintiff\u2019s request not to break into a run. The son himself testified that he was aware that \u201chorses sometimes do unusual things\u201d, and the jury could reasonably find that the plaintiff and his party were exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm by the son\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The plaintiff was not called upon to disprove the existence of all other possible causes of the accident, but only to make it appear \u201ca little more probable than otherwise\u201d that it resulted from the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Bresnahan v. Company, </em>88 N.H. 273, 275, 188 A. 10, 11 (1936); <em>Descoteau v. Boston </em>&amp; <em>Maine R.R., </em>101 N.H. 271, 275, 140 A.2d 579, 583 (1958). That the defendant\u2019s agent might have calmed the horse, or prevented the plaintiff from attempting to dismount had he remained with the party, or that the horse might not have reared in the absence of the \u201crun\u201d, were permissible inferences from the testimony. The case of <em>De Pietro v. Lavigne, </em>97 N.H. 474, 92 A.2d 914 (1952), requires no different conclusion, since the record in the case at bar contains no evidence of \u201cequally probable\u201d causes of the accident not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>attributable to the defendant which would admit of speculation by the jury. <em>See Ahern v. Company, </em>88 N.H. 287, 291, 188 A. 470, 473 (1936). The motions for nonsuit and directed verdict were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">There was no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to set aside the verdict on the grounds that it was against the law and the evidence, and the result of plain mistake. <em>Condiles v. Waumbec Mills, </em>95 N.H. 127, 58 A.2d 726 (1948); <em>Powell v. Gagne, </em>102 N.H. 256, 257, 154 A.2d 750, 751 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b731-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
