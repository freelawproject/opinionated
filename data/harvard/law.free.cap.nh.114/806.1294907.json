Ryder for loss of consortium resulting from an injury to his wife Lidia in the course of her employment by Asbestos. The matter was submitted on an agreed statement of facts to a Master <em>(Leonard C. Hardwick, </em>Esq.) who ruled that both insurers were obligated to defend the action and satisfy any judgment within the limits of their respective policies. The master\u2019s report was approved by <em>Keller, </em>C.J., who reserved and transferred the exceptions of both insurers thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Lidia Ryder was injured on December 14, 1965, in the course of her employment by Asbestos and received from American workmen\u2019s compensation benefits under RSA ch. 281. Thereafter her husband brought an action at law against Asbestos with an ad damnum of $50,000 for his loss of consortium alleging that the injuries to his wife resulted from Asbestos\u2019 negligent failure to properly supervise her work. His right of action for loss of consortium is a separate and distinct right from that of his wife to recover for her injury. <em>Guevin v. Railway, </em>78 N.H. 289, 99 A. 298 (1916); <em>LaBonte v. National Gypsum Co., </em>110 N.H. 314, 319, 269 A.2d 634, 638 (1970); <em>see </em>RSA 507:8-a. Asbestos\u2019 liability to the wife arises under the statutory provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (RSA ch. 281) while its liability to the husband is based on the common law of negligence. <em>Archie v. Hampton, </em>112 N.H. N.H. 13, 287 A.2d 622 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Under its \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation And Employers\u2019 Liability Policy\u201d, American agreed under \u201cCoverage A \u2014 Workmen\u2019s Compensation:\u201d \u201cTo pay promptly when due all compensation and other benefits required of the insured by the workmen\u2019s compensation law.\u201d Under \u201cCoverage B \u2014 Employer\u2019s Liability\u201d, American agreed: \u201cTo pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury by acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>dent or disease, including death at anytime resulting therefrom, sustained... by any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured.\u201d In essence, under \u201cCoverage A\u201d the insurer agrees to assume \u25a0the liabilities imposed by statute on the insured by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. \u201cCoverage B\u201d protects the insured against liability imposed by common law on account of injury to its employees in the course of their employment. <em>Parfait v. Jahncke Service, Inc., </em>484 F.2d 296, 307 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Danek v. Hommer, </em>28 N.J. Super. 68, 71, 100 A.2d 198, 199 (1953), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>15 N.J. 573, 105 A.2d 677 (1954); 7A J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4571 (1962); F.C.&amp;S. Bulletins, W.C. B-l (Oct. 1954). American\u2019s limit of liability under \u201cCoverage B\u201d is $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">American maintains that the coverage provided by its policy is for injuries sustained by the employee personally and not for damages which are caused to a third person as a result of an injury to the employee. We disagree. Damages which may be assessed against Abestos for the husband\u2019s action at law for loss of consortium would constitute damages under \u201cCoverage B\u201d which \u201cinclude damages for care and loss of services and damages for which the insured is liable by reason of suits . . . brought by others to recover . . . damages . . . because of such bodily injury sustained by employees .. ..\u201d Condition 9 \u2014 Limits of Liability. <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co. v.

The master properly found and ruled that American is bound to defend Asbestos in the present action and to satisfy within the limits of its policy any judgment which may be returned against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Aetna insured Asbestos under a \u201cComprehensive Liability Policy\u201d. Under its \u201cCoverage C. \u2014 Bodily Injury Liability \u2014 Except Automobile\u201d, Aetna agreed: \u201cTo pay on behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any person and caused by accident.\u201d The limits of this coverage are $100,000 for each person and $300,000 for each accident. Condition 4 of the policy provides that under \u201cCoverage C\u201d the coverage applicable to each person is the limit of liability \u201cfor all damages, including damages for care and loss of services, arising out of bodily injury . . . sustained by one person as the result of any one accident\u201d. This language has been construed to include actions for loss of consortium. <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co. v. Yeroyan, </em>90 N.H. 145, 5 A.2d 726 (1939); Annot., 105 A.L.R. 1204, 1205 (1936). Aetna does not seriously contend otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">Aetna\u2019s main contention is that coverage for loss of consortium is precluded by exclusion (f) of its policy which provides that \u201cexcept with respect to liability assumed by the Insured under a contract\u201d the policy does not apply under Coverage C \u201cto bodily injury to . . . any employee of the Insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the Insured.\u201d In order to exempt loss of consortium from the insuring clause of Coverage C, it was incumbent on Aetna to do so in terms which would effectively convey this exclusion to a reasonable person in the position of the insured. <em>Aetna Insurance Co. v. State Motors, </em>109 N.H. 120, 125, 244 A.2d 64, 67 (1968); <em>Sun Insurance Co. v. Hamanne, </em>113 N.H. 319, 321, 306 A.2d 786, 788 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The exclusion by its expressed terms precludes liability for physical injury to an employee of the insured arising out of their master and servant relationship. <em>American Insurance Co. v. Nationwide Insurance Co., </em>110 N.H. 192, 195, 270 A.2d 907, 910 (1970); Annot., 34 A.L.R.3d 1397, 1400 (1970). It cannot be said that this language should have conveyed to the insured that an action by the employee\u2019s husband for loss of consortium was excluded from \u201cCoverage C\u201d under which Aetna obligated itself to pay damages for bodily injury \u201csustained by any person and caused by accident\u201d which covered \u201call damages including damages for care and loss of services.\u201d Condition 4, Limits of Liability. <em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co. v. Yeroyan, </em>90 N.H. 145, 5 A.2d 726 (1939); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>12 G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 45.795 (2d ed. 1964); Annot., 13 A.L.R.3d 1228, 1234 (1967). The master properly ruled that under the terms of its policy Aetna was bound to defend Asbestos in this action for loss of consortium and to satisfy any judgment within the limits of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">\n<em>Judgment for plaintiff</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b878-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
