The district court denied Shanks\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Shanks is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-23\">Aside from conclusional allegations, Shanks does not challenge the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>court\u2019s determination that he failed to present an arguable or nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Further, Shanks does not address the district court\u2019s determination that because his criminal judgment was entered nearly three years prior to his filing the motion for the appointment of counsel, any 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion would be time barred. Therefore, these issues are deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Shanks has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Shanks\u2019s IFP motion is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Shanks is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
