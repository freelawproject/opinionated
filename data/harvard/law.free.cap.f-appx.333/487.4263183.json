California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). On May 15, 2009, we denied without prejudice counsel\u2019s motion, ordering counsel to file transcripts of the <em>voir dire </em>and jury selection proceedings. Following our May 15, 2009 order, counsel has demonstrated that he had already filed these transcripts before the issuance of our May 15, 2009 order. Consequently, we VACATE our May 15, 2009 order and consider the merits of counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Lloyd\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED. Lloyd\u2019s motions for appointment of replacement counsel, and permission to file a second brief in ease of inadvertent omissions from his first brief, are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
