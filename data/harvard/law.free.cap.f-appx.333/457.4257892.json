On appeal, Johnson argues, through counsel, that he is entitled to a reduction under Amendment 706 because he was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1, not pursuant to the career-offender provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, given that the district court at sentencing noted that the guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1 was grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense and that the crack-to-cocaine disparity was unwarranted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Johnson also argues that he falls within an exception created in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), wherein a defendant could receive a sentence reduction if he was not sentenced as a career offender, even if he qualified as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">A defendant whose original guideline sentencing range was based on the career-offender guideline section of \u00a7 4B1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (stating that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u201cthe amendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d). Where the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 \u201cplay [] no role\u201d in the calculation of the guideline range, the defendant is not entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief under Amendment 706. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Johnson was determined to be a career offender, and the district court sentenced him as such. At sentencing, the court never stated that the PSI\u2019s career-offender determination was incorrect or overrepresented Johnson\u2019s criminal history. Rather, after explicitly discussing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the craek-to-cocaine disparity, the district court used its discretion to vary downward from the advisory career-offender guideline range. The crack-cocaine base offense level of \u00a7 2D1.1 played no role in the calculation of Johnson\u2019s guideline range, and thus Amendment 706 did not lower that range. Accordingly, Johnson is not entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
