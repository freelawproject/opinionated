On appeal, Beqiri argues that the IJ erred in denying his application for relief because: (1) substantial evidence did not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding; (2) Beqiri established a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his status as an ethnic Albanian; and (8) the IJ improperly failed to recognize Beqiri\u2019s legitimate CAT relief claim. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the opinion of the IJ. <em>Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1812 (11th Cir.2006). To the extent that the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s reasoning as well. <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, the BIA expressly adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, and makes a few additions, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the IJ\u2019s legal determinations. <em>See Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). Under the substantial evidence test, the record is reviewed in the light most favorable to the IJ\u2019s decision and we will draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1230 (11th Cir.2007). We cannot engage in fact-finding, consider evidence not presented to the IJ, or re-weigh the evidence that was before the IJ. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1278. \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). In addition, we review the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). The IJ must make an explicit credibility determination, which will be viewed as conclusive unless a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">First, we do not agree with Beqiri that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence. \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the ... credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). \u201cAn IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief ... can be supported solely by an adverse credibility determination, especially if the alien fails to produce corroborating evidence.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). Still, if the applicant provides corroborating evidence, the IJ must consider that evidence, and not rely solely on the adverse credibility finding in denying relief. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">An adverse credibility finding may be based on inconsistencies between an alien\u2019s application, testimony, and documentary evidence. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819. In addition, an applicant\u2019s failure to mention relevant facts prior to his asylum hearing, such as his omission of those facts from his application, may support an adverse credibility finding. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. An applicant\u2019s provision of \u201ctenable\u201d explanations for aspects of his claim that the IJ found incredible does not compel the reversal of the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, especially in the absence of cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>roborating evidence. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">As the record here shows, the IJ cited several specific inconsistencies and omissions in the record involving an alleged protest that Beqiri attended in Macedonia, a police detention and beating that allegedly followed, and a subsequent visit to his home by police \u2014 all events that were central to his application. Beqiri also failed to mention any past persecution or fear of future persecution at his initial airport interview upon entering the United States, and he offered different accounts of his level of education. Thus, the record does not compel reversal of the adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We likewise are unpersuaded by Beqiri\u2019s claim that he established a well-founded fear of future persecution. An alien may establish eligibility for asylum by demonstrating: (1) past persecution on account of \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in. a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d; or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that one of these statutorily listed factors will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a statutory factor. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotations omitted) (emphasis in original). The burden is on the alien to establish asylum eligibility. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. Although the IJ is required to consider all of the evidence submitted by the applicant, she is not required to discuss every piece of evidence presented before her. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1376 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">\u201cIn determining whether an alien has suffered past persecution, the IJ must consider the cumulative effects of the incidents.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir.2007). Although the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and regulations do not define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have indicated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and brackets omitted). In general, minor physical abuse and brief detentions do not amount to persecution. <em>See Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1174 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that alien who was detained for 36 hours and beaten by police, resulting in multiple scratches and bruises according to medical records, did not suffer persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">An applicant who establishes past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). However, without regard to past persecution, an applicant may establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution by demonstrating that her fear of future persecution is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2). The subjective component of the well-founded fear determination relates to the credibility of the applicant, whereas the objective component assesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the probability of future persecution. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In order to establish his eligibility for withholding of removal under CAT, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to the proposed country of removal. <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). CAT relief depends only on objective evidence that torture is more likely than not, <em>see Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1180 (11th Cir.2004), and that standard is higher than the standard for asylum, <em>see Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006). The CAT defines torture as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgTX\">any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\"><em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Similarly, because the standard for establishing eligibility for asylum is less stringent than the standard for withholding of removal, an alien\u2019s withholding of removal claim also must fail if his asylum claim fails on the merits. <em>See Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">On the record here, substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s denial of Beqiri\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. As an initial matter, the record shows that in denying Be-qiri\u2019s application, the IJ considered <em>all </em>of the evidence presented by him and properly recognized his CAT relief claim. The IJ noted that she considered all of the evidence and she specifically referenced much of this evidence, such as the expert testimony and report, the Country Reports, and the letters from Beqiri\u2019s sister and a fellow protestor. The IJ was not required to specifically discuss all of the evidence, <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1376, and any claim concerning the IJ\u2019s weighing of the evidence is outside the scope of our review. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Next, to the extent that Beqiri has preserved a past persecution claim, it is foreclosed by the adverse credibility finding, the lack of specific corroborating evidence, and the lack of any credible claim of problems in Macedonia that rose to the extreme level of persecution. <em>See Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. The only specific piece of evidence corroborating Beqiri\u2019s story of persecution by the police was a letter from a fellow protestor, but that letter did not mention the purpose of the protest, stated that the protest occurred on a different date than Beqiri claimed, and did not indicate that the police still were looking for him. As a result, the adverse credibility finding, the letter and the general background evidence do not compel the conclusion that past persecution occurred.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">In addition, Beqiri\u2019s claim of a subjective fear of future persecution was undermined by the adverse credibility finding, and out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>side evidence did not compel the conclusion that a fear of future persecution or torture was objectively reasonable. Although an expert testified that Beqiri might be detained and questioned upon his return to Macedonia, and there was a possibility of harm by the police, that conclusion was based, in part, on the assumption that Beqiri had previously been detained by the police, which the IJ found not credible. Furthermore, as the IJ noted, the mere detention and questioning of Beqiri upon returning to Macedonia would not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Djonda, </em>514 F.3d at 1174. Because the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Beqiri suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution, the IJ did not err in finding him ineligible for asylum. Accordingly, IJ\u2019s denial of his withholding of removal claim also was proper. <em>See Zheng, </em>451 F.3d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Finally, the IJ did not err in rejecting Beqiri\u2019s CAT relief claim. That claim, along with his fear of future persecution claim, rested upon the assumption that the police would torture him when he returned to Macedonia. However, as discussed above, the evidence did not compel the conclusion that his fear of torture was reasonable, much less than such torture was more likely than not to occur. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Therefore, the IJ properly denied Beqi-ri\u2019s asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief claims, and we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\">. Because Beqiri filed his asylum application prior to May 11, 2005, the statutory amendments made by the REAL ID Act of 2005 (\u201cREAL ID Act\u201d) regarding adverse credibility determinations do not apply to this case. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (as amended by the REAL ID Act \u00a7 101(a)(3)). On- a related point, we decline to consider the question, not yet addressed by this Court in a published opinion, whether inconsistencies supporting an adverse credibility finding must go to the \u201cheart of the claim\u201d in a pre-Real ID Act case because the inconsistencies at issue in the instant case directly related to Beqiri's persecution claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">. Beqiri also made vague claims of persecution regarding health care, employment, and education. Although evidence showed that ethnic Albanians are disadvantaged in these areas, there was no indication that these disadvantage rose to the \"extreme\u201d level of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Moreover, aside from being forced to pay for private health care because his girlfriend did not have insurance, Beqiri could not recount any specific problems his girlfriend had obtaining health care. Also, evidence showed that Beqiri had worked odd jobs setting tile, and he did not mention any specific incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>where he was denied employment based on his ethnicity. Finally, evidence showed that Beqiri attended high school and technical school and he did not recount any specific educational opportunities that he sought that were denied to him based on his ethnicity. Thus, evidence does not compel the conclusion that the problems Beqiri faced in the areas of health care, employment, and education, on account of his ethnicity, rose to the level of persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
