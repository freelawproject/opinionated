In his complaint, he argued that (1) his due process rights were violated by the revocation of his parole and the loss of his street-time credit and (2) Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 47-7-27, which governs the procedure for parole revocation, was unconstitutional. As relief, Walker sought reinstatement of his term of parole and the restoration of his street-time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-18\">Because success in Walker\u2019s action \u201cwould necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration[,]\u201d a \u00a7 1983 action is barred, and his claims must be brought in a habeas corpus petition. <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). The district court properly declined to construe Walker\u2019s complaint as a habeas petition because Walker failed to exhaust his state remedies. The district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim was therefore proper. <em>See Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-19\">Walker\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>42.2. Walker has already been informed that he has accumulated three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>Walker v. Norwood, </em>No. S:08-cv-275-TSL-JCS, 2009 WL 387387, at *1 (S.D.Miss. Feb.13, 2009). Walker is no longer able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). In order to avoid the imposition of an additional sanction, Walker should review any pending appeals and actions and move to dismiss any that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b876-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
