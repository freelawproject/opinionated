Following amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that lowered the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, the district court granted a motion by Thomas pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and reduced his sentence to 151 months, at the bottom of the amended guidelines range. Thomas now appeals, challenging the limits on the district court\u2019s discretion set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and arguing that the district court had the authority to impose an even lower sentence. The Government argues that the district court could not reduce Thomas\u2019s sentence further.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">Thomas\u2019s arguments are foreclosed in light of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 21, 2009) (No. 09-6657). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
