He contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney was operating under an actual conflict of interest. The record is not sufficiently developed to permit direct review of Castillo\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See United States v. Kizzee, </em>150 F.3d 497, 502-03 (5th Cir.1998). Therefore, this court declines to consider this claim without prejudice to Castillo\u2019s right to raise it in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See id. </em>at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-20\">Castillo also contends that the district court erred when it increased his offense level for trafficking in firearms pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). As the Government contends, the record reflects that Castillo knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence on any ground. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, his challenge to the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) is barred by the appellate-waiver provision in his plea agreement. <em>See id. </em>at 746M7.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-21\">Accordingly, the- district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
