Gaskins currently is serving a 48-month sentence for violating the terms of his supervised release, in relation to an underlying crack cocaine offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-25\">On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it had the authority to reduce his sentence, despite his status, at his original sentencing, as a career offender. Gas-kins also asserts that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court had the authority to sentence him below his guideline range. Further, he contends, the court should have reduced his sentence based on the crack cocaine racial disparity, under <em>Kim-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number><em>brough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any such reduction must also be consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements, which provide that a sentencing reduction is not permitted if none of the retroactive amendments apply to the defendant or a retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 states, \u201cOnly a term of imprisonment imposed as part of the original sentence is authorized to be reduced under this section. This section does not authorize a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (N.4(A)); <em>see also United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. OS-8664) (holding that \u201ca district court is bound by the limitations on its discretion imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Furthermore, Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines sets out the guideline ranges applicable to defendants whose terms of supervised released have been revoked. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Thus, in the revocation of supervised release context, a defendant is not sentenced under the crack cocaine guidelines in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and Amendment 706 has no effect on the guideline ranges set out in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (amending the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 201.1(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Here, the district court correctly determined that Gaskins was not eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706, as his sentence was imposed upon revocation of supervised release and based on a guideline range set out in \u00a7 7B1.4, not \u00a7 2D1.1. In addition, Gaskins\u2019s original sentencing range was based on his status as a career offender and not on his crack cocaine offense. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201ca defendant whose original sentencing range was based on something other than \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction, since the amendment would not lower his applicable guidelines range.\u201d). Thus, Gaskins\u2019s crack cocaine base offense level played no role in his sentence, and Amendment 706 did not affect his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
