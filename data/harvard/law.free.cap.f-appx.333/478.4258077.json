Pugh, a Georgia state prisoner proceeding pro <em>se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), of his \u00a7 1983 action for failure to state a claim and, in construing his complaint as writ for habeas corpus, for impermissibly filing a successive habeas petition. On appeal, Pugh re-asserts arguments made in his complaint, namely that he was wrongly convicted and, as a result, the Georgia parole board should commute his sentence and immediately release him. After thorough review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), taking the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). Pursuant to \u00a7 1915A, a district court must dismiss a prisoner\u2019s complaint if the complaint \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) \u2014 (b)(1). A <em>pro se </em>complaint is held to a \u201cless stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The standards that apply to dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) apply to dismissal under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). <em>See, e.g., Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1490 (11th Cir.1997) (addressing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)). That is, although the complaint need not provide detailed factual allegations, there \u201cmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,\u201d and the complaint must contain enough facts to state a claim that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555-56, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>see also Watts v. Florida Int\u2019l Univ., </em>495 F.3d 1289, 1295-96 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that a complaint is sufficient if it identifies facts that are suggestive enough to render the necessary elements plausible).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">\u201cIn order to prevail on a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). A habeas petition is the exclusive remedy for a prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release. <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973); <em>see Clark v. State of Ga. Pardons &amp; Paroles Bd., </em>915 F.2d 636, 638 (11th Cir.1990) (holding that the district court mischaracterized a state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim as a petition for writ of habeas corpus because the prisoner did not attack his conviction, challenge the fact or length of his confinement or seek immediate release from prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">Furthermore, a state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is barred \u201cno matter the relief sought\u201d and \u201cno matter the target of the prisoner\u2019s suit (state conduct leading to conviction or internal prison proceedings)\u201d if success in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of his conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>or length of confinement. <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-32, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005); <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). If it would, the district court must dismiss the complaint, unless the plaintiff can show that the conviction or sentence has been \u201creversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. A plaintiff seeking relief based on the premise that he \u201cwas the victim of an unconstitutional conspiracy to falsely convict him\u201d is merely attempting to overturn his conviction and is barred by <em>Heck </em>from proceeding. <em>Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1064, 1065-66 (11th Cir.1995) (involving action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), which is analogous to \u00a7 1983 for <em>Heck </em>purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">If the district court treats a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim as a writ for habeas corpus relief because he challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks an immediate release, it is without jurisdiction to consider it if the prisoner has previously filed a habeas petition that was dismissed with prejudice and has not applied to this Court for permission to file a successive application. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A); <em>Fugate v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>301 F.3d 1287, 1288 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In this case, Pugh directly challenged his conviction and requested an immediate release and, consequently, his complaint is Heck-barred. <em>Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242. As a result, the district court correctly dismissed his complaint and construed it as a writ for habeas corpus relief. <em>Clark, </em>915 F.2d at 639. Moreover, the district court properly dismissed Pugh\u2019s habeas petition because he previously filed a \u00a7 2254 petition that was dismissed with prejudice, and he did not obtain our permission to file a successive petition. <em>Fugate, </em>301 F.3d at 1288. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-12\">. In addition, Pugh's motion to waive filing fees is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
