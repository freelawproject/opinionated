Felipa Herrera CABALLERO, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b517-24\">No. 08-15655</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AHBI\">Non-Argument Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b517-25\">United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b517-26\">June 26, 2009.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Before DUBINA, Chief Judge, TJOFLAT and BLACK, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b518-4\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Felipa Herrera Caballero appeals her conviction for possession and use of another person\u2019s identification during a felony, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Caballero argues on appeal the Government selectively prosecuted her based on her ethnicity, gender, and physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Generally, a defendant waives all nonju-risdictional defects upon pleading guilty to an indictment. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>532 F.3d 1125, 1127 (11th Cir.2008); see <em>also United States v. Jennings, </em>991 F.2d 725, 730 (11th Cir.1993) (assuming, without comment, that selective prosecution of a defendant would constitute a defect in the indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Caballero never raised the issue of selective prosecution before the trial court, but instead pled guilty to the charges in the indictment. She thus has waived this issue on appeal. <em>See Smith, </em>532 F.3d at 1127. Accordingly, we affirm her conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\">. Caballero does not challenge her convictions for unlawful re-entry into the United States, a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), and false representation in order to gain entry into the United States, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-11\">. To the extent Caballero\u2019s Notice of Supplemental Authority can be construed as raising an argument that there was an insufficient factual basis to support her guilty plea, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3); <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 1888, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), we decline to consider this issue because it was not raised in Caballero's initial brief, <em>see United States v. Valladares, </em>544 F.3d 1257, 1269 n. 2 (11th Cir.2008). Furthermore, even if we were to reach the merits of this issue, we would uphold Caballero's conviction because she did not raise a Rule 11 objection in district court, and the court did not plainly err in failing to anticipate the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Flores-Figueroa.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
