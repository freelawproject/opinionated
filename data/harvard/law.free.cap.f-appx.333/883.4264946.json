Matthews, </em>312 F.3d 652, 657 (5th Cir.2002) (holding that under the law of the case doctrine, an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal). Even if we were to consider his arguments on- the merits, they are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 776 (5th Cir.2007), in which we held that there is no right under the Confrontation Clause at sentencing. The Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
