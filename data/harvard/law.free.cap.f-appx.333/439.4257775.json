Williams\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-25\">Williams argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in denying his motion for a reduced sentence because he was sentenced as a career offender. Williams concedes that the issue he raises on appeal is controlled by our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), but he argues that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided as the sentencing guidelines are fully advisory, even in \u00a7 3582 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-30\">The district court did not err in denying Williams\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he was sentenced as a career offender. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (holding that a district court lacks authority under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence when the defendant was sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 as a career offender). Additionally, Williams\u2019s argument that the sentencing guidelines are fully advisory, even in \u00a7 3582 proceedings, is also foreclosed by precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664).
