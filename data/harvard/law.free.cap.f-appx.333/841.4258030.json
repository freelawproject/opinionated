The district court denied Ta-mez-Plata leave to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Tamez-Plata is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Tamez-Plata argues that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced pursuant to Amendment 709, which clarified which misdemeanor and petty offenses are counted in determining the defendant\u2019s criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). He argues that the application of the amendment would lower his sentencing guidelines range and that the district court should reconsider his advisory sentencing guidelines range in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. Section 3582(c)(2) applies only to retroactive guidelines amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a); <em>Drath, </em>89 F.3d at 218. The Sentencing Commission has stated in \u00a7 lB1.10(a) that unless an amendment is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), a reduction based on the amendment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not consistent with the policy statement of \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c) (May 2008). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court correctly denied Tamez-Plata\u2019s motion. <em>See Drath, </em>89 F.3d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">Insofar as Tamez-Plata argues that he is entitled to a reduction of his sentence because Amendment 709 is a clarifying amendment, we have held that, except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not retroactively applied unless the amendment is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See id. </em>at 217-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Tamez-Plata has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal was not taken in good faith was incorrect. Accordingly, his request for IFP is DENIED, <em>see Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24, and his appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
