She was sentenced to a 64-month term of imprisonment, a five-year term of supervised release, $568,366.11 in restitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>tion, and a $100 special assessment. Young challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction in her base offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. She contends that she (1) truthfully admitted the conduct comprising the offense; (2) truthfully admitted or did not falsely deny any additional relevant conduct; and (3) timely manifested acceptance of responsibility, entering her guilty plea before trial. She argues that the court should not have withheld the two-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility merely because the court rejected her mitigation argument that her former boss also was involved in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">An appellate court\u2019s review of a sentence must start with the issue whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). A finding that a defendant has not accepted responsibility is examined \u201cunder a standard of review even more deferential than a pure clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Cano-Guel, </em>167 F.3d 900, 906 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We will affirm the denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1 unless the denial is without foundation. <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The testimony at the sentencing hearing and the facts set forth in the presentence report support the finding that Young\u2019s allegation that her former boss was involved in the offense was false. A defendant\u2019s attempt to minimize conduct provides a sufficient foundation for the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 175-77 (5th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s denial of the downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was not without foundation. <em>See Solis, </em>299 F.3d at 458. Young has not shown that the district court clearly erred in denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See Cano-Guel, </em>167 F.3d at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b869-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
