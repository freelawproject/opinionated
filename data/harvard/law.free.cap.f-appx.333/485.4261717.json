Smith, appointed counsel for Harry Lee Telfair in this direct criminal appeal, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In considering counsel\u2019s motion, we consider only the propriety of Telfair\u2019s 2006 amended sentence at issue in this out-of-time direct appeal. We do not examine the propriety of any other actions Telfair has taken, or may take in the future. Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of this out-of-time direct appeal for Telfair\u2019s 2006 amended sentence is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Telfair\u2019s amended sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
