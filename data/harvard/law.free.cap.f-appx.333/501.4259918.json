The district court determined that Smith was ineligible for relief under Amendment 706 because he had been sentenced as a career offender. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-22\">On appeal, Smith argues that, despite his career offender status, he was eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706 because\u2014after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)\u2014the advisory nature of the guidelines gave the court discretion to lower his sentence. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-23\">Amendment 706 \u2014 which became retroactive on 3 March 2008, U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. 1 May 2008) \u2014 reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). But a defendant who is sentenced pursuant to the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, is ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (concluding that the district court had no authority to reduce the sentence of a defendant who was sentenced as a career offender). So here, the district court committed no error in denying Smith\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion given that he was sentenced based on the offense level for the career offender guideline instead of the offense level for drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">While Smith argues that <em>Moore </em>was decided incorrectly, neither this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>nor the Supreme Court has overruled it. <em>See United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8655) (explaining that we are bound to follow our prior precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court).\u201d And Smith\u2019s argument that <em>Booker </em>allows the district court to reduce his sentence is unavailing. Smith was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706; and <em>Booker </em>does not, by itself, permit a court to impose a section 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
