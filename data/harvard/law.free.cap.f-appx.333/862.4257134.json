However, Singh\u2019s notice of appeal and brief to the BIA did not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that his asylum application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>was untimely. Because the exhaustion requirement is statutorily mandated, Singh\u2019s failure to exhaust this issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar to our consideration of the issue. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). In addition, we lack jurisdiction to review a factual determination that an alien has failed to meet the one-year deadline for filing an asylum application. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 594-95 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Singh also argues that the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal based on an adverse credibility finding. We review the record to determine whether an adverse credibility determination is \u201csupported by specific and cogent reasons derived from the record.\u201d <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). It is the petitioner\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306 (5th Cir.2005). Nothing in Singh\u2019s arguments suggests that we should substitute our own judgment for the determination that Singh was not credible. <em>See id. </em>Because the denial of Singh\u2019s claim for withholding of removal was based on a finding that he was not credible, we will not review the decision to deny relief. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Singh also argues that he has shown that he is qualified for relief under the CAT. However, Singh\u2019s notice of appeal and brief to the BIA did not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that he failed to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT. Because Singh failed to exhaust this issue, we will not consider it. <em>See Wang, </em>260 F.3d at 452-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Finally, Singh argues that the BIA erred in finding that the IJ\u2019s conduct of the hearing did not violate his right to due process. The arguments in Singh\u2019s brief are conclusory; he does not address any of the case law, statutes, or regulations cited by the BIA in its detailed analysis of this claim. Inadequately briefed arguments are waived. <em>Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Even if we were to consider this argument, it is without merit. An IJ is required by statute to \u201cinterrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l). Singh has not shown that the IJ\u2019s questioning deprived him of due process. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
