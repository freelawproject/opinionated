In addition, Fengyan argues that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding supporting the denial of her application for withholding of removal under the INA or CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-16\">I. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b484-17\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Frech v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>491 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir.2007). An alien can apply for asylum if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within [one] year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The BIA may consider a late application \u201cif the alien demonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Section 1158(a)(3), however, divests us of jurisdiction to review any such determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>and see Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). Because we lack jurisdiction to consider Fengyan\u2019s asylum claim, we dismiss her petition in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>II. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the BIA issued its own decision but adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning with respect to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we review both opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We review the IJ and BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. The IJ and BIA\u2019s factual determinations, including adverse credibility findings, are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we must affirm \u201cif [they are] supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84 (quotation omitted); <em>and see Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Because the IJ explicitly found that Fengyan\u2019s testimony lacked veracity, credibility, plausibility, and candor, and because the BIA adopted this finding, the burden shifted to Fengyan to show that it was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. Substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding and this Court should deny her petition in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">First, the IJ provided specific, cogent reasons for doubting Fengyan\u2019s veracity, including that her demeanor was evasive, portions of her testimony were unbelievable or implausible, and some of her responses were contradictory. Second, the totality of the circumstances supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion, including that Fengyan (1) asked several questions to be repeated, (2) testified that she did not know where she entered the United States, where she was beaten on her body while in police custody, the details of her domestic addresses, and whether there were other churches in China, (3) testified that she flew from New York to Miami without valid documentation, and (4) testified first that the underground church consisted of a few people, and later that it involved 40 to 50 people meeting a few times a week at members\u2019 homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Third, the IJ and BIA properly considered the supporting documentation in the record and, in light of the credibility problems discussed above, they were entitled to give minimal weight to unauthenticated letters and an unauthenticated hospital record Fengyan provided. Further, while background articles confirmed the occurrence of religious persecution in parts of China, they did not mention Fujian \u2014 Fen-gyan\u2019s home province \u2014 and she failed to present evidence of her continued involvement in the Christian church in support of her claim that she will be singled out for persecution upon her return. Thus, substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding and the denial of Fengyan\u2019s withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">III. CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Because Fengyan\u2019s appeal to the BIA did not challenge the IJ\u2019s finding that she was not entitled to CAT relief, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim as well. <em>See Amaya-Artundnaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). Likewise, she failed to exhaust her claim that she will suffer persecution upon her return for departing China illegally and, regardless, possible sanctions for illegal departure from China would not constitute persecution on the basis of a statutorily protected ground. <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
