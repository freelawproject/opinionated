The district court determined that the appeal is frivolous and denied Eaglin\u2019s pro se motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. Eaglin\u2019s appointed counsel, the federal public defender, asserts that there is no nonfrivolous issue that would support the filing of a motion for leave to proceed IFP in this court and has moved for leave to withdraw. Eaglin has filed a response to the motion requesting appointment of substitute counsel. We have analyzed counsel\u2019s motion under the rubric of <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-23\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Eaglin\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Eaglin\u2019s motion for appointment of substitute counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
