As a result, she broke a finger, which required surgery. She and her husband, Marshall Knight, then sued Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Inc., an independent contractor that performed maintenance at the refinery, alleging that its negligence in maintaining the road where Barbara fell caused her physical injury and Marshall\u2019s loss of consortium, among other things. Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Inc. filed a motion for summary judgment in which it argued that the plaintiffs failed to establish that it owed the plaintiffs a duty because it had not performed work in the area where Barbara\u2019s accident occurred. The plaintiffs responded by producing documents purporting to show that Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Inc. had performed work in the area where Barbara fell. The district court determined that the documents were inadmissible as unauthenticated business records and, even if the documents were considered, that the plaintiffs failed to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Inc. owed a duty to the plaintiffs. The court therefore granted the motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for new trial \u2014 construed as a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u2014 pressing the district court to alter or amend its judgment. The district court denied the motion. Now, the plaintiffs appeal both the grant of summary judgment and the denial of the Rule 59(e) motion. Because the summary judgment evidence reveals no genuine issue of material fact as to the duty element of plaintiffs\u2019 claim and because the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion, we affirm both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b34-15\">On November 9, 2005, Barbara Knight, an ExxonMobil employee working as a lab technician at the Chalmette, L.L.C. refinery, left work to catch a transport van located outside of the refinery\u2019s Gate 3, an exit leading toward Paris Road. Just after passing through Gate 3, Barbara Knight\u2019s foot caught on either a protruding piece of pipe, the raised cement lip of a pothole, or some combination of the two. Her ensuing fall resulted in a fractured fourth metacarpal \u2014 her ring finger \u2014 that required surgery and physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-16\">On November 8, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in Louisiana state court against Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, Inc. (\u201cKBR\u201d), an independent contractor hired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>to perform construction and supplemental maintenance at the refinery. In their complaint, the plaintiffs urged that KBR was hable for the injury to Barbara\u2019s finger and for Marshall\u2019s resulting loss of consortium due to KBR\u2019s negligence in \u201cremov[ing] certain fencing and concrete located alongside the Paris Road entrance to the refinery.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiffs asserted that KBR was negligent for \u201c[fjailure to totally remove the pipe from the concrete,\u201d \u201c[fjailure to properly remove all of the fence and to properly grade said area,\u201d \u201c[fjailure to inspect the job and remove the remaining piece of pipe sticking up,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny acts of negligence which will be shown at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">KBR responded on December 19, 2006, by removing the case for a bench trial to the United Stated District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana based on diversity of citizenship. On June 9, 2008, KBR filed its Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that the record contained insufficient evidence to prove that it owed a duty to the plaintiffs. In support of its motion, KBR pointed to Barbara Knight\u2019s deposition in which she testified that she was unaware of what work KBR performed at the refinery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> KBR additionally submitted the affidavits of Todd Morse and Eli Williams \u2014 respectively, KBR\u2019s Site Manager for the refinery and its Superintendent of the Building and Grounds Division. Both employees asserted in their affidavits that \u201c[KBR] is not responsible for the upkeep, maintenance or repair of the road leading to Gate 3 which was the site of the accident\u201d and that, to the best of their knowledge, \u201cExxon/Mobil never instructed KBR to fix any potholes in the road leading to Gate 3 where the accident occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-16\">The plaintiffs parried with a Memorandum in Opposition to KBR\u2019s motion. In it, they first contended that KBR\u2019s proffered affidavits had \u201cfail[ed] to state that KBR had no involvement\u201d in maintaining- the area of the accident. They then asserted that KBR clearly had a duty to maintain the area as evidenced by numerous documents that the plaintiffs appended to their memorandum. These documents, submitted for the first time as Appendices A and B of the plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum and purportedly obtained from ExxonMobil (the \u201cProject No. 7859 Documents\u201d), evidenced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>according to plaintiffs, a \u201cProject No. 7859\u201d pursuant to which KBR was \u201cinvolved in demolition of concrete slabs and fences\u201d in the area where Barbara Knight fell. Specifically, Appendix A consisted of spreadsheets, each with the heading \u201cKBR Estimating\u201d and dated August 8, 2002. Addressed to the client, ExxonMobil, these spreadsheets appear to detail the cost estimates for various construction projects in numerically designated areas of the refinery, though nothing in the documents explains where in the refinery each numerical area is found. For example, the first page estimates a total \u201cProject Cost\u201d of $23,471 for unspecified work will occur in the refinery\u2019s undefined \u201cArea 22.\u201d Appendix B contains various maps and schematics of sections of the refinery. The maps contain numerous notations and symbols, but these are so small as to be illegible. Similarly, the writing on the key accompanying all of the maps is unreadable. Other than the arguments in their memorandum, the plaintiffs included no evidence explaining or interpreting the Project No. 7859 Documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The parties\u2019 exchange of briefs continued. In KBR\u2019s Response in Support of Summary Judgment, it argued that the Project No. 7859 Documents were inadmissible as hearsay because they constitute unauthenticated business records. The plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent Supplemental Memorandum in Opposition included a July 21, 2008 affidavit from Barbara Knight. This affidavit avers that the Project No. 7859 Documents were kept in the normal course of business in ExxonMobil\u2019s Department of Maintenance and Engineering and that they showed that KBR removed concrete and piping in the area where Barbara Knight fell. Further, the plaintiffs averred that KBR was performing new construction, as shown by the Project No. 7859 Documents, and not maintenance work in the area of Gate 3; thus, they reasserted that KBR failed to demonstrate that it had no involvement in performing work in the area of Barbara Knight\u2019s fall because Morse\u2019s and Williams\u2019s recent depositions indicated that they were only familiar with KBR\u2019s maintenance work and not its new construction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, KBR\u2019s Supplemental Memorandum in Support contended that the business record exception still did not apply to the Project No. 7859 Documents because Barbara Knight was neither ExxonMobil\u2019s records custodian nor an \u201cother qualified witness\u201d possessing personal knowledge concerning when and how the records were made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>KBR also restated its argument that the plaintiffs failed to point to any evidence linking KBR to either maintenance work or new construction in the area where the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">On August 1, 2008, 2008 WL 3010048, the district court granted KBR\u2019s Motion for Summary judgment. It first determined that the summary judgment evidence \u2014 the affidavit and deposition of Barbara Knight, the affidavits and depositions of Morse and Williams, and the Project 7859 Documents \u2014 failed to satisfy the plaintiffs\u2019 obligations under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Addressing the Project No. 7859 Documents in particular, the court stated that the plaintiffs \u201chave not put forth admissible, related evidence explaining the substance of these documents \u2014 which consist primarily of cryptic and very small text and diagrams that are difficult to decipher, much less interpret \u2014 so as to properly connect them to the situs of Ms. Knight\u2019s accident and KBR\u2019s alleged duties regarding that area.\u201d Even if the documents created a genuine issue of material fact, however, the court determined that they were inadmissible hearsay because the plaintiffs failed to authenticate the documents as business records: Barbara Knight\u2019s affidavit fell short because she was neither the records custodian nor otherwise qualified with personal knowledge regarding how the records were made and kept; the documents were not subpoenaed from Exxon-Mobil; no other affidavit was obtained from either ExxonMobil or KBR; and the depositions of Morse and Williams failed to render the documents admissible. Thus, the court granted KBR\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Within ten days after the district court entered judgment in KBR\u2019s favor, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for New Trial asking the court to reconsider and set aside its judgment. The district court treated the motion as a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, they argued (1) that the court\u2019s granting summary judgment constituted a manifest error of law and (2) that newly discovered evidence warranted reconsideration. As new evidence, the plaintiffs submitted documents that they obtained by subpoenaing ExxonMobil. The documents allegedly concerned plans for the installation of a low sulfur MOGAS unit at the refinery (the \u201cMOGAS Documents\u201d) and were similar to the Project No. 7958 Documents in that they contained various unexplained spreadsheets and schematic maps of the refinery. According to the plaintiffs, the documents describe new construction work done by KBR related to the installation of the MO-GAS unit in the area where Barbara Knight\u2019s accident occurred. KBR, in opposing this motion, argued that the district court did not commit a manifest error of law and that the plaintiffs failed to show why they could not have discovered this evidence through the exercise of due diligence prior to the district court\u2019s judgment. The district court agreed with KBR and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion on November 7, 2008, 2008 WL 4861996.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The plaintiffs timely appealed both the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and its order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">We first consider the plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the grant of summary judgment. Finding no error, we then turn to consider the court\u2019s denying plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>A. The Grant Of Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Marseilles Homeowners Condo. Ass\u2019n Inc. v. Fid. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>542 F.3d 1053, 1055 (5th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c). In making this determination, we \u201cmust view all facts in the light most favorable to the non-movant.\u201d <em>Adams v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>465 F.3d 156, 163-64 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of establishing that no genuine issue of material fact exists and may satisfy this burden \u201cby merely pointing out that the evidence in the record contains insufficient proof concerning an essential element\u201d on which the non-movant bears the ultimate burden of proof at trial. <em>Norwegian Bulk Transp. A/S v. Int\u2019l Marine Terminals P\u2019ship, </em>520 F.3d 409, 412 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). In response, the nonmovant must \u201cgo beyond the pleadings and designate specific facts in the record showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>465 F.3d at 164 (internal quotation marks omitted). The nonmovant\u2019s burden is not satisfied \u201cwith conclusory allegations, unsubstantiated assertions, or only a scintilla of evidence.\u201d <em>Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 119 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (same). Further, summary judgment evidence cannot be based on inadmissible hearsay. <em>Fowler v. Smith, </em>68 F.3d 124, 126 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cEvidence on summary judgment may be considered to the extent not based on hearsay or other information excludable at trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">In a Louisiana negligence cause of action, \u201c \u2018[t]he duty \u2014 risk analysis is the standard negligence analysis employed in determining whether to impose liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Audler v. CBC Innovis Inc., </em>519 F.3d 239, 249 (5th Cir.2008) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Lemann v. Essen Lane Daiquiris, </em>923 So.2d 627, 633 (La.2006)). Under this analysis, the plaintiff must prove five elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">(1) the defendant had a duty to conform his conduct to a specific standard (the duty element); (2) the defendant\u2019s conduct failed to conform to the appropriate standard (the breach element); (3) the defendant\u2019s substandard conduct was a cause in fact of the plaintiffs injuries (the cause-in-fact element); (4) the defendant\u2019s substandard conduct was a legal cause of the plaintiffs injuries (the scope of liability or scope of protection element); and (5) the actual damages (the damages element).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-9\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The failure to prove any one of these elements results in a determination of no liability. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">Here, the question is whether the plaintiffs have pointed to summary judgment evidence sufficient to prove the essential duty element of their claim. The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred because: (1) KBR failed to prove its lack of involvement in the area of the accident; and (2) Morse\u2019s and Williams\u2019s depositions, in conjunction with the Project No. 7859 Documents, show that KBR performed new construction work in the area of the accident. KBR, on the other hand, initially argues that the Project No. 7859 Documents are unauthenticated and hence inadmissible because they do not meet the business record exception to the hearsay rule. Next, KBR responds to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tiffs\u2019 arguments by emphasizing that the ultimate burden of proving that KBR owed Barbara Knight a duty lay with the plaintiffs and by asserting that the summary judgment evidence \u2014 even including the Project No. 7859 Documents \u2014 is insufficient to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">We agree with KBR and conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment. As KBR states in its brief, the \u201cplaintiffs entirely fail to understand the nature of KBR\u2019s burden.\u201d The <em>plaintiffs </em>bear the burden of proving that a duty exists, and KBR \u201cneed not <em>negate </em>the elements of the nonmovant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Little, </em>37 F.3d at 1075; <em>see also Duplantis v. Shell Offshore, Inc., </em>948 F.2d. 187, 190 (5th Cir.1991) (\u201c[I]f the moving party will not bear the burden of proof at trial, ... \u2018[it] need not produce evidence negating the existence of a material fact, but need only point out the absence of evidence supporting the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Saunders v. Michelin Tire Corp., </em>942 F.2d 299, 301 (5th Cir.1991)). Thus, KBR is not required to prove that it was not involved in performing work around the area where Barbara Knight fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Turning to the consideration of the summary judgment evidence, we note that the plaintiffs have failed to challenge the district court\u2019s determination that the Project No. 7859 Documents constitute inadmissible hearsay, and the failure to challenge an issue on appeal waives the right to review of that issue. <em>See Dresser v. Ingolia, </em>307 Fed.Appx. 834, 839 n. 7 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe plaintiffs fail to challenge these determinations on appeal; therefore, they have waived these arguments.\u201d). Even so, the documents were properly excluded by the district court because Barbara Knight was not qualified to authenticate the documents as business records; thus, the documents do not satisfy the business record exception to the hearsay rule set forth as Rule 803(6) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 331 (5th Cir.2008) (stating that \u201c[t]he means of authenticating records of regularly conducted activity under Rule 803(6) are found within that rule\u201d and concluding that evidence was inadmissible because the sponsoring witness lacked personal knowledge of how the report was prepared or of the business\u2019s practices in making the records); <em>Moore v. United Parcel Sen., Inc., </em>150 Fed.Appx. 315, 318 (5th Cir.2005) (concluding that the district court properly determined that evidence failed to support a plaintiffs claim where the plaintiff submitted documents that were unauthenticated business records and were unaccompanied by explanatory information to understand the statistical data that they contained).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">That said, the summary judgment evidence, even were we to include the Project No. 7859 Documents, fails to create a genuine issue of material fact as to KBR\u2019s duty in the area where Barbara Knight fell. Morse\u2019s and Williams\u2019s affidavits and depositions demonstrate that KBR performed no maintenance work in the area, and the Project No. 7859 Documents show planned construction projects as of August 2002 in impossible-to-identify locations on refinery property by means of indecipherable schematics, maps, and spreadsheets. The plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory assertions as to the import of the Project No. 7859 Documents notwithstanding, there is nothing in the record to suggest that KBR owed a duty to the plaintiffs by virtue of its performing work in the area of Barbara Knight\u2019s accident. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting KBR\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">B. The Denial Of A New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">The plaintiffs next challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their Motion for New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Trial, which the district court properly-treated as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment. See <em>Lavespere v. Niagara Mach. &amp; Tool Works, Inc., </em>910 F.2d 167, 173 (5th Cir.1990) (stating that a motion attempting to challenge a prior summary judgment on the merits will be treated as a Rule 59(e) motion \u201c[i]f [it] is served within ten days of the rendition of judgment\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Little, </em>37 F.3d at 1075 n. 14. \u201cRulings on Rule 59(e) motions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. Unless the district court clearly abused its discretion in determining that plaintiffs\u2019 motion neither established a manifest error of law or fact nor presented newly discovered evidence, the district court\u2019s ruling should not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Coliseum Square Ass\u2019n v. Jackson, </em>465 F.3d 215, 247 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">A Rule 59(e) motion \u201cserves the narrow purpose of allowing a party to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence\u201d and \u201cis not the proper vehicle for rehashing evidence, legal theories, or arguments that could have been offered or raised before the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Templet v. HydroChem Inc., </em>367 F.3d 473, 478-79 (5th Cir.2004). Here, plaintiffs attempt to do just that. First, they assert that granting summary judgment constitutes a manifest error of law by re-arguing that KBR failed to meet its burden of proving the non-existence of a genuine issue of material fact. Like before, the plaintiffs misunderstand the summary judgment standard; as the party bearing the ultimate burden of proof at trial, the onus is on the plaintiffs to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact concerning this essential element.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">And second, the plaintiffs argue that newly discovered evidence obtained by subpoenaing ExxonMobil \u2014 the MOGAS Documents \u2014 warrants alteration of the judgment. However, the plaintiffs fail to adequately explain why they did not obtain these documents before summary judgment, and \u201c \u2018[a]n unexcused failure to present evidence available at the time of summary judgment provides a valid basis for denying a subsequent motion for reconsideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>ICEE Distribs., Inc. v. J &amp; J Snack Foods Corp., </em>445 F.3d 841, 847-48 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Templet, </em>367 F.3d at 479). Plaintiffs assert that they failed to produce these documents earlier because they \u201cbelieved that [the] documents in their possession were sufficient to prove that KBR worked in the area in question.\u201d Additionally, they contend that KBR failed to provide these documents in response to a request for discovery. Both of these arguments are unpersuasive: the plaintiffs\u2019 confidence provides no excuse for their failure to obtain this evidence before the district court\u2019s judgment, and there is nothing to suggest that KBR actually possessed these documents and purposefully withheld them. Further, the plaintiffs knew from the outset of these proceedings that the accident occurred on the grounds of a refinery operated by ExxonMobil, and they could have easily obtained these documents from ExxonMobil prior to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">For these reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order granting KBR\u2019s motion for summary judgment and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying the plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b34-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
