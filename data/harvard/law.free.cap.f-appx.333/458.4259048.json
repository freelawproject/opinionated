Vickers also argues that the district court erred in finding that the firearm he possessed was used in connection with a homicide. Vickers lastly contends that his trial counsel was ineffective. For reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-19\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss an indictment for pre-indictment delay for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Foxman, </em>87 F.3d 1220, 1222 (11th Cir.1996). \u201cThe limit on pre-indictment delay is usually set by the statute of limitations. But, the Due Process Clause can bar an indictment even when the indictment is brought within the limitation period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1222. For dismissal to be proper, a defendant must show that pre-indictment delay caused him actual, substantial prejudice and that the government intentionally delayed prosecuting the case in order to gain a tactical advantage over the accused. <em>Id. </em>Although actual preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>dice is a necessary element of a due process claim, it is not, standing alone, sufficient to support dismissal. <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 790, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 2048-49, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Regarding post-indictment delay, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss based on the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161, <em>et seq., </em>or upon the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>376 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated, we must consider: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the cause of the delay; (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right to a speedy trial; and (4) the presence or absence of prejudice resulting from the delay. <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972); <em>see also United States v. Ingram, </em>446 F.3d 1332, 1336 (11th Cir.2006). Unless the first three factors all weigh heavily against the government, the defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>769 F.2d 1544, 1547 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">A delay attributable to negligence is weighted less heavily than a deliberate delay, but still counts against the government. <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>722 F.2d 1510, 1513 (11th Cir.1984). When the investigation was not performed diligently, however, it weighs heavily against the government. <em>Ingram, </em>446 F.3d at 1339-40 (holding that a two-year delay weighed heavily against the government when the arresting officer knew where the defendant lived and worked and made only weak efforts to contact the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">A defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial. <em>Ingram, </em>446 F.3d at 1337. Where the defendant did not know of the indictment until arrest, however, he may promptly assert his right to a speedy trial after arrest, and it weighs heavily against the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1340. A defendant may invoke the right to a speedy trial after indictment, information, other formal charge, or upon \u201carrest and holding to answer a criminal charge.\u201d <em>Dillingham v. United States, </em>423 U.S. 64, 65, 96 S.Ct. 303, 304, 46 L.Ed.2d 205 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">In the situation where the government has placed a detainer on the defendant, the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (\u201cIADA\u201d) provides that the defendant shall be brought to trial within 180 days after delivery of his speedy trial request has been delivered to the prosecutor and court. <em>Fex v. Michigan, </em>507 U.S. 43, 47-48, 52, 113 S.Ct. 1085, 1089, 1091, 122 L.Ed.2d 406 (1993) (expressly rejecting the contention that it was the defendant\u2019s transmittal of a speedy trial request to prison authorities that initiated the 180-day period even if that request was lost in the mail or was not delivered to the prosecuting agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u201cAlthough compliance with the Speedy Trial Act does not bar Sixth Amendment speedy trial claims, \u2018it will be an unusual case in which time limits of the Speedy Trial Act have been met but the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial has been violated,\u2019 \u201d as the <em>Barker </em>factors underlie a speedy trial constitutional claim. <em>United States v. Twitty, </em>107 F.3d 1482, 1490 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u201cTo trigger a speedy trial analysis, an accused must allege that the interval between [the indictment] and trial has crossed the threshold dividing ordinary from presumptively prejudicial delay.\u201d <em>Ingram, </em>446 F.3d at 1336. \u201cOnly if this threshold point is satisfied may the court proceed with the final three factors in the <em>Barker </em>analysis.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>83 F.3d 1350, 1352 (11th Cir.1996). \u201cDelays exceeding one year are generally found to be \u2018presumptively prejudicial.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>Ingram, </em>446 F.3d at 1336; see <em>also United States v. Otero-Hernandez, </em>743 F.2d 857, 858 n. 3 (11th Cir.1984) (noting that a seven-month delay is not \u201cpresumptively prejudicial\u201d within the meaning of the test for a speedy trial violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">In any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date (and making public) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, <em>whichever date last occurs.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1) (emphasis added). \u201cHowever, the Act excludes from the computation of the 70 days \u2018any period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to ... delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris, </em>376 F.3d at 1288 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F)) (brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Here, under the doctrine of invited error, we are precluded from reversing a district court error, if any, that was made in denying Vickers\u2019s pre-indictment delay claim or his Speedy Trial Act violation claim because he conceded to the court that he had no such claims and invited the district court to focus only on his constitutional right to a speedy trial. <em>See United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cIt is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Even if we did not view the invited error doctrine as applicable, we would still conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion because the indictment was returned within the statute of limitations, and Vickers failed to provide evidence of actual, substantial prejudice or that any pre-indictment delay was intended to gain a tactical advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Regarding his post-indictment delay claims, Vickers failed to show that he was presumptively prejudiced by the delay and although the court was not obligated to touch upon the other <em>Barker </em>factors, Vick-ers nevertheless failed to show that, the cause of the delay was improper, that the government received his request for a speedy trial, or that he was actually prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">We review a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review ... [and] its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). We will not find clear error unless we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005)(internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">If a defendant used or possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with the commission or attempted commission of another offense,\u201d and death resulted, then the sentencing guidelines direct that the homicide guideline under \u00a7 2A1.1 should be applied. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(e)(l)(B). The phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d is not defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c). However, we have interpreted this phrase expansively, finding that it reflects the context of the defendant\u2019s possession. <em>Rhind, </em>289 F.3d at 695 (interpreting the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in the context of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) and applying it in case where defendants drove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>a car during their crime spree that contained firearms). In addition, we have held that the firearm does not have to facilitate the underlying offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">When the district court states that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the advisory guideline calculations, we may assume error and review whether the ultimate sentence is supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Here, the evidence showed that Vickers murdered someone with the firearm. That is clearly in connection with the offense of possession of a firearm. Additionally, Vickers\u2019s 120-month sentence was reasonable because the record shows that the court adequately reviewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Vickers\u2019s criminal history and circumstances and determined that a 120-month sentence promoted respect for the law, reflected the seriousness of the offense, provided just punishment, and protected the public from a person with a very violent criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">To the extent that Vickers received ineffective assistance of counsel, such a claim is not cognizable on direct appeal, unless the record is sufficiently developed. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 508, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Verbitskaya, </em>406 F.3d 1324, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). We decline to address ineffective assistance of counsel in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Vickers\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
