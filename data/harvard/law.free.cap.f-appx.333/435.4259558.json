McAffee argues that the district court erred in denying his \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion, despite his career-offender designation, because Amendment 706 does not specify that career offenders are ineligible for a sentence reduction. He asserts that the district court departed downward at sentencing based on his criminal history category over-representing his criminal history, and the additional reduction to his offense level for acceptance of responsibility did not preclude him from being eligible for a reduction under Amendment 706. Further, McAffee submits that (1) under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory in all contexts, (2) under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the court should have considered the crack and powder cocaine sentencing disparity, and (3) the court should have considered his post-sentencing achievements.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">In the instant case, McAffee\u2019s sentencing range was determined by his career-offender offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1, and his crack cocaine base offense level played no role in his ultimate sentence. Because Amendment 706 only affects base offense levels in \u00a7 2D1.1, it would not reduce McAffee\u2019s sentencing range, and he was ineligible for relief under Amendment 706. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)) (prohibiting reduction where \u201camendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-9\">. We also find no merit to McAfee's other arguments. The sentencing court did not depart downward based on his criminal history category over-representing his criminal history. Further, McAffee's arguments that he should receive a sentence reduction under <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>are foreclosed by precedent. See <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), petition for cert. filed, (U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664) (holding that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to original sentencing proceedings and do \"not address motions to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
