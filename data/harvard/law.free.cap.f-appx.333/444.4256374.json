Hat-ten\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendments 505, 706, 711, and 715 to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, which collectively reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, Hatten argues that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when it refused to sentence him below the minimum of the amended guideline range. Hatten asserts that, despite the language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, which constrains the court\u2019s authority to go below the amended range, that section, like all of the Guidelines, is merely advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the ease of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statements, found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, state that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-2\">Hatten\u2019s argument that he was entitled to a reduction below his amended guideline range is foreclosed by precedent. We recently held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and thus, the district court is bound by the limitations imposed by \u00a7 1B1.10 and does not have the authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the amended guideline range. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Booker </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 10, 2009) (No. 08-8664).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
