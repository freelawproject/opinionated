Liu contends that the BIA ignored evidence that as a member of a Chinese opposition political party he faces a more serious risk of arrest and sentencing than he did when he was first ordered removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of motions to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). This review is \u201climited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). (quotation omitted). \u201cGenerally, motions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 808 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-20\">A party may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is an exception to the 90-day and one-motion limits, which provides that the limits shall not apply if the motion to reopen is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). To meet this exception, a movant must show \u201cthat evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-21\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Liu\u2019s motion to reopen. Liu has not presented sufficient evidence that country conditions in China have changed since he was ordered removed in 2002. Rather, Liu\u2019s contention was based on his new activities of belonging to the opposition party and publishing anti-gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>eminent articles. However, this does not fall under the limited exception found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). Additionally, the U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in China suggest that the Chinese government\u2019s persecution of members of Liu\u2019s political party during the time period between Liu\u2019s removal order and his motion to reopen was persistent. Because Liu did not demonstrate changed country conditions, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">PETITION DENIED<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-22\">.
