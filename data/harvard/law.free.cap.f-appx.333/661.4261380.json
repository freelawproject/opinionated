For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-28\">Reyes filed an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that prison officials violated his constitutional rights by provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ing poor medical care regarding the removal of his cataracts and by ordering him to work with hazardous chemicals in the kitchen after his surgery. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that Reyes had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). To support the motion, the defendants submitted a declaration from Christina Kennedy, the prison superintendent\u2019s assistant, indicating that Reyes had submitted only one grievance while incarcerated at SCI-Forest. That grievance was dated January 31, 2008, and it was rejected as untimely because it related to work issues from 2006 and 2007. According to Kennedy\u2019s declaration, Reyes did not appeal this decision. In his brief in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion, Reyes did not address the issue of exhaustion or provide evidence that he had complied with the prison\u2019s grievance procedure; instead, he merely reiterated the merits of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The Magistrate Judge treated the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment and recommended that it be granted because Reyes had not exhausted his administrative remedies in accordance with the PLRA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reyes did not object to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report. By order entered January 8, 2009, 2009 WL 57060, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation and granted the defendants\u2019 motion. Reyes then filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Summary judgment is proper, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, where, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all inferences in favor of that party, no genuine issue of material fact exists. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Kaucher v. County of Bucks, </em>455 F.3d 418, 422-23 (3d Cir.2006). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Camp v. Brennan, </em>219 F.3d 279, 280 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The PLRA prohibits an inmate from bringing a civil rights suit alleging specific acts of unconstitutional conduct by prison officials until he has exhausted available administrative remedies. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). \u201c[Ejxhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and ... unexhausted claims cannot be brought in court.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 211, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Pennsylvania\u2019s Inmate Grievance System, DC-ADM 804, requires a prisoner to follow a three-step review process: An initial grievance must be submitted to the Grievance Coordinator within 15 days after the events upon which the claims are based. <em>See </em>DC-ADM 804, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Part VI.A.8. If the Grievance Coordinator\u2019s decision is adverse to the inmate, it can be appealed to the local prison\u2019s Facility Manager or Superintendent. <em>See </em>DC-ADM 804, Part VLC. Once the intermediate decision is made, the inmate has 15 days from the date that the decision was received to file a final appeal with the Office of Inmate Grievances and Appeals. <em>See </em>DC-ADM 804, Part VI.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In support of their motion to dismiss, the defendants submitted a declaration indicating that Reyes had \u201cfiled only one grievance while at SCI-Forest, on January 31, 2008, [that] [i]t was rejected as untimely because it related to work issues from 2006 and 2007, ... [and] that [h]e did not appeal the rejection.... \u201d Reyes did not present any evidence to contradict the defendants\u2019 claim that he had failed to comply with the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Under the circumstances, we agree that Reyes failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that this appeal presents no substantial question. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-5\">. \"If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) ... matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(d). Here, the defendants submitted evidence with their motion to dismiss. In addition, the Commonwealth's Rule 12(b) motion invited the District Court to convert it to a request for summary judgment if necessary. Accordingly, Reyes was sufficiently on notice of the possible conversion to summary judgment. See <em>In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>184 F.3d 280, 288-89 (3d Cir.1999). In any event, we note that Reyes responded to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss by submitting outside material of his own. Moreover, the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation made explicit the conversion to summary judgment, and Reyes was given time to file objections. He did not. For the sake of completeness, we note that \u2014 in some cases, anyway \u2014 it is acceptable to dismiss a prisoner's complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) at the pleadings stage. <em>See, e.g., Spruill </em>v. <em>Gillis, </em>372 F.3d 218, 223 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
