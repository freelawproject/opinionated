California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ray has filed a response and has also filed a motion for appointment of counsel. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Ray\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such claims generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">So, too, is Ray\u2019s claim of mental incapacity. Although the district court record suggests Ray may have suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the record does not contain evidence that the PTSD rendered Ray \u201cunable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(d). The current record does not support an appellate argument that the district court failed to comply with its duty to ascertain Ray\u2019s competence to understand rationally the proceedings. <em>United States v. Sparks, </em>2 F.3d 574, 584 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Ray\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2. Ray\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
