On appeal, Medina alleges a Fifth and Sixth Amendment violation on the ground that the enhancement of his sentence due to an increase in the base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) was based on a predicate aggravated felony that was neither charged in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-25\">Because Medina properly raised his objections to the enhancement of his sentence to the district court, we review the sentence <em>de novo, </em>but will only reverse for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-26\">A district court does not violate the Sixth Amendment when conducting judicial fact finding, so long as it applies the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory. <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that extra-verdict enhancements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>used \u201cin a non-mandatory guidelines system [are] constitutionally permissible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Medina\u2019s challenge on appeal is limited to the increase in his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). However, to the extent he also seeks to challenge the statutory enhancement in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), that challenge is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 246-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1232-33, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that neither the statute nor the Constitution require the government to charge a prior offense in the indictment or prove it beyond a reasonable doubt when it is being used to increase a sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Moreover, at the sentencing hearing, the district court acknowledged that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory when it pronounced Medina\u2019s sentence. Since the court applied the Sentencing Guidelines in an advisory manner, the court did not violate the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by enhancing Medina\u2019s sentence based on a prior conviction that was not alleged in the indictment. <em>See Dudley, </em>463 F.3d at 1228. Accordingly, we affirm Medina\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
