Ucciferri, federal prisoner # 10339-018, appeals the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his sentence for maintaining a building for the purpose of manufacturing marijuana. Ucciferri argues that he is actually innocent, having been convicted of conduct that did not constitute a federal criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Ucciferri may bring this claim in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding only by demonstrating under the \u201csavings clause\u201d that the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900 (5th Cir.2001). \u201c[T]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which established that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904. Conceding that his actual innocence claim meets neither prong of the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>test, Ucciferri nevertheless urges us to hold the savings clause inapplicable under the facts of his case. The <em>Reyes-Requena </em>actual innocence test, however, is binding precedent in this circuit. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also In re Brown, </em>457 F.3d 392, 394 n. 1 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b918-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
