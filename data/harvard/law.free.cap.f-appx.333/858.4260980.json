Tillman compares how much a defendant charged with possession of marijuana would have to possess to receive a sentence similar to that received by him in connection with the revocation of his supervised release. He argues that, given his criminal history, his sentence is too harsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-24\">Upon revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release, the district court may impose any sentence that falls within the statutory maximum term of imprisonment allowed for revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The district court must consider the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>including the non-binding policy statements in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>see United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 92-93 (5th Cir.1994). We review the sentence imposed on revocation of supervised release to determine whether it is unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005) (noting it is unnecessary to decide which standard applies where a sentence passes muster under both standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">In determining Tillman\u2019s sentence, the district court noted his history and characteristics by noting that Tillman, who had twice been released to supervised release, had been unwilling to abide by the conditions of his supervised release. The district court also noted the need to protect the public from future crimes by Tillman, who had been convicted while on supervised release of disorderly conduct, profanity, providing false information, and simple assault. Tillman has not shown that the 24-month sentence imposed was unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a); <em>Mathena, </em>23 F.3d at 93-94 (affirming statutory maximum sentence of 36 months where guidelines range for revocation was 6 to 12 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b890-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
