Thomas, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels applicable to crack cocaine offenses. On appeal, Thomas, whose guideline range was determined based on his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, argues that the district court erred in finding that he was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 because he was sentenced as a career offender. In addition, he contends that the district court should have reduced his sentence in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in: (1) <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); (2) <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and (3) <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence modification is not consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy statements where an amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Thomas\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by precedent. Thomas was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his guideline range was based on his status as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that, where a defendant\u2019s base offense level is calculated under the career-offender provision in \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e), Amendment 706 does not operate to lower the defendant\u2019s guideline range, and, therefore, the defendant is not eligible for a sentence modification under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)), <em>cert denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Furthermore, Thomas cannot show that <em>Booker </em>or its progeny or the advisory nature of the Guidelines made him eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>(rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Booker </em>effectively lowered his guideline range by making it advisory and reiterating that <em>Booker, </em>standing alone, does not render a defendant eligible for a sentence reduction), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). To the extent that Thomas argues that his original sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Apprendi </em>and that the district court should have considered the crack-powder sentencing disparity pursuant to <em>Kim-brough, </em>the district court properly declined to address these arguments because they were outside the scope of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that, in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Thus, the district court did not err in denying Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
