The district court dismissed Gregory\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because Gregory had not shown that his \u00a7 2241 petition falls within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-24\">Generally, a collateral attack on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). If a petitioner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he must apply for and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h). However, the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner, even if he has already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 under certain circumstances. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-25\">To fall within the savings clause, a petitioner must show that an otherwise avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>able remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). Consequently, a petitioner who has filed a previous \u00a7 2255 motion and been denied may not circumvent the successive-motion rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>Rather, under <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>the savings clause applies when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a nonexistent offense; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The district court did not err in dismissing Gregory\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. In 2006, Gregory pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Gregory did not file a direct appeal of his convictions or sentences. In 2007, Gregory filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that his firearm offense was not supported by sufficient evidence. The district court denied this \u00a7 2255 motion as barred by Gregory\u2019s plea agreement and without merit. Gregory voluntarily dismissed his appeal of the denial. Gregory then filed the instant petition without first obtaining permission from this Court. Thus, Gregory\u2019s petition is barred as a successive motion unless it falls within the savings clause and can proceed under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Gregory does not make any argument that he satisfies the <em>Wofford </em>test or identify any retroactively applicable Supreme Court precedent. Instead, Gregory makes substantive arguments about his underlying claims. Specifically, Gregory argues: (1) unconstitutional defects in his indictment; (2) prosecutorial misconduct; (3) breach of the plea agreement; (4) ineffective assistance of counsel; and (5) actual innocence as to a dismissed count.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, a petitioner may not argue the merits of his claims until he has \u201copen[ed] the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding by showing that the savings clause applies. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3. Given that Gregory has not satisfied even the first prong of the <em>Wof-ford </em>test, the \u00a7 2241 portal remains shut, and we have no cause to address the merits of his underlying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-16\">. The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-5\">. We note, in any event, that Gregory's \"actual innocence\u201d argument relates to a third count in his indictment \u2014 for being a felon in possession of a firearm \u2014 that was dismissed as part of the plea agreement and does not relate to either count of conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
