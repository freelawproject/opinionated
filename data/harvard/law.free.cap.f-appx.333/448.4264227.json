Allen, who was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine and was attributed 848 grams of crack cocaine, argues that he is entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief because his offense level was based on \u00a7 2D1.1, and that he was not sentenced as, or ever determined to be a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. He also asserts that the statutory maximum sentence for his offense was actually 240 months, and consequently, the district court at his original sentencing exceeded its authority because it sentenced him to 480 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any such reduction must also be consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements, which similarly provide, <em>inter alia, </em>that a sentencing reduction is not permitted where the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).III.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-19\">A defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1, such as the career offender guideline section of \u00a7 4B1.1, is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)) (stating that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where \u201cthe amendment ... is applicable to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>dant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d). Where the base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 play no role in the calculation of the guideline range, the defendant is not entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief under Amendment 706. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In <em>Moore, </em>however, we did not address the applicability of Amendment 706 to a career offender who was originally sentenced based on the drug quantity guideline. In a related context, we have suggested that Amendment 706 might apply to armed career criminals who were originally sentenced based on the drug quantity guideline, because such individuals would have been \u201csentenced to a \u2018range that has subsequently been lowered\u2019 under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>James, </em>548 F.3d at 985 n. 2. Consequently, if the offense level was based on \u00a7 2D1.1, the defendant\u2019s guideline range would be lowered, and Amendment 706 would apply. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Nevertheless, proceedings under \u00a7 3582 do not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Rather, \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A court applying an amendment under \u00a7 3582 \u201cmust recalculate the sentence under the amended guidelines, first determining a new base level by substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 780; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Facts contained in the PSI are \u201cundisputed and deemed to have been admitted, unless party objects to them before the sentencing court with specificity and clarity.\u201d <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 843-44 (11th Cir.2009). Indeed, a defendant\u2019s failure to object to allegations of fact at sentencing means that the defendant admitted those facts for sentencing purposes, and precludes any argument that there was error in them. <em>Id. </em>at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Regarding his eligibility for a sentence reduction, although the record is not clear whether the court specifically found that Allen was a career offender, there is no doubt that he is a career offender. Allen failed to object to his career offender status below and conceded that his criminal history, which reveals that he had more than two prior felony convictions and therefore qualified him as a career offender, was correct. Consequently, we assume that the court at the original sentencing applied the guidelines correctly and found that he was a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Although Allen was not sentenced under the career offender provisions because his offense level under the drug quantity guidelines, in \u00a7 2D1.1, was higher than the offense level as a career offender, he nevertheless is not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. Because all original sentencing determinations are left unchanged in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the court was required to determine Allen\u2019s new base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1, and compare that number to his career offender offense level under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). In this respect, the court did not err in determining that Amendment 706 would not have the effect of reducing his sentencing range, as this approach is consistent with the policy statement in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">To the extent that Allen seeks to challenge his original sentence based on his argument that his statutory maximum sentence was 240 months, he may not do so in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Moreover, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>argument fails because the mandatory maximum sentence was life imprisonment due to his possession of over 500 grams of crack cocaine and his prior conviction for a felony drug offense. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
