Renshaw, 152 Ill. 491.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-7\" pgmap=\"586\">The plea is subject to the same interpretation and construction as dilatory pleas, and therefore must be subjected to strict construction, and must comply with all technical requirements of such dilatory plea.

Dig. Abatement, I, 24; 1 Chitty, Pl. 637; 3 Black. Com. 316; 5 Peters 232; 1 Allen 214.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-5\" pgmap=\"587\">Sec. 126. \u201cA plea of this kind, in abatement, begins and concludes like a plea of the same kind when pleaded in the first instance; but when pleaded in bar, it begins with saying that the plaintiff, ought not further to maintain his action; and concludes by praying judgment if the plaintiff Ought further to maintain his action. In other respects, pleas of this kind are governed by the same rules which regulate other pleas in general.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-6\" pgmap=\"587\">. The form of this plea is identical with the one given by Chitty, where a release is sought to be pleaded, puis dtwrein continuance, as a plea in bar. 3 Chitty (15th Am. Ed.) 1238.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-7\" pgmap=\"587\">Whether a plea is in abatement or in bar, is to be determined, not from the subject-matter of the plea, but from its conclusion. The advantage or relief sought by the plea\u2014 the prayer of the plea\u2014determines its character. Jenkins v. Pepoon, 2 Johns. Cas. 312; 1 Tidd\u2019s Pr. 637; Pitts\u2019 Sons Manf. Co. v. Commercial Nat. Bank, 121 Ill. 587.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-8\" pgmap=\"587\">Pleas in bar and pleas in abatement have, therefore, this marked distinction: Pleas in bar are addressed to the merits of the claim, and as impairing the right of action altogether, whereas, pleas in abatement tend merely to divert, suspend, or defeat the present, suit. 1 Saunders\u2019 Pl. and Ev. 1, 2; Comyn\u2019s Digest, title Abatement; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 441; Pitts\u2019 Sons Manf.

Bank, 121 Ill. 587.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-9\" pgmap=\"587(55) 588(17)\">As a general rule, the plea puis darrein waives all previous pleas, but not the defense thereby pleaded. It admits the cause of action to the same extent as if no other defense had been urged than that contained in this plea. But it does not admit away that defense. Raynor v. Dyett, 2 Wend. 300; Kimball v. Huntington, 10 Wend. 680; East St. Louis v. Renshaw, 153 Ill. 496.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-5\" pgmap=\"588\">It is only to that extent that it admits that the suit was properly begun and prosecuted up to that time. And the only bearing, of this is on the question of costs. Mount v. Scholes, 120 Ill. 400.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-6\" pgmap=\"588\">The effect is merely that the case stands as if there was no other defense than that set up on this plea. East St. Louis v. Renshaw, 153 Ill. 496.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-7\" pgmap=\"588\">\u2022And this plea does not always even waive former pleas. Baynor v. Dyett, 2 Wend. 300.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-8\" pgmap=\"588\">A bond is to be construed strictly in favor of the obligee. The contracts and obligations of sureties are always to be strictly construed in favor of the sureties. Nothing can be taken by implication or argument. The strict and clear letter of the bond is the measure of their liability. Crego v. The People, 36 Ill. App. 407.</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-9\" pgmap=\"588\">Beneficiaries under the bond will not be permitted to enlarge the liability of sureties, or to change their contract, by any sort of device.

Toomey, 132 Ill. 308.</p> <opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b588-10\" pgmap=\"588\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"AMGr\" pgmap=\"588\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b588-11\" pgmap=\"588\">The judgment of this court having been affirmed by' the Supreme Court, more than ten days after such affirmance, suit was begun upon the bond given by appellee. When suit was so begun default on said bond had been made by appellee. The condition of the bond gave to him ten days after affirmance within which to pay the amount mentioned in said bond or surrender Berkson. Appellee did neither. Instead of this, he waited for the result of a petition for rehearing.</p> <p id=\"b588-12\" pgmap=\"588\">On December 5th, twenty days after the present suit was begun, and nearly a month after his default, he obtained from the Supreme Court a stay from its judgment. Appellee was then entitled to, and obtained, a stay of proceeding in this suit.</p> <p id=\"b588-13\" pgmap=\"588(10) 589(16)\">On March 21, 1895, the Supreme Court overruled the petition for rehearing; thereupon, Berkson having, March 22, 1895, surrendered himself, appellee filed the aforesaid plea.</p> <p id=\"b589-4\" pgmap=\"589\">This plea does not deny the allegation of the declaration that the judgment of the Appellate Court was affirmed by the Supreme Court on the 29th day of October, 1891; instead of this, departing therefrom, it sets up the filing in the Circuit Court of an order of affirmance of the judgment of that court by the Appellate Court, and that the Appellate Court issued its said order upon a judgment and order of affirmance made by the Supreme Court March 21, 1895; and that no order of affirmance nor certified copy thereof was filed in said Circuit Court until the 22d day of March, 1895; and thereafter, the surrender of Berkson.</p> <p id=\"b589-5\" pgmap=\"589\">The plea does not set up performance of the condition of the bond. The condition is not that the obligation'shall be void if Berkson surrender himself in ten days after the denial of a petition for a rehearing, or after the filing in the Circuit Court of an order affirming its judgment. The judgment of the Appellate Court, mentioned in the bond, was affirmed October 29, 1891. Not when the partition for rehearing was denied. Lester v. The People, 150 Ill. 108-127.</p> <p id=\"b589-6\" pgmap=\"589\">It is urged that Berkson could not surrender himself until an order affirming the judgment of the Circuit Court had been filed in that court. If such be the case, appellee could have procured and filed the orders within ten days after the judgment of affirmance, October 29th, as well as to file them, as he did, within ten days after the order denying the petition for rehearing. As to surrender without such order, see Greenwaldt v. Krauss, 118 Penn. St. 517-523; Saunders v. Quiggs, 112 Penn. 516; Marks v. Drovers National Bank, 114 Penn. 490.</p> <p id=\"b589-7\" pgmap=\"589\">The filing of a certified copy of the order of affirmance was not necessary to the maintenance of an action on the bond. City of Cairo v. Everett, 107 Ill. 75; Smith v. Stephens, 133 Ill. 83; City of East St. Louis v. Renshaw, 153 Ill. 191; Sutherland v. Phelps, 22 Ill. 29.</p> <p id=\"b589-8\" pgmap=\"589\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
