Whereupon complainants brought this suit.</summary><summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-9\" pgmap=\"624(11) 625(94)\">The evidence shows that on the 10th day of March, 1888, (after judgment had been rendered in favor of Wyman, Mullen &amp; Co., and execution had been issued thereon, but before they had been informed thereof), they assigned their claim against Cahn to one David Goodman for the sum of $222.48, and received from said Goodman an article of indemnity wherein and whereb) said Goodman undertook and promised to save Wyman, Mullen &amp; Co., and the sheriff of Douglas county, Wisconsin, harmless, on account of the seizure of Cahn\u2019s goods. In no other way did they receive any of the proceeds of the attachment.</summary><summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-4\" pgmap=\"625\">The evidence further shows that the moneys realized upon the sale of goods under the execution in favor of Henry W. Price were paid by the sheriff to attorneys Steele &amp; Jones, and by them remitted to the Northwestern Collection Loan and Trust Association of Minneapolis, Minnesota, which shortly thereafter failed, none of said moneys actually coming to the hands of defendant, Henry W. Price.</summary><summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-5\" pgmap=\"625\">It further appears from the evidence that said attachments were brought in good faith, in the honest belief that said mortgages were fraudulent and void as to creditors, and for the sole purpose of enforcing the collecting of the claims of appellants and appellees as creditors of Cahn and that no ill feeling or ill will was entertained against the parties.</summary><summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-6\" pgmap=\"625\">The evidence shows that Oliver C. Wyman, G. W. Partridge and Samuel D. Coykendall compose the firm of Wyman, Partridge &amp; Co., and that the firm succeeded to the business of Wyman, Mullen &amp; Co., assuming all its liabilities and collecting all of its assets, and that it is practically the same firm under another name.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-7\" pgmap=\"625\">Flower, Smith &amp; Musgrave, attorneys for appellants,</attorneys><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUM\" pgmap=\"625\">contended that the appellees are liable to contribution under the common law, and the decision of our Supreme Court in Farwell v. Becker, 129 Ill. 261.</p><p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b625-8\" pgmap=\"625(41) 626(28)\">As an abstract question of justice and equity, this appeals strongly to our moral sense of right. The attaching creditors were all seeking to collect just and lawful demands, and to make their money out of property which, until but lately, was beyond all dispute their debtor\u2019s, and which they were advised by their respective attorneys and verily believe still remains his in the eyes of the law.</p><p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b626-5\" pgmap=\"626\">These facts stand admitted upon the record. It is afterward- adjudged that the seizure and sale of the goods and chattels were illegal and void, and the sheriff is held to respond in damages for their value. The sheriff should not suffer, as he has acted under the direction of the plaintiffs or their attorneys in the several actions. The parties who incited the wrongful action should bear the loss; but why one more than another ? Is there any more reason why one of these unintentional wrongdoers should bear the whole burden and the rest go harmless, than there is why one surety upon a promissory note, having been called upon to make good his principal\u2019s paper, should bear the loss alone ? We can conceive of none. Modern equity jurisprudence says there is none and all should bear the loss. Equality, however, is equity, and therefore, where greater benefits have been received by such wrongful acts by some of the wrongdoers than by others, equity will decree that they should bear a greater portion of the loss; hence the doctrine that attaching creditors should contribute pro rata, where attachment is wrongful without mala fides, and damages ensue. Public policy does not forbid it and justice requires it. It has been upheld by the Supreme Courts of other States, but none of the decisions are more carefully considered and the principal more clearly defined than in the case decided by our own Supreme Court heretofore cited, viz., Farwell v. Becker, 129 Ill. 261.</p><attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b626-6\" pgmap=\"626\">J. C. Garver and A. E.

The attachment law of this State is not a part of the common law, yet we are not in this proceeding to conclude there was no law in the State of Wisconsin under which an attachment could be had or maintained.</p> <p id=\"b629-6\" pgmap=\"629\">It is undisputed that appellants and appellees did commence in the State of Wisconsin suits intended by them to be in attachment against Henry Cahn, and that under such proceedings, a large quantity of goods, at one time owned and possessed by him, and then in the possession of his mortgagees, was seized by the sheriff in that State, and such attachment proceedings being prosecuted to judgment, the goods obtained thereon were sold, and the proceeds distributed, as hereinbefore' set forth, to the attachment creditors. ,</p> <p id=\"b629-7\" pgmap=\"629\">We do not feel called upon to decide whether the attorneys for the respective attaching creditors who entered into the agreement to pro rate, had authority from their respective principals so to do. As to this, attention is called to Clark v. Randall, 9 Wis. 135. It is clear from the evidence that appellees knew what their respective attorneys had done in that regard, and made no objection thereto. Moreover, all of the appellees have, directly or indirectly, received the benefits of such agreement, and it is now too late for them to repudiate the same. Apparently such agreement was in the interests of all of the parties to this litigation.</p> <p id=\"b630-4\" pgmap=\"630\">Suit having been brought against the sheriff, whom all of the parties to this litigation had undertaken to indemnify, judgment was obtained against him, from which judgment an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin. Wyman, Mullen &amp; Co. did not sign the bond given upon such appeal, and, so far as appears, took no part in prosecuting the appeal, they having previously thereto assigned their claim to Goodman. Wyman, Mullen &amp; Co. now urge that, not having signed said appeal bond, they can not be made to contribute to the payment of the judgment obtained thereon. Wyman, Mullen &amp; Co. were responsible to the sheriff for any loss or damage which he might suffer on account of the levy which he made at their instance and by their direction. The sheriff who had acted upon their request in making the levy was entitled to call upon them to protect him against the claim made upon and suit brought against him by the mortgagees, whose property he had seized. The sheriff had a right to defend such action and to insist that appellees, and others in whose behalf he acted, should either pay the claim or defray the expenses of conducting the suit brought against him. So, too, when judgment was obtained against him, he had a right to insist that those whose agent he had been should either pay the judgment or defray the expenses of prosecuting an appeal to the Supreme Court. Appellees did neither, and they can not now complain of him, or of those who acted in his behalf, that instead of at once satisfying said judgment, they endeavored to have the same set aside by appeal to the Supreme Court. The sheriff in making the attachment had acted as an agent, appellee being among the number of his principals.</p> <p id=\"b630-5\" pgmap=\"630(75) 631(49)\">A rule which pervades the whole law of principal and agent is, that the principal is bound to indemnify the agent against the consequences of all acts done by him in due execution of the authority conferred upon him. When in obeying the orders of, or performing duties for his principal, in good faith, the agent incurs expenses or liability, or is compelled to pay damages to third persons, the principal is bound to indemnify and reimburse him. When sued for an act done in pursuance of his employment, he is not obliged to let judgment go against him, but may defend, and recover the expenses of a defense bona fide made. First Nat. Bank v. Tenny, 43 Ill. App. 544.</p> <p id=\"b631-4\" pgmap=\"631\">Whether Wyman, Mullen &amp; Co. received, directly or indirectly, a portion of the proceeds of the attachment made by them, is immaterial. Their liability is predicated upon the orders given by them to the sheriff to attach and the undertaking by them to indemnify him; and for all things done by him in good faith and in the legitimate pursuance of such orders, they are responsible up to the time they gave notice that they desired that he take no further steps. Randolph v. Blodgett, 17 N. H. 298; Nelson et al. v. Cook, 17 Ill. 443-449; Gower v. Emery, 18 Me. 79; Nelson et al. v. Cook, 19 Ill. 440-453; Clark v. Randall, 9 Wis. 135.</p> <p id=\"b631-5\" pgmap=\"631\">Appellee Henry W. Price, in addition to what is urged by the other appellees, insists that he is not liable to contribute, because no part of the proceeds of the attachment actuaUy came to his hands. A portion of the proceeds was paid to his attorney, and the fact that his attorney proved false to the trust reposed in him and failed to pay over what he had received to Mr. Price can not affect his liability. Price has a claim against his attorney, the amount of which it is to be hoped, at no distant period, he will be able to realize.</p> <p id=\"b631-6\" pgmap=\"631\">Where attaching creditors, acting in concert, sue out attachments in good faith, exercising such prudence and caution as an ordinarily prudent person would exercise, with no intention of committing trespass or injuring any one, and with the honest belief that their attachments can he maintained, the concerted act is not such a tort as forbids one of the creditors who has paid a judgment against him, for the unsuccessful, and, as found, legally tortious act of all, to insist upon contribution from his co-tortfeasors. Farwell et al. v. Becker et al., 129 Ill. 261.</p> <p id=\"b631-7\" pgmap=\"631\">The decree of the Circuit Court is reversed, and the cause remanded, for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
