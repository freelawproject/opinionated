Same\u2014Not the Gravamen of a Civil Action\u2014Aggravation of Damages\u2014Joint Liability.\u2014In civil actions the conspiracy is not the gravamen of the charge, but may be pleaded and proved in aggravation of the wrong of which the plaintiff complains, and as enabling him to recover against all the conspirators as joint tort feasors.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-7\" pgmap=\"388\">4. Unlawful Combinations\u2014Distinguished from Honest Competition.\u2014Honest competition in business is always permissible,, and it is not easy to draw the line between acts which are but lawful competition and those which are unlawful, because designed to result and actually resulting in an injury to the person or property of a rival, but the line of demarkation is no more difficult of ascertainment than as to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of many other matters of which the law takes note.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-8\" pgmap=\"388\">5. Boycotting\u2014Action Lies for.\u2014An action may be maintained for the malicious interference with the business of another, his occupation, profession, or way of obtaining a livelihood. It is not necessary to the maintenance of such action that there should be any moral turpitude in the act complained of. It lies whenever a damage is occasioned by the wrong done.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-9\" pgmap=\"388\">6. Trespass on the Case\u2014Nature of the Action.\u2014The action of trespass on the case is founded upon the justice and conscience of the case, and is in the nature of a bill in equity.

Same\u2014 Where it Lies for a Conspiracy.\u2014Whenever, in pursuance of an unlawful combination to defame or injure another in his particular avocation or business, means are employed which tend to effectuate,' and to a greater or less extent accomplish, the object of the conspirators, an action of trespass on the case will lie.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b388-12\" pgmap=\"388\">9. Punitive Damages\u2014When to be Imposed.\u2014In actions where the gist of the case is the damage that has resulted from the malicious acts of the defendant, punitive damages may be imposed, and the amount of such damages is, within wide limits, a matter of discretion for the jury.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-13\" pgmap=\"388\">Trespass on the Case, for a conspiracy.

In an action on the case in the nature of a conspiracy, the gist of the action is not the conspiracy (as it is in an indictment, and was in the old writ of conspiracy), but the damage done to the plaintiff.

Small, 3 Cush. 145.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\" pgmap=\"389\">A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to do an unlawful act; if the act to be done is not unlawful, then the agreement or conspiracy is not a conspiracy in law.

Chambers et al. v. Baldwin, 91 Ky. 122.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-7\" pgmap=\"389\">Malicious motives make a bad act worse, but they can not make that wrong which in its own essence is lawful. Any transaction Avhich would be laAvful and proper if the parties are friends can not be made the foundation of an action merely because they happen to be enemies. As long as a man keeps himself within the Iuav, by doing no act Avhich violates it, we must leave his motives to Him Avho searches the heart. Jenkins v. Fowler, 24 Pa. St. 308; Stevenson v.

Lumley v. Gye, 2 El. &amp; Bl., 216; Bowen v. Hall, L. R., 6 (Q. B. D.) 333.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-7\" pgmap=\"390\">The leading case upon this proposition of law is Lumley v. Gye, 16 Victoria (1853), in the Queen\u2019s Bench, reported in Ellis &amp; Blackburn, Vol. 2, p. 216. The action was brought \u201c by the lessee of a theatre for maliciously procuring Miss Wagner, who had agreed with the plaintiff to perform and sing in his theatre and nowhere else, for a certain term, to break her contract and not to perform and sing at the plaintiff\u2019s theatre, and to continue away during the time for which she was engaged.\u201d Three of the judges held that the counts were good and that an action would lie, one judge dissenting.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-8\" pgmap=\"390(177) 391(117)\">The argument found in the report of this case seems to very fully cover the ground. Crompton, J., in his opinion, says among other things: \u201c It is clear, from Blake v. Lanyon, 6 T. R. 221, and other subsequent cases, Sykes v. Dixon, 9 A. &amp; E. 693, Pilkington v. Scott, 15 M. &amp; W. 657, and Hartley v. Cummings, 5 Con. B. 247, that the action for maliciously interfering with persons in the employment of another is not confined to menial service, as suggested in Taylor v. Heri, and I see no reason for quoting such a rule; but I should rather, if necessary, apply such a remedy to a case where the wrong and damage are strictly analogous to the wrong and damage in a well organized class of cases.\u201d Erie, J., in his opinion, says, among other things: \u201c If it is objected that this class of actions for procuring a breach of contract of hiring rests upon no principle and ought not to be extended beyond the cases heretofore decided, the answer appears to me to be that the class of cases referred to rest upon the principle that the violation of the right is a cause of action, and that when the principle is applied to the violation of a right arising upon a contract of hiring, the nature of the services contracted for is immaterial. He who maliciously procures a damage to another, by violation of his right, ought to be made to indemnify; and that, whether he procures an actionable wrong or a breach of contract.\u201d The following cases are stated as authority: Winsmore v. Greenbank, Willes 577; Green v. Buttom, 2 C. M. &amp; R.,707; Shepherd v.

Bennett, 140 Ill. 69.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-7\" pgmap=\"391(75) 392(77)\">Freedom is the policy of this country. But freedom does not imply a right in one person, either alone or in combination with others, to disturb or annoy another, either directly or indirectly, in his lawful business or occupation, or to threaten him with annoyance or injury, for the sake of compelling him to buy his peace; or, in the language of the statute cited above, \u201c with intent to extort money or any pecuniary advantage whatever, or to compel him to do any act against his will.\u201d The acts alleged and proved in this case are peculiarly offensive to the free principles which prevail in this country; and if such practices could enjoy immunity, they would tend to establish a tyranny of irresponsible persons over labor and mechanical business which would be extremely injurious to both. Carew v. Rutherford, 106 Mass. 1; Walker v. Cronin, 107 Mass. 555.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-5\" pgmap=\"392\">Every one has the right to enjoy the fruits and advantages of his own enterprise, industry, skill and credit. He has no right to be protected against competition, but he has a right to be free from malicious and wanton interference, disturbance or annoyance. If disturbance or loss come as a result of competition or the exercise of like rights by others, it is damnum, absque injuria, unless some superior right by contract or otherwise is interfered with. But if it comes from merely wanton or malicious acts of others without the justification of competition or the service of any lawful purpose, it then stands upon a different footing, and falls within the principle of the authorities first referred to. Walker v. Cronin, 107 Mass. 555; Gunter v. Astor, 4 J. D. Moore 12; Hart v. Aldrich, Cowper 54; Shepherd v. Wakeman, Sid. 79; Winsmore v. Greenbank, Willes 577; Burnley v.

Rep. 934, which was decided in 1887.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-6\" pgmap=\"392\">An action lies, in behalf of an employe, against a person who has maliciously procured the employer to discharge such emplojm from employment in which he is engaged under a legal contract for a certain period, provided damage result to the employe from such discharge. Chipley v. Atkinson, 1 So. Rep. 934.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-7\" pgmap=\"392\">No action for conspiracy will lie by a butcher against several dealers in beef cattle because they have combined to refuse to sell him beeves; but where the petition further alleges that defendants also induced a certain dealer in slaughtered meat to likewise refuse to sell him, such interference with his business is a cause of action, and it is error to sustain a demurrer to the petition. Delz v. Winfree et al., 16 S. W. 111.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-3\" pgmap=\"393\">In the case of Walker v. Cronin, 107 Mass. 562, it was recognized to be a general principle that \u201c in all cases where a man has a temporal loss or damage by the wrong of another, he may have an action upon the case to be repaired in damages. The intentional causing of such loss to another, without justifiable cause, and with malicious purpose to inflict it, is of itself a wrong.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-4\" pgmap=\"393\">On the ground of common rights, where every one is lawfully struggling for the mastery, and where losses suffered must be borne, there are losses which every one is protected against. Those are losses willfully caused to one by another, in the exercise of what otherwise would be a lawful right, from simple motives of malice. Moores &amp; Company v. Bricklayers Union No. 1 et al., 7 R. &amp; C. L. J. 108 (Ohio, 1889).</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-5\" pgmap=\"393\">\u201c The law appears to me to be, that a combination by two or more persons to induce others not to deal with a particular individual, or enter into contracts with him, if it is done with an intent to injure that individual, and if he is therefore injured, is an actionable wrong.\u201d Tamperton v. Russell, Vol. 4 of The Reports (Queen\u2019s Bench Appeals), 376; Olive et al. v. Van Patten et al., 25 S. W. Rep. 428.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-6\" pgmap=\"393(154) 394(15)\">A petition all\u00e9ging that defendants (wholesale' lumber dealers) formed an association agreeing not to sell to others than dealers, that because of- refusal by plaintiff (another dealer) to join said association, they had maliciously distributed circulars asking that patronage be withdrawn from plaintiff till he agreed not to sell to others than dealers, thereby influencing others not to deal with plaintiff, to his injury, states a good cause of action. It could not be held that defendants had the right to prevent plaintiff from selling to customers, or that such interference by them (defendants) was serving a legitimate purpose connected with their own business. To break plaintiff down as a competitor for the customers\u2019 trade might, if it is true, result in benefit to defendants, but such a benefit, obtained in such a manner, could not be deemed a legitimate purpose within the meaning of the opinion quoted.

People v. Petheran, 31 N. W. Rep., 188 Mich.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-7\" pgmap=\"394\">A combination or conspiracy among a number of persons engaged in a particular business to stifle or prevent competition, and thereby to enhance or diminish prices to a point above or below what they would be if left to the influence of unrestrained competition, is contrary to public policy, and all courts will refuse their aid to the enforcement of contracts by which such combinations are sought to be effected. Moore v. Bennett, 140 Ill. 69.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-8\" pgmap=\"394\">In order to render the defendants liable for willfully inducing parties to break their contract or contracts with the plaintiff, done by the defendants with the intention of causing injury to the plaintiff, without right or justifiable cause, and from which acts damage results to the plaintiff, it is not necessary that such inducements should be with either force, fraud, threats or intimidations.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-9\" pgmap=\"394\">Such inducement on the part of the defendants will give a cause of action if consisting merely of advising, or arguing that it would be to the business interest of the one breaking the contract, if such acts were done by the defendants maliciously, without right or justifiable cause, and with the intention of injuring the plaintiff, if damages actually result therefrom.

It is the damage done in pursuance of the conspiracy which gives the right of action.</p> <p id=\"b398-7\" pgmap=\"398\">It is now well established that, in civil actions, the conspiracy is not the gravamen of the charge, but may be pleaded and proved in aggravation of the wrong of which the plaintiff complains, and as enabling him to recover against all the conspirators, as joint tort feasors. If a plaintiff fail in the proof of a conspiracy, or concerted design, he may yet recover damages against such of the defendants as are shown to be guilty of a tort, directly resulting in damages to the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b398-8\" pgmap=\"398\">It has sometimes been said that an act which is not unlawful if done by one person, can not be unlawful because done by a multitude. This may be true. It must, however, be borne in mind, that the united act of many'persons is very different from the isolated act of one, as it is very seldom that each of many persons do, at one time, as individuals, the same act, without there having been before, an agreed concert of action. The united call or cry of a thousand persons is a very different thing from the call or cry of one; and if the united calling of a thousand was by previous concert, then the loud acclaim or disturbance, which the union of so many voices make, is the act of each participating therein.</p> <p id=\"b399-3\" pgmap=\"399\">Honest competition in business is always permissible, and it is not easy to draw the line between acts which are but lawful competition and those which are unlawful, because designed to, and actually resulting in an injury to the person or property of a rival. The line of demarkation is, in this matter, no more difficult of ascertainment than as to the lawfulness or unlawfulness of many other things of which the law takes note.</p> <p id=\"b399-4\" pgmap=\"399\">In Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor, Gow &amp; Co., L. R. 15 Q. B., Div. 476, Lord Coleridge, C. J., said: \"It seems that a large number of important and rich ship owners joined together, and they issued two circulars or documents to the different traders and their agents, with whom they had been in the habit of dealing in the tea, and other trades in China, to the effect that if the persons whom that circular reached and 'was meant to affect, should deal with the plaintiff or plaintiff\u2019s ships, they, the defendants, would deny them all the benefits, or at least a very large and substantial benefit which had accrued to them in their dealings Avith the defendants; and that if the persons to AAThom they addressed the circular ayouM deal exclusively Avith them, they should have certain advantages at their hands. \"x\" * It is conceivable that if such a conspiracy, because conspiracy undoubtedly it is, being proved in point of fact, were made out to be, not the mere honest support and maintenance of a defendant\u2019s trade, but the destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s trade, and their consequent wrong as merchants, it would be an offense for which an indictment for conspiracy, and if an indictment, then an action for conspiracy Avould lie; * * \"x\" that the conspiracy to do the thing Avhich has been called by the name of 6 boycotting \u2019 is unlaAvful and an indictable offense, and if so, then a thing for Avhich an action will lie. An action may Avell lie for that Avhich is complained of here.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b399-5\" pgmap=\"399(49) 400(109)\">The case of James Van Horn et al. v. Amos Van Horn et al., 52 N. J. Law, 284, is quite like the present. That Avas an action in tort for acts done in pursuance of a conspiracy to break up the separate business of Emma D. Van Horn. Among other things it wa.s charged that with the purpose and intent of breaking up and ruining her business, the defendants persuaded a certain firm in New York to decline to complete their contract with the said Emma Van Horn, and did prevail upon said firm, by means of fraudulent and corrupt representations as to the personal and business character and standing of the plaintiff, to remove the stock already supplied to her, and to refuse to deliver other goods as agreed for, leaving her entirely without any stock to sell, or customers to purchase from her. As to a demurrer to the declaration, this court said:</p> <p id=\"b400-5\" pgmap=\"400\">\u201c The declaration begins in this form, and is no exception in this particular. It is an action on the case, setting forth a malicious conspiracy, with the concurrent confederation, with the means employed to perfect its purpose, and the resulting damage to the plaintiff. No further certification is required, than the general terms in which it is pleaded in the declaration. The whole pleading is based upon the malicious conduct of the defendants in destroying the plaintiff\u2019s credit and patronage and breaking up her business, and means of livelihood.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b400-6\" pgmap=\"400\">It is- urged that appellants had a right to offer to the parties who were doing work for appellee, a greater price for doing similar work for them, appellants, than appellee was paying, and a right to ask such persons to give up appellee\u2019s work, and that to do that of appellants, would be found more profitable; that this was but the carrying on, by the appellants, of their own business, and in the line of legitimate competition with appellee, who was engaged in the same business.</p> <p id=\"b400-7\" pgmap=\"400(84) 401(123)\">It is not for the doing of this, merely, that the present action was brought. As has been already stated, the declaration charges and the jury have found that the defendants conspired together, and induced parties to break their conItraots with appellee, and to refuse to do business with her, for the purpose of breaking up and destroying the business of appellee; that the action of appellants in this regard was malicious, and was an attempt to obtain for themselves the business which appellee was doing, not by legitimate competition, but for the purpose only, of destroying the business of appellee. That an action may be maintained for the malicious interference with the business of another, his occupation, profession, or way of obtaining a livelihood, has for many years been \u00bfrecognized by the law; as where the plaintiff is the owner of a decoy for catching wild fowl, and the defendant, without entering upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, fires off guns near to the decoy, and frightens wild fowl away from it; where, also, if a man menaces the tenants at will of another, of life or member, so that they depart from their tenures, an action on the case lies against him.</p> <p id=\"b401-4\" pgmap=\"401\">There is a very old case of an action brought against one for firing guns at the natives of a semi-civilized country, Avhereby they were frightened, and the plaintiff lost his trade with them Avhich he otherwise Avould have had.</p> <p id=\"b401-5\" pgmap=\"401\">So the discharge of a gun by an individual by which a horse is frightened and the owner thereof is injured will subject the person firing to an action on the case, although he had no intention or reasonable ground for apprehending the frightening of the horse. Bacon\u2019s Abridgment, Actions on the Case, 119; Webb\u2019s Pollock on Torts, 406-408.</p> <p id=\"b401-6\" pgmap=\"401\">It has sometimes been said that the laAv does not take notice of the motives Avith which actions are done. This is not altogether true. The action on the case for malicious prosecution is founded upon the malicious intent with which the prosecution was instituted.</p> <p id=\"b401-7\" pgmap=\"401\">In the case of Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor, Gow &amp; Co., L. R., 21 Q. B. 544-553, Chief Justice Coleridge said : \u201c But it is said that the motives of these acts was to ruin the plaintiff\u2019s trade, and that such a motive, it has been held, Avill render the combination itself wrongful and malicious, and that if damage has resulted to the plaintiffs an action will lie. I concede that if the premises are established the conclusion folloAvs. It is too late to dispute if I desired it. as I do not, that a wrongful and malicious combination to ruin a man in his trade may be ground for such an action as this.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b402-4\" pgmap=\"402\">In the same case, upon appeal, L. R., 23 Q. B. 598, all of the judges were of the opinion that if the acts done in pursuance thereof were shown to have been for the purpose of ruining and destroying the plaintiff\u2019s trade, then- an action for the damage occasioned could be maintained. Bowen, J., page 614, says: \u201cHo man, whether trader or not, can, however, justify damaging another in his commercial business by fraud or misrepresentation. Intimidation, obstruction and molestation are forbidden; so is the intentional procurement of a violation of individual rights, contractual or other, assuming always that there is no just cause for it. The intentional driving away of customers by show of violence (Tarleton v. McGawley, Peak M. P. C. 270), the obstruction of the actors on the stage by a preconcerted hissing (Clifford v. Brandon, 8 Camp. 358, and Gregory v. Brunswick, 6 Man. &amp; G. 205), the disturbance of wild fowls in decoys by firing of guns (Carringten v. Taylor, 11 East, 571, and Keeble v. Hickeringill, 11 East, 574 n.), the impeding or threatening servants or workmen (Garrett v. Taylor, Cra. Jac. 567), the inducing persons under personal contract to break contracts (Bowen v. Hall, 6 Q. B. D. 333, and Lumley v. Gye, 2 E. &amp; B. 216), all are instances of such forbidden acts.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b402-5\" pgmap=\"402\">It is not necessary to the maintenance of an action on the case that there should be any moral turpitude in the act complained of. It lies whenever a damage is occasioned by the wrong done. The action of trespass on the case is founded upon the mere justice and conscience of the case, and is in the nature of a bill in equity.</p> <p id=\"b402-6\" pgmap=\"402\">It is a universal remedy given for all personal wrongs and injuries, without force, so-called, because the plaintiff\u2019s whole case or cause of complaint was formerly set out in the original writ.</p> <p id=\"b402-7\" pgmap=\"402(59) 403(53)\">When any special consequential damage arises, which could not be foreseen and provided for in the ordinary course of justice, the party injured is allowed to bring a spe-. cial action on his own case, upon a declaration framed according to the peculiar circumstances of his own particular grievance, for, whenever the common law gives a right or prohibits an injury, it. also gives a remedy by action, and therefore whenever a new injury is done, a new method of remedy may be pursued. 3 Blackstone\u2019s Com. 122; Bird v. Randall, 3 Burr, 1353; Millar v. Taylor, 4 Burr 2345; Webb case, 8 Coke 96; Adams v. Page, 7 Pickering 541.</p> <p id=\"b403-4\" pgmap=\"403\">To conspire, comprehends any confederacy to prejudice a third person, as where divers confederate to impoverish another. Mott v. Danforth, 6 Watts 304.</p> <p id=\"b403-5\" pgmap=\"403\">While no civil action lies for the mere conspiracy, whenever, in pursuance of an unlawful combination to defame or injure another in his' particular avocation or business, means have been employed which tended to effectuate, and to a greater or less extent did accomplish, the object of the conspirators, an action on the case will lie. Wilder v. McKee, 111 Penn. St. 335; Place v. Minster et al., 65 N. Y. 89-95; Cooley on Torts, Second Ed., 142; Webb\u2019s Pollock on Torts, pp. 401, 671-672; Walker v. Cronin, 117 Mass.; Bacon\u2019s Ab., Actions on the Case, f.</p> <p id=\"b403-6\" pgmap=\"403\">Appellee\u2019s action is not a mere proceeding to recover damages of appellants, because they induced certain persons to break their contracts with her; her action is for damages by her sustained in consequence of .the malicious destruction and ruin of her business by appellants, in pursuance of their conspiracy so to do.</p> <p id=\"b403-7\" pgmap=\"403\">In proof of such charges, she shows that for the purpose of breaking up and ruining her business, they did, in pursuance of a preconcerted plan, induce various persons to break their contracts with her, and did persuade many persons to refuse to do work for her, as a consequence of which her customers were lost and her business destroyed. The conspiracy charged and proven is only a matter of inducement, or evidence; it is the acts thereunder actually done by appellants, and the damage suffered in consequence thereof by appellee, that is the gist of this action.</p> <p id=\"b403-8\" pgmap=\"403\">Taking the instructions given by the court below as a whole, we think appellants have no just cause for complaint thereon.</p> <p id=\"b403-9\" pgmap=\"403(12) 404(38)\">In such an action as this, where the gist of the plaintiff\u2019s suit is the damage that has resulted from the malicious acts of the defendants, punitive damages may be imposed by the jury. The amount of such damage is, within wide limits, a matter of discretion for the jury.</p> <p id=\"b404-5\" pgmap=\"404\">For these and other considerations already mentioned, we see no sufficient reason for interfering with the verdict of the jury, sanctioned as it has been by the judge before whom the case was tried.</p> <p id=\"b404-6\" pgmap=\"404\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
