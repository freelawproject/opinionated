Barber. The suit was in assumpsit, upon the common counts, for a balance alleged to be due the plaintiff for the laying of an asphalt sidewalk, under a written contract with the park board. The defense interposed set up that the work, in fact, had not been finished by the plaintiff, but that he had quit the same before its completion; and, further, that the defendant had, thereupon, under the terms of the agreement, contracted with other parties to complete it, and had paid them therefor.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-7\" pgmap=\"105\">The cause being called for trial, the defendant moved for a continuance, on the ground of the absence of a material witness, which motion the court overruled and the defendant was forced to trial. The principal points relied upon for a reversal by the appellant, are, that the court erred in denying the motion for a continuance, and, further, that during the trial of the case the evidence proffered by the defendant, in the line of the above defense, was improperly excluded.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-8\" pgmap=\"105\">Edward T. Noonan, attorney for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-10\" pgmap=\"105\">David S. Geer, attorney for appellee,</attorneys><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4G\" pgmap=\"105\">contended that the affidavit should show to the satisfaction of the court, that the presence of the absent witness is necessary for a full and fair defense to the suit. Duncan v. Niles, 32 Ill. 541, 542.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-4\" pgmap=\"106\">The affidavit is defective because it appears that the facts sought to be proved by the absent witness can be established by the officers of the company, but no effort is made to get them into court. Eames v. Hennessy, 22 Ill. 628.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-5\" pgmap=\"106\">It does not disclose a meritorious defense, and in this respect is insufficient. Ballston Bank v. Marine Bank, 16 Wis. 125.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-6\" pgmap=\"106\">It is insufficient in not affirmatively disclosing the materiality and admissibility of the evidence, and due diligence, and a positive showing that the absent witness would be produced at a future term. The discretion of the trial judge in refusing a continuance on such an affidavit will not be disturbed. Shirwin v. People, 69 Ill. 55.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\" pgmap=\"106\">It should affirmatively appear that due diligence has been used to obtain the testimony of the witness. Dunlap v. Davis, 5 Gilm. 84.</p> <opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b106-8\" pgmap=\"106\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"AqK\" pgmap=\"106\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b106-9\" pgmap=\"106\">The affidavit for a continuance fails to set up any matter which could not be proved by other witnesses, save the giving by the plaintiff of certain orders upon the defendant; there was no pretense that these had been accepted by or presented to appellant; the testimony would therefore have be\u00e9n immaterial.</p> <p id=\"b106-10\" pgmap=\"106\">The rules and regulations of appellant did not enter into the contract, and, so far as appears, had nothing to do with this case; the court, therefore, properly refused to admit them in evidence. The certificate of the engineer of the park commissioners was admissible, because by the terms of the contract the work was to be done subject to his inspection, approval or rejection; and it was further provided that if the rate of progress was satisfactory to him, estimates in the usual form would be issued to the contractor for eighty-five per cent of the value of the- work done; the remaining fifteen per cent being reserved until the final completion and acceptance of the work.</p> <p id=\"b106-11\" pgmap=\"106(9) 107(13)\">Appellee testified that after he completed the work he received from said engineer the final certificate upon which the action was brought.</p> <p id=\"b107-4\" pgmap=\"107\">So, also, the court properly refused to allow appellant to put in evidence the record of the proceedings of the commissioners. The question before the court was not what record the board had made, but whether appellee was entitled to be paid the amount for which a certificate was given him. Whether appellee had completed his contract, was a matter concerning which appellant did introduce evidence; as to this, the finding was against the appellant. The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
