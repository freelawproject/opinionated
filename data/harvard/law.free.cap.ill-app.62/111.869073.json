Each party acquired definite rights under the contract; it was therefore mutual.</p> <p id=\"b109-8\" pgmap=\"109\">Appellees have not exercised their option to take back the box, and the $250, by reason of the failure of appellant to pay the two dollars per week, has become due.</p> <p id=\"b110-4\" pgmap=\"110\">The box has been sold to appellant for $250, and the price is due; the box belongs to the vendee.

Upon the trial appellant tendered to them the receipts of the box, and they were by appellees accepted. Appellant also on the trial tendered to appellees the box. After such recognition of appellees as the parties with whom the contract was made by him, we think it is now too late for him to object that they are not the parties who made the contract sued on, no such objection having been made in the court below. Richelieu Hotel Co. v. Military Encampment Co., 140 Ill. 248-259.</p> <p id=\"b110-7\" pgmap=\"110\">The verdict as recorded is as follows: \u201cWe, the jury, find the issue for the plaintiff and assess its damages at the sum of two hundred and thirty-five dollars and thirty-five cents.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b110-8\" pgmap=\"110\">In the bill of exceptions the verdict appears as follows : \u201cWe, the jury, find the issue for plaintiff and assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages in. the sum of two hundred and thirty-five and 35-100 dollars ($235.35).\u201d</p> <p id=\"b110-9\" pgmap=\"110\">When the recitals of the record made up by the clerk of the court, and the bill of exceptions disagree, the latter will prevail.
