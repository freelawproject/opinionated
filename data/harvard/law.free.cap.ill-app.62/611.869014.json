The old rule of chancery that when an annuity was payable out of the rents and profits, the corpus of the estate was also liable, has been modified. The intention of the testator governs in all cases, so that a direction to pay an annuity out of the rents and profits, charges only the rents and profits, and not the corpus of the estate, unless a contrary intention appears. 1 Am. &amp; Eng.

Shephard, 32 Beav. 194.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-9\" pgmap=\"610\">Theobald on Wills (2d Ed.), 637, makes the following distinctions:</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-10\" pgmap=\"610\">If there is a direction to set apart a sum of money in order to pay an annuity out of the dividend, with a gift over, the annuitant is not entitled to come upon the corpus, and it is a simple case of tenant for life and remainder-man.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-3\" pgmap=\"611\">When the annuity is charged upon the income of the whole estate, if the capital is given over subject to or after payment of the annuities, the corpus is liable.</p><attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-4\" pgmap=\"611\">Richard Prendergast and J. E. Deakin, attorneys for appellee,</attorneys><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXn\" pgmap=\"611\">contended that where a sum of money is by will directed to be paid periodically to a person out of a residuary estate, and not specifically and unambiguously out of the income resulting from some specific fund or estate, the gift is an annuity and not a rent charge. It is, in fact, nothing more nor less than a gift in the nature of a legacy, payable by installments, and, as such, payable out of any residuary estate, for the time being in the hands of the trustees, and not more so out of income than out of the corpus.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-5\" pgmap=\"611\">A direction to invest a sufficient sum of money out of a residuary estate to produce periodical payments directed to.be made, is only a means of insuring their prompt payment, and does not limit the legatee or donee to the income of the' invested fund, if that should at any time prove insufficient.

Pickering, 9 Sim. 176.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-7\" pgmap=\"611\">Section 10 of the Dower Act has an important bearing on the question before the court, for it in effect places the provision given by the will on the same footing as an annuity in lieu of dower at common law. That is, the widow is entitled to have it wholly or in part paid out of corpus. Stamper v. Pickering, 9 Sim. Ch. 176, and note at foot of page 177.</p> <opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b611-8\" pgmap=\"611\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"AOM\" pgmap=\"611\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p> <p id=\"b611-9\" pgmap=\"611\">It is clear that the intention of the testator was to provide for his widow an income of \u00a7125 per month, so long as his daughter Cecelia remained with her mother.</p> <p id=\"b612-4\" pgmap=\"612\">It is also apparent that the testator did not intend to limit' the source of such income to his personal estate. The trustees are given power to sell and convey all of the real estate, and full power to collect, manage, invest and re-invest all moneys coming to their hands as trustees; this includes moneys derived from sale, as well as from' income. The object of the conveyance to the trustees and the powers intrusted to them, is to pay the income provided for the widow of the testator, and to have the estate properly managed until the periods of distribution arrive.</p> <p id=\"b612-5\" pgmap=\"612\">When a distribution is made, upon the coming of age of the youngest child, the trustees are to retain sufficient capital, consisting of either real estate or securities, to insure from the income arising therefrom the prompt payment of the monthly allowance to the widow.</p> <p id=\"b612-6\" pgmap=\"612\">The annuity should have been paid each month. Houghton v. Franklin, 1 Sim. &amp; Stu. 390.</p> <p id=\"b612-7\" pgmap=\"612\">The annuity became, by the acceptance by the widow of the provisions of the will, in effect, a purchase of her dower right.

Jenks, 140 Mass. 562.</p> <p id=\"b612-8\" pgmap=\"612\">The intent of the testator is to be determined in view of his presumed knowledge of what the effect of her acceptance would be.</p> <p id=\"b612-9\" pgmap=\"612\">If the income from the estate is insufficient to pay the annuity, the annuitant is entitled to resort to the corpus of the property in the hands of the trustees.
