After review, we affirm Joseph\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cPursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(e), upon finding that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a district court may revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering the specific factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">A review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (2008). The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">If a district court decides the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) warrant a sentence outside the Guideline range, it \u201cmust consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cAlthough there is no proportionality principle in sentencing, a major variance does require a more significant justification than a minor one.... \u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1196 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc). </em>We have previously stated that a variance of 12\u00a14 years and 42 percent \u201cis a \u2018major\u2019 variance in the legal parlance of sentencing law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cquantifying [a] variance as a certain percentage of the maximum, minimum, or median prison sentence recommenced by the Guidelines\u201d is unhelpful because \u201cdeviations from the Guidelines range will always appear more extreme ... when the range itself is low.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 48, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it deviated from the Guideline range pursuant to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The record shows the court considered Joseph\u2019s arguments, weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and ultimately found an above-Guidelines sentence was appropriate based on the past nature of his conduct. The district court offered several reasons for its deviation, including Joseph\u2019s repeated illegal reentry into the United States and his failure to acknowledge his wrongdoing. Further, Joseph\u2019s claim that his sentence is unreasonably disproportionate based on the Guidelines range is without merit. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 48, 128 S.Ct. 586. Accordingly, we affirm Joseph\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-16\">. Joseph previously pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana while on board a motor vessel, in violation of 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1903(j). The district court sentenced him to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 36-months' supervised release for that offense. Thereafter, Joseph was convicted of illegal reentry after removal, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). The district court found that the subsequent conviction constituted a violation of Joseph\u2019s supervised release and imposed a revocation sentence of 36 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-25\">.
