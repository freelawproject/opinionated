We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">I.Background</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Mr. Foster fell approximately 30 feet while working at his job on March 31, 2005. He attempted two weeks of rehabilitation but could not return to his position due to pain. He received Worker\u2019s Compensation until at least November 8, 2007. In addition to the back injury, Mr. Foster reported psychological ailments dating from his time as a military policeman. These included post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder. Both his physical and psychological conditions formed the basis of Mr. Foster\u2019s claim for benefits under the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Between the time of his injury and the administrative denial of his claims on December 15, 2007, Mr. Foster sought treatment from a host of physicians and other care providers. One of these clinicians is especially relevant to the current litigation. Dr. Huntly Chapman treated Mr. Foster\u2019s back injury between June 21, 2006, and April 17, 2007. He submitted a document entitled \u201cCervical Spine Residual Functional Capacity Questionnaire\u201d on October 31, 2007. The administrative hearing had already occurred three weeks prior, on October 10, 2007. Following that hearing, the ALJ issued a finding that Mr. Foster was not disabled and could work in at least two of his former occupations as a telemarketer and customer service supervisor. Foster appealed first to the Appeals Council and then to the district court. Each of these reviews affirmed the ALJ\u2019s original conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">II.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">This court reviews whether the ALJ and Appeals Council (\u201cthe Agency\u201d) applied the correct law and had \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support its conclusion. <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994). The statutory requirement of \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), means \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-14\">III.Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">On appeal, Foster challenges the Agency\u2019s finding of residual functional capacity (RFC), alleging that the finding was contrary to the opinion of a treating physician and therefore against the weight of substantial evidence. Foster also argues that the ALJ erred in finding that Mr. Foster did not suffer from a debilitating mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">The opinion of a treating physician generally deserves \u201cconsiderable weight in determining disability.\u201d <em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 465-66 (5th Cir.2005). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>general rule ceases to apply, however, when a treating physician\u2019s testimony is \u201cbrief or conclusory, not supported by medically acceptable clinical laboratory diagnostic techniques, or otherwise unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466 (emphasis and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">In the present case, Dr. Chapman\u2019s opinion was not entitled to considerable weight. First, the \u201cquestionnaire\u201d format typifies \u201cbrief or conclusory\u201d testimony. Second, Dr. Chapman\u2019s questionnaire was unique among the many medical opinions in focusing on Mr. Foster\u2019s cervical rather than lumbar spine. All of the other doctors to evaluate Mr. Foster since his accident in 2005 discussed harm to his lumbar spine, and the L4 and L5 vertebrae in particular. Even Dr. Chapman\u2019s own treatments concentrated on the lumbar spine. A third reason to question Dr. Chapman\u2019s report is his reliance on old data. Despite submitting the questionnaire on October 31, 2007, he last treated Mr. Foster on April 17, 2007. Finally, the Agency relied on other physicians \u2014 both examining and other treating physicians\u2014 to draw conclusions about Mr. Foster\u2019s residual functional capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">On balance, we agree with the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cdue to its brevity and conclusory nature, lack of explanatory notes, or supporting objective tests and examinations, Dr. Chapman\u2019s opinion is given little weight....\u201d We find no error in the Agency\u2019s treatment of this evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Likewise, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Mr. Foster was not disabled by virtue of a mental impairment. At least four experts evaluated Mr. Foster\u2019s mental condition: Drs. Cox, Ludden, Lankford, and Craig Moore. Dr. Ludden examined Mr. Foster on February 15, 2007. She concluded that, although he suffered from several psychological conditions, his judgment and demeanor were normal. Dr. Craig Moore, the psychological expert who testified at Mr. Foster\u2019s hearing before the ALJ, summed up that Mr. Foster did not display a mental impairment under the Social Security Regulations. Moreover, he told the ALJ that Mr. Foster displayed \u201cvery few workplace limitations psychologically.\u201d Based on this testimony, more thoroughly recounted in the magistrate judge\u2019s decision, and on Foster\u2019s concession that his mental problems had subsided with proper medication, we conclude that the Agency had substantial evidence \u2014 on both physical and psychological grounds \u2014 to conclude that Mr. Foster was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b856-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b856-17\">. Mr. Foster died on April 10, 2009. The district court allowed his wife to pursue this lawsuit as a substitute plaintiff. Where appropriate we will follow the district court\u2019s convention of referring to both Mr. and Mrs. Foster by their last name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\">. The Appeals Council was entitled to and did properly consider Dr. Chapman\u2019s late-filed questionnaire. <em>Higginbotham v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 332, 337-38 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
