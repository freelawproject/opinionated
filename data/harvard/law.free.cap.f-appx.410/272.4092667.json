Williams raises several issues on appeal, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">Williams first asserts evidence of (1) phone calls placed by him from prison; and (2) a cutting agent (cut)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found in his car after his arrest were improperly ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>mitted into evidence at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We normally review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2005). When a party challenges an evi-dentiary ruling for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error only. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">We employ a three-part test to determine whether the admission of evidence of other criminal activities was proper: \u201c[f]irst, the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; [s]econd, the act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; [t]hird, the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and the evidence must meet the other requirements of Rule 403.\u201d <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>431 F.3d 1296, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2005). Evidence is not extrinsic if it is: (1) an uncharged offense arising out of the \u201csame transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense, (2) necessary to complete the story of the crime, or (3) inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramsdale, </em>61 F.3d 825, 829 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The evidence of the cut was not extrinsic to the crime charged, as it was necessary to complete the story of the crime. <em>See Ramsdale, </em>61 F.3d at 829. The cut was also probative to the charges Williams faced, as evidence of a cutting agent is probative as to whether a defendant dealt drugs. <em>See United States v. Faust, </em>456 F.3d 1342, 1346 (11th Cir.2006) (providing that the presence of a cutting agent at a house where a defendant was arrested supported an inference that the defendant was dealing drugs). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing this evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Further, Williams cites to no binding law from the Supreme Court or this Court indicating the admission of the phone calls for impeachment purposes was in error under this Court\u2019s three-part test regarding admission of other wrongdoing. As no controlling precedent supports Williams\u2019 alleged error, there is no plain error. <em>See United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 948 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cAn error is plain if it is obvious and clear under current law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Williams next contends the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conspiracy conviction. We review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in the government\u2019s favor. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>473 F.3d 1115, 1118 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">To support a conspiracy conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, the Government must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) a conspiracy existed, (2) the defendant had knowledge of it, and (3) he voluntarily joined it. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1290 (11th Cir.2005). A conspiracy to distribute drugs \u201cmay be inferred when the evidence shows a continuing relationship that results in the repeated transfer of illegal drugs to [a] purchaser.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">There is sufficient evidence to supports Williams\u2019s conspiracy conviction. The Government established at trial the exis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>tence of a continuing relationship between Williams and Cox, amongst others, in which Williams would supply Cox with MDMA. <em>Thompson, </em>422 F.3d at 1292 (11th Cir.2005). The jury was entitled to believe the phone calls between the Cl and Cox, Cox and Williams, and Williams and Henderson were the calls between a drug buyer, a drug seller, the seller\u2019s supplier, and the ultimate source of the drugs. <em>See United States v. Lyons, </em>53 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.1995) (providing that a jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence in a case).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Further, evidence of Williams\u2019s prior conviction for cocaine trafficking was also presented and undermines his contention that he was merely present at the drug transactions. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Lizaraza, </em>981 F.2d 1216, 1224 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that \u201cevidence of prior drug dealings is highly probative of intent in later charges of conspiracy and distribution of a controlled substance.\u201d) The jury was also entitled to find that Williams\u2019s presence at two consecutive drug transactions contradicted his \u201cmere presence\u201d defense, and indicated he was a willing participant in the conspiracy. <em>See United States.v. Adams, </em>799 F.2d 665, 672 (11th Cir.1986) (providing that participation was a logical inference to be drawn from a defendant accompanying others to two drug transactions). Thus, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to support Williams\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Williams next alleges the Government committed prosecutorial misconduct by improperly vouching for a witness, Donovan Jonas. When a party raises a prosecutorial misconduct claim for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Newton, </em>44 F.3d 913, 920 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">To establish prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, (1) the remarks must be improper, and (2) the remarks must prejudicially affect the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>United States v. Iglesias, </em>915 F.2d 1524, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). Improper vouching may occur in two ways: \u201c[fjirst, the prosecution may place the prestige of the government behind the witness, by making explicit personal assurances of the witness\u2019 veracity .... [sjecondly, a prosecutor may implicitly vouch for the witness\u2019 veracity by indicating that information not presented to the jury supports the testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Sims, </em>719 F.2d 375, 377 (11th Cir.1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">In this case, while the Government argued that Jonas\u2019s testimony was credible, it did not do so on the basis of the reputation of the Government. The Government also did not improperly vouch for Jonas\u2019s credibility by relying on evidence not before the jury. The Government\u2019s mention to the \u201cpublic record\u201d during closing argument was not improper, as the Government provided testimony as to what was included in the public record. Furthermore, the record indicates other evidence referred to by the Government was also before the jury. As such, the Government did not improperly vouch for Jonas\u2019s credibility by referring to these items. <em>See Sims, </em>719 F.2d at 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Williams\u2019s argument that the Government may have improperly denied not promising to help Jonas with his deportation also is without merit. Other than the fact that Jonas remains in jail, nothing in the record indicates a deal existed between Jonas and the Government. Regardless, the Government presented ample evidence of Williams\u2019s guilt besides Jonas\u2019s testimony. As such, Williams cannot meet his burden under the plain error standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Lastly, Williams argues the court abused its discretion by dismissing his pro se motion for a new trial without holding an evidentiary hearing. We review the denial of a motion for a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Puentes, </em>50 F.3d 1567, 1578 (11th Cir.1995). Likewise, we review a district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Massey, </em>89 F.3d 1438, 1443 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The movant of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(b) motion based on newly discovered evidence must establish that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATe\">(1) the evidence was discovered after trial, (2) the failure of the defendant to discover the evidence was not due to a lack of due diligence, (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, (4) the evidence is material to issues before the court, and (5) the evidence is such that a new trial would probably produce a different result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-8\"><em>Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d at 1287 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Williams\u2019s motion for a new trial on its merits, without holding an evidentiary hearing. The court correctly concluded the evidence in Williams\u2019s motion was merely impeaching and did not warrant a new trial. <em>See id. </em>(requiring a movant to establish newly discovered evidence is not merely impeaching). Moreover, Williams failed to meet the fifth <em>Jemigan </em>prong that a new trial would probably have produced a different result. Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-13\">. \"Cut\u201d is a substance commonly used by drug dealers to dilute pure cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\">. Williams also challenges the admission of a firearm. When the district court admitted the handgun into evidence, it expressly asked Williams if he wished to object, and Williams expressly declined. Thus, we will not review admission of the firearm, even for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1290 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that under the invited-error doctrine, where a party stipulates to the admission of evidence, he is precluded from objecting to the same evidence on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
