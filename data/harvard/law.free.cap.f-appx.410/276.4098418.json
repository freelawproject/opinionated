Calderon-Gamez contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain its sentence and substantively unreasonable because the sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-16\">Calderon-Gamez, a Mexican citizen, entered the United States in 1989 at the age of 15, and he was assigned an Alien Registration Number.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1999, Calderon-Ga-mez was convicted of his first felony\u2014 possession of cocaine \u2014 and was sentenced to three years probation. He failed to follow the terms of his probation and was deported to Mexico in 2001. He thereafter illegally reentered the United States, and in 2005 he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and the unauthorized possession of a driver\u2019s license. He was convicted of those charges and sentenced to 366 days in prison. In 2006, after his release, he was sentenced to 21 months imprisonment, followed by 36 moths of supervised release, for his illegal reentry into the United States after being deported. After serving that prison sentence, Calderon-Gamez was deported \u2014 for a second time \u2014 to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-17\">Calderon-Gamez once again illegally reentered the United States, and in 2009 he was arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon \u2014 a switch blade. As a result, the supervised release from his previous con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>viction was revoked and he was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment. He then pleaded guilty to and was convicted of illegal reentry into the United States, which led to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Based on Calderon-Gamez\u2019s offense, criminal history, and acceptance of responsibility, his recommended guidelines range was 21 to 27 months imprisonment. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5 Pt. A (sentencing table). He was subject to a statutory maximum sentence of 120 months imprisonment. The district court, after stating that it had considered the \u201cpolicies and guidelines of the United States Sentencing Commission,\u201d and the \u201cadvisory guideline sentence,\u201d and \u201cthe factors arrayed at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d and that Calderon-Ga-mez is a \u201cpersistent and ... actively defiant offender,\u201d found that a 27-month sentence at the top of the guidelines range was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u201cWe review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-step process.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010). First, we look at \u201cwhether the district court committed any significant procedural error,\u201d and second we look at \u201cwhether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">To determine if a sentence is procedurally unreasonable, we consider issues such as whether the district court improperly calculated the guidelines range, treated the guidelines as mandatory instead of advisory, failed to consider the appropriate statutory factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain the sentence it imposed. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Calderon-Gamez does not contend that the district court improperly calculated the guidelines range or that it relied on clearly erroneous facts. Instead, he argues that the court failed to adequately explain its sentence and consider the appropriate factors because it did not specifically state that it had considered Calderon-Gamez\u2019s \u201ccultural assimilation\u201d as a reason that it could depart downward from the guidelines range. Although we have implied that a district court may depart from the guidelines based on cultural assimilation, <em>see Sanchez-Valencia, </em>148 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.1998), that does not mean a district court must do so nor does it mean that the district court has to specifically state it considered that issue in deciding not to vary downward from the guidelines range. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d); <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1195 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (\u201cNo member of this Court has ever before indicated that a sentencing judge is required to articulate his findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>and reasoning with great detail or in any detail for that matter.\u201d). Further, Calderon-Gamez did not object to the fairness of the guidelines range or specifically ask the district court to consider his cultural assimilation. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 357, 127 S.Ct. at 2468 (\u201cUnless a party contests the Guidelines sentence generally under \u00a7 3553(a) ... or argues for departure, the judge normally need say no more.\u201d). Accordingly, when the district court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that it was particularly disturbed by Calderon-Gamez\u2019s persistent disregard for the law, it did not impose a procedurally unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">To determine if a sentence is substantively unreasonable, \u201cwe must, as the Supreme Court has instructed us, consider the totality of the facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1189. \u201c[Ojrdinarily we ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We will vacate a sentence for substantive unreasonableness \u201cif, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Here, the totality of the circumstances, including the within-the-guidelines-range sentence and Calderon-Gamez\u2019s persistant and repetitive history of violating the law, supports the 27-month sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-12\">. Although the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement records indicate that Calderon-Gamez first entered the United States in 1989, he asserts that he came to the United States in 1987 at age 13. That inconsistency, however, has no bearing on this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\">. Although we usually apply the plain error standard where the defendant failed to raise the issue in the district court, <em>see United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), which the government argues occurred here, it is unnecessary to decide whether a plain error standard applies here because Calderon-Gamez\u2019s arguments fail regardless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
