Tuft, Texas prisoner # 1062966, appeals the summary-judgment dismissal of his civil rights action, filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>well as other rulings by the district court. Tuft sued the State of Texas, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), and numerous prison officials in their individual and official capacities, seeking nominal, compensatory, and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and transfer to federal-protective custody. Tuft alleged prison conditions, including unsanitary conditions, waiting in line to receive medication, and female guards participating in strip searches of male prisoners, violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213. Summary judgment was granted against Tuft\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In regard to the court\u2019s interlocutory rulings, Tuft contends the district court erred by ordering him to file a more definite statement of his claims. Such an order is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Old Time Enters., Inc. v. Int\u2019l Coffee Corp., </em>862 F.2d 1213, 1217 (5th Cir.1989). Although Tuft maintains most of the information the district court required by its order was already included in his pleadings, the order identified specific details Tuft failed to provide in his amended complaint. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Tuft further asserts the court erred by requiring in its order for a more definite statement that he provide information related to exhaustion of claims. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) (holding inmate not required to demonstrate exhaustion in complaint). Error, if any, was harmless because the court did not dismiss any of Tuft\u2019s claims as unexhausted until <em>after </em>defendants raised exhaustion in their answer as an affirmative defense and moved for summary judgment on that basis. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61 (noting court must disregard all errors not affecting party\u2019s substantial rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Other interlocutory rulings Tuft challenges include denial of his motions for leave to amend his pleadings, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2). Denial of such motion is also reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). \u201cWhile leave to amend must be freely given, that generous standard is tempered by the necessary power of a district court to manage a case\u201d, <em>Shivangi v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>825 F.2d 885, 891 (5th Cir.1987); and \u201ca busy district court need not allow itself to be imposed upon by the presentation of theories seriatim\u201d, <em>Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., </em>332 F.3d 854, 865 (5th Cir.2003) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Because Tuft requested leave to amend his pleadings <em>after </em>he already filed an amended complaint, his motions for leave to amend were subject to the court\u2019s discretion under Rule 15(a)(2). The court\u2019s ruling was consistent with a concern for avoiding \u201cundue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment\u201d, a \u201cpermissible base[ ] for denial of a motion to amend\u201d. <em>Wright v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>415 F.3d 384, 391 (5th Cir.2005) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Tuft failed to brief any challenge to the denial of his motions for reconsideration of those rulings; accordingly, that issue is waived. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Tuft also appeals the denial of leave to file a supplemental complaint to include claims arising after the date of his amended complaint. Such denial is reviewed for abuse of discretion; however, Tuft fails to explain why the district court\u2019s decision constituted such abuse. <em>Burns v. Exxon Corp., </em>158 F.3d 336, 343 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">Finally, Tuft maintains the district court abused its discretion in denying his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>motion to file supplemental records consisting of documents showing ADA architectural guidelines. The district court properly struck the document because Tuft failed to verify them. <em>See DIRECTV, Inc. v. Budden, </em>420 F.3d 521, 529-31 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.CivP. 56(c)(4). Although Tuft also challenges the denial of reconsideration of its order striking the documents, he has not briefed his claim against that ruling, and, therefore, waived any error attending it. <em>See Hughes, </em>191 F.3d at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Tuft asserts the district court erred by failing to apply the continuing-tort doctrine to claims it ruled as time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. A dismissal of claims under \u00a7 1915A is reviewed <em>de novo. Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005). For purposes of the continuing-tort doctrine, \u201ca continuous tort involves not only continuing wrongful conduct, but continuing <em>injury </em>as well\u201d. <em>Upjohn Co. v. Freeman, </em>885 S.W.2d 538, 542 (Tex.App. 1994). Tuft did not allege continuing <em>injury </em>with respect to the claims dismissed as time barred. For example, although Tuft maintained unsanitary prison conditions caused his ongoing bacterial infection, and that those conditions persisted, he did not assert that the \u201cwrongful conduct continues to effect additional injury\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Tuft also contends the court improperly dismissed, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e), his ADA and constitutional claims regarding prison conditions; however, this assertion is unavailing to the extent he sought compensatory damages. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 375 (stating failure to allege physical injury precludes recovery of compensatory damages for mental or emotional injuries). We also review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of claims under \u00a7 1997e(e). <em>Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373. Although \u00a7 1997e(e) prohibits Tuft from recovering compensatory damages, it does not bar his ability to recover nominal and punitive damages for constitutional violations despite the lack of any physical injury. <em>Hutchins v. McDaniels, </em>512 F.3d 193, 198 (5th Cir.2007). In any event, even if the dismissal of claims for \u201cmonetary\u201d damages included nominal and punitive damages, any error was harmless because, as explained below, the court properly granted summary judgment against the constitutional and ADA claims regarding prison conditions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Tuft asserts the court erred in granting summary judgment on his claims regarding: a cross-sex strip search in 2005; the constitutionality of TDCJ policy governing strip searches; deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs; deliberate indifference to his health and safety; and violations of the ADA. A summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a). If the movant demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the burden shifts to the non-movant to provide specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), (e). In reviewing summary judgment, \u201c[w]e construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party\u201d. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Under \u00a7 1997e(a), a prisoner is prohibited from bringing a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1983, \u201cuntil such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted\u201d. The court held Tuft failed to exhaust his claims regarding: waiting in line and in the cage for medication; treatment for hepatitis C; unsanitary prison conditions; having to walk more than 50 yards to receive medication; the lack of comfortable shirts; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>failing to provide handicapped recreational facilities. Tuft contends he exhausted these claims; however, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Tuft acknowledged he did not exhaust his claim that prison officials violated the ADA by failing to provide handicapped recreational facilities. He also failed to exhaust his Eighth Amendment claim he was denied medical care when required to wait in line and then walk 50 yards for medication. <em>See Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 517 (5th Cir.2004). Although Tuft maintains he filed grievances (that were not returned to him) regarding his other claims, Tuft does not contend, and the record does not show, that he filed grievances for these claims. <em>See id. </em>at 517-23. Because he failed to \u201cpursue the grievance remedy to conclusion\u201d, Tuft failed to exhaust the claims. <em>Wright v. Hollingsworth, </em>260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir.2001). In addition, the court properly dismissed as unexhausted Tuft\u2019s claim regarding having to walk 50 yards to the medication line to the extent Tuft did not file administrative grievances for this claim until after filing this \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See Richardson v. Spurlock, </em>260 F.3d 495, 499-500 (5th Cir.2001). Nevertheless, even if Tuft satisfied the exhaustion requirement, none of his claims constituted deliberate indifference of his medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Summary judgment was granted on the merits against Tuft\u2019s remaining ADA claims. Tuft failed to create a genuine issue of material fact with regard to them. In his initial brief, Tuft does not brief any challenge to the summary-judgment dismissal of these claims. Defendants contend, however, that the dismissal of Tuft\u2019s ADA claim regarding overcrowded showers was proper, and Tuft challenges the dismissal of that claim in his reply brief. Accordingly, although Tuft has waived any error with respect to the dismissal of other ADA claims on the merits, <em>see Hughes, </em>191 F.3d at 613, we have discretion to consider Tuft\u2019s contentions regarding overcrowded showers, <em>see United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 360-61 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Despite complaining about such overcrowding, Tuft did not provide any summary-judgment evidence showing he and other prisoners with disabilities were treated differently from non-disabled prisoners. Therefore, even assuming Tuft is a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d and the provision of showers is one of the \u201cservices, programs, or activities\u201d of the TDCJ, and consistent with the district court\u2019s ruling, the crowded conditions of the showers did not constitute an ADA violation because there is no evidence he was discriminated against in his use of prison showers by reason of his disability. <em>See Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, </em>118 F.3d 421, 428 (5th Cir.1997). In addition, Tuft failed to allege the overcrowding had a greater effect in impairing his access to showers than it did for non-disabled prisoners. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.160(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Tuft appeals the summary-judgment against his cross-sex strip-search claim, in which a female guard allegedly participated, by maintaining: it violated his constitutional rights; and the prison policy governing such searches is unconstitutional. In Tuft\u2019s verified amended complaint, he alleged Lt. Gonzalez, a female corrections officer, participated in a strip search of Tuft and six other inmates on 26 February 2005. <em>See Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 765 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cOn summary judgment, factual allegations set forth in a verified complaint may be treated the same as when they are contained in an affidavit.\u201d). According to Tuft, all seven inmates were ordered into a prison security office after being questioned about the source of cigarette smoke the previous day; Lt. Gonzalez was sitting at a desk \u201cwithin arms reach\u201d of the inmates; a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>male officer named Lt. Peterson and two other male officers were present; Lt. Gonzalez ordered the prisoners to remove their clothing; two of the male officers searched the prisoners\u2019 clothing while Lt. Gonzalez \u201cwas directing the search and participated in the visual cavity search by observing closely\u201d; and after the inmates told Lt. Gonzalez they had no information, she replied they would be \u201csubjected to these humiliating strip searches by her if [they] did not snitch on the smokers\u201d. Tuft supported his claims with affidavits from two of the six other prisoners who were strip searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Defendants admitted Tuft and other prisoners were strip searched but submitted affidavits from Lts. Gonzalez and Peterson denying Lt. Gonzalez\u2019 participation. In addition, defendants submitted a copy of the TDCJ policy governing such searches, Administrative Directive 03.22 (AD 03.22), which authorizes strip searches of male offenders by staff of the opposite sex, but \u201conly in extraordinary circumstances and when approved by a supervisor\u201d. The policy also states: \u201c[i]f, under ordinary circumstances, a female officer is present in the vicinity of a male offender being strip-searched, the officer\u2019s duty is solely to provide security for the searching officer\u201d; and \u201c[t]he female officer shall not actively participate in the strip search\u201d in such a case. Tuft maintained the policy was unconstitutional with respect to strip searches, insofar as it authorized Lt. Gonzalez to strip search him.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">We have recognized a prisoner: possesses a \u201cconstitutional right to bodily privacy\u201d that \u201cis minimal, at best\u201d, <em>Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 745 (5th Cir.2002); and \u201closes those rights that are necessarily sacrificed to legitimate penological needs\u201d, <em>Elliott v. Lynn, </em>38 F.3d 188, 190-91 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we have held \u201csearches or seizures conducted on prisoners must be reasonable under all the facts and circumstances in which they are performed\u201d; however, \u201cproving reasonableness is a light burden\u201d, because \u201ca prison administrator\u2019s decision and actions in the prison context are entitled to great deference from the courts\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 191 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Thus, \u201cvisual body cavity searches of prisoners can be constitutionally reasonable\u201d, but judging the reasonableness of such a search \u201c \u2018requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails\u2019 \u201d while \u201c \u2018considering] the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 558-59, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">Regarding prison regulations, we \u201cgive great deference to prison administrators\u2019 judgments regarding jail security\u201d and will uphold such regulation if it is \u201c \u2018reasonably related to legitimate penological interests\u2019\u201d. <em>Oliver, </em>276 F.3d at 745 (quoting <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)). <em>Oliver </em>upheld the constitutionality of AD 03.22, at issue, regarding cross-sex strip searches. <em>Id. </em>at 742-43. Although the regulation has been amended since our court reviewed its constitutionality in <em>Oliver, </em>the current policy also \u201cnarrowly cabins the scope\u201d of such searches by permitting them only under \u201c \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 743 (quoting AD 03.22). A prisoner \u201cmight allege specific facts that would make lower-level officers liable for any unconstitutional <em>application </em>of the policy; the policy itself, however, is constitutional\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The court properly ruled that Tuft\u2019s claims for monetary damages against all individual defendants, in their official capacities as employees of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>of Texas, are barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 742. The Eleventh Amendment also justifies the district court\u2019s dismissal of claims against the State of Texas and the TDCJ, \u201cregardless of the relief sought\u201d. <em>See Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 146, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993); <em>Talib v. Gilley, </em>138 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201cThis court may affirm on any basis supported by the record.\u201d). The district court properly dismissed Tuft\u2019s claims against former TDCJ-ID Director Douglas Dretke, former Jester III Warden Brenda Chaney, and Jester III Assistant Warden Richard Leal in their individual capacities, as well as for vicarious or re-spondeat-superior liability. Tuft did not produce any summary judgment evidence showing these TDCJ officials were personally involved in the 2005 strip search or that they implemented a policy that was itself a repudiation of constitutional rights and the moving force of the constitutional violation. <em>See Oliver, </em>276 F.3d at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The district court found Tuft\u2019s claim, \u201cthat the sole purpose of the female officer\u2019s presence during the search was to sexually coerce and humiliate him into disclosing information\u201d, was \u201cconclusory and unsupported\u201d. Tuft, however, supported his claim that Lt. Gonzalez participated in the search in order to sexually coerce him into telling the officers who was smoking, with competent summary-judgment evidence, including his verified pleadings and affidavits from two other prisoners. \u201cAny credibility determinations [the district court] made between the officers\u2019 and [Tuft\u2019s] version of events [was] inappropriate for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Tarver v. City of Edna, </em>410 F.3d 745, 753 (5th Cir.2005). \u201c[C]onstru[ing] all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party\u201d, <em>Dillon, </em>596 F.3d at 266 (5th Cir.2010) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted), we vacate the district court\u2019s partial dismissal of Tuft\u2019s claim against Lts. Gonzalez and Peterson in their individual capacities as premature, and remand the claim for further proceedings, <em>see Moore v. Carwell, </em>168 F.3d 234, 236-37 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The district court recognized that Tuft seeks nominal and punitive damages, but found that analysis of defendants\u2019 qualified immunity was unnecessary because Tuft disclaimed any request for \u201cmonetary\u201d damages. The court cited Tuft\u2019s summary-judgment response, in which Tuft stated he did not seek \u201cdamages for mental or emotional injury\u201d. Tuft contends the district court \u201cerroneously and incorrectly\u201d found he disclaimed \u201cmonetary damages\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">In that regard, Tuft stated in his summary-judgment response that he requested \u201cnominal and punitive damages for this claim\u201d. Liberally construing his statement regarding damages for mental or emotional injury, he apparently meant to disclaim only compensatory damages for the 2005 strip search, because compensatory damages, apart from physical injury, are unavailable under \u00a7 1997e(e). <em>See Oliver, </em>276 F.3d at 740 (holding pleadings filed by <em>pro se </em>litigant entitled to liberal construction); <em>see also Hutchins, </em>512 F.3d at 197-98 (holding nominal and punitive damages available for constitutional violations notwithstanding \u00a7 1997e(e)). To the extent the district court interpreted Tuft\u2019s summary-judgment response as disclaiming nominal and punitive damages, it misread it. <em>See Oliver, </em>276 F.3d at 740. As explained above, Tuft stated a colorable claim for an unconstitutional cross-sex strip search in 2005 and supported it with competent summary-judgment evidence. <em>See Moore, </em>168 F.3d at 236-37. Accordingly, on remand, the district court may wish to consider whether Lts. Gonzalez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>and Peterson are entitled to qualified immunity from Tuft\u2019s claim for nominal and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\">Tuft contends additional discovery was needed before the district court ruled on the summary-judgment motion. The district court, however, granted Tuft\u2019s Rule 56(d) extension request, and Tuft has not provided any specific facts to suggest additional discovery time would have enabled him to locate information that would have successfully rebutted the summary-judgment motion regarding the dispositive issues in his action. <em>See Washington v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>901 F.2d 1281, 1285 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Tuft asserts the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a temporary-restraining order and preliminary injunction to require prison officials to allow Tuft to keep his medication on his person. Our court lacks jurisdiction over the denial of a temporary-restraining order, therefore, Tuft\u2019s appeal of that ruling is dismissed. <em>See Faulder v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 741, 742 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">A denial of a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>SEC v. First Fin. Group of Tex., </em>645 F.2d 429, 433 (5th Cir.1981). \u201c[A]ll interlocutory orders are reviewable on appeal from the final decree.\u201d <em>Gloria S.S. Co. v. Smith, </em>376 F.2d 46, 47 (1967); <em>see also First Fin. Group, </em>645 F.2d at 433 (applying that principle to a preliminary injunction ruling). The appeal from the denial of the preliminary injunction became moot when the district court granted summary judgment against Tuft\u2019s claim for injunc-tive relief on the same basis, because an appeal is proper only from the final order addressing injunctive relief. <em>See First Fin. Group, </em>645 F.2d at 433. Accordingly, we \u201cdismiss the appeal ... from the order of preliminary injunction\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Moreover, as explained above, Tuft\u2019s claims for injunctive relief became moot when he was transferred from the Jester III Unit to another unit in 2009. <em>See Herman v. Holiday, </em>238 F.3d 660, 665 (5th Cir.2001). In any event, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the preliminary injunction because there was no substantial threat Tuft would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction was not granted. For the same reason, we dismiss his challenge to the denial of his motion for \u201creconsideration\u201d of the denial of injunc-tive relief as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">DISMISSED in part; AFFIRMED in part; VACATED on the dismissal of Tuft\u2019s claims for nominal and punitive damages against Lts. Gonzalez and Peterson in their individual capacities; REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b796-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
