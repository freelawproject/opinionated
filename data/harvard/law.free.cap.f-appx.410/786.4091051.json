Munoz argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 5K2.12, maintaining his contention that he provided false testimony at his co-defendant\u2019s trial under duress as a result of his co-defendant\u2019s threats against the lives of his family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">This court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of a downward departure motion made pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12 unless the district court held a mistaken belief that it lacked authority to depart. <em>United States v. Lucas, </em>516 F.3d 316, 350-51 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). Munoz does not argue, and the record does not indicate, that the district court in this case mistakenly believed it was not authorized to grant the motion. Consequently, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of the motion. <em>See Lucas, </em>516 F.3d at 350-51; <em>United States v. Buck, </em>324 F.3d 786, 797-98 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
