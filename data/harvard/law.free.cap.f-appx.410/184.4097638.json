He was later granted temporary-resident status and became a lawful permanent resident (LPR) in 1990. In 1991, Garcia-Padilla pleaded guilty in federal court to illegally entering the United States. In exchange for his plea, the government dismissed two other charges against Garcia-Padilla: alien smuggling, and aiding and abetting aliens entering the United States. The criminal charges were based on statements Garcia-Padilla had made to immigration officials that he assisted his common-law wife, their two children, and her brother with entering the United States \u201cillegally through a hole in the fence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-24\">Based on his plea and this conduct, the Immigration and Naturalization Service initiated deportation proceedings and issued an Order to Show Cause (OSC) why Garcia-Padilla should not be deported for entering the United States without inspection. Garcia-Padilla failed to appear at the subsequent deportation hearing and the Immigration Judge (IJ) ordered him deportable. Instead of leaving the United States, however, Garcia-Padilla remained in the country until May 2008, when he voluntarily traveled to Mexico. A few weeks later, Garcia-Padilla was admitted into the United States as a returning LPR, but he did not possess or present any valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>entry documents. As a result, in 2009 the Department of Homeland Security<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued a notice to appear, charging Garcia-Padilla as removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Garcia-Padilla filed for permission to reapply for admission and an 1-485 application to adjust his status to that of a permanent resident. The government filed a motion to pretermit the 1-485 application on the grounds that Garcia-Padilla was inadmissible because he had been involved with smuggling aliens, namely, his brother-in-law. The government further argued that Garcia-Padilla was inadmissible because he had left the United States while under an outstanding order of removal and had not remained outside the country for at least ten years before seeking readmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Garcia-Padilla responded that he was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility because he had married a citizen in 1998, he was never convicted of alien smuggling, and the OSC was insufficient to support his deportation. He also claimed that he was unaware of the deportation order, which had been issued in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The IJ granted the motion to pretermit, finding that Garcia-Padilla, having admitted smuggling his brother-in-law into the United States, was inadmissible. The IJ further found that Garcia-Padilla was inadmissible because he had not departed following the entry of the deportation order, had re-entered the United States without waiting the required ten years, and had not obtained a waiver before reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Garcia-Padilla asked the IJ to reconsider the decision, arguing that the dismissal of the alien-smuggling charges was enti-tied to <em>res judicata </em>or collateral-estoppel effect. He also argued that he was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility because he was married to a U.S. citizen. Finally, he asserted that the OSC was improper because the government had been aware of his LPR status. Garcia-Padilla then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">The BIA affirmed. The BIA explained that Garcia-Padilla\u2019s LPR status automatically terminated when the 1991 deportation order became final; the deportation order was executed when Garcia-Padilla left in 2008; an LPR could be charged with deportability for entry without inspection; and neither <em>res judicata </em>nor collateral estoppel precluded the IJ from considering whether Garcia-Padilla had engaged in alien smuggling. The BIA further found that the IJ had properly refused to consider Garcia-Padilla\u2019s waiver because he was otherwise inadmissible and thus ineligible for adjustment of status. The BIA did not address Garcia-Padilla\u2019s challenge to the 1991 deportation order itself because he had not raised the issue before the IJ. Garcia-Padilla now petitions this court for review of the BIA\u2019s order dismissing his appeal. He challenges (1) the BIA\u2019s conclusion that neither <em>res judicata </em>nor collateral estoppel barred the IJ from considering his alleged alien smuggling; (2) the sufficiency of the OSC; (3) the determination that he was inadmissible; and (4) the denial of his application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">When considering a petition to review a BIA final order, we review legal issues <em>de novo. Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Id. </em>When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 1338-39. Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s order, so we review only the BIA\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Garcia-Padilla argues that the government is estopped from using his alien-smuggling conduct against him in deportation proceedings because those charges were dismissed under the terms of his plea agreement in his 1991 criminal case. Garcia-Padilla argues that considering this conduct violates double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">We review questions of <em>res judicata de novo. In re Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>244 F.3d 1289, 1295 (11th Cir.2001). The doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>\u201cbars the filing of claims which were raised or could have been raised in an earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999). <em>Res judicata </em>bars the filing of a claim when four requirements have been met: (1) there has been a final judgment on the merits, (2) rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) the parties in both suits are identical, and (4) both cases involve the same cause of action. <em>Singh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir.2009). We then determine whether the claim could have been raised in the prior action; if so, <em>res judicata </em>applies. <em>Piper Aircraft, </em>244 F.3d at 1296. The party asserting <em>res judicata </em>carries the burden to show that the later-filed action is barred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Generally, if a case arises out of the same \u201cnucleus of operative fact\u201d as a former case, the two cases are the same for <em>res judicata </em>purposes. <em>Singh, </em>561 F.3d at 1280. But <em>\u201cres judicata </em>does not bar a claim that was not in existence at the time of the original action unless the facts underlying the claim were actually raised in that action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>244 F.3d at 1299).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Here, Garcia-Padilla\u2019s guilty plea and 1991 deportation order were the result of his illegal entry into the country. When he applied for adjustment of status during the 2009 removal proceedings, the government argued that Garcia-Padilla was inadmissible because he had smuggled his brother-in-law into the country. Although the criminal case and the 1991 deportation proceeding involved some of the same facts as the 2009 removal proceeding and application for adjustment of status, the question of Garcia-Padilla\u2019s inadmissibility and eligibility for adjustment of status was not raised or even in existence in 1991. Therefore, the two cases do not involve the \u201csame cause of action\u201d and <em>res judicata </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">Collateral estoppel is a legal issue that we review <em>de novo. Dailide v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>387 F.3d 1335, 1341 (11th Cir.2004). Collateral estoppel precludes a party from litigating an issue in a later action if that issue was fully litigated in a prior action. <em>Id. </em>at 1342. For the doctrine to apply (1) the issue now at stake must be identical to the one involved in the prior proceeding, (2) the resolution of the issue in the prior litigation must have been a critical and necessary part of the judgment, (3) the issue must actually have been litigated in the prior proceeding, and (4) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">Here, the alien-smuggling issue was never litigated in a prior proceeding. <em>See Dailide, </em>387 F.3d at 1342. The alien-smuggling charges were dismissed under the terms of a plea agreement in a 1991 criminal case. A criminal charge dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>an indication that the accused is innocent. <em>See Uboh v. Reno, </em>141 F.3d 1000, 1004-05 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that dismissal of criminal charges pursuant to a compromise or agreement does not constitute a favorable termination). Moreover, immigration proceedings are civil, not criminal, proceedings, <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1196 (11th Cir.2004), and the government may raise, in a civil proceeding, an issue on which it \u201clost\u201d in a criminal case, <em>Tomlinson v. Lefkowitz, </em>334 F.2d 262, 264 (5th Cir.1964).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, collateral estoppel does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Finally, Garcia-Padilla\u2019s due process argument fails because deportation proceedings cannot form the basis of a double-jeopardy claim; double jeopardy arises in criminal proceedings, and deportation is a civil matter. <em>See Cadet, </em>377 F.3d at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Garcia-Padilla argues that the OSC was insufficient to support his deportation because it failed to charge a violation of immigration law and because he was an LPR. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u201cAny alien who entered the United States without inspection ... or is in the United States in violation of this chapter or any other law of the United States is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1)(B) (1991);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>In re Briones, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 355, 362-63 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">When the OSC was issued in 1991, Garcia-Padilla was charged with entry without inspection. His status as an LPR did not preclude deportation on this ground. <em>See Matter of Ruis, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 320, 320-22 (BIA 1982) (noting that an LPR may be charged with being de-portable for entry without inspection). Accordingly, the 1991 OSC properly charged Garcia-Padilla with a violation of the immigration laws and was sufficient to support the deportation order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">Garcia-Padilla argues that his status as an LPR prevents the government from deeming him deported when he traveled to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">The LPR status of an alien who has entered the United States without inspection terminates \u201cwhen the adjudication of his deportability becomes final in administrative proceedings.\u201d <em>Matter of Gunaydin and Kircali, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 326, 328 (BIA 1982). Any alien who has been ordered deported and who has left the United States is considered to have been deported in accordance with the law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(g). \u201cDeportation orders are self-executing orders, not dependent upon judicial enforcement.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 398, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">In this case, Garcia-Padilla\u2019s LPR status was terminated when the 1991 deportation order became final. <em>Gunaydin, </em>18 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 328. When Garcia-Padilla later traveled to Mexico, his 1991 deportation order self-executed, and he was considered deported pursuant to law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(g); <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 398, 115 S.Ct. 1587. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Garcia-Padilla removed himself is not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Finally, Garcia-Padilla argues that he was entitled to a waiver of inadmissibility and to an adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">In a removal proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of proving that he is \u201cclearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A). An alien is eligible for adjustment of status if, among other requirements, \u201cthe alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">An alien who is involved in smuggling, however, is not eligible for admission. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). The Attorney General may waive this ineligibility \u201cfor humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest\u201d if the alien seeking the waiver is an LPR \u201cwho temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of removal, and who is otherwise admissible to the United States as a returning resident.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(d)(ll). But this waiver is only available if the individual the alien has \u201cencouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided ... was the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, son, or daughter (and no other individual).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, an alien who has been ordered removed and who attempts to re-enter the United States without being admitted is inadmissible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II). Aliens subject to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C) may nevertheless seek re-admission after waiting 10 years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (9)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Here, Garcia-Padilla engaged in alien smuggling, which made him inadmissible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). Moreover, because Garcia-Padilla entered the United States within 10 years of his self-executed deportation, he is inadmissible. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), 1255(a). Because Garcia-Padilla was inadmissible on these grounds, he was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Additionally, because Garcia-Padilla was ineligible for a waiver, there was no reason for the BIA to consider Garcia-Padilla\u2019s marriage. <em>See I.N.S. v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25, 97 S.Ct. 200, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976) (holding that \u201ccourts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Accordingly, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\">. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 abolished the INS and transferred its functions to the new Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-9\">.
