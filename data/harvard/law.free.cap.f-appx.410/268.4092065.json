Hearn alleged in his petition that the state court erred by denying his motion to suppress because there were false statements in the affidavit that provided probable cause for the warrant to search his property. The district court ruled that the issue was barred from review, under <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 494, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3052, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976), but we reversed and remanded because the state court had failed to make \u201cexplicit findings on matters essential to\u201d Hearn\u2019s argument under the Fourth Amendment, <em>Hearn v. Fla., </em>326 Fed.Appx. 519, 522 (11th Cir.2009). On remand, the district court denied Hearn\u2019s petition. The district court ruled that the officers had entered Hearn\u2019s property in exigent circumstances and lawfully had observed evidence that Hearn had been manufacturing methamphetamine, which provided probable cause to obtain a warrant to search Hearn\u2019s property. The district court also ruled that allegedly false statements in an affidavit that had supported the warrant were immaterial to a finding of probable cause and were not made deliberately or recklessly. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">A federal court may not grant a state prisoner a writ of habeas corpus when a claim has been adjudicated on the merits by a state court unless the decision is \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Suggs v. McNeil, </em>609 F.3d 1218, 1227 (11th Cir.2010). A decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d clearly established federal law if either the state court reached a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law or the state court was presented with facts that are \u201cmaterially indistinguishable\u201d from relevant Supreme Court precedent, but arrived at a contrary result. <em>Suggs, </em>609 F.3d at 1227. A state court makes an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law if the court \u201c \u2018identifies the correct legal rule from Supreme Court case law but unreasonably applies that rule to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rutherford v. Crosby, </em>385 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">The state court reasonably could have concluded that any misstatements in the affidavit about the reason that officers visited Hearn\u2019s property did not invalidate the warrant to search Hearn\u2019s property. Hearn was required to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant made false statements of fact either deliberately or recklessly. <em>See Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). The affidavit stated that a suspect in an armed robbery, Wayne Land, received a telephone call from Hearn while Land was being inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>viewed inside the home of Mark Wade, and that officers had learned the telephone call came from Hearn\u2019s residence. Although Hearn argued that the statements were irreconcilable with copies of records that no calls were made from his house to Wade\u2019s house during or within a few hours of the time that the officers questioned Land inside Wade\u2019s house, the statements in the affidavit can be reconciled with the evidence presented by the government during the hearing on Hearn\u2019s motion to suppress. The affidavit was consistent with the testimonies of Wade and Darrell Smith that Smith called Wade from Hearn\u2019s house around 5:30 a.m. and the testimony of Officer Jenny Mann that, later that day, she observed inside Wade\u2019s house a caller identification machine displaying the telephone number for Hearn\u2019s residence. Officer Mann testified that she could not recall whether she looked at the machine after hearing Wade\u2019s telephone or a different telephone. A previous call from Hearn\u2019s residence to Wade could have caused the caller identification machine to display Hearn\u2019s number. Moreover, the state court could reasonably have concluded that the misstatement in the affidavit was not made deliberately or recklessly.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The state court also reasonably could have concluded that the affidavit contained sufficient information to provide probable cause to issue the warrant to search Hearn\u2019s property. The affidavit stated that officers went to Hearn\u2019s residence to search for Wade and, while the officers surrounded the property as part of their search for Wade, they observed evidence that Hearn was manufacturing methamphetamine. The affidavit, coupled with evidence presented in the state court during the hearing on Hearn\u2019s motion to suppress, established that exigent circumstances allowed a warrantless entry onto Hearn\u2019s property and that the location where the officers observed evidence of Hearn\u2019s methamphetamine operation was outside the curtilage of Hearn\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The state court reasonably could have concluded that exigent circumstances allowed the officers\u2019 entry onto Hearn\u2019s property without a warrant. Under the exigent circumstances exception, a \u201cwar-rantless entry by criminal law enforcement officials may be legal when there is compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Tyler, </em>436 U.S. 499, 509, 98 S.Ct. 1942, 1949, 56 L.Ed.2d 486 (1978); <em>see Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 14-15, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948) (exigent circumstances include a suspect \u201cfleeing or likely to take flight\u201d). The victim of an armed kidnaping had identified Wade as a perpetrator, and officers went to Wade\u2019s house to investigate that crime. While at Wade\u2019s house, Land, who also was a suspect in the armed kidnaping, told the officers that Wade \u201ccould be hiding out and was known to hang around Hearn.\u201d The officers were in hot pursuit of Wade and, based on the possibility that he was still armed and might flee, were entitled to enter Hearn\u2019s property without a warrant to search for Wade.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The state courts could reasonably have concluded that the officers, having lawfully entered Hearn\u2019s property, observed incriminating evidence through the door of a shed left ajar. Under the open fields doctrine, officers may observe property outside the curtilage of a person\u2019s home. <em>See United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 300, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 1139, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987). To determine if property is within the curtilage of a home, courts must consider four factors: (1) the proximity of the property to the home; (2) whether the property is \u201cincluded within an enclosure surrounding the home\u201d; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the use of the property; and (4) what, if any, \u201csteps [have been] taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 107 S.Ct. at 1139. Officer Johnny Nolan testified at the hearing before the state court that he and Lieutenant Martinez walked to the back of Hearn\u2019s property to prevent Wade from trying to escape through the woods behind Hearn\u2019s house. Nolan stated that a shed was situated about 20 yards behind Hearn\u2019s house, behind a camper trailer, and about 10 yards behind the shed was a wooded area. Nolan stated that there was no fence or other object that obstructed the area between the woods and the shed; the shed appeared to house only chemicals and containers for storing liquids; and the shed was subject to observation by any member of the public passing through or near the woods. Mark Wade testified that a hunting club was located beside Hearn\u2019s property and members of the hunting club had unlimited access to the woods, which were located about thirty yards from Hearn\u2019s house. Officer Nolan testified that he stopped between the shed and the woods and, from that position, he could see through the opened door of the shed paraphernalia \u201ccustomarily\u201d used to manufacture methamphetamine and smelled a strong odor of chemicals. Lieutenant Martinez, who was positioned behind Nolan and closer to the wooded area, observed in a small toolshed attached to the shed other paraphernalia used to manufacture methamphetamine. The state court reasonably have could concluded that the shed was outside the curti-lage of Hearn\u2019s home and the officers lawfully observed the contents of the shed, which provided probable cause to obtain a warrant to search Hearn\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The district court did not err when it denied Hearn\u2019s petition. It was reasonable for the state courts to conclude that the warrant provided probable cause to issue a warrant to search Hearn\u2019s property for evidence that he had manufactured methamphetamine. The decision of the state court to deny Hearn\u2019s motion to suppress was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We AFFIRM the denial of Hearn\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
