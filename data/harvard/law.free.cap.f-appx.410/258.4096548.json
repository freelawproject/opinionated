On appeal, Campos-Arrollo argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the consideration of his cooperation, family issues, remorse, and lack of a criminal history should have led the court to sentence him to less than 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">We review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court is required to impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Further, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will not overturn a sentence unless we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">Campos-Arrollo has not identified why his sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and \u00a7 3553(a) factors. His sentence was within the guidelines range and thus one we would ordinarily expect to be reasonable. Campos-Arrollo does not show that the court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
