He contends that the district court erred in determining, based on the application notes accompanying Section 1B1.10 of the Sentencing Guidelines, that he was ineligible for a reduction of sentence because he was not serving his original term of imprisonment. He argues that the term of imprisonment imposed following the revocation of his supervised release is part of his original sentence and that, in any event, the district court erred in applying Section 1B1.10 and its accompanying commentary as mandatory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Section 3582(c)(2) \u201cpermits a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment when it is based upon a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines, if such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). The applicable policy statement that is found in Section 1B1.10, prohibits a district court from reducing a term of imprisonment below the term of imprisonment the defendant has already served. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(C). Moreover, a defendant is entitled to a reduction in his term of imprisonment only if it was imposed as part of the original sentence. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.4(A)). He may not obtain \u201ca reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Nelson\u2019s argument that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered Section 1B1.10 advisory fails. This court previously ruled <em>Booker </em>did \u201cnot alter the mandatory character of Guideline \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions.\u201d <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, Nelson\u2019s arguments do not establish that the district court erred in determining that it lacked the authority to reduce his sentence under Section 3582(c)(2). <em>See Dillon v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">As Nelson has served his original custodial sentence, the Guidelines prohibit any reduction in that sentence or the sentence Nelson received upon revocation of his supervised release. Because Nelson has no remaining supervised release term that may be modified or terminated, he can obtain no meaningful relief from the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">Nelson\u2019s appeal is moot. Accordingly, it is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b758-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-25\">. Nelson also argues that Section IB 1.10, cmt. (n.4(A)) is unconstitutional and should not prohibit reduction of his revocation sentence because it is inconsistent with the definitions of supervised release in Chapter Seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>of the Guidelines. As Nelson raised those issues for the first time in his reply brief, we will not consider them. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>509 F.3d 682, 693 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
