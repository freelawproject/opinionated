We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">On February 17, 2009, the immigration judge notified De Alfaro that her removal hearing would be held on March 19, 2009. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a). De Alfaro moved for a continuance on the ground that her attorney had a conflict in his schedule, but the immigration judge did not rule on De Alfaro\u2019s motion before the hearing. De Alfaro did not appear for her removal hearing, and the immigration judge denied De Alfaro\u2019s motion to continue and ordered her removed from the United States <em>in absentia, id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). De Alfa-ro moved to reopen her removal proceedings, but the immigration judge denied the motion. The Board found \u201cappropriate\u201d the decisions of the immigration judge to deny De Alfaro\u2019s motion for a continuance and to order her removed <em>in absentia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">The Board did not abuse its discretion by affirming the denial of De Alfaro\u2019s motion to reopen her removal hearing. De Alfaro\u2019s failure to appear at her removal hearing was not attributable to exceptional circumstances beyond her control. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1). De Alfaro received notice of her removal hearing and, although her attorney could not attend because of a conflict, De Alfaro does not assert that she could not appear at the hearing. De Alfaro argues that she failed to attend at \u201cthe instruction of the staff of her attorney,\u201d but she does not argue that conduct amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1274-75 (11th Cir.2005). De Alfaro failed to present evidence of circumstances so compelling that she would be entitled to reopen her removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">We DENY De Alfaro\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
