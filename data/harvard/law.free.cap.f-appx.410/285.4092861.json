In all, the authorities concluded that he was involved in 29 armed bank robberies. Two grand juries indicted him for, and he pled guilty to, committing the following offenses set out in Title 18 of the U.S.Code: two counts of conspiring to interfere with commerce, in violation of \u00a7 1951; five counts of bank robbery, in violation of \u00a7 2113(a) &amp; (d); five counts of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of \u00a7 924(c); one count of felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court sentenced Hughes to a total of 1524 months\u2019 imprisonment. Specifically, for the two conspiracy counts and the five bank robbery counts, the court imposed sentences of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment. For the count of possession of a firearm by a felon, the court imposed a sentence of 120 months. All of these sentences were ordered to run concurrently with each other. For the five counts of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, the court imposed statutory minimum sentences of 84 months on the first count and 300 months on each of the other four counts, to run consecutively to each other and to the remaining counts of the indictments. Hughes now appeals, presenting several arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">Hughes argues that the district court erred in imposing consecutive, rather than concurrent, sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) for his convictions for using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. We review <em>de novo </em>the question of statutory interpretation his argument presents. <em>United States v. Tate, </em>586 F.3d 936, 946 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>(U.S. Nov. 29, 2010) (No. 09-8888).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">First, Hughes argues that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) prevents the imposition of consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">The relevant provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-14\">Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The subsection then lists mandatory minimum punishments for various specific acts. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). If a firearm is brandished, the minimum term is seven years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). The statute further states: \u201cIn the case of a second or subsequent conviction under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>subsection, the person shall ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i). Moreover, \u201cno term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">In <em>United States v. Tate, </em>586 F.3d 936, 946-47 (11th Cir.2009), we held that the \u201cexcept\u201d clause did not prevent the imposition of consecutive sentences for each of the defendant\u2019s firearm convictions under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See also United States v. Phaknikone, </em>605 F.3d 1099, 1111 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cSection 924 requires consecutive sentences for [defendant\u2019s] convictions under that statute.\u201d). Recently, the Supreme Court agreed, interpreting the \u201cexcept\u201d clause to allow consecutive sentences. <em>Abbott v. United States, </em>562 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 18, 22-31, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010). <em>Abbott </em>held that a defendant is \u201csubject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in \u00a7 924(c), unless another provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by \u00a7 924(c) imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 S.Ct. at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In light of <em>Tate </em>and <em>Abbott, </em>Hughes\u2019s argument regarding the \u201cexcept\u201d clause of \u00a7 924(c) is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Hughes argues that his convictions under \u00a7 924(c) could not be deemed \u201csecond or subsequent,\u201d since the district court accepted his plea of guilty on all counts simultaneously, and, therefore, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993), is inapplicable. Furthermore, Hughes contends that <em>Deal </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The Supreme Court in <em>Deal </em>reasoned that \u201cconviction\u201d means a \u201cfinding of guilt by a judge or jury,\u201d and \u201cfindings of guilt on several counts are necessarily arrived at successively in time.\u201d <em>Deal, </em>508 U.S. at 132-33 &amp; n. 1, 113 S.Ct. at 1996-97 &amp; n. 1. Therefore, multiple convictions in the same prosecution were \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d under \u00a7 924(c), and warranted consecutive sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 131-37, 113 S.Ct. at 1995-99. While <em>Deal </em>does not specifically address guilty pleas, we analyzed \u00a7 924(c) prior to <em>Deal </em>and explained that, while \u201csubsequent\u201d means \u201cfollowing in time, order, or place,\u201d the term \u201csecond\u201d only means \u201cone more after the first, or another or additional conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Rawlings, </em>821 F.2d 1543, 1545 (11th Cir.1987). Therefore, multiple \u00a7 924(c) convictions stemming from the same indictment triggered the enhanced penalty provision. <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that interpreting the statute any differently would lead to \u201cincongruous results,\u201d encouraging prosecutors to bring separate indictments for each \u00a7 924(c) violation in order to secure the enhanced penalty. <em>Id. </em>at 1546.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">Under the interpretation of \u00a7 924(c) advanced in <em>Rawlings, </em>821 F.2d at 1545-46, Hughes\u2019s argument fails. Furthermore, we are bound to follow the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent. Accordingly, the district court committed no error in imposing consecutive 300 months\u2019 sentences for Hughes\u2019s multiple \u00a7 924(c) convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">Hughes contends that his total sentence of 1524 months is substantively unreasonable and is unlawful under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, given his age at the time of sentencing, he would not outlive even his combined mandatory minimum sentences of 107 years, which were imposed for the \u00a7 924(c) violations. Therefore, imposing non-mandatory additional terms for his other counts made the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>sentence \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that one day for the non-mandatory sentences would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">If a party fails to preserve an issue for appeal by making a proper objection, we review the issue for plain error, which requires the appellant to establish \u201c(1) that there was error (2) that was plain; (3) that affected his substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Straub, </em>508 F.3d 1003, 1008 (11th Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), which include the need of the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Other factors to be considered include the nature of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the available sentences, the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 policy statements and applicable Guidelines sentence range, the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). We ordinarily expect a sentence within the sentence range to be reasonable, and remand for resentencing only if the district court committed a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Hughes failed to object to the reasonableness of his total sentence. Specifically, before or during the sentencing hearing, he neither asked for leniency under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) nor for sentences below the Guidelines prescribed sentence range; thus, his claims warrant review only for plain error. Here, the district court committed no error, plain or otherwise, since Hughes failed to show that his sentences, individually or combined, were substantively unreasonable. As reflected in the record, the district court considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reasonably determined that nothing less than sentences within the Guidelines sentence range, as indicated above, would be a sufficient punishment for Hughes\u2019s multiple offenses. Accordingly, the imposition of the sentences at issue did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
