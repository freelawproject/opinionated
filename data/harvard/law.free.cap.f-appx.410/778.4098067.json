Bell states that she is appealing the BIA\u2019s September 2, 2009 dismissal of her appeal and the BIA\u2019s April 22, 2010 denial of her motion for reconsideration. She argues that the immigration judge (IJ) did not apply the proper law and the IJ and BIA did not meaningfully consider her request for cancellation of removal and waiver under \u00a7 1182\u00ae. Bell further contends that the adverse credibility determination that was made in her case is not supported by the record. She also challenges the IJ\u2019s analysis of her income tax statements, arguing through reliance on specific provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that the IJ incorrectly applied tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Because Bell did not file a petition for review from the BIA\u2019s September 2, 2009 dismissal of her appeal, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the arguments that she makes relative to that dismissal. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, this court lacks jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the discretionary relief provisions at issue, except to the extent this appeal involves \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Bell\u2019s arguments essentially consist of challenges to the factual determinations that she was not credible and that she had not established the requisite level of hardship. <em>See Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 306 (5th Cir.2005). To the extent that Bell\u2019s arguments do not present constitutional or legal challenges, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Bell\u2019s arguments. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Moreover, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Bell\u2019s argument that the IJ misinterpreted specific provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, because Bell did not exhaust this issue by presenting it to the BIA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Claudio v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 316, 318 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Further, while this court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Bell\u2019s motion to reconsider its dismissal on \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Bell has failed to show that the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Bell\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
