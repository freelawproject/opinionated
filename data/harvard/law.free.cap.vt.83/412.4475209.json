It is quite apparent that, to sanction tbe signing of a county court writ, it must be in a ease within tbe fair meaning of the statute; if not, tbe process is used against law. Tbe jurisdiction of a justice is limited to -the county in which be lives so it must necessarily follow that if Samuel P. Welch was a duly elected justice within and for tbe County of Caledonia, be bad no authority to issue tbe writ at Barre; if a justice within and for tbe county of Washington, be bad no authority to issue the writ. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>16 Yt. 461; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Grout, 2 </em>Yt. 489; <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>9 Yt. 271; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Town of Richmond, </em>6 Yt. 121; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>State, </em>72 Miss. 960; <em>Atchinson etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>36 Kan. 593; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Thralls, </em>26 Kan. 780; <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>34 Kan. 655; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>McAdams, </em>9 Tex. 542; <em>Learned </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>14 Allen 109; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kellog, </em>17 Wis. 475; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>3 Wis. 736; <em>Crandall </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>20 Wis. 640, 91 Am.
