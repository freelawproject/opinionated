Dec. 82; <em>Morewood </em>v. <em>Wakefield, </em>133 Mass. 240; <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>42 N. H. 373; <em>Julienne </em>v. <em>Mayor etc. of Jackson, </em>69 Miss. 34, 30 Am. St. Rep. 526; <em>Sentell </em>v. <em>New Orleans, etc. R. R. Co., </em>166 U. S. 698; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>72 Vt. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Accordingly, our statute (P. S. 5623) provides that the owner or keeper of a dog shall cause it to be registered, numbered, described and licensed, and to wear a collar distinctly marked with the name of its owner or keeper, and (P. S. 5635) that \u201cany person may, and every police officer and constable shall, kill or cause to be killed\u201d dogs not so licensed and collared \u201cwhenever and wherever found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">These provisions afford a complete defence to this action. The defendant shot the plaintiff\u2019s hounds \u2014 killing one and wounding the other \u2014 which he found attacking a wild deer. The dogs were duly licensed and usually wore lawful collars, but when shot they did not have collars on \u2014 a fact which the defendant observed. The plaintiff had started out with them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>to hunt foxes and had removed their collars, as was his custom when they were on the chase. By so doing, the plaintiff exposed them to the penalty provided for uncollared and therefore unprotected dogs. The provisions of the statute are drastic, but they are plain and positive, and the consequences of a noncompliance therewith are distinctly specified, and nothing short of a strict, if not literal compliance will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">These views find sufficient support in the following cases, all of which were tort actions for killing dogs: <em>Morewood </em>V. <em>Wakefield, 'supra. </em>The Massachusetts statute required dogs to be licensed and collared, and provided that \u201cany person may, and every police officer or constable shall, kill or cause to be killed all\u201d dogs not licensed and collared \u201cwhenever and where-ever found.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s dog was duly licensed, but his neck was so large and his head so small that he could not wear a collar. While without a collar, he was- shot and killed by the defendant. It was held-that there could be no recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\"><em>Moore </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>191 Mass. 56, arose under the same statute. The plaintiff\u2019s dog was duly licensed and when killed by the defendant wore a collar with its owner\u2019s name distinctly marked thereon. But the number on the collar was not the dog\u2019s correct registered number \u2014 the requirement of the statute being that the owner should cause the dog to wear a collar marked with the owner\u2019s name and the dog\u2019s registered number. It was held that there could be no recovery, and a judgment ordered for the defendant was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\"><em>Morey </em>v. <em>Brown, supra. </em>The statute of New Hampshire provided that no person should be liable for killing a dog found without a collar with its owner\u2019s name carved or engraved thereon. The plaintiff\u2019s dog, when killed by the defendant, wore a collar on which was engraved only the initials of the owner\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cJ. P. M.\u201d It was held that there was no liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">It is argued that the defendant cannot justify under the statute, since the agreed statement shows that he shot the dogs to save the life of the deer. But the defendant\u2019s motive was immaterial. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Mills, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and judgment for the defendant to recover his costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
