We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">Petitioner is a former air traffic controller who was removed from employment with the FAA based on charges of participating in the 1981 strike against the United States, in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7311, and absence without leave. In 1984, he applied for employment with the FAA. The parties have stipulated that OPM determined that he was not suitable for employment solely because (1) he belongs to a class of individuals discharged for their participation in the strike; and (2) OPM interpreted a Presidential directive as indefinitely barring from reemployment with the FAA all controllers discharged as a result of the strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">This court addressed an essentially identical factual situation in a recent class action case, <em>Wagner v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>783 F.2d 1042 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 3276, 91 L.Ed.2d 566 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-13\">After the strike, the President issued a directive to the Director of OPM stating that those former federal employees who had been discharged for participating in the strike \u201cshould not be deemed suitable for employment with the Federal Aviation Administration.\u201d 17 Weekly Comp, of Pres. Doc. 1364 (Dec. 9, 1981). The petitioners in <em>Wagner </em>argued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIcD\">(A) that OPM incorrectly interpreted the presidential directive as imposing an indefinite ban upon the employment by the [Federal Aviation] Administration of the former controllers, and (B) that if the presidential directive did impose such a ban, it was illegal because it was inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7311, which the petitioners interpret as barring strikers from federal employment for only three years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1043-14\"><em>Wagner, </em>783 F.2d at 1044. With regard to the first issue, the court upheld OPM\u2019s interpretation as imposing an indefinite ban. <em>Id. </em>at 1045. With regard to the second issue, the court examined the language of the statute and the legislative history, and concluded that \u201cCongress meant exactly what it said \u2014 that persons who participated in a strike against the government are barred indefinitely from employment in the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-15\">Korte opted out of the Wagner class and now attempts to distinguish the <em>Wagner </em>holding on constitutional grounds. He argues on appeal that the determination of his unsuitability is unconstitutional because it (1) deprives him of liberty and property rights without the procedural protection required by the Due Process Clause; (2) adopts an irrebuttable presumption violative of the Due Process Clause in that it has no rational relation to any legitimate government interest; and (3) violates the Bill of Attainder Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-16\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-17\">What Korte does not challenge is the constitutionality of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7311 (1982) (the statute), which reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>An individual may not accept or hold a position in the Government of the United States ... if he \u2014 ... (3) participates in a strike ... against the Government of the United States____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">Neither at the Board nor in his briefs to this court does he attack the statute itself, and in response to a question from the panel during oral argument his counsel confirmed that even if the statute imposed a permanent bar to future employment it would not be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">In a memorandum opinion, the Supreme Court has affirmed a judgment that the statute is constitutionally sound. <em>United Federation of Postal Clerks v. Blount, </em>404 U.S. 802, 92 S.Ct. 80, 30 L.Ed.2d 38 (1971), <em>aff'g </em>325 F.Supp. 879 (D.D.C.1971). The district court held that the statute did not violate any constitutional rights of those employees who were members of the plaintiffs union. 325 F.Supp. at 885. The district court also stated that \u201cit is not irrational or arbitrary for the Government to condition employment on a promise not to withhold labor collectively, and to prohibit strikes by those in public employment.\u201d 325 F.Supp. at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">Similarly, we believe it is not irrational or arbitrary for the government to prohibit reemployment of discharged employees who participated in a strike against the government, and that is just what the statute does. \u201c[Pjersons who participated in a strike against the government are barred indefinitely from employment in the government.\u201d <em>Wagner, </em>783 F.2d at 1046. \u201c[A] worker may not hold a government position if the individual has participated in a strike against the government.\u201d <em>American Postal Workers v. United States Postal Service, </em>682 F.2d 1280, 1283 (9th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">Conceding, as he must, that the statute does not limit the period of debarment, Korte relies on 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.303 for his assertion of a period of debarment limited to three years. In its entirety, that regulation reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-8\">When a person is disqualified for any reason named in \u00a7 731.202, OPM, in its discretion, may deny that person examination for and appointment to a competitive position for a period of not more than 3 years from the date of determination of disqualification. On expiration of the period of debarment, the person who has been debarred may not be appointed to any position in the competitive service until his fitness for appointment has been redetermined by OPM.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">Among the many reasons for disqualification listed in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.202(b) is \u201c[a]ny statutory disqualification which makes the individual unfit for the service.\u201d Section 7311 is such a statutory disqualification. As the parties stipulated, OPM determined he was not suitable for employment on the basis of that statutory disqualification and the President\u2019s directive \u2014 he belongs to a class of individuals discharged for their participation in the strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">Korte\u2019s implicit argument that OPM\u2019s action was contrary to its own regulation is beside the point because OPM was not acting on its own authority and exercising its own discretion; rather it was acting under the express direction of the President. Even assuming, arguendo, that the indefinite statutory bar was limited to three years by the regulation, the President\u2019s directive overrode or superseded that regulation and imposed an indefinite ban on the class of which Korte was a member. As the government properly argues, OPM\u2019s role in the suitability determination was limited to executing the President\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-11\">On the factual record in this case, it is our view that OPM properly determined that he was disqualified. The statute is constitutionally sound and OPM\u2019s action was in accord with the statute and the President\u2019s directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-12\">I DUE PROCESS A</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-13\">Korte asserts that he had constitutionally protected liberty and property in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>terests of which he was deprived in violation of the Due Process Clause. Citing <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), Korte urges this court to adopt a balancing test and to declare OPM\u2019s action constitutionally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">We note that the Supreme Court recently stated that it has \u201cnever held that applicants for benefits, as distinct from those already receiving them, have a legitimate claim of entitlement protected by the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Lyng v. Payne, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 106 S.Ct. 2333, at 2343, 90 L.Ed.2d 921 (1986). Nevertheless assuming, without deciding, that he had constitutionally protected property and liberty interests, and even assuming those interests were \u201cterminated,\u201d we are not persuaded that the Due Process Clause was violated. Korte was afforded what the Supreme Court has declared are the \u201cessential requirements of due process, ... notice and an opportunity to respond.\u201d <em>Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, -, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). Because Korte was entitled to a full administrative hearing, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 731.401(a), 1201.24(c), and judicial review, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(a)(1), it was constitutionally permissible for a pretermination hearing to be \u201can initial. check against mistaken decisions.\u201d <em>Loudermill, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">Here, the facts are not disputed. Korte admitted participating in the strike. Yet he asserts that OPM should have evaluated his application more fully by considering the factors enumerated in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.-202(c), <em>e.g., </em>nature and seriousness of the conduct, contributing social or environmental conditions, and rehabilitation. It may thus appear that he is only asserting a \u201cmeaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker,\u201d <em>Loudermill, </em>105 S.Ct. at 1494, but actually he is arguing that \u201cthe decisionmaker should be lenient and depart from legal requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n. 8. The government properly argues that once it was determined that Korte was removed from his air traffic controller position for strike participation, \u201cthere was no need for further investigation as the President\u2019s directive was then controlling.\u201d This court has held that the Presidential directive \u201cexplicitly imposed an indefinite ban upon the employment of striking controllers by the [FAA].\u201d <em>Wagner, </em>783 F.2d at 1044. Because this ban, this rule, \"was expressly mandated by the President, \u201cwe might presume that any interest which might rationally be served by the rule did in fact give rise to its adoption.\u201d <em>Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, </em>426 U.S. 88, 103, 96 S.Ct. 1895, 1905, 48 L.Ed.2d 495 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">When Korte appealed to the Board, he wrote that \u201c[o]n December 8, 1984, I received final notice that I had been determined unsuitable.\u201d He had earlier been put on notice of the basis for OPM\u2019s ultimate decision and he had the opportunity to respond. Korte relates that during the summer of 1984 he \u201cprepared the necessary application form to take the [controller] examination,\u201d albeit less some supplementary materials. By letter dated August 30, 1984, the FAA notified him that OPM had decided he was unsuitable, citing the President\u2019s 1981 directive. Korte then sent letters, dated September 5, 1984, to both the FAA and OPM \u201cwhich, among other things, (1) enclosed my complete application for consideration in reaching a final suitability determination.\u201d Korte states that in response to that letter, \u201cOPM acknowledged receipt of my complete application but nevertheless confirmed its earlier action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">It is thus evident that Korte was afforded notice and an opportunity to respond. His assertion of a procedural Due Process Clause violation is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-15\">\u25a0 [5] Korte also argues that the indefinite debarment announced in the Presidential directive has no rational relation to any legitimate government interest. We do not agree. At the very least, the statute <em>authorizes </em>the indefinite debarment of the discharged controllers. Under the statute, just as the government may \u201ccondition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>employment on a promise not to withhold labor collectively, and [may] prohibit strikes by those in public employment,\u201d <em>United Federation of Postal Clerks v. Blount, </em>325 F.Supp. 879, 883 (D.D.C.), <em>aff'd, </em>404 U.S. 802, 92 S.Ct. 80, 30 L.Ed.2d 38 (1971), so it may condition reemployment and may prohibit the reemployment of those who participated in a strike against the government. As stated in his directive, the President determined that permitting discharged controllers to return to the FAA would be detrimental both to the efficiency of the FAA's operations and to the safe and effective performance of the nation\u2019s air traffic control system. The President\u2019s directive does bear a rational relationship to the statutory bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">II BILL OF ATTAINDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">A bill of attainder has been described by the Supreme Court as \u201ca law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.\u201d <em>Selective Service v. Minnesota Public Interest Research Group, </em>468 U.S. 841, 846-47, 104 S.Ct. 3348, 3350, 82 L.Ed.2d 632 (1984) (quoting <em>Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, </em>433 U.S. 425, 468, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 2803, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Korte argues that \u201c[a]ccording to the Board\u2019s interpretation of the President\u2019s Memorandum, on December 9, 1981, President Reagan imposed retroactively a new, additional sanction on the discharged controllers never before imposed upon them or any other Federal employees discharged for striking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">At the outset, we note that even if the President\u2019s directive imposed a new or additional sanction, the directive would not violate the constitutional proscription against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. The sanction imposed is civil, not criminal, and from \u201cearliest times,\u201d the Supreme Court has construed the <em>ex post facto </em>provision to apply only to criminal laws. <em>Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, </em>342 U.S. 580, 594, 72 S.Ct. 512, 521, 96 L.Ed. 586 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">Regarding his bill of attainder contention, neither the Presidential directive nor the statute established Korte\u2019s \u201cguilt.\u201d As OPM argues, his \u201cguilt\u201d was established when he was found to be a strike participant as a result of an adjudicative determination which included a proceeding at the agency level, a proceeding before the Board\u2019s regional office, and an appeal to the full Board, each of which was subject to judicial review. In reply, Korte asserts that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1046-9\">OPM ignores one of the crucial issues on this appeal. The determination of Mr. Korte\u2019s participation in the strike did not constitute a finding that Mr. Korte could never be suitable for FAA service again and did not effect an indefinite debarment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">That assertion is meritless because the determination that he participated in the strike necessarily resulted in an indefinite debarment \u2014 the statute is an \u201cabsolute prohibition against employment by strikers.\u201d <em>Wagner, </em>783 F.2d at 1045. Furthermore, in the course of that determination, \u201cthe safeguards of a judicial trial,\u201d <em>United States v. Lovett, </em>328 U.S. 303, 316, 66 S.Ct. 1073, 1079, 90 L.Ed. 1252 (1946), were provided: for example, he had the right to be represented by counsel, he was clearly informed of the charge against him, the law he was charged with violating had been passed before he committed the act charged, and he was confronted by the witnesses against him. <em>Id. </em>at 317-18, 66 S.Ct. at 1079-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">Moreover, the Bill of Attainder Clause was intended \u201cas an implementation of the separation of powers, a general safeguard against legislative exercise of the judicial function, or more simply \u2014 trial by legislature.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>381 U.S. 437, 442, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 1711, 14 L.Ed.2d 484 (1965). The clause is a limitation on the authority of the legislative branch. <em>Id. </em>at 443-46, 85 S.Ct. at 1712-13. Korte has cited no authority, and we are aware of none, holding that the clause applies to the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">Korte\u2019s other arguments are controlled by <em>Wagner, </em>which was issued after he filed his initial brief. As to the former controllers who applied for non-FAA positions, whether the President\u2019s directive constitutes an action in the nature of an amnesty, reprieve, or pardon within the meaning of Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution is an issue we need not and do not address.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
