After a six-month hiatus, Biomedical sued Cordis, in a commonwealth court, claiming that Cordis violated the Puerto Rico Dealers\u2019 Contracts Act, 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278 <em>et seq. </em>\u2014 a statute that (as relevant here) forbids a manufacturer from ending its business relation with a distributor unless there is \u201cjust cause\u201d for doing so. 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278a. Cordis, a Florida corporation, removed the case to federal district court; and, that court, after appropriate discovery, granted Cordis\u2019 motion for summary judgment. 604 F.Supp. 582. Biomedical appeals the court\u2019s decision, claiming that the record shows a \u201cgenuine\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d issue of fact, the resolution of which requires a trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">The reason that the district court granted Cordis\u2019 motion is that Biomedical failed to pay Cordis\u2019 bills on time. Biomedical\u2019s contract with Cordis allowed it ninety days for payment, but Biomedical typically and continuously ran an overdue (beyond ninety days) balance owed of as much as $30,000. The district court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-11\">When a dealer consistently owes the principal considerable amounts of money and does not timely pay them so that there is a balance of over $18,000 extending over a period of two years before termination, and being payment of the amounts due one of the principal, if not the most important, reason for entering any contract, we hold that the dealer did not perform one of the essential obligations of the dealer\u2019s contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">In our view, however, the matter is not so simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">The district court is clearly right about Puerto Rico\u2019s law. To cut off Biomedical, Cordis must have \u201cjust cause,\u201d and \u201cjust cause\u201d (insofar as relevant here) means \u201cnonperformance of any of the <em>essential </em>obligations of the dealer\u2019s contract.\u201d 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278(d) (emphasis added). The court is also right, as a general matter, that consistent failure to pay on time likely violates an \u201cessential obligation.\u201d But, here there are special circumstances. That is to say, Biomedical argues that the history of its dealings with Cordis makes clear that its duty to pay on time, while an obligation, was not an \u201cessential\u201d obligation of its contract. And, it presents enough evidence to raise a genuine factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">First, Biomedical points to evidence in the record suggesting that Cordis\u2019 decision to terminate had little to do with overdue balances; rather, it rested upon Cordis\u2019 view that Biomedical had not done enough to promote Cordis\u2019 products. Cordis\u2019 termination letter focuses almost exclusively upon Biomedical\u2019s performance. (It mentions Biomedical\u2019s credit history as well, but refers to it as a \u201ccontributing factor.\u201d) Of course, poor performance might also amount to \u201cjust cause,\u201d either because it breaches an \u201cessential obligation\u201d or because it satisfies an alternative branch of the statutory definition of \u201cjust cause,\u201d namely, \u201cany action or omission\u201d on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>dealer\u2019s part that \u201cadversely and substantially affects\u201d the manufacturer\u2019s interests in \u201cpromoting the marketing or distribution of the merchandise.\u201d 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278(d). But, the parties agree for purposes of this appeal, that the \u201cpoor performance\u201d charge raises triable issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Second, Biomedical says that both it and Cordis understood that overdue balances (at least in the amounts at issue) would not constitute grounds for terminating their relationship. Biomedical submitted affidavits from its own president, Miguel Arrieta, and Cordis\u2019 former regional sales manager, Gregory Velez. Arrieta says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">Cordis represented and warranted to Biomedical that the cash limitation of Biomedical would never be a detrimental factor in their relationship ... [t]hat as a matter of fact, every time there were outstanding invoices not paid by Biomedical ... Cordis would accomodate Biomedical through either payments or extension of their credit line consistent with the original agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Velez says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">[T]he credit situation between Biomedical and Cordis was never a fact considered as detrimental to the relationship between Biomedical and Cordis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Third, Biomedical points to the history of its credit relationship with Cordis \u2014 a history that begins soon after Biomedical and Cordis began their relationship in May 1980. We reproduce the relevant account in the Appendix. That account shows that Biomedical consistently owed Cordis a significant amount of money, and for more than ninety days. But, it also shows that Biomedical had reduced that overdue balance significantly \u2014 from about $32,000 to about $11,000 by the beginning of December 1983 when Cordis wrote its termination letter. This history, of course, shows that Biomedical\u2019s payments were late. But it also helps to substantiate Biomedical\u2019s claim that overdue balances in these amounts were not a matter of serious concern to the parties, that Cordis understood that Biomedical\u2019s financial position might prevent timely payments, and, that Biomedical\u2019s obligation to pay these sums on time was not \u201cessential\u201d to the manufacturer-distributor relationship. The testimony of Velez, Arrieta and possibly others should help the district court evaluate the significance of this account record.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">To repeat the main point: this evidence taken together viewed in the light most favorable to Biomedical, <em>Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, </em>368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S.Ct. 486, 491, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962); <em>Hahn v. Sargent, </em>523 F.2d 461, 464 (1st Cir.1975), raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not the parties considered Biomedical\u2019s failure to make timely payments \u201cessential,\u201d within the terms of 10 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 278(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Biomedical also points out that the federal district court dissolved an <em>ex parte </em>injunction that the commonwealth court had issued before Cordis removed this case to federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1450. It says that the federal court erred in doing so. The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that when a case is removed to federal district court, that court <em>must </em>dissolve any <em>ex parte </em>state court injunction or temporary restraining order \u2014 once the maximum time limits that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b) authorizes for an <em>ex parte </em>order have expired. <em>Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Brotherhood of Teamsters and Auto Truck Drivers, Local No. 70, </em>415 U.S. 423, 439-40, 94 S.Ct. 1113, 1124, 39 L.Ed.2d 435 (1974); <em>Aybar v. F. &amp; B. Manufacturing Co., </em>498 F.Supp. 1184, 1186 (D.P.R.1980). Rule 65\u2019s time limits have long since expired here. Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(b) <em>(ex parte </em>orders must expire by their terms within 10 days of entry). Hence, the district court properly dissolved the commonwealth court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Since we find that Biomedical has raised a genuine issue of material fact, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b93-34\">\u2018Average amount past due (over 90 days) up to date of termination: $18,242,00</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
