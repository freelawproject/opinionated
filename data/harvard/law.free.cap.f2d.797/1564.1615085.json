Glaros (Glaros) appeals from the grant of partial summary judgment to H.H. Robertson Company (Robertson), holding claims 1 and 3 of Glaros\u2019 patent<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> invalid for obviousness. <em>Glaros v. H.H. Robertson Company and Inryco, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>600 F.Supp. 342, 224 USPQ 1037 (N.D.Ill.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-22\">In No. 85-2641, Robertson appeals from the judgment entered on a jury verdict that claim 2 of Glaros\u2019 patent is not invalid and was willfully infringed, and from the denial of Robertson\u2019s motions for JNOV and for a new trial. <em>Glaros v. H.H. Robertson, </em>615 F.Supp. 186, 227 USPQ 448 (N.D.Ill.1985). Robertson also asks this court to reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number>the district court\u2019s refusal to grant it summary judgment holding Claim 2 invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-4\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-6\">\n<em>(a) Summary Judgment on Claims 1 and 3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-7\">On May 7, 1979, Glaros sued Robertson for infringement of claims 1, 2, and 3 of his \u2018844 patent on a prefabricated structural panel. Robertson moved for summary judgment, alleging that the claimed inventions were anticipated or would have been obvious. The then-assigned judge denied the motion. After extensive discovery, Robertson renewed the motion before Judge Hart, to whom the case had been reassigned, alleging obviousness and relying largely on the deposition testimony of Glaros\u2019 expert, Dr. Larry D. Luttrell (Luttrell).</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-8\">On November 14, 1984, Judge Hart, having explained in a thorough and carefully crafted opinion the reasons for doing so, granted partial summary judgment, declaring claims 1 and 3 invalid for obviousness, and reserving the validity of claim 2 for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-9\">Judge Hart followed carefully the decisional guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 693, 15 L.Ed.2d 545, 148 USPQ 459, 467 (1966), and in eleven of this court\u2019s opinions following and applying those guidelines. He adhered also to the need for determining the presence or absence of genuine issues of material fact, to the requirement that Glaros be given the benefit of inferences, and to the statute, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282, requiring that each claim be separately considered. The court determined that Robertson had established the absence of factual dispute on the relationship of the prior art to the inventions set forth in claims 1 and 3, but had not established absence of factual disputes on the relationship of that prior art to the invention set forth in claim 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1641-14\">\n<em>(b) The Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-15\">At a pretrial conference, Robertson moved for exclusion of Luttrell as a witness, on the ground that he was not skilled in the art and thus not an expert. Glaros acceded to the motion and the court excluded Luttrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-16\">On March 13, 1985, after a two-week trial, the jury returned its verdict in the form of answers to interrogatories, saying that claim 2 was not invalid and was willfully infringed by Robertson. Robertson\u2019s motions for JNOV and for new trial were denied. The court accompanied its denial of the motion for JNOV with a complete review of the jury\u2019s findings, the evidence, and Robertson\u2019s contentions, again in light of the guidelines in <em>Graham </em>and in twelve of this court\u2019s opinions, including a number involving review of jury verdicts in response to motions for JNOV under Fed. R.Civ.P. 50(b). The court found without merit the argument that a new trial was required. Having then gone on to enter its own findings and conclusions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court enjoined further infringement and reserved the questions of damages, costs, and attorney fees until the accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-17\">\n<em>(c) The Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-18\">The details of this fortunately unique litigation are set forth in the trial court\u2019s opinions reported as above indicated. We deal on these appeals with only the facts relating to our resolution of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>The proceedings below and these appeals would play better in a tragicomic theatre of the bizarre. Trial counsel succeeded in creating a muddled procedural puddle in the trial court, where the parties effectively engaged in two legal contests, each prevailing in one and losing in the other. Each has then tried on appeal, in briefs containing mischaracterizations of the law and the events below, to use the victory in one as a means of converting the loss to victory in the other*.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-4\">Before the trial court, Robertson first asserted the lack of qualifications of Glares\u2019 expert, then, as above indicated, relied on that expert to support summary judgment, then moved to exclude that expert from the trial for lack of qualifications, and Glares, having designated that same person as an expert, acceded to his own expert\u2019s exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-5\">Disregarding the differences between a partial summary judgment proceeding and a trial, Robertson says on appeal that the former established \u201claw of the case\u201d in the latter and Glares says the latter requires reopening of the former and should be the \u201claw of the case\u201d in the reopened former. Robertson says the trial should be totally disregarded and the summary judgment modified to include invalidity of claim 2. Neither side can bring itself to fully recognize or abide by the statutory command, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282, that claims must be separately and independently considered. The law is not a sport where winning has been called everything, and neither a trial nor an appeal should be only an exercise in gamesmanship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1642-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-7\">(1) Whether the district court erred in granting Robertson partial summary judgment holding claims 1 and 3 invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-9\">(2) Whether the district court erred in denying Robertson\u2019s motion for JNOV holding claim 2 invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-10\">(3) Whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Robertson\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-11\">(4) Whether this court may entertain Robertson\u2019s argument that the district court should have granted it summary judgment holding claim 2 invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-12\">(5) Whether either party is entitled to costs and attorney fees incurred on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-13\">Appeal No. 85-2573</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-14\">\n<em>(1) The Partial Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ADY\">Glares contends that because: (a) his expert Luttrell, whose testimony was substantially relied on in the grant of summary judgment, was later excluded from the trial; and (b), the Pimsner patent was later found (Glares says) not \u201crelevant\u201d by the jury, the trial court should now be instructed to vacate its partial summary judgment and set for trial the validity and infringement of claims 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-15\">One appealing the grant of summary judgment, including a partial summary judgment, must show that the district court erred in determining that, on \u201cthe pleadings and the evidence before it,\u201d there was no genuine issue of material fact, and that the movant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See SRI International v. Matsushita Electric Corp. of America, </em>775 F.2d 1107, 1116, 227 USPQ 577, 581-82 (Fed.Cir.1985) <em>(in banc); Martin v. Barber, </em>755 F.2d 1564, 1566, 225 USPQ 233 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-16\">In granting partial summary judgment, the trial court indicated that Glares had submitted no evidence that a genuine issue of material fact existed in relation to the obviousness of claims 1 and 3. To succeed on appeal, Glares must show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>he did submit such evidence <em>before </em>summary judgment was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-4\">Luttrell was Glaros\u2019 expert. Robertson\u2019s earlier objections must now be seen as having been subsumed in Robertson\u2019s reliance on Luttrell\u2019s testimony in support of its second motion for summary judgment. Thus, <em>at the time summary judgment was granted, </em>there was no genuine issue of material fact as to Luttrell\u2019s expertise.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence Glaros\u2019 reliance on Luttrell\u2019s subsequent change of status is unavailing. That Glaros joined in effecting that change is of interest only for its demonstration of Glaros\u2019 poor grace in attempting now to rely on his own failed strategy. <em>See Litton Industrial Products, Inc. v. Solid State Systems Corp., 755 </em>F.2d 158, 163, 225 USPQ 34, 37 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-5\">Glaros\u2019 notion that he can undo the grant of summary judgment against him by thereafter agreeing that his expert was not qualified is grotesque. To give losers of partial summary judgment adjudications that weapon would gravely diminish the usefulness of partial summary judgments in expediting litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-6\">Before us, Glaros avers that \u201c[tjhere was a factual dispute as to the relevancy of the prior Pimsner patent\u201d because \u201c[bjoth Judge Hart and the jury, after more than two weeks at trial were convinced as to the nonrelevancy of the Pimsner patent.\u201d The argument self-destructs on the rocks of chronology. Glaros attempts to give a retroactive effect to the jury verdict, using it in an effort to create a genuine issue of material fact at the time the court was considering Robertson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. That Glaros cannot do. The time at which he was required to establish existence of a genuine issue of material fact was long past when the trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-11\">Further, Glaros misstates the record. The jury determined that Pimsner was not <em>\u201cmore pertinent </em>to claim 2\u201d than the art cited by the examiner. (Emphasis added.) The jury did <em>not </em>find that Pimsner was \u201cnot relevant.\u201d Further, the jury was not considering claims 1 and 3. Thus, if it were otherwise appropriate to use the jury finding <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>that use would not necessarily create a factual dispute on the pertinency of Pimsner to claims 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-12\">Glaros also improperly argues before this court that Pimsner should not have had the effect he says it did in the grant of summary judgment, because it \u201cdoes not disclose or refer to the \u2018art of insulating building panels.\u2019 \u201d We may not and will not decide the summary judgment motion <em>de novo. </em>In its summary judgment opinion the district court noted that \u201cGlaros has chosen to rely almost exclusively upon ... secondary considerations in his opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion.\u201d 600 F.Supp. at 344, 224 USPQ at 1038. The trial court also correctly noted that Glaros \u201cfailed to direct the Court to any <em>evidence </em>that the Pimsner patent is not relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345 n. 2, 224 USPQ at 1039 n. 2 (emphasis in the original). Glaros\u2019 effort to create an issue of fact now on Pimsner\u2019s relevancy to claims 1 and 3 is a dollar short and a day late.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>Thus the subsequent agreement of Robertson and Glaros that Luttrell was not qualified, and the jury\u2019s subsequent finding that Pimsner was not invalidating prior art for claim 2, are simply irrelevant to review of the grant of partial summary judgment on claims 1 and 3. Because that agreement and finding were not in existence at the time summary judgment was rendered, the scope and teachings of the prior art in relation to claims 1 and 3 were not in dispute when summary judgment was rendered, and they cannot by this court be placed in dispute retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-4\">Moreover, unlike the parties on appeal, the trial court considered more than Luttrell\u2019s testimony and the Pimsner patent in finding the absence of a genuine issue of material fact relating to the obviousness of claims 1 and 3, and, again unlike the parties on appeal, the district court properly noted the differences in the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-5\">Rule 56(d) requires the trial court to look only at the evidence and pleadings before it at the time it renders judgment under the Rule. It did precisely that here, and did so thoroughly. The partial summary judgment, incorporated in the final judgment and holding claims 1 and 3 invalid, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-6\">Appeal No. 85-2641</p>\n<p id=\"ARv\">\n<em>(2) Denial of Motion for JNOV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ArF\">A court may overturn a jury verdict only if the jury\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence, <em>Envirotech v. Al George, Inc., </em>730 F.2d 753, 760, 221 USPQ 473, 477 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Railroad Dynamics, Inc. v. A. Stucki Co., </em>727 F.2d 1506, 220 USPQ 929 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 871, 105 S.Ct. 220, 83 L.Ed.2d 150 (1984), or if its legal conclusions cannot be supported by the facts it properly found. <em>See Connell v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>722 F.2d 1542, 1547-48, 220 USPQ 193, 198 (Fed.Cir.1983).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1644-10\">\n<em>(a) Validity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-11\">The jury answered special interrogatories on validity. Interrogatory 2 is at issue here:</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-12\">2. Are the following prior art references more \u201cpertinent\u201d (as that word is defined in these instructions) to Claim 2 of the Glaros patent than the references cited in the Patent Trademark [sic] Office during the prosecution of the Glaros patent application?</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-13\">YES NO</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-14\">a. United States Letters Patent No.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-15\">2,047,154 to Pimsner. _ X</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-16\">The jury marked the space \u201cNO\u201d for each of the nine references submitted to it. The court stated, and the parties agree, that the jury was correctly instructed on the terms \u201cprior art\u201d and \u201cpertinent\u201d prior art. The court also instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he <em>following prior art </em>was not before the Patent &amp; Trademark Office during the prosecution of the Glaros patent application: The Letters Patent to Pimsner____\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Witnesses referred to Pimsner as prior art throughout the trial and counsel for both sides referred to Pimsner as prior art in their closing arguments to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-18\">Robertson devotes the majority of each of its briefs to an insistence that the jury \u201cthought\u201d the Pimsner patent was \u201cnot relevant prior art\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It relies primarily on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>this query transmitted by the jury to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1645-5\">Although we do not feel Pimsner should be cited as prior art, we do recognize that it has a double tongue-and-groove. With that in mind, would it be inconsistent to cite Pimsner in response to 3A.?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1645-6\">Interrogatory 3 was: \u201cWith respect to Claim 2 of the Glaros Patent, do any of the prior art references disclose or suggest the following elements?\u201d The interrogatory then went on to list a claim element in Interrogatory 3A and another elaim element in Interrogatory 3B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-7\">The district court, noting the jury\u2019s answer to Interrogatory 2, said \u201cthe jury found that the references listed were <em>not </em>more pertinent to Claim 2 of the Glaros patent than the references cited in the Patent and Trademark Office during the prosecution of the Glaros patent application. These findings are supported by credible evidence.\u201d 615 F.Supp. at 188, 227 USPQ at 449 (emphasis in the original). Though the court at various points indicated that the jury \u201cdetermined that Pimsner is not within the relevant prior art.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 227 USPQ at 449, the key statement of the court was: \u201cHaving heard the evidence, the Court concludes that the jury was entirely correct in rejecting Pimsner as pertinent prior art governing Claim 2.\u201d That the court may have used other phrases in the course of its opinion cannot support Robertson\u2019s argument that the jury believed Pimsner was \u201cnot prior art at all,\u201d because neither those words nor that concept can be attributed to the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1645-8\">Robertson\u2019s reliance on the jury\u2019s query fails because it ignores the interrogatory to which the query relates and the entirety of the query itself. The individual claim element listed in Interrogatory 3A was a \u201cdouble tongue and groove side edge where the tongue of one panel member is spaced from the groove of the other panel member forming an offset portion.\u201d The jury\u2019s query noted that Pimsner \u201chas a double tongue and groove.\u201d Having Interrogatory 2 before it, to which as we now know it had already answered \u201cNo\u201d, the jury was merely asking whether, because Pimsner should not be \u201ccited\u201d, as that word is used in Interrogatory 2, Pimsner should be listed in answer to Interrogatory 3A because it disclosed a \u201cdouble tongue and groove.\u201d The court correctly and without objection answered the query, indicating that only those references found more pertinent in answering Interrogatory 2 were \u201crelevant\u201d to the jury\u2019s role in answering of Interrogatories 3A and 3B. Thus the word \u201crelevant\u201d did not mean relevant to the claimed invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-12\">Robertson concedes that the jury was fully instructed on the term \u201cprior art,\u201d and there is no reason to believe that the jury did not understand the definition. Pimsner was at all times described on all sides as prior art. Pimsner is listed in Interrogatory 2 itself as among \u201cthe following prior art references.\u201d It is included in the \u201cprior art references\u201d the jury was required to review in answering Interrogatory 3A. Taken in context, as it must be, the jury\u2019s query was a reasonable shorthand or lay manner of asking whether Pimsner should be listed in response to Interrogatory 3A just because it \u201chas a double tongue and groove.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-13\">Robertson attacks the jury\u2019s finding that its infringing product enjoyed commercial success, but ignores the finding that Gla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>ros\u2019 product enjoyed commercial success. Robertson attacks the jury\u2019s determination that it failed to carry its burden of establishing invalidity under \u00a7 103 by re-casting that determination as an improper \u201cfinding of validity.\u201d Robertson exhibits no recognition of the presumption of validity, \u00a7 282, or that it had the burden imposed by \u00a7 282. It makes no real effort to show that it <em>did </em>carry that burden by clear and convincing evidence at trial. These and other arguments presented by Robertson in relation to validity of claim 2 have been thoroughly considered and found without merit in light of the trial record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-4\">The district court did not err in denying the motion for JNOV in respect of the validity of claim 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-5\">\n<em>(b) Infringement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-6\">Robertson\u2019s attack on the jury verdict of infringement is equally without merit, virtually ignoring what occurred at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-7\">First, Robertson improperly attacks the jury instructions on claim interpretation and infringement. Having failed to object to those instructions before the jury retired, Robertson is precluded from assigning them as error on appeal. Fed.R. Civ.P. 51.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1646-8\">Second, Robertson says there was not substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict on infringement, and goes on to present the merits of its own argument for non-infringement. In citing only the testimony of its own witness, and deprecating that of Glaros, while ignoring the court\u2019s statement that the verdict was supported by Glaros\u2019 credible testimony, Robertson is simply wrong. The jury was presented with days of testimony and exhibits going to the prosecution history, the claim, the specification, and the product accused as an infringement. The district court correctly noted, in deciding Robertson\u2019s motion for JNOV, that \u201ca reasonable jury could find that both the tongue and fastener of the accused panels fall within the scope of claim 2____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-12\">The jury was likewise presented with substantial evidence from which it could have correctly found Robertson\u2019s infringement willful. The impeachment of its witnesses, the absence of any evidence of a good-faith belief that it was not infringing, and the nature of its own documents formed a fully adequate basis for the jury\u2019s finding of willfulness.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1646-13\">As the district court noted, there is simply no basis on which it could substitute a judgment of non-infringement for the judgment to be entered on the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying the motion for JNOV in respect of the infringement of claim 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-14\">\n<em>(3) Motion for New Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-15\">Robertson moved for a new trial on the primary ground that the district court\u2019s exclusion of certain evidence constituted error requiring a new trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court did not abuse its discretion under Fed.R.Evid. 403, in excluding that evidence as prejudicial, confusing, and cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-16\">Robertson\u2019s \u201cevidence\u201d consisted of other patent applications and other patents, all with claims differing in language and scope from claim 2, a patent application declaration of one Welsh, Robertson\u2019s patent on the accused product, and an interference between the parties. Introduction of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>evidence would have injected frolics and detours and would have required introduction of counter-evidence, all likely to create side issues that would have unduly distracted the jury from the main issues. <em>See </em>C. McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 185, at 439 (2d ed. 1972) and cases cited. Trial courts have the right and duty to manage proceedings before them to insure both expedition and fairness, and must be granted a wide discretion in carrying out that duty. Here the trial court\u2019s exercise of its responsibility under Rule 403 was exemplary in all respects. Robertson has shown no prejudice to its case and no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion in excluding evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-5\">\n<em>(k) Denial of Summary Judgment on Claim 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-6\">Robertson asks this court to decide that the district court improperly determined that genuine issues of material fact were present when it denied summary judgment of invalidity of claim 2. We cannot do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-7\">A Rule 56(d) order <em>granting </em>partial summary judgment from which no immediate appeal lies is <em>merged </em>into the final judgment and reviewable on appeal from that final judgment. <em>Aaro, Inc. v. Daewoo International (America) Corp. </em>755 F.2d 1398, 1400 (11th Cir.1985), and cases cited therein; <em>see also Eudy v. Motor-Guide, Herschede Hall Clock Co., </em>604 F.2d 17, 18, 203 USPQ 721 (5th Cir.1979). Hence Glares\u2019 appeal from the grant of summary judgment to Robertson is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-8\">An order <em>granting </em>a judgment on certain issues is a judgment on those issues. It forecloses further dispute on those issues at the trial stage. An order <em>denying </em>a motion for partial summary judgment, on the other hand, is merely a judge\u2019s determination that genuine issues of material fact exist. It is not a judgment, and does not foreclose trial on the issues on which summary judgment was sought. It \u201cdoes not settle or even tentatively decide anything about the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>Switzerland Cheese Association, Inc. v. E. Horne\u2019s Market, Inc., </em>385 U.S. 23, 25, 87 S.Ct. 193, 195, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966). Denial of summary judgment \u201cis strictly a pretrial order that decides only one thing \u2014 that the case should go to trial,\u201d <em>id., i.e., </em>that the claim <em>remains pending </em>for trial. \u201cAn order denying a motion for summary judgment is interlocutory, non-final, and non-appealable.\u201d <em>Parker Brothers, </em>757 F.2d 254, 255, 226 USPQ 11 (Fed.Cir.1985) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The order in <em>Parker </em>was interlocutory. Nonetheless, a denial of summary judgment is not properly reviewable on an appeal from the final judgment entered after trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1647-13\">The substantial segment of Robertson\u2019s brief devoted to its effort to overturn the denial of summary judgment on claim 2 fails to recognize that the <em>only </em>final judgment rendered on the validity of claim 2 was that entered on the jury verdict. <em>See Boyles Galvanizing &amp; Plating Co. v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>372 F.2d 310, 312 (10th Cir.1967). Having been cited by Glares to its failure to include the matter in its notice of appeal, Fed.R.App.P. 3(c), and to cases holding that <em>denials </em>of partial summary judgments do not merge with the final judgment, Robert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>son, incredibly, filed a reply brief ignoring Rule 3(c) and citing cases in which <em>grants </em>of partial summary judgment were held reviewable with the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-4\">Robertson (1) failed to convince the district court that no genuine issue of material fact existed in respect of the validity of claim 2; (2) excluded from trial the witness it relied on in respect of claims 1 and 3; and (3) failed to persuade the jury of anything. In this court, Robertson asks us not only to overturn the jury\u2019s verdict, the denial of JNOV, and the denial of a new trial, but goes on, in the face of contrary authority, to twice insist that we must reach back into the beginning of the litigation in the Northern District of Illinois, ignore entirely the subsequent trial by jury, and order the district court to vacate its determination on the motion for summary judgment that facts remained in dispute respecting validity of claim 2. Robertson\u2019s effort in this court to overturn the denial of summary judgment on claim 2 is improper. It is productive only of a waste of this court\u2019s time and of Robertson\u2019s resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-5\">\n<em>Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-6\">Just before oral argument, Glaros filed an \u201cEmergency Motion to Dismiss\u201d Robertson\u2019s appeal, accompanied by five documentary exhibits. The court denied the motion, dismissal being too draconian a remedy for the misrepresentation of fact by Robertson set forth in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-7\">Robertson\u2019s main brief included a section heading that began \u201cThe Jury\u2019s Finding of Wilfullness Is Without Meaning Given Lack of Instruction.\u201d The text of that section contained repeated assertions that \u201cthe trial court submitted the issue to the jury in Interrogatory 9 without any instructions on the law pertaining to wilfullness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-9\">Glaros\u2019 answering brief argued that the jury\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence, but did not mention instructions. Robertson\u2019s reply brief contained a section heading that began \u201cGlaros Presents No Answer To The Jury\u2019s Finding of Wilfullness Being Without Meaning Given Lack of Instruction.\u201d In that section, Robertson again repeatedly stated that there were no instructions on willfulness, saying \u201ca fundamental fact in this case is that the jury was not instructed on the issue of wilfullness,\u201d that the jury received \u201cno guidance from the court\u201d and that Glaros ignored \u201cthis glaring error, arguing instead as though the jury had been instructed\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-10\">Glaros\u2019 motion set forth a three-paragraph instruction on willfulness given the jury by the court. That instruction appears on page 2358 of the Appendix agreed to by the parties. Glaros said this was Robertson\u2019s second \u201cmajor barefaced misrepresentation of fact,\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and \u201can obvious factual fabrication.\u201d Glaros accused Robertson of <em>removing </em>page 2358 for ulterior purposes, indicating that its removal by accident would be a \u201cmillion to one\u201d coincidence. Glaros demanded dismissal, costs, and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-11\">In a Memorandum in Opposition to Glaros\u2019 motion, Robertson begins by accusing Glaros of \u201cartifice and exaggerated protestations,\u201d saying that the motion establishes only \u201cthat Robertson\u2019s appellate counsel was missing a page of the trial transcript and did not note its absence,\u201d that a simple \u201cerror\u201d was made in copying the transcript given appellate counsel, and that it went \u201cunnoticed by counsel despite diligent preparation and briefing.\u201d The closest Robertson\u2019s appellate counsel comes to recognizing the effect on and offense to the court is that \u201cRobertson and its appellate counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>Reed, Smith, Shaw &amp; McClay, regret the error.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1649-4\">Robertson\u2019s Memorandum was accompanied by an affidavit signed by Arland T. Stein, Frederick H. Colen, James G. Uber, and Michael H. Ginsberg, stating that the Reed Smith firm was not involved in the trial, that it received the transcript from Robertson\u2019s trial counsel, that it did not contain page 2358, that though Robertson \u201cmistakenly asserted\u201d the absence of instructions, Glaros did not correct the \u201cerror\u201d by citing page 2358 in his answering brief, and that Glaros waited three weeks after he received the transcript to call attention to the \u201cerror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-5\">Robertson\u2019s Memorandum also included an unauthorized brief containing an improper attack on the instruction given the jury and additional argument respecting willfullness. Robertson\u2019s explanation of its error appears on one page. Its unauthorized brief runs for three pages. The brief has been disregarded as filed without leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-6\">The notion that counsel may strenuously and repeatedly emphasize a fact contrary to the record, may consider that conduct mere \u201cerror,\u201d and may still consider his preparation \u201cdiligent,\u201d is anathema to the proper, fair, and expeditious administration of appellate justice. That conduct constitutes a dereliction of duty owed the court. If a record page were missing, that would supply no justification whatever for stating (even once) that something did not happen at trial <em>without checking </em>to be sure of the accuracy of that statement. Page 2358 would fall within the block of pages 2334 to 2362 designated for the appendix. With 30 pages of instructions in the transcript, and the care reflected in the district court\u2019s opinions, the facile assumption that the district court failed to instruct on will-fullness was, at best, the result of gross carelessness. Had counsel telephoned opposing counsel to check that unjustified assumption, the truth would have been learned. That counsel on appeal were not involved in the trial neither excuses the present conduct nor diminishes the care to be exercised to <em>insure </em>that the record is reflected truly and accurately in the brief. Nor is the action or inaction of opposing counsel relevant. Lastly, Robertson\u2019s light-hearted evaluation of its disregard of duty to the court is unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-10\">Glaros\u2019 request for an award of costs and attorney fees must in this case be denied. Robertson\u2019s misstatements of the record respecting its motion to disqualify Luttrell and the absence of instructions would normally justify an award of costs and attorney fees incurred in the effort of opposing counsel to inform the court of the truth. Glaros, however, carried that effort too far. Glaros\u2019 counsel presumably knew the truth. No reason is given or appears for the failure of Glaros\u2019 counsel, upon reading the misstatements in Robertson\u2019s main brief, to telephone Robertson\u2019s appellate counsel.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That step might have made unnecessary the preparation and filing of Glaros\u2019 Emergency Motion to Dismiss and the need for the court to consider it and Robertson\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-11\">\n<em>(5) Costs and Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A74c\">Neither party is entitled to costs and attorney fees on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-13\">The parties have advanced and argued numerous other contentions. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>those other contentions are facially merit-less and non-dispositive of any issue, we decline to address them. The judgment of the district court is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1640-13\">. U.S. Pat.

(Inryco) participated fully in the trial and in post-trial arguments.

Shortly after the court\u2019s decision on summary judgment, Robertson again moved for summary judgment that claim 2 was invalid. The court denied that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1641-11\">. Findings duplicating the jury\u2019s answers would appear an unnecessary step, the jury verdicts having been returned and the court having expressly found them supported by substantial evidence. The court\u2019s findings and conclusions are not inconsistent with the jury\u2019s verdicts. Nonetheless, those recasting the jury\u2019s language enabled Robertson to devote most of its brief to an attack on the court\u2019s language, rather than on the interrogatory answers that constituted the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1642-8\">. Counsel on appeal have each engaged in lamentable attribution of ulterior motives to the other. Having unprofessionally charged unprofessionalism, each then cites that charge as warranting an award of costs and attorney fees. Pointing to misstatements of the record is appropriate. Motivational analysis is not. Nor will the latter prejudice the court. Judges have much and many better things to do than to referee irrelevant cat-fights of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1643-7\">. Glaros attempts in his brief to resurrect Robertson\u2019s original objections to Luttrell\u2019s qualifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1643-8\">by defendants' own admission [under Fed.R. Civ.P. 56(c) \"admissions on file\u201d], Dr. Luttrell could not assist the Court in determining the scope and content of the prior art, the differences between the prior art and the claims at issue, and the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art. Nor could Dr. Luttrell provide aid to the meaning of the claims which are directed to one of ordinary skill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1643-9\">The record does not disclose whether Robertson withdrew its original objections to Luttrell\u2019s qualifications before relying heavily on Luttrell\u2019s testimony in obtaining summary judgment. Whatever may be said of the propriety of Robertson's reliance on testimony of a witness it considered unqualified, Glaros interposed no objection to the submission of that testimony when it was offered and was at that time presenting Luttrell as his expert. He cannot now be heard to complain. Moreover, Robertson\u2019s naked assertion is not an admission of fact required by Rule 56(c). <em>See Proctor v. Sagamore Big Game Club, </em>265 F.2d 196, 198-99 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 831, 80 S.Ct. 81, 4 L.Ed.2d 73 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-14\">Though Glaros treats Luttrell\u2019s lack of qualification as a fact, the district court made no such finding at any time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1644-7\">. Charging the jury and the court with error at virtually every step, Robertson misconstrues its role on appeal following denial of its motion for JNOV. Disregarding its burden under \u00a7 282, it attacks Glaros\u2019 failure to establish nonobviousness and presents primarily a jury argument to this court, ignoring, e.g., the record indications that Robertson\u2019s witnesses were impeached and self-contradictory, factors from which the jury could have found that they lacked credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1644-8\">. Robertson repeatedly cites the district court\u2019s references to Pimsner in the court\u2019s opinion, including an admittedly synonymous use of \"relevant\", \u201canalogous\u201d, and \"pertinent\u201d. Robertson also repeatedly refers to the relevancy of Pimsner to the Glaros <em>patent, </em>and to its use by the district court in the grant of summary judgment on claims 1 and 3. The court's phrasing is not appealable. Summary judgment turned on the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the relevance of Pimsner to claims 1 and 3. The <em>question </em>is whether the jury\u2019s answer to interrogatory 2, that Pimsner was \"not more pertinent to claim <em>2\" </em>than the cited art, is supported by substantial evidence. Robertson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>makes no effort to show such absence of supporting evidence, and its repeated assertion that the jury thought Pimsner \"was not prior art at all\u201d is simply unsupported anywhere in the entire record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1645-10\">. Robertson devotes much of its briefs to an argument that, because Pimsner was recognized as prior art on summary judgment, the \"law of the case\u201d precluded the jury from finding that Pimsner was \"not prior art.\" The argument is fallacious, the jury having made no such finding. It is fallacious, also, because of the differences in claims 1 and 3, held invalid on summary judgment, and claim 2, held not invalid at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-15\">The jury\u2019s verdict being clearly supported, Robertson\u2019s assignment of error in the court\u2019s use of \"credible\u201d evidence (instead of \"substantial\" evidence) is not deserving of comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1646-9\">. The rule was designed to avoid the heads-or-tails ploy by which counsel stands mute when an erroneous instruction is given, hoping for a favorable verdict and planning to use the erroneous instruction on appeal if the verdict be unfavorable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1646-10\">. Robertson improperly asserts facts to this court that were never presented to the jury in respect of willfulness. Further, its argument that the jury\u2019s failure to find Inryco's infringement willful establishes an \"inconsistency\" is meritless. As the district court explained, the jury was at liberty to find Inryco's denial of willfulness convincing and Robertson\u2019s unconvincing. No \u201cinconsistency\u201d exists in a jury\u2019s finding of differences between independent defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1646-18\">. Robertson also attacks from numerous angles the instructions given the jury. The arguments offered in support of that attack have been considered and found without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1647-9\">. Courts have allowed interlocutory appeals of such orders under circumstances not here present (certification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b); effective denial of injunction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1)). <em>See generally </em>10 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2715, at 638 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1647-10\">. <em>See generally </em>Annot., 15 A.L.R. 3d 899, 922; Annot., 17 L.Ed.2d 886, 893; 4 Am.Jur.2d <em>Appeal and Error </em>\u00a7 104. References may be found in an occasional appellate opinion to the propriety or reviewability of a summary judgment denial that had occurred in the case. <em>See, e.g., Savarin Corp. v. National Bank of Pakistan, </em>447 F.2d 727 (2d Cir.1971). Because the denial decided nothing but a need for trial and trial has occurred, the general and better view is against review of summary judgment denials on appeal from a final judgment entered after trial. In any event, no case has been found in which (as Robertson seeks here) a final judgment after trial was vacated or reversed because summary judgment had been improperly denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1648-8\">. In Robertson\u2019s main brief it flatly denied that it had moved to exclude Luttrell as a witness at trial. In Glaros\u2019 answering brief, he quoted a colloquy of the court with Robertson\u2019s counsel, in which the latter admitted unequivocally that he <em>had </em>moved to disqualify Luttrell. In its reply brief, Robertson merely accuses Glaros of going outside the record and of misconstruing counsel\u2019s statement, with no indication of any different construction that would be possible, and no recognition whatever that Robertson\u2019s misstatement of fact constitutes an offense to the court. Treating the matter only as one between the parties, Robertson says Glaros raised it only to \"divert attention from the frivolity of its appeal.\u201d The treatment of the matter in Robertson\u2019s brief is totally inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1649-7\">. At another point, Robertson said \"Fortunately, the error was discovered before oral argument and disposition of the appeal.\u201d Robertson was in no position to characterize or to temper. The error was discovered by Glaros, and there is nothing \"fortunate\u201d to the <em>court </em>in the timing of the discovery. By that time, the court had read the briefs, made appropriate notes, researched authorities as necessary, etc. The \"error\u201d caused additional work for the court in considering the motion and Robertson\u2019s response.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1649-14\">. The court is aware, of course, of the schedule of events in readying an appeal for hearing, and that the parties in this case apparently did not have the formal appendix until late in the process. Those factors, however, argue for more, not less, use of the telephone by counsel on both sides, and in no manner justify a diminution in the standard of care required in the preparation of briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
