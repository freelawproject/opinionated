(Derry) appeals a partial summary judgment in favor of the Christiana Companies, Inc. (Christiana) in its suit for nonpayment of six recourse promissory notes. (Christiana recourse notes). The district court held that Christiana, the maker of the notes, was relieved from liability by operation of a restrictive provision in those notes. On appeal Derry argues that the district court erred in its holding that the restrictive provision applied, and, in any event, in its rejection of Derry\u2019s equitable estoppel argument. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>This dispute stems out of a complicated leveraged leaseback transaction. The principal parties to the transaction were Air Florida, Inc. (Air Florida), AIG-737-1, Inc. (AIG), AARK, and Christiana. The transaction, which was proposed by AARK, involved the sale and leaseback of two Boeing 737 aircraft. The deal essentially was structured as follows: Air Florida was to sell the planes to AIG, AIG was then to sell them to AARK, and AARK in turn was to sell them to Christiana. Christiana was then to lease the aircraft back to AIG, which would in turn sublease them to Air Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-4\">The various steps in the leaseback transaction were laid out in a series of documents. The basic document was the Participation Agreement. It established the overall structure of the transaction and the obligations of the parties, and incorporated by reference the other documents evidencing it. Chief among these documents for our purposes were: 1) Sales Agreement-I between Air Florida and AIG, 2) Sales Agreement-II between AIG and AARK, 3) the AARK notes by AARK in favor of AIG, 4) Security Agreement-I between AARK, as debtor, and AIG, as secured party, 5) Sales Agreement-Ill between AARK and Christiana, 6) the Christiana recourse notes by Christiana in favor of AARK, 7) Security Agreement-II between Christiana, as debtor, and AARK, as secured party, 8) the Overlease Agreement between Christiana, as lessor, and AIG, as lessee, and 9) the Lease Agreement between AIG, as sublessor, and Air Florida, as sublessee. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix 207-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-5\">At closing AARK was to purchase the aircraft from AIG by making a cash payment to AIG in the amount of $2,960,000 and by delivering to AIG two nonrecourse installment notes (AARK notes), each in the amount of $10,342,500. Under the terms of the AARK notes, a portion of the cash sum was to represent the first installment on the notes. As security for its obligation, AARK was to execute a security agreement (Security Agreement-I) in favor of AIG. Security Agreement-I gave AIG certain rights upon the occurrence of an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d under the AARK notes by reason of certain action or inaction on the part of AARK.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-7\">Christiana\u2019s obligations at closing were to purchase the aircraft from AARK and to lease them, pursuant to the Overlease Agreement, to AIG. Christiana was to pay for the planes by delivering to AARK $950,000 in cash, the six Christiana recourse notes, the first two of which were due on July 15, 1981, and a nonrecourse promissory note. The six Christiana recourse notes, which are the subject matter of this appeal, contain the following exculpatory clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-8\">Payor [Christiana] and Payee [AARK] among others are parties to a certain Participation Agreement ... (\u201cParticipation Agreement\u201d). Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, payor shall not have any obligation to pay this note nor shall payor have any liability hereunder if, on the maturity date of this note, a default exists under the Participation Agreement or any note, lease, agreement or document contemplated therein, including, without limitation, the Loan Certificates, the Lease and the Overlease (as those terms are defined in the \u201cParticipation Agreement.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1286-9\">Joint Appendix at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-10\">The transaction closed on December 31, 1979. At that time AARK failed to pay the first installment on the notes, which amounted to approximately $600,000. In May of 1981 AARK assigned the Christiana recourse notes to Derry in exchange for a multi-million dollar line of credit. On July 15,1981, the maturity date on the first two Christiana recourse notes, AARK still owed AIG $505,500 out of the $600,000 it failed to pay at closing. In addition, as of July 15, 1981, AIG, as lessee, had failed to make many of the rental payments due Christiana, as lessor, under the Overlease Agreement. In fact from the closing date until February of 1981 AIG made no payments at all. At some point AARK stepped in and paid AIG\u2019s rent from the period running from January 15, 1980 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>through January 15,1981. No further payments, however, were made until early July 1981. At that time Christiana rejected attempted payments by AARK and AIG. Christiana then refused to make payment on the two recourse notes when they came due. The remaining notes were promptly accelerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-5\">Derry, the holder of the notes, instituted this suit in federal court on June 28, 1982, seeking to hold Christiana liable on the six notes. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court held in favor of Christiana on the ground that AARK\u2019s failure to pay the appropriate cash sum at closing constituted a default within the meaning of the restrictive clause in the Christiana recourse notes thereby relieving Christiana of all liability. <em>See Derry Finance N.V. v. Christiana Companies, Inc., </em>616 F.Supp. 544 (D.Del.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-6\">The pivotal issue on this appeal is the proper interpretation of the exculpatory clause in the Christiana recourse notes stating that Christiana is relieved of liability if \u201ca default exists under\u201d certain.referenced documents. In this case, although they advocate conflicting interpretations of the clause, both Derry and Christiana contend that the clause is unambiguous. Under New York law, which controls this case, the construction of plain and unambiguous language is for the court. <em>See Teitelbaum Holdings, Ltd. v. Gold, </em>48 N.Y.2d 51, 396 N.E.2d. 1029, 421 N.Y.S.2d 556 (1979); <em>West, Weir &amp; Bartel, Inc. v. Mary Carter Paint Co., </em>25 N.Y.2d 535, 255 N.E.2d 709, 307 N.Y.S.2d 449 (1969), <em>remittitur amended, </em>26 N.Y.2d 969, 259 N.E.2d 483, 311 N.Y.S.2d 13 (1970). When the intent of the parties can be gleaned from the documents themselves, the court will not consider extrinsic evidence, but will give effect to the parties\u2019 intent as evidenced by the language they used. <em>See Slatt v. Slatt, </em>64 N.Y.2d 966, 967, N.E.2d 1099, 488 N.Y.S.2d 645 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-8\">Derry argues, as it did in the distn court, that the unequivocal meaning of th clause is that Christiana is relieved of liability only in the event that a default occurs under the terms of the referenced documents.' In other words, it argues that the parties intended that the referenced documents give meaning and content to the word default; they did not intend for it to have any independent meaning. Applying this rationale, Derry argues that a default did not occur under the AARK notes and Security Agreement-I when AARK failed to pay the first installment on the notes at closing because Security Agreement-I, although not defining when a default <em>per se </em>occurs, states that an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d does not occur until three conditions coincide: 1) AARK fails to perform, 2) AIG gives AARK notice of its failure to perform, and 3) a ten-day period elapses after notice is given. Because AIG never gave notice, Derry contends that no default triggering the exculpatory clause occurred. On the other hand, Christiana contends, and the district court found, that the unambiguous meaning of default is its plain meaning, failure to pay or perform, and, thus, that AARK\u2019s nonperformance constituted a default for purposes of the exculpatory clause. We conclude that Derry\u2019s argument is fatally flawed and we decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">Several considerations compel us to reject Derry\u2019s argument that the term default incorporates the \u201cEvent of Default\u201d provision in Security Agreement-I as the definition of default. First and foremost, the exculpatory clause cannot incorporate anything from Security Agreement-I because the word default is simply not defined in that document. Security Agreement-I and the other referenced documents speak in terms of \u201cEvents of Default,\u201d not \u201cdefault.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, Security Agreement-I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>or grants AIG, the party owed the percance, rights upon the occurrence of an /ent of Default.\u201d \u201cEvent of Default\u201d is acifically defined in Security Agreeent-I as the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1288-4\">failure of Debtor [AARK] promptly and faithfully to pay, observe and perform when due any of the Obligations [defined as making payments under the AARK note] ... and such failure shall continue for a period of ten (10) days after written notice thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1288-5\">Joint Appendix at 516. As a comparison of these documents illustrates, there is nothing in either Security Agreement-I nor the Christiana recourse notes that leads to the conclusion that \u201cdefault\u201d is the equivalent of \u201cEvent of Default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-6\">The obvious distinction between these terms is borne out by the fact that the word \u201cdefault\u201d in the exculpatory clause is in lower case letters whereas the term \u201cEvent of Default\u201d, which is clearly a term of art, is always capitalized. Upon a review of ail the referenced documents, it becomes clear that when the parties intended to create a term of art or to incorporate specific definitions from other documents, they capitalized the referencing term and then utilized the same term in the referenced document. An example of this can be found in the relationship between Sales Agreement-II between AIG and AARK and the Lease Agreement between AIG and Air Florida. Sales Agreement-II grants AARK certain rights upon the occurrence of an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d under the Lease. The Lease, the referenced document, specifically defines \u201cEvent of Default\u201d using the term \u201cEvent of Default.\u201d The incorporation could not be clearer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-7\">The difference between the meaning of the lower case \u201cdefault\u201d and the capitalized \u201cEvent of Default\u201d is perhaps best illustrated by a provision in the Overlease Agreement between Christiana and AIG in which the parties use both terms and they obviously ascribe different meanings to them. The provision, which defines what constitutes an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d for purposes of that agreement, states that an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d occurs if \u201cAIG shall <em>default </em>in the payment of any installment of Rent as and when the same becomes due and payable, and such <em>default </em>shall continue for a period of ten (10) days after written notice.\u201d Joint Appendix at 854-55 (emphasis supplied). Clearly, in this provision, the parties intended for the word default, which is written in lower case letters as it is in the exculpatory clause, to have its ordinary, plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-10\">Finally, an examination of the purposes served by the two terms further convinces us that they are not functional equivalents and therefore that one does not incorporate the other. Under the exculpatory clause, a \u201cdefault\u201d enables Christiana to avoid liability on the recourse notes; however, under the \u201cEvent of Default\u201d clauses in the other documents, the occurrence of an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d automatically triggers in the party owed performance all of the rights afforded secured parties under the Uniform Commercial Code, including the right to take possession of the aircraft.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus the \u201cEvent of Default\u201d clause gives the obligee access to equity; the default clause does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-11\">For the above reasons, we conclude that Derry\u2019s reading of the restrictive provision is not supported by the language of the documents. Derry\u2019s construction leads only to hopeless confusion since there is no such thing as a \u201cdefault\u201d within the meaning of Security Agreement-I and the AARK notes. A \u201cdefault\u201d is simply not the same thing as an \u201cEvent of Default.\u201d Therefore there can be no incorporation. The intention of the parties is plain on the face of the documents: The word default means failure to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-12\">Derry contends, however, that even if default is given its plain meaning, no default occurred for purposes of the excul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>patory clause because AARK and AIG entered into a separate, oral agreement deferring AARK\u2019s obligation under the AARK notes to pay the first installment until some, time after closing when AARK could discount the Christiana notes. The district court rejected this argument and we do too. When drafted, Christiana and AARK agreed that Christiana would be relieved of liability on the notes if, <em>inter alia, </em>AARK failed to perform its obligation to pay a certain cash sum to AIG at closing. This agreement cannot be modified or changed without the consent of Christiana. <em>See, e.g., Beacon Terminal Corp. v. Chemprene, Inc., 75 </em>A.D.2d 350, 429 N.Y.S.2d 715 (N.Y.App.Div.1980) (modification requires mutual assent); <em>Lundberg v. Board of Education of Gloversville Enlarged School District, </em>127 Misc.2d 804, 487 N.Y.S.2d 306 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1985) (unilateral modification not binding on other party). Derry points to no agreement, written or oral, to which Christiana was a party that modifies the Christiana notes. Therefore the plain meaning of the notes controls, and AIG\u2019s and AARK\u2019s alleged oral modification has no bearing on Christiana\u2019s rights under the exculpatory clause in the recourse notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-4\">Finally, Derry contends that in any event Christiana is liable on the notes because Christiana is estopped from raising the exculpatory clause as a defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Derry\u2019s estoppel argument is based on a conversation that a Mr. D.W.H. McCowan, one of the principals of Derry, had with a Mr. George Weymouth, who was a close personal friend of Mr. Martin Fenton, the president of Christiana. The conversation took place before Derry purchased the notes. McCowan asked Weymouth whether it was his understanding that Christiana would pay the notes when due. Weymouth spoke with Fenton and Fenton assured Weymouth that Christiana intended to pay them. At the time Fenton made this representation to Weymouth, Fenton was aware that Weymouth was inquiring on behalf of someone in Bermuda who was interested in purchasing the notes and on his own family\u2019s behalf, which was considering the purchase of a participation in the notes. Weymouth conveyed Fenton\u2019s response to McCowan. McCowan resides in Bermuda.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-7\">The district court concluded, after draw-' ing all reasonable inferences in Derry\u2019s favor, that Derry failed to satisfy the elements necessary for the application of the equitable estoppel doctrine. We agree with the conclusion of the district court. Derry has not produced any evidence from which one could reasonably infer that Fen-ton intended or even imagined that a prospective purchaser of these notes would, without further inquiry, rely on this telephone conversation as Christiana\u2019s final and fixed intention. Moreover, Derry\u2019s estoppel argument requires it to show that its reliance on Fenton\u2019s statement, reported to McCowen secondhand by Weymouth, was reasonable. However, Derry has produced nothing to justify its dependence upon these remarks made by Fenton, upon a relatively informal inquiry, regarding future plans of Christiana towards obligations that had not yet matured. For these reasons, Derry\u2019s estoppel argument cannot succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-8\">We hold that AARK\u2019s failure to pay the requisite cash sum to AIG at the December 1979 closing triggered the exculpatory clause in the Christiana recourse notes relieving Christiana of all liability because AARK\u2019s nonperformance constituted a default within the meaning of that clause. In addition we hold that Christiana is not es-topped from raising the exculpatory clause as a defense to this suit for nonpayment. The summary judgment will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">. The \"Event of Default\" provision in Security Agreement-I is captioned \"Default\u201d, but we must disregard the caption because another section of the Agreement states that the captions are meaningless.

BACKGROUND: THE PLAIN</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">MEANING INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"Akj\">Although the case arises from a complicated transaction, the essential documents are few and the issue simply stated. We are called upon to interpret the \u201crestrictive legend\u201d affecting the six recourse promissory notes between Christiana and AARK. The restrictive legend provided that Christiana would be relieved of all liability on the notes if, on their maturity dates, a \u201cdefault exists under\u201d certain referenced documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only referenced documents relevant here are (1) the AIGAARK notes (\u201cthe notes\u201d) which established the dates on which specified sums were due AIG from AARK, and (2) the related security agreement (\u201cthe AIGAARK security agreement,\u201d or \u201cSecurity Agreement I\u201d) which (a) defined the conditions that constituted an \u201cEvent of Default,\u201d and (b) gave AIG certain remedies if such an Event of Default occurred. The only part of the \u201cEvent of Default\u201d definition that is relevant here stated that an Event of Default occurred when (i) AARK failed to pay money in the amount and at the dates specified in the notes; (ii) AIG made a written demand for payment; and (iii) AARK still failed to pay for a period of ten days following the written demand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is undisputed that the notes incorporated the AIG-AARK security agreement by reference. <em>See </em>App. at 510 (\u201cThis Note is ... subject to, a security agreement ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-18\">The majority holds that because AARK failed to pay the specified sums to AIG on the dates identified in the AIG-AARK notes, there was, as a matter of law, a \u201cdefault under\u201d the notes and security agreement as that term (\u201cdefault under\u201d) is used in the restrictive legend. The majority never explains precisely what it understands the phrase \u201cdefault under [certain agreements]\u201d to mean. Apparently, the majority believes that the phrase means simply \u201cfailure to pay sums on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>dates required by those agreements.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I shall refer to this as the \u201cplain meaning\u201d interpretation. Although the plain meaning interpretation is plausible, I believe that it is not the only \u2014 or necessarily the best \u2014 interpretation of \u201cdefault under\u201d in the restrictive legend. Given the evidence on the record, at least two other interpretations are available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\">II. THE INCORPORATION INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">\u201cDefault under [certain agreements]\u201d in the restrictive legend might mean \u201cdefault <em>as defined by </em>[those agreements].\u201d I shall refer to this reading as the \u201cincorporation interpretation.\u201d Under the incorporation interpretation, \u201cunder\u201d is effectively a verbal shorthand by which the parties incorporate by reference the terms reached in other agreements. This is a common usage of the word \u201cunder.\u201d If we accepted this reading, we would refer to the AIG-AARK security agreement to see when there was a default <em>as defined therein </em>in order to decide whether there was a default as that term is used in the restrictive legend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">Whether the plain-meaning or incorporation interpretation is correct depends upon what Christiana and AARK intended by the phrase \u201cdefault under [certain agreements]\u201d when they drafted the restrictive legend. The majority never refers to any direct evidence of what the parties intended. Instead, it offers arguments based on circumstantial evidence that the parties <em>could not have meant </em>to incorporate the term default as defined in the AIG-AARK security agreement; the majority thus concludes that the plain meaning interpretation must be correct. The majority has three main arguments, none of which I find convincing. I shall list them here, and then address them in turn: (A) the failure of the restrictive legend to use precisely the same terms as did the AIG-AARK security agreement; (B) the contrasting evidence of the Christiana-AIG Overlease Agreement; and (C) the \u201cfunctional\u201d differences between \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cevent of default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-10\">A. <em>Failure of the Restrictive Legend to Use the Same Terms as the AIGAARK Security Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">The majority\u2019s most significant argument can be summarized as follows. In technical corporate documents such as the recourse notes between Christiana and AARK, terms are incorporated only through the use of exactly the same words that are used in the referenced documents. There is no definition of \u201cdefault\u201d in the security agreement that could be incorporated through the restrictive legend. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 1213 (\u201cthe exculpatory clause cannot incorporate anything from [the AIG-AARK security agreement] because the word default is simply not defined in that document\u201d). Moreover, the inexact term \u201cdefault\u201d in the restrictive legend cannot have been intended to incorporate the term \u201cEvent of Default.\u201d Hence, the majority concludes, an incorporation interpretation of \u201cdefault under [certain agreements]\u201d is impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-12\">Contrary to the majority, I do not believe that the general precision of corporate documents is sufficient evidence of the absence of incorporation to justify a grant of summary judgment. Our focus must be on the intention of the parties to <em>these </em>documents, which I find far from clear. Not only do I see no compelling evidence that AIG and AARK intended incorporation to occur only through the use of exact terms, but I find strong indications that they may in fact have intended the inexact term \u201cdefault\u201d to refer to the default provisions of other documents. I therefore do not find conclusive either the failure of the AIGAARK security agreement to define \u201cdefault\u201d or the failure of the restrictive legend to use the defined term \u201cEvent of Default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-13\">The majority points merely to the circumstantial evidence of lack of identity of the terms to support its conclusion that AIG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>and AARK recognized a distinction between the term \u201cdefault\u201d in the restrictive legend of the recourse notes and the term \u201cEvent of Default\u201d in the security agreement. It states that \u201c[u]pon a review of all the referenced documents, it becomes clear that when the parties intended to create a term of art or to incorporate specific definitions from other documents, they capitalized the referencing terms and then utilized the same term in the referenced document.\u201d Maj.Op. at 1214. However, the majority\u2019s only example in support of its argument, however, does not involve a contract between AARK and Christiana, but a contract between AARK <em>and </em>AIG. Maj. Op. at 1214-15 (sales agreement between AIG and AARK incorporating by express reference certain terms of the lease agreement between AIG and Air Florida). Although this document may have some probative value, it surely is not sufficient evidence to support a conclusion, for purposes of summary judgment, that when AARK <em>and Christiana </em>wanted to incorporate by reference they invariably did so by reproducing the language of the referenced document.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">On the other hand, there is a good reason that the restrictive legend would not be able to use the exact language of the incorporated document as did the AIG-AARK security agreement: the restrictive legend relieved Christiana of its obligations under the notes upon the default by any party to any of several documents. The different documents may have used different terms, or had different conditions, and, thus, AARK and Christiana may have preferred to use a broad term that could apply to all of the underlying documents. By contrast, the exculpatory clause in the AIG-AARK sales agreement which the majority analogizes to the restrictive legend at issue in this case referred <em>only </em>to the Air Florida-AIG lease agreement. It is thus no surprise that the AIG-AARK sales agreement used the precise language of the underlying lease.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">Moreover, there is evidence that AIG and AARK intended the terms \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cEvent of Default\u201d synonymously. The most telling evidence of this intention is that the definition and entire discussion of \u201cEvent of Default\u201d in the AIG-AARK security agreement is found under a heading marked simply \u201cDefault.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 2. This is a strong indication that the parties meant \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cEvent of Default\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> synonymously. It is further evidence of the parties\u2019 intent that nowhere in the contract do they use the term \u201cdefault\u201d except in the phrase \u201cEvent of Default.\u201d Therefore, to distinguish between the terms \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cEvent of Default\u201d would appear to be contrary to the wishes of the parties to the underlying contract, AIG and AARK.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-10\">The parties\u2019 intention that the terms \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cEvent of Default\u201d be used synonymously is further supported by the deposition testimony of Mr. McCanless, the president of AIG (the victim of the alleged default by AARK). Upon questioning by Christiana\u2019s counsel, Mr. McCanless testified in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number><em>McCanless: </em>From my standpoint, no, they were not in default. The beginning of the default only exists when notice is rendered of an existence of a default condition, and the notifiee \u2014 or whatever you want to call it \u2014 fails to cure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-8\">Q: What did you say to Mr. Lippe [Christiana\u2019s attorney]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-9\">A: I said no they were not in default, that \u2014 that they would not be in default until I notified them of default and they had the chance to cure it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-11\">Q: When you say the word or term \u201ctechnically in default,\u201d what do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-12\">A: Well, the documents are very clear. You know, a condition \u2014 a default under the agreement does not exist until an event of default has occurred, first of all; and second of all, that the party commiting [sic] that event of default has been so notified by the other party and fails to cure it within the cure period, which in the case of a late payment, I think it\u2019s ten days, and there are various other longer cure periods depending upon what other conditions or events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-14\">A: I will say that that is the way the leasing industry works, as far as default events are concerned. I\u2019m very familiar with those kinds of circumstances. That\u2019s the way it works.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1293-15\">App. at 183,187,191. This testimony demonstrates that at least one of the parties to the AIG-AARK agreement understood no distinction between \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cEvent of Default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AfU5\">B. <em>A Comparison of the AIG-AARK Security Agreement with the Ckristiana-AIG Overlease Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8R\">The majority\u2019s second argument against the incorporation interpretation is that \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cEvent of Default\u201d mean very different things, and that whereas \u201cEvent of Default\u201d has a very technical meaning, default has an \u201cordinary plain meaning.\u201d Maj.Op. at 1214-1215. Therefore, the argument runs, it would be a mistake to interpret \u201cdefault\u201d in the restrictive legend in terms of \u201cEvent of Default,\u201d as defined in the AIG-AARK security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-18\">The majority relies on the Overlease Agreement between Christiana and AIG to prove its point that \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cEvent of Default\u201d refer to separate things. It is indeed true that in <em>that </em>document \u201cEvent of Default\u201d is defined in terms of \u201cdefault.\u201d Because something cannot be defined in terms of itself, the majority makes a strong case that <em>insofar as the Overlease Agreement is concerned </em>the two terms cannot be synonymous. <em>See </em>App. at 418-19. But the use of the terms in one agreement does not control the use of those terms in another agreement, especially when the parties to the agreements are not the same. Because there is not an identity of the parties between the agreements, the terms of the Overlease Agreement can be only minimally probative of the meaning of the AIG-AARK security agreement, the subject of this appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-19\">C. <em>The Alleged \u201cFunctional\" Difference between Default and Event of Default</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1293-20\">The majority\u2019s final argument is predicated on the observation that under the restrictive legend, a \u201cdefault under [specified agreements]\u201d relieves Christiana of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>the obligation to pay off its recourse notes, whereas under the AIG-AARK security agreement the occurrence of an \u201cevent of default,\u201d would give AIG the right to repossess the aircraft.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the majority concludes, the terms \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201cEvent of Default\u201d \u201care not functional equivalents and therefore ... one does not incorporate the other.\u201d Maj.Op. at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-4\">This argument is specious. It is of course true that only the terms of the AIG-AARK security agreement would give a party a right to possession, whereas the terms of the restrictive legend could not, for the former is a security agreement while the latter is not. Using this reasoning, a document that is not a security agreement could <em>never </em>incorporate by reference an operative term of a security agreement because the security agreement, by definition, involves equity interests and a sales agreement or promissory note does not. Obviously, this cannot be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1294-10\">D. <em>Conclusion: There Is a Genuine Question About the Meaning of \u201cDefault\u201d in the Restrictive Legend</em></p>\n<p id=\"Av_\">The majority thus raises no conclusive argument to support its holding that the plain-meaning interpretation of \u201cdefault\u201d is correct. While it points to circumstantial evidence against the incorporation interpretation, its analysis leaves unclear the intention of the parties to the recourse notes, AIG and AARK. The incorporation interpretation is certainly a reasonable reading of the phrase \u201cdefault <em>under </em>[certain agreements].\u201d On the basis of the evidence now before the court, it is possible to conclude that the parties intended the phrase to be read this way. Because there still exists a question as to the intention of AIG and AARK with respect to the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>ing of \u201cdefault,\u201d summary judgment is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-4\">III. THE EVIDENCE OF TRADE CUSTOM</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-5\">Even if I were to agree with the majority that the incorporation interpretation is incorrect because the term \u201cdefault under [certain agreements]\u201d does not mean \u201cdefault as defined [in those agreements],\u201d I would still not agree that the plain meaning interpretation is necessarily correct. I disagree with the majority\u2019s implicit belief that the meaning of \u201cdefault\u201d is plain and immutable. Even a common term like \u201cdefault\u201d may have variable meanings depending on the trade custom and usage. In such a case the meaning of the term must be determined from the industry practice and trade usage. There is significant evidence on the record that in the airplane leasing trade, default does not mean \u201cfailure to pay exactly as specified by the contract,\u201d but has a more flexible meaning, and therefore that AARK did not default on its notes to AIG as \u201cdefault\u201d is used in the airplane financing and leasing trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-6\">Evidence on the record suggests that in large airplane leasing transactions, it is customary for parties to installment contracts to defer their initial payments and pay greater sums later, regardless of the explicit payment schedule outlined in the contract. Thus, for example, Mr. McCanless testified that \u201c[i]n the normal business practice in transactions of this type, it is that the packager [AARK] doesn\u2019t normally pay the leasing company [AIG] at closing. It pays them after the investor\u2019s notes are discounted.\u201d App. at 181. Similarly, in a passage quoted above, <em>see supra </em>at 1219, Mr. McCanless explained that the \u201cEvent of Default\u201d provision was merely a synopsis of the industry\u2019s standard practice: \u201cI will say that that [i.e., the Event of: Default provision] is the way the leasing industry works, as far as default events are concerned. I\u2019m very familiar with those kinds of circumstances. That\u2019s the way it works.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-11\">Looking at this testimony in the light most favorable to Derry, I believe that a reasonable jury could have found on the basis of the evidence presented that AARK\u2019s failure to pay AIG on the dates specified in the notes was not a \u201cdefault\u201d in light of the custom of the airplane leasing trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-12\">IV. THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A3g\">My differences with the majority are not merely random, but stem from a common source \u2014 our different perceptions of this court\u2019s role in this dispute. The majority states that both Christiana and Deny argue that their proposed interpretations\u2014 the plain meaning or incorporation interpretations \u2014 are \u201cunambiguousPy]\u201d correct. Maj.Op. at 1213. After stating Derry\u2019s position and rejecting it for the reasons described and criticized above, the majority is left with Christiana\u2019s interpretation, upon which it affirms the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-13\">In my opinion, this is not the proper way to proceed. Even if both parties did contend that their interpretations were unambiguously correct,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we could not then simply choose between the profferred interpretations the one that we felt was most likely correct. Rather, because this is an appeal of an order granting summary judgment, Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, our job is to determine not which of the parties' positions is more persuasive, but whether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the opponent of the motion, there are any disputed issues of material fact. If there are, then, regardless of what the court thinks as to their ultimate merit, we must reverse the grant of the summary judgment and allow the jury to hear the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-14\">I believe that I have shown that the issue of intent, clearly an issue of material fact, is genuinely disputed. I would therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>reverse the grant of summary judgment. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">.

The majority makes much of the fact that in the restrictive legend the term \"default\" is in lower case letters, whereas in the AIG-AARK security agreement defined terms are capitalized. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at 1214. The majority's suggestion on this point strikes me as hypertechnical. I would not place any weight on the difference in capitalization which may have been no more than a typist's peccadillo. Such a minor point should not be a ground on which a party is denied a right to have its case heard by a jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1293-16\">. Indeed, to the extent that the Overlease Agreement is at all probative of the relationship between the terms \"default\u201d and \"Event of Default,\u201d in the AIG-AARK security agreement, I would argue that it supports the contention that as those terms are used in the security agreement, they mean the same thing. Unlike the AIG-AARK security agreement, which, as noted above, defines \u201cEvent of Default\u201d in a section entitled \"Default,\" and which never uses the term \u201cdefault\u201d except in the phrase \"Event of Default,\u201d the Overlease Agreement defines \u201cEvents of Default\u201d in a section entitled \"Events of Default,\" and, as just noted, defines \"Events of Default,\" in terms of \"default.\u201d The differences between the two documents suggest that the signers of the Overlease Agreement recognized a distinction between \"default\u201d and \u201cEvent of Default\u201d that the signers of the AARK-AIG security agreement did not recognize.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">. The AIG-AARK security agreement reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-6\">3.2 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Secured Party shall have, in addition to all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code, the right to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-7\">(i) take possession of any or all of the Equipment wherever situated and, for such purpose, enter upon any premises; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-8\">(ii) sell, dispose of, hold, use or lease any or all of the Equipment as the Secured Party in its sole discretion shall decide; provided, however, that should the Secured Party decide to foreclose, such rights and remedies shall be subject and subordinate to the Bank Lien and with respect to any lease of the Equipment, the rights of any lessee of the Equipment so long as it shall not be in default of any of the provisions of any lease of the Equipment to quiet and peaceful possession of the Equipment and to the unrestricted use of the Equipment for its intended purpose.
