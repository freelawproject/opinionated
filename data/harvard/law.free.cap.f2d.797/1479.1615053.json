WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1554-22\">In this case we are asked to decide the reasonableness of the Forest Service\u2019s interpretation of the Alaska Statehood Act. The Service requires that land grant selections from national forests have a community nexus before they will be approved. The district court held that the Service\u2019s interpretation was unreasonable and granted summary judgment for Alaska. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-23\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b1554-24\">Prior to statehood, the vast majority of land in Alaska was owned by the federal government. To facilitate economic development and community expansion, Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>gress made several land grants to the state in the Alaska Statehood Act. Under Section 6(a) of the Alaska Statehood Act, the state may select up to 400,000 acres of land from the national forests, \u201cwith the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AzP\">In December 1977, Alaska filed selections totaling 247,597 acres in the Chugach and Tongass National Forests. In a series of decisions in 1979, the Regional Forester disapproved 51,050 acres of those selections after determining they did not qualify under the conditions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-6\">The decision of the Regional Forester was affirmed by the Chief of the Forest Service in October 1979. After the Secretary of Agriculture declined review, Alaska filed this action in federal district court. The court granted Alaska\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statute was contrary to law. The Secretary has appealed. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"A-d\">We review <em>de novo </em>a grant of summary judgment. <em>Planet Insurance Co. v. Mead Reinsurance Corp., </em>789 F.2d 668 (9th Cir.1986). The construction of a statute is a question of law reviewable <em>de novo. United States v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp., </em>754 F.2d 1445, 1447 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-7\">The APA requires that a reviewing court hold unlawful and set aside agency action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), and actions in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 706(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-8\">The interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is granted substantial deference. <em>Udall v. Tollman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>Kidd v. United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management, </em>756 F.2d 1410, 1412 (9th Cir.1985). If the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the court may not substitute its own construction for a reasonable interpretation made by the agency. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-12\">To affirm, we need not conclude that the agency\u2019s construction was the only one it could have adopted, or even the one the court would have reached. <em>Alcaraz v. Block, </em>746 F.2d 593, 606 (9th Cir.1984). Deference requires affirmance of any interpretation within the range of reasonable meanings the words permit, comporting with the statute\u2019s clear purpose. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1555-13\">The courts, however, are the final authorities on issues of statutory construction, <em>Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Federal Maritime Commission, </em>390 U.S. 261, 262, 88 S.Ct. 929, 930, 19 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1968); <em>Markair, Inc. v. Civil Aeronautics Board, </em>744 F.2d 1383, 1385 (9th Cir.1984), especially where the construction requires consideration of broad concerns beyond the agency\u2019s expertise. <em>Grunfeder v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 503, 505 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1555-14\">A court must reject administrative constructions of a statute inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the policy that Congress sought to implement. <em>Federal Election Commission v. Demo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number><em>cratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, </em>454 U.S. 27, 32, 102 S.Ct. 38, 42, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981); <em>United States v. Louisiana-Pacific Corp., </em>754 F.2d at 1447.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-4\">Alaska argues that no deference is due the Forest Service here because the Alaska Statehood Act is not an act that it administers. It contends that the Act is a contract between two sovereigns creating rights in the state, and the Forest Service\u2019s approval is only a procedural function. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-5\">The Supreme Court has held that the \u201capproval of the Secretary\u201d power conferred under land grant statutes gives the Secretary the authority and the duty \u201cto determine the lawfulness of the selections.\u201d <em>Wyoming v. United States, </em>255 U.S. 489, 503-04, 41 S.Ct. 393, 397, 65 L.Ed. 742 (1920); <em>Payne v. New Mexico, </em>255 U.S. 367, 371, 41 S.Ct. 333, 334, 65 L.Ed. 680 (1920). <em>Accord Andrus v. Utah, </em>446 U.S. 500, 511, 100 S.Ct. 1803, 1809, 64 L.Ed.2d 458 (1980); <em>Lewis v. Hickel, </em>427 F.2d 673, 676 (9th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 992, 91 S.Ct. 456, 27 L.Ed.2d 440 (1971); <em>Ferry v. Udall, </em>336 F.2d 706, 710, 713 (9th Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 904, 85 S.Ct. 1449, 14 L.Ed.2d 286 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-6\">The \u201caction of the Secretary [is] required, not merely as supervisory of the action of the agent of the state, but for the protection of the United States against an improper appropriation of their lands.\u201d <em>Wisconsin Cent R. Co. v. Price County, </em>133 U.S. 496, 512, 10 S.Ct. 341, 347, 33 L.Ed. 687 (1890). Alaska\u2019s sovereignty did not prevent it from consenting to administration of the land grants by the Secretary as a condition of receiving the grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-11\">Alaska also argues that deference is improper here because the standards used by the Forest Service have not been promulgated as regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, deference to an administrative interpretation of a statute is appropriate whether or not it has been embodied in a regulation. <em>Western Pioneer, Inc. v. United States, </em>709 F.2d 1331, 1335 (9th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AlBl\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-12\">I. <em>Community Nexus</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1556-13\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1556-14\">The Forest Service refused to approve several Section 6(a) selections submitted by Alaska as suitable for prospective recreational areas. It required such areas to be near (generally within 25 nautical miles of) existing communities, proposed by existing community governments or planning boards as community areas, or at or near an area where there had been an expressed intention of establishing new communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1556-15\">B. <em>Statutory Language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1556-16\">Section 6(a) requires that all selections of land under this subsection \u201cshall be adjacent to established communities or suitable for prospective community centers and recreational areas.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Forest Service has interpreted \u201cprospective community\u201d in this clause to modify both \u201ccenters\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>and \u201crecreational areas.\u201d Alaska, on the other hand, would not read \u201cprospective community\u201d to modify \u201crecreational areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-4\">In construing a statute, we look first to the language of the statute itself, and second to its legislative history and, as an aid in interpreting Congress\u2019 intent, the interpretation of its administering agency. <em>Brock v. Writers Guild of America, West, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 1349, 1353 (9th Cir.1985). We look to the legislative history if the statutory language is unclear. <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 896, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1547, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). However, even where the meaning of the words is plain, the circumstances of the enactment of legislation may persuade us that Congress did not intend words of common meaning to have their literal effect. <em>Heppner v. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., </em>665 F.2d 868, 870 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-5\">Here, the phrase in question is susceptible to either asserted interpretation and is ambiguous. We look to Congress\u2019 intent to shed light on its meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-6\">Section 6(a) states its purpose. The land grants under this section are \u201c[f]or the purpose of furthering the development of and expansion of communities.\u201d This purpose supports the Forest Service\u2019s \u201ccommuity nexus\u201d interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-7\">The relationship between the land grants in Section 6(a) and Section 6(b) also supports the Forest Service\u2019s interpretation. Section 6(a) provides for two 400,000 acre grants, one from National Forests and one from other public lands. Section 6(b) provides for a grant of 102.5 million acres from public lands.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If no community nexus were required, Section 6(a) public land grants would be almost as unrestricted as Section 6(b) grants, since virtually any site may be classified as suitable for a prospective recreational area. The grant of public lands in Section 6(a) would in substance be rendered surplusage, as Congress could have simply provided for a larger Section 6(b) grant. We must read the statute as a whole to avoid such a result. <em>See Richards v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 11, 82 S.Ct. 585, 591, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982); <em>United States v. Menasche, </em>348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S.Ct. 513, 519-20, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-12\">C. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1557-13\">Purposes of the Alaska Statehood Act included developing Alaska\u2019s economy, H.R.Rep. No. 624, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, 9, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 2933, 2933, 2941 (1957) and resources, <em>id. </em>at 2936, and decreasing the amount of federally owned land in Alaska. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 7, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 2937, 2939. <em>See also </em>S.Rep. No. 1163, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1957). However, these purposes are much more general than the specific purpose statement in Section 6(a). The specific purpose of Section 6(a) overrides the general purposes of the Act. <em>See Markair, </em>744 F.2d at 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b1557-14\">The House Report specifies that Section 6(a) grants are to be \u201cadjacent to established communities or suitable for prospective community or recreational areas.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 624, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 6, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S.Code Cong. <em>&amp; </em>Ad.News 2933, 2938 (1957). This suggests that a \u201crecreational area\u201d need not be a \u201ccommunity recreational area.\u201d The Senate Report specifies that this land is \u201cfor community expansion and recreational sites.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1163, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1957). Like the phrase in Section 6(a), this is ambiguous. However, the Senate Report also specifies that Section 6(a) grants will create \u201c[sjtate ownership of valuable, accessible timberlands and other lands\u201d which in turn \u201cis intended to encourage the development and expansion of communities and recreational areas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. This tends to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1484\">*1484</page-number>support Alaska\u2019s contention that \u201crecreational areas\u201d is not modified by \u201ccommunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-4\">The Forest Service relies heavily upon the legislative history of an Alaska statehood bill considered by Congress in 1954. This bill had language identical to that under consideration here. Such prior legislative history can be relevant to an understanding of the act. <em>See United States v. Enmons, </em>410 U.S. 396, 404 n. 14, 93 S.Ct. 1007, 1012 n. 14, 35 L.Ed.2d 379 (1973). We need not decide what weight should be given this legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-5\">We find the 1957 legislative history ambiguous. In light of the community emphasis in the purpose clause and the relationship between Section 6(a) and Section 6(b), the Forest Service\u2019s interpretation is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-6\">II. <em>Adjacent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1558-7\">Under Section 6(a), land selected must be \u201cadjacent to established communities or suitable for prospective community centers and recreational areas.\u201d The Forest Service has interpreted \u201cadjacent\u201d broadly to mean \u201cnear to, but need not be adjoining, an established community.\u201d FSM 5455.22(4)(a)(2). It generally has approved recreation selections within 25 nautical miles from an existing community. This interpretation is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-8\">The Service\u2019s requirement that land granted as suitable for prospective community recreational areas be within 25 miles of existing communities or lands \u201csuitable for prospective community centers\u201d is also reasonable. It gives similar tests for recreational areas near \u201cestablished communities\u201d and for those near areas \u201csuitable for prospective \u25a0 community centers,\u201d making the clause internally consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-9\">III. <em>Suitable</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1558-10\">The Service interprets \u201csuitable\u201d to mean \u201cthere must be a reasonable expectancy that the site will be developed for these purposes.\u201d FSM 5455.22(4)(a)(l). For a location to be suitable as a prospective community center, the Service requires an expressed intention of establishing a new community at or near the site. For a location to be suitable as a prospective recreational area, it requires that an existing community government or planning board propose the site for its community recreation plans or program, in addition to the requirement that the site be \u201cnear\u201d the established community.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-13\">Alaska argues that this interpretation is unreasonable. From the plain meaning of the language, Alaska contends, Congress did not require these sites to be \u201cexpected\u201d to develop into communities and recreational areas. It required only that the sites be \u201csuitable for such uses.\u201d \u201cSuitable\u201d does not require an \u201cexpressed intention\u201d that something be used for a particular use or purpose; it requires only that the thing be adaptable to such use or purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1558-14\">We disagree. \u2022 Because the stated purpose of the grant is to further community development and expansion, it is not unreasonable to require the state to show some expectancy that the land will be used for those purposes. One factor going into a determination of suitability, from a land use planning standpoint, is the likelihood that people will move there. If this is not considered, almost any site could be found \u201csuitable\u201d for community purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1558-15\">IV. <em>Arbitrary and Capricious</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1558-16\">Alaska argues that the Forest Service has applied its criteria in an arbitrary and capricious manner. This issue was presented to, but not decided by, the district court. We may consider an issue conceded or neglected below if the issue is purely one of law and the pertinent record has been fully developed. <em>In re Howell, </em>731 F.2d 624, 627 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 933, 105 S.Ct. 330, 83 L.Ed.2d 266 (1984). The issue here involves the application of law to fact, and we decline to reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1485\">*1485</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-2\">We reverse the summary judgment for Alaska and remand to the district court for further proceedings, including a determination whether the Forest Service has applied its selection criteria in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1555-9\">. Section 6(a) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1555-10\">For the purposes of furthering the development of and expansion of communities, the State of Alaska is hereby granted and shall be entitled to select, within thirty-five years after the date of the admission of the State of Alaska into the Union, from lands within national forests in Alaska which are vacant and unappropriated at the time of their selection not to exceed four hundred thousand acres of land, and from the other public lands of the United States in Alaska which are vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved at the time of their selection not to exceed another four hundred thousand acres of land, all of which shall be adjacent to established communities or suitable for prospective community centers and recreational areas. Such lands shall be selected by the State of Alaska with the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture as to national forest lands and with the approval of the Secretary of the interior as to other public lands ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1555-16\">Pub.L. No. 85-508, 72 Stat. 339, 48 U.S.C. prec. \u00a7 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1556-7\">. Contrary to the Forest Service\u2019s assertion, the Secretary of Agriculture has promulgated no regulations giving the standards to be met before selections are approved. The regulation cited by the Forest Service, 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 627, was promulgated by the Secretary of the <em>Interior </em>and establishes only the administrative procedure for filing land selections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1556-8\">. Alaska has not challenged the Forest Service\u2019s failure to comply with the notice and hearing requirements of the A.P.A. These requirements generally do not apply to matters relating to public property or grants. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a)(2). However, the Department of Agriculture has decided voluntarily to impose these requirements on all agencies of the Department when making rules relating to public property or grants. 36 Fed.Reg. 13,804 (1971); <em>Alcaraz, </em>746 F.2d at 611. Because the district court has not considered this issue, we will not do so. <em>See United States v. Kupau, </em>781 F.2d 740, 742 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1556-18\">. The parties have argued whether the word \"and\" in this phrase is conjunctive or disjunctive. This is not determinative, as \u201ccommunity\u201d could modify \u201crecreational areas\u201d under either reading. Furthermore, this phrase makes sense only if \u201cand\u201d is read disjunctively. Otherwise, any lands granted under the \"suitable for\u201d phrase would have to be suitable <em>both </em>for prospective community centers <em>and, </em>at the same time, for prospective recreational areas. Even the Forest Service does not insist on such an interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1557-8\">. Section 6(b) reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1557-9\">The State of Alaska, in addition to any other grants made in this section, is hereby granted and shall be entitled to select, within thirty-five years after the admission of Alaska into the Union, not to exceed one hundred and two million five hundred and fifty thousand acres <em>from the </em>public lands of the United States in Alaska which are vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved at the time of their selection...</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1558-11\">. Because we find the Forest Service's interpretation of the statute to be reasonable, we do not reach its contention that Congress has acquiesced in this interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1559-8\">SCHROEDER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANx\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-9\">I agree with the majority that the Alaska Statehood Act requires the state\u2019s land selections to have some nexus to existing or prospective communities. That interpretation resolves an ambiguity in the Act in a manner that is fully supported by the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-10\">I cannot agree with the majority, however, when it upholds the Forest Service requirement that the selections generally be within 25 miles of existing or already planned communities. The Alaska Statehood Act permits the state to select \u201cfrom lands within national forests in Alaska which are vacant and unappropriated.\u201d It requires that the land either be \u201cadjacent to established communities\u201d or, in the alternative, be \u201csuitable for prospective community centers and recreational areas.\u201d Pub.L. No. 85-508, 72 Stat. 339, 48 U.S. note prec. \u00a7 21, Sec. 6(a). The Forest Service\u2019s wholly arbitrary 25-mile requirement is not even hinted at in the statute or its history. In insisting that the communities already be planned or in existence, the Service ignores the language of the statute which requires only that the land be \u201csuitable for prospective\u201d community development.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-11\">The only justification which the Forest Service offers for such an arbitrary standard is that the 25-mile restriction is reasonable as a distance for non-overnight recreation. The rule might make sense for suburban New Jersey. In Alaska, where residents routinely travel by plane and boat due to the scarcity of roads, such a limitation is impractical. When Congress authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to approve Alaska\u2019s land selections, it did not authorize disapproval on an arbitrary and irrational basis. Accordingly, in my view, the majority does not hold the Forest Service to an appropriate standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1559-6\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
