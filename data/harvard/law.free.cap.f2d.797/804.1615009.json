The BIA denied Ghadessi\u2019s motion on the ground that she failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for relief. We conclude that Ghadessi has stated a <em>prima facie </em>case of a well-founded fear of persecution and thus we remand this matter to the BIA to reopen deportation proceedings for the presentation of evidence on her eligibility for asylum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">Ghadessi, a citizen of Iran, first entered the United States in 1978 as a non-immigrant student. When her student visa expired, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) instituted deportation proceedings. In 1980, Ghadessi was found deportable by an immigration judge, and this decision was affirmed by the BIA and this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">In 1984, Ghadessi filed a motion to reopen deportation proceedings pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2 to apply for asylum as a refugee. She alleges that since her deportation proceedings, she has been active in an anti-Khomeini organization and would be persecuted for such conduct upon her return to Iran. The BIA found that she had not established the <em>prima facie </em>showing necessary to reopen proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">It is generally stated that the BIA\u2019s denial of a petition to reopen deportation proceedings to apply for asylum is reviewed by this court for an abuse of discretion. <em>Hernandez-Ortiz v. INS, 777 </em>F.2d 509, 513 (9th Cir.1985); <em>cf. INS v. Rios-Pineda, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 2098, 85 L.Ed.2d 452 (1985) (abuse of discretion standard applies to motion to reopen to petition for suspension of deportation). However, when the BIA restricts its decision, as here, to whether the alien has established a <em>prima facie </em>case, this is the only basis for the decision that we review. <em>Hernandez-Ortiz, 777 </em>F.2d at 517; <em>see Larimi v. INS, </em>782 F.2d 1494, 1496 (9th Cir.1986). The determination of whether an alien has established a <em>prima facie </em>case that she is a refugee, i.e., has a well-founded fear of persecution, is nondiscretionary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Hernandez-Ortiz, 777 </em>F.2d at 518; <em>cf Aviles-Torres v. INS, </em>790 F.2d 1433, 1436 (9th Cir.1986) (BIA has no discretion to deny motion to reopen where prima facie case for prohibition of deportation is established).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Even where an alien qualifies as a refugee by showing a well-founded fear of persecution, the BIA may exercise some discretion in determining whether to grant asylum. <em>Hernandez-Ortiz, </em>777 F.2d at 518; <em>see Mahini v. INS, </em>779 F.2d 1419, 1421 (9th Cir.1986) (adverse factor of narcotics conviction permits discretionary denial of asylum). It is also true that, in a review of a motion to reopen, the BIA may exercise discretionary authority to avoid the question of whether a <em>prima facie </em>case of statutory eligibility is established and instead proceed to rule on the merits of the alien\u2019s entitlement to a favorable exercise of discretion. <em>See Hernandez-Ortiz, </em>777 F.2d at 517-18. However, the BIA clearly did not exercise any type of discretionary authority in this case. Its decision was squarely predicated on a finding that Ghadessi failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. Thus, we need not consider the nature or extent of the BIA\u2019s discretion to deny a motion to reopen deportation proceedings in order to apply for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Consequently, our review is limited to considering whether the BIA\u2019s \u201cdetermination concerning the prima facie case is <em>correct. \u201d See Larimi, </em>782 F.2d at 1496 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Prima Facie Case Standard</p>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">In support of her application, Ghadessi presented an affidavit in which she described her involvement in an anti-Khomeini organization, stated she had organized and participated in three public anti-Khomeini demonstrations, and said she had given interviews on conditions in Iran. She also alleged that the Revolutionary Guards had detained her parents in Iran and interrogated them as to her whereabouts and whether she was involved in anti-Khomeini activities. In addition, she submitted an advisory opinion letter from the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, which stated that if Ghadessi\u2019s statements were true, she had established a well-founded fear of persecution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">A <em>prima facie </em>case for relief as a refugee entitled to asylum under section 208(a) is established when an alien presents \u201caffidavits or other evidentiary material,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.5, which, if true, demonstrate that she has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Hernandez-Ortiz, </em>777 F.2d at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">Because the BIA was acting on Ghadessi\u2019s motion to reopen, it was required to accept as true the factual statements contained in her affidavit. <em>Id. </em>at 514; <em>Maroufi v. INS, </em>772 F.2d 597, 600 (9th Cir.1985). As motions to reopen are decided without a factual hearing, the Board is unable to make credibility determinations at this stage of the proceedings. <em>Hernandez-Ortiz, </em>777 F.2d at 516. Unless the alleged facts are \u201cinherently unbelievable,\u201d corroboration of the petitioner\u2019s affidavit is not necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">The BIA simply failed to appreciate the limited screening nature of the motion to reopen review. There is every indication from the text of its decision that the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Ghadessi had not established a <em>prima facie </em>case was due solely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>the Board\u2019s weighing of the quality, rather than the sufficiency, of her evidence. The BIA\u2019s short decision emphasized that Ghadessi had not presented \u201cany impartial, objective evidence\u201d nor \u201cany corroborating material independent of her own statements or those of family members or close friends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">In fact, although the BIA correctly noted that the State Department opinion was not binding upon it, the BIA never contradicted the opinion letter\u2019s statement that Ghadessi had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of a well-founded fear of persecution if her allegations were regarded as true. Rather the BIA strongly indicated that it found her allegations to be <em>untrue, </em>or at least insufficiently corroborated by other evidence; a finding which the BIA is prohibited from making in considering a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Furthermore, the BIA applied the wrong standard in reviewing Ghadessi\u2019s motion to reopen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The BIA required Ghadessi to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of \u201ca realistic likelihood of persecution\u201d were she to return to Iran. By phrasing the test in terms of \u201clikelihood\u201d of persecution, the BIA was requiring Ghadessi to demonstrate the \u201cprobability\u201d of persecution. <em>See Garcia-Ramos, </em>775 F.2d at 1373 (withholding of deportation statute requires showing of a \u201cprobability\u201d or <em>\u201clikelihood\u201d </em>of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">This \u201cprobability\u201d or \u201clikelihood\u201d standard has been expressly rejected by this court in considering petitions for asylum. The \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard applied to claims for asylum under section 208(a) of the Refugee Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), is \u201cmore generous\u201d than the \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d standard applied to petitions for mandatory withholding of deportation under section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h). <em>Bolanos-Hernandez v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1277, 1282 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">The \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard applied to claims for asylum includes a subjective and an objective component. <em>Diaz-Escobar v. INS, </em>782 F.2d 1488, 1492 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Hemandez-Ortiz, </em>777 F.2d at 513. An applicant satisfies the subjective component if she shows that her fear is genuine. <em>Diaz-Escobar, </em>782 F.2d at 1492. The objective component is satisfied if persecution is a \u201creasonable possibility,\u201d <em>Hernandez-Ortiz, </em>777 F.2d at 513; <em>Garcia-Ramos, </em>775 F.2d at 1374. There is no requirement of a showing of a \u201clikelihood\u201d of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">\u25a0 Finally, the BIA erred by simply noting the absence of independent corroborating evidence and failing to give <em>any </em>consideration to the substance of Ghadessi\u2019s allegations in her affidavit. On a motion to reopen, the BIA must indicate both individualized and cumulative consideration of all of the relevant evidence presented in support of the motion. The BIA decision is devoid of any such analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Merits of the Prima Facie Case Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Applying the proper standard and accepting Ghadessi\u2019s affidavit as true, Ghadessi has established a <em>prima facie </em>showing of a well-founded fear of persecution. She has presented <em>\u201cspecific </em>facts that give rise to an inference that the applicant has been or has good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution.\u201d <em>See Del Valle v. INS, </em>776 F.2d 1407, 1411 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">In her affidavit, Ghadessi has described her extensive and active involvement in a public campaign to protest and discredit the Khomeini regime in Iran.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) asserts that no evidence was submitted showing her activities had come to the attention of the Iranian government, she had produced evidence from which an inference can be drawn that Iranian government authorities might be aware of her anti-Khomeini activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">In <em>Garcia-Ramos, </em>775 F.2d at 1373, we noted that the petitioner had not presented <em>any </em>evidence that the El Salvadoran government was aware of his political activities. However, we found that, owing to his extensive anti-government activities, he was statutorily eligible for asylum because he <em>might </em>have come to the attention of the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The affidavit evidence presented by Ghadessi is much stronger than that of the petitioner in <em>Garcia-Ramos. </em>Her allegation that her parents were detained and interrogated by Iranian authorities on three occasions regarding her activities indicates that her political beliefs may have come to the attention of the Iranian government. The fact that her parents have been harassed and actually detained due to the government\u2019s apparent suspicion of her dissident activities lends \u201cconsiderable strength\u201d to her claim that she fears persecution. <em>See id. </em>(evidence of government harassment of petitioner or family \u201c[ojbviously\u201d would \u201clend considerable strength\u201d to asylum claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The INS dismisses these interrogation sessions, saying that the questioning of her parents by Iranian authorities merely evidenced government curiousity as to her whereabouts and her delay in returning to Iran. This is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Ghadessi\u2019s affidavit states the interrogation of her parents concerned \u201cmy whereabouts in the United States and whether they <em>were aware of my involvement in Anti-Khomeini organizations. </em>The revolutionary guards have told them that I should return to Iran to clear my name and undergo questioning.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is significant that Ghadessi does not state that her parents were interrogated as to <em>whether </em>she was involved in anti-Khomeini organizations, but whether they were <em>\u201caware\u201d </em>of her involvement in such activities. This statement at least implies that the government may know of her activities. Most importantly, the suggestion by the Revolutionary Guards that she needs to \u201cclear her name\u201d can only be interpreted as evidence that the Iranian government suspects her lack of loyalty to the current regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">Furthermore, Ghadessi submitted evidence giving rise to a reasonable fear on Ghadessi\u2019s part that the Khomeini government might act upon its suspicions of her political opposition. She described the repressive conditions in Iran, which, although not sufficient in itself to demonstrate individualized fear of persecution, is a factor to be considered. <em>See Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>767 F.2d at 1283 n. 11. In particular, she noted the unfavorable attitude toward female activists in that radical Islamic environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">Most importantly, the fact her own parents have been detained by the Revolutionary Guards for interrogation regarding her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>activities, and that the government believes it necessary for her to \u201cclear her name\u201d lays a strong foundation for a reasonable fear of persecution. Her parents present in Iran have warned her not to return as she would encounter trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Lastly, the Department of State\u2019s advisory opinion, presumably based on the Department\u2019s knowledge of the Iranian situation, stated that she has established a well-founded fear of persecution, assuming her allegations are true. Although this opinion is not binding upon the BIA, it is an important evidentiary factor to be weighed. <em>See Zavala-Bonilla v. INS, </em>730 F.2d 562, 567 (9th Cir.1984) (State Department\u2019s advisory opinion, stating that if petitioner\u2019s allegations were true, she had a well-founded fear of persecution, was entitled to deference).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">This evidence may or may not be sufficient to establish Ghadessi\u2019s eligibility for asylum after a full hearing on the merits, but it is sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of a well-founded fear of persecution in order to obtain a reopening of deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">This case is remanded to the BIA to conduct a deportation hearing allowing the presentation of evidence on Ghadessi\u2019s statutory eligibility for asylum and her suitability for a favorable exercise of discretion by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-12\">. \"All requests for political asylum are also considered applications for withholding of deportation pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h).\u201d <em>Aviles-Torres v. INS, </em>790 F.2d 1433, 1435 (9th Cir. 1986); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3(b). As we hold that Ghadessi has established a prima facie case for asylum mandating reopening of proceedings, she should also be allowed to present evidence in support of a claim for prohibition of deportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b879-13\">. If we were reviewing a BIA decision denying asylum after a deportation hearing, we would apply a two-part standard of review. First, we would evaluate whether there is substantial evidence of a well-founded fear of persecution, i.e., whether the alien is statutorily eligible for asylum. Second, we would determine whether the BIA abused its discretion by its ultimate decision denying asylum. <em>Garcia-Ramos v. INS, </em>775 F.2d 1370, 1373 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-21\">However, in a motion to reopen, the petitioner need only establish a <em>prima facie </em>showing. Although this is analogous in some ways to the statutory eligibility showing, there is no evidence in the record to review and we must accept as true the factual statements contained in the alien\u2019s affidavit. Consequently, our review is limited to an evaluation of whether the BIA\u2019s determination on the <em>prima facie </em>case showing was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b880-7\">. Ghadessi also presented a letter from an acquaintance, Dr. Ahmad Azadeh, written on the stationery of an anti-Khomeini organization, which attested to her involvement in the organization\u2019s activities and stated that her life would be endangered if she were returned to Iran. The BIA properly noted that this letter was not entitled to probative weight. The letter writer\u2019s qualifications were not stated, and no factual basis was indicated for his assertion that she would be persecuted in Iran.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b880-12\">. As we noted in <em>Hernandez-Ortiz, </em>777 F.2d at 514 n. 5, direct corroborative evidence of a substantive fear of persecution is not necessary even in the full hearing on the merits of a petition for asylum because \"the imposition of such a requirement would result in the deportation of many people whose lives are genuinely in jeopardy.\u201d <em>Bolanos-Hernandez v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1277, 1285 (9th Cir.1984). This court has recognized the impracticability of requiring refugees fleeing their homeland to present evidence other than their own credible testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b881-7\">. The argument that Ghadessi failed to preserve this issue on appeal is without merit. Although Ghadessi\u2019s brief did not expressly attack the evidentiary standard applied by the BIA, she did challenge the BIA\u2019s decision that she had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for asylum. We cannot review the BIA\u2019s ultimate decision denying the existence of a <em>prima facie </em>case of a well-founded fear of persecution without also considering whether the standard applied to evaluate Ghadessi\u2019s petition was the correct one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b881-16\">. The recent case of <em>Larimi v. INS, </em>782 F.2d 1494 (9th Cir.1986), although superficially similar to the instant case, is in fact distinguishable. In <em>Larimi, </em>an Iranian national, who became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>involved in anti-Khomeini political activities subsequent to his initial deportation proceedings, subsequently sought to reopen proceedings to apply for asylum and withholding of deportation. We affirmed the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen. <em>Id. </em>at 1497.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The evidence alleged in support of the prima facie case by Ghadessi is far stronger than that submitted in <em>Larimi. </em>In <em>Larimi, </em>the petitioner had only a casual connection with an anti-Khomeini organization in the Bay Area and he offered only speculation that such a connection would result in his persecution if returned to Iran. <em>Id. </em>at 1497. Ghadessi, by contrast, has described extensive and active involvement in anti-Khomeini activities, not only participating in demonstrations but organizing them, as well as giving public interviews to criticize the Iranian regime. More importantly, Ghadessi stated that her parents had been interrogated by the Revolutionary Guards concerning her involvement in anti-Khomeini activities, with the Guards\u2019 stating that she needed to clear her name. Finally, the State Department advisory opinion confirmed that she had shown a well-founded fear of persecution. None of these important factors were present in the <em>Larimi </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b883-10\">JAMESON, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aem\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">I concur in the conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of a well founded fear of persecution and in most of Judge Beezer\u2019s well considered opinion. I have some reservation, however, with respect to the holding that the determination of whether an alien has established a <em>prima facie </em>case is nondiscretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">I recognize that there is some confusion in the decisions with respect to the standard of abuse of discretion. As Judge Beezer has noted, in <em>Larimi v. INS, </em>782 F.2d 1494, 1496, the court held that review is limited to considering whether the BIA\u2019s \u201cdetermination concerning the prima facie case is correct.\u201d On the other hand, the court also noted in <em>Larimi </em>that the BIA\u2019s decision as to whether Larimi had established a <em>prima facie </em>case is reviewed for an \u201cabuse of discretion,\u201d citing <em>Maroufi v. INS, </em>772 F.2d 597, 599, and <em>Vasquez v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 598, 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">The case most nearly in point factually is the recent case of <em>Aviles-Torres v. I.N.S., </em>790 F.2d 1433, 1437 (9th Cir.1986), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-15\">The Board also improperly concluded that Aviles-Torres did not establish prima facie eligibility for asylum. Because he presented a prima facie case for withholding of deportation, he also satisfied the more generous \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum. <em>See Bolanos-Hernandez v. INS, </em>767 F.2d 1277, 1288 (9th Cir.1984). Although the Board has broad discretion in considering petitions to reopen for discretionary relief, <em>see INS v. Rios-Pineda, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2101, the Board in this case failed to articulate any legitimate concerns that would justify an exercise of discretion unfavorable to the petitioner. We have held that it should do so. <em>See Hernandez-Ortiz, </em>777 F.2d at 518-19. Moreover, no factors similar to those which prompted denial of the petition in <em>Rios-Pineda </em>appear in the record in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-16\">We hold that the petitioner should have the opportunity fully to establish his case and to receive thoughtful consideration of it. The BIA\u2019s denial of reopening in view of the evidence presented was an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-17\">As in <em>Aviles-Torres, </em>the BIA\u2019s denial of reopening in this case, in view of the evidence presented, was an abuse of discretion. The case should be remanded to reopen deportation proceedings for presentation of evidence on Ghadessi\u2019s eligibility for asylum.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b883-18\">POOLE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AaB\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">I agree with Judge Jameson\u2019s view concerning this court\u2019s standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>when the BIA denies an alien\u2019s petition to reopen deportation proceedings. However, because I believe that my colleagues incorrectly analyze the merits of Ghadessi\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Preliminarily, I note that a majority of the panel agrees that we must review for an abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen Ghadessi\u2019s deportation proceedings. As an appellate court, the resolution of what standard of review to apply to a given issue is a fundamental prerequisite to any further analysis of the case. Because of this importance, I offer my own views to support the conclusion that we must review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of Ghadessi\u2019s motion to reopen on the ground that she had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Motions to reopen deportation proceedings are not expressly provided for by statute, but are allowed pursuant to administrative regulations. <em>INS v. Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 140-41, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 1029-30, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (per curiam). The regulations are construed so that the granting of a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is discretionary with the BIA. <em>See INS v. Rios-Pineda, </em>471 U.S. 444, 105 S.Ct. 2098, 2102, 85 L.Ed.2d 452 (1985); <em>INS v. Phinpathya, </em>464 U.S. 183, 188 n. 6, 104 S.Ct. 584, 588 n. 6, 78 L.Ed.2d 401 (1984). This court reviews the BIA's decision denying reopening to see whether the BIA abused its discretion. <em>Aviles-Torres v. INS, </em>790 F.2d 1433, 1435 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Judge Beezer, however, believes that when the BIA denies an alien\u2019s motion to reopen deportation proceedings to apply for asylum on the basis that the alien has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, then this standard vanishes and is replaced by a new standard whereby this court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision to determine whether that decision is \u201ccorrect.\u201d Opinion at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Besides running contrary to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Larimi v. INS, </em>782 F.2d 1494, 1496 (9th Cir.1986) (when the BIA restricts its decision to whether the alien had established a <em>prima facie </em>case, \u201c[i]t is this action that we must review for an abuse of discretion.\u201d), this position strays from the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in this area. As the Court has cautioned, reviewing courts must not improvidently encroach on the authority which the immigration statutes have conferred on the Attorney General and his delegates. <em>See Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. at 144, 101 S.Ct. at 1031. As previously noted, the granting of a motion to reopen deportation proceedings clearly is discretionary with the BIA.' <em>See RiosPineda, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2102. Whether the basis for the BIA\u2019s decision is the failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case or the further exercise of the BIA\u2019s discretion beyond the <em>prima facie </em>case, the BIA is still performing the function which by statute it is authorized to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">While this court does review the BIA\u2019s decision, our review is limited to whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying reopening. The BIA abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law. <em>Israel v. INS, </em>785 F.2d 738, 740 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see Aviles-Torres, </em>790 F.2d at 1435. The Supreme Court has made clear that this standard is to be followed by the federal courts and that \u201cit is not for the judiciary to usurp Congress\u2019 grant of authority to the Attorney General by applying what approximates <em>de novo </em>appellate review.\u201d <em>Rios-Pineda, </em>105 S.Ct. at 2103; <em>see also Jong Ha Wang, </em>450 U.S. at 144, 101 S.Ct. at 1031 (definition of standard for suspension of deportation committed to Attorney General and his delegates \u201cand their construction <em>and application </em>of th[ese] standardes] should not be overturned by a reviewing court simply because it may prefer another interpretation of the statute.\u201d) (emphasis added). Heeding this admonition, I believe that we must examine the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Ghadessi failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of asylum to see if that conclusion was arbitrary, irrational or contrary to law. Therefore, I agree with Judge Jameson\u2019s conclusion regarding this court\u2019s standard of review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>although I disagree with his analysis of the facts under this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Even reviewing Ghadessi\u2019s claim <em>de novo, </em>she has failed to present enough evidence to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for asylum, namely that she has a well-founded fear of persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ghadessi must present objective evidence demonstrating that persecution is a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d should she be forced to return to Iran.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">To support her claim, Ghadessi submitted a two-page affidavit. In it Ghadessi states that due to her public political activities in this country, \u201cI am sure I have been placed on the Revolutionary Committee \u2018Black List\u2019 and will be persecuted if I am forced to return to Iran.\u201d Ghadessi, however, provides only one concrete example of her public activities. On October 27, 1984, she helped lead a demonstration in front of the Netherlands Embassy in San Francisco. Although the I.S.F. also demonstrated earlier in front of the San Francisco office of Melli Bank, Ghadessi\u2019s affidavit does not state that she participated in that demonstration.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Even if one stretches Ghadessi\u2019s affidavit so as to include her participation in the Melli Bank demonstration, there emerges only two instances of public political activity. From these two instances and Ghadessi\u2019s generalized characterization of her activities as being \u201cseveral\u201d and \u201cfrequent\u201d we are asked to draw the inference that she was so spotlighted that it would be reasonable to conclude that the Iranian government was thereby made aware of her anti-Khomeini sentiments. I do not believe there is any basis for such an inference from the dearth of specific information provided by Ghadessi, especially in light of the fact that her alleged activities all occurred in the midst of a crowd and in the United States. <em>Cf. Garda-Ramos v. INS, </em>775 F.2d 1370 (9th Cir.1985) (political activities occurred <em>in El Salvador).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">Ghadessi\u2019s strongest evidence suggesting a possibility of persecution concerns the questioning of Ghadessi\u2019s parents by Iranian authorities. Because this evidence is so important, I quote it in full from Ghadessi\u2019s affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-12\">To confirm my fears that the Islamic authorities were aware of my political activities, my parents have been questioned on three separate occassions [sic] on my whereabouts in the United States and whether they were aware of my involvement in Anti-Khomeini organizations. The Revolutionary Guards have told them that I should return to Iran to clear my name and undergo questioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aub\">The majority extrapolates from the fact that the Iranian officials inquired <em>whether </em>Ghadessi was involved in any anti-Khomeini activities and their suggestion \u2014 accompanied by no threats \u2014 that Ghadessi should return to Iran to clear her name and undergo questioning, a certainty that this \u201ccan only be interpreted as evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>the Iranian government suspects her lack of loyalty to the current regime.\u201d Opinion at 808. I strongly disagree with such an interpretation. First, Ghadessi does not indicate the time frame in which these encounters occurred, i.e., whether all of some of the encounters occurred prior to 1980 when Ghadessi first joined the I.S.F. or after her affiliation with that group. Second, the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 questions concerning Ghadessi suggest that the Iranian government is trying to find out about Ghadessi\u2019s whereabouts and activities. It is significant that nowhere in Ghadessi\u2019s affidavit is it stated, nor can it be inferred from what is set forth, that the government had information about Ghadessi\u2019s I.S.F. activities and was merely confronting her parents with the hope that they would confirm such reports. No pressure appears to have been applied by the Guards to Ghadessi's parents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the fact that the Guards believe that Ghadessi should return to Iran to \u201cclear her name\u201d may just as easily stem from the fact that she has been domiciled in a country considered hostile by the Iranian government as from any concrete information concerning her lack of loyalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">But even so, the majority reaches its conclusion only by drawing arguable inferences from the meager evidence presented. This ignores the proper allocation of functions between this court and the BIA. Surely, the BIA\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was within the realm of reason and was not arbitrary, irrational or contrary to law. The majority may prefer its own result of inference-drawing; but Congress and the Supreme Court have placed that function in the hands of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Ghadessi\u2019s claim fails because it is not sufficiently specific.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She had the burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case that she has a <em>well-founded </em>fear of persecution. The BIA found her evidence too speculative to sustain this burden. That was that body\u2019s assigned role. The majority\u2019s holding usurps that role. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse the discretion vested in it when it denied the petition, and I would affirm its decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\">. I disagree with the majority that the BIA in its opinion applied the wrong standard in reviewing Ghadessi\u2019s motion to reopen. The BIA appeared to recognize that there is a difference between the \"clear probability\u201d standard for prohibition of deportation and the \"well-founded fear\" standard for claims of asylum. Instead of requiring a clear probability of persecution, the BIA recognized a lesser standard of \"realistic likelihood.\u201d While the BIA did not mouth the specific words used by this court, its decision clearly evidenced and applied a more lenient standard to Chadessi\u2019s claim. <em>See Chatila v. INS, </em>770 F.2d 786, 790 (9th Cir.1985) (BIA recognized difference between two forms of relief when it stated that its conclusion as to asylum claim would be the same \"whether we apply a standard of \u2018clear probability,\u2019 \u2018good reason,\u2019 or \u2018realistic likelihood\u2019\u201d). Because I conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Ghadessi did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution, I would affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-14\">Even were I to agree with the majority that the BIA applied an incorrect standard to Ghadessi\u2019s petition, I could not agree that Ghadessi is entitled to reopening of her deportation proceedings. When this court determines that the BIA has applied too strict a standard when reviewing an alien\u2019s asylum claim, the proper course is not to determine the case <em>de novo </em>but to remand to the BIA for it to reconsider the alien\u2019s petition under the correct standard. <em>See Martinez-Sanchez v. INS, </em>794 F.2d 1396, 1400 (9th Cir.1986); <em>Maroufi v. INS, </em>772 F.2d 597, 601 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">. In her affidavit, Ghadessi claims, \u201cMy parents fear that I will be in trouble if I return to Iran.\" This warning is not entitled to probative weight. The basis for such a fear is not explained, nor does the affidavit explain what type or degree of trouble Ghadessi\u2019s parents were talking about.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">. Moreover, the fact that the Department of State's Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs (BHRHA) issued a favorable opinion letter does not alter this conclusion. Such an advisory opinion is not binding on the BIA but is merely a factor to be considered by it. <em>Matter of Exilus, </em>18 I &amp; N Dec. 276, 279 (BIA 1982). Furthermore, this advisory is conditional; if the allegations were factually sustained, a <em>prima facie </em>case of well-founded fear would be presented. That opinion does not conclude that such facts were established. The BIA did consider the State Department\u2019s advisory opinion in making its determination, but found the supporting foundation lacking.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
