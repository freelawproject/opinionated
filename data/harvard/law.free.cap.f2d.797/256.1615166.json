This assumed an actionable injury and we intended no opinion as to the nature of the injury required to give rise to an actionable claim. <em>See Adams v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>783 F.2d 589, 593 (5th Cir.1986); Annot. 64 A.L.R.2d 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-21\">A member of the Court in active service having requested a poll on the reconsideration of this cause en banc, and a majority of the judges in active service not having voted in favor of it, it is ordered that the mandate issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">Before CLARK, Chief Judge, GEE, RUBIN, REAVLEY, POLITZ, RANDALL, JOHNSON, WILLIAMS, GARWOOD, JOLLY, HIGGINBOTHAM, DAVIS, HILL, and JONES.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-23\">JOLLY, Circuit Judge, with whom CLARK, Chief Judge, GEE, GARWOOD, HIGGINBOTHAM, DAVIS and JONES, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting from denial of petition for rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-24\">The panel\u2019s modification of the original opinion eliminates potential ambiguity by expressly holding that there must be an actionable injury before a seaman can recover under the Jones Act. To my understanding, this change means that a seaman must show either a traumatic event giving rise to physical or mental injury, or physical injury resulting from the incremental effect of harmful substances. The modification eliminates the possibility that a seaman may recover for cancerphobia, without showing either physical injury or a traumatic event, simply because he served on a ship containing asbestos. Nevertheless, our court holds for the first time that a seaman may recover under the Jones act for only <em>fear </em>of contracting cancer, a fear not based on probability. The ramifications of this holding are worthy of en banc consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-25\">I therefore respectfully dissent from the denial of en banc consideration of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
