Most of his complaints \u2014 those of the stop and search of his automobile, of the validity of a search warrant for his motel room, of the composition of the venire, of unexpected unwelcome evidence which his attorney ploughed up in the course of cross-examination, and of the sufficiency of evidence to support one of his convictions \u2014 do not merit discussion.

Because of its singularity, we discuss the remaining point briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">The jury retired with thirteen members, the judge having overlooked discharging the alternate juror \u2014 who, the court found, was present when the foreman was elected (apparently by acclamation) but not when any discussion of the case had commenced. Her presence as a supernumerary was discerned before discussion began and she was discharged. The court found that her presence had no effect on the actions of the jury in convicting Guevara and that there was no reasonable probability that her presence affected their discussion or vote. These fact findings are not clearly erroneous, and they satisfy the demands of our existing authority. <em>United States v. Allison, </em>481 F.2d 468 (5th Cir.1973).
