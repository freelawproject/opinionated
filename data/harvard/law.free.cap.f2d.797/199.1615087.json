The district court dismissed the indictment, ruling that it failed to state a federal offense because the Chief Minister was not a \u201cforeign official, official guest, or internationally protected person\u201d as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116. We conclude that the target of this conspiracy was \u201cdesignated\u201d an \u201cofficial guest\u201d so as to establish a federal offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1116 and 1117. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-20\">The facts are, for the most part, undisputed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In May 1985, Bhajan Lai, the Chief Minister of the state of Haryana, India, came to New Orleans for eye surgery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before his arrival the Indian embassy notified the State Department of his impending visit, expressing concern that Lai, a Hindu, might be the target of an attack by Sikh extremists. Although State Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>personnel did not follow their customary paperwork procedures for designating Lai as an official guest, they initiated security measures to protect Lai. The State Department directed its local special agent, named Nagel, to alert the New Orleans Police Department of Lai\u2019s expected arrival, which he did. Several days later the FBI notified the State Department that two Sikhs had attempted to recruit someone to assassinate Lai. Nagel, as instructed by his superiors in Washington, D.C., relayed this information to the New Orleans police and requested them to increase the number of officers assigned to protect Lai. The State Department directed Nagel to continue monitoring the situation. The following day the FBI reported to the State Department that the two Sikhs had purchased a weapon in Alabama and were en route to New Orleans to assassinate Lai. Nagel notified the police and then participated in the ensuing events. That evening three of the defendants were seen in the vicinity of Lai\u2019s hotel. They were detained and later arrested. During that time, one of them told police officers that the members of the group were \u201ctogether\u201d and that they had come to \u201churt him.\u201d Subsequently, the State Department dispatched a detail of seventeen special agents to further protect Lai.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The Government indicted the five defendants for conspiring to kill Lai in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1116 and 1117. Section 1116 makes killing or attempting to kill a \u201cforeign official, official guest, or an internationally protected person\u201d a federal crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 1117, conspiring to violate \u00a7 1116 is also a federal crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The superseding indictment alleges that Lai was a \u201cforeign official, internationally protected person, and official guest\u201d as defined in \u00a7 1116. The district court entered an order dismissing the indictment on the grounds that Lai did not fall within any of these three classifications. The Government brings this appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. The Government does not appeal the court\u2019s ruling that Lai did not qualify as an \u201cinternationally protected person,\u201d but does challenge the court\u2019s determination that Lai was not an \u201cofficial guest\u201d or a \u201cforeign official.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The issue is whether the Secretary of State, through the State Department\u2019s actions, \u201cdesignated\u201d Lai an \u201cofficial guest\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1116.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 1116(b)(6) defines an \u201cofficial guest\u201d as \u201ca citizen or national of a foreign country present in the United States as an official guest of the Government of the United States pursuant to designation as such by the Secretary of State.\u201d The defendants argue that Chief Minister Lai does not qualify as an \u201cofficial guest\u201d because the State Department failed to complete the paperwork required by its internal procedures. The Secretary of State promulgated these procedures pursuant to his statutory rule-making authority. 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2658. Under these rules, the Secretary delegated the task of designating official guests to the Chief of Protocol. 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.4 (1985). The Chief of Protocol receives requests for such designations through regular State Department channels and formally confers this status on foreign visitors by placing their names on an official guest roster.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The Government contends that the State Department\u2019s internal procedures should not be dispositive of Lai\u2019s status. Despite formal inaction, the United States avers that \u201cthe actual treatment of Chief Minister Lai as an official guest was sufficient to confer federal jurisdiction over the attempt to murder him.\u201d It contends that the State Department\u2019s activities in protecting Lai rise to the level of \u201cdesignation\u201d as an \u201cofficial guest.\u201d These actions evince the State Department\u2019s special interest in Lai, distinguishing him from the ordinary foreign visitor. The Department treated him as an \u201cofficial guest,\u201d although he was not formally named one. Furthermore, had the Chief of Protocol received a request, Lai\u2019s name would have been placed on the \u201cofficial guest roster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Defendants respond that it is immaterial whether Lai \u201ccould have been, would have been, or was treated\u201d as an \u201cofficial guest.\u201d There is no evidence that the Secretary of State or Chief of Protocol made this designation, or that anyone requested them to designate Lai as an \u201cofficial guest.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants suggest that \u201cdesignation\u201d implies a formal procedure, and there is no indication that Congress intended an uncommon definition of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The United States suggests in addition that the State Department\u2019s non-compliance with its internal procedures is irrelevant to this criminal proceeding. It relies on <em>United States v. Caceres, </em>440 U.S. 741, 99 S.Ct. 1465, 59 L.Ed.2d 733 (1979), where an Internal Revenue Service agent failed to comply with IRS regulations on the electronic monitoring of conversations. The Government sought to introduce the tapes of several conversations as evidence in the taxpayer's criminal trial. The Court held that where neither the Constitution nor federal law mandate the procedures, a court need not enforce these procedures in a criminal trial. Here, the statute does not mandate the procedures adopted by the Secretary of State and Congress did not provide guidelines by which the Secretary should make the designation. The whole structure was a departmental project. In addition, the defendants have no Constitutional, i.e. due process, rights in seeing that the State Department followed its internal procedures; to sustain a conviction under this statute, the Government need not show the defendants knew of the victim\u2019s \u201cofficial guest\u201d status. The defendants respond that <em>Caceres </em>is inapposite because it involves an evidentiary, not a jurisdictional, issue. They reiterate that for jurisdiction to exist under \u00a7 1116 on the basis of the victim\u2019s \u201cofficial guest\u201d status, the Chief of Protocol must have granted that status.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">This is a case of first impression. \u201cAs in all cases of statutory construction, our task is to interpret the words of [the statute] in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve.\u201d <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., </em>441 U.S. 600, 608, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979). More than a decade ago, the Congress recognized the nation\u2019s special obligations under international law to protect certain foreign visitors, yet at that time no federal jurisdiction existed to permit the government to act directly to discharge those obligations. For the prosecution of those who perpetrated violence against foreign visitors on United States soil, the United States had to rely on the cooperation of state authorities, with no way to assure the foreign country that such cooperation would be forthcoming or that the local resources would be adequate. H.Rep. 1268, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1972). The law establishes federal jurisdiction, concurrent with the states, to proceed against those who commit violent acts against foreign officials, their family members, or against official guests, and thus \u201cadversely affect the foreign relations of the United States.\u201d Declaration of Policy, Pub.L. 92-539, 86 Stat. 1070 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The original House Bill covered only \u201cforeign officials.\u201d Then, before the Senate considered the legislation, the Israeli Olympic athletes were murdered in Munich. In reaction to this terrorist outrage, Senator McClellan confected the \u201cofficial guest\u201d category, noting that \u201chad the situs of the tragedy been the United States, no federal jurisdiction would exist despite the fact that our responsibilities would parallel those which exist vis-a-vis visiting diplomatic personnel.\u201d The Committee agreed with Senator McClellan and added in its committee report that the official guest provision not only would cover foreign visitors such as Olympians, but would \u201calso operate to protect the rights of visiting artists, academic and scientific groups, and other groups <em>and individuals who ought not be beyond the pale of Federal concern </em>S.Rep. 1105, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 9 1972, <em>reprinted in </em>U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 4316, 4319 (emphasis added). Congress accepted the Senate amendment, thus vesting wide discretion in the Secretary of State to determine who should be accorded \u201cofficial guest\u201d status.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Defendants rest their argument on the failure of the Chief of Protocol to designate Lai formally as an \u201cofficial guest.\u201d We therefore direct our attention to the requirements that must be satisfied to effect a \u201cdesignation,\u201d interpreting the statute according to its plain language as we customarily do unless a clear, contrary legislative intention is apparent. <em>United States v. Apfelbaum, </em>445 U.S. 115, 121, 100 S.Ct. 948, 952, 63 L.Ed.2d 250 (1980). <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>defines \u201cdesignate,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201cto choose and s\u00e9t apart\u201d or \u201cto distinguish as to class.\u201d The essence of \u201cdesignation,\u201d in this context, is distinguishing one class of foreign visitors \u2014 \u201cofficial guests\u201d \u2014 from other foreign visitors. The question is whether the State Department decided to place Lai in this special class. The record shows that the State Department took substantial measures to insure Chief Minister Lai\u2019s safety while he was in the United States. Even before Lai\u2019s arrival, the State Department had initiated communication with the New Orleans Police Department; their local agent continued to inform the police and to monitor the situation as it unfolded. Then, the State Department went so far as to dispatch special agents to protect Lai against a Sikh attack. It is obvious that the State Department does not take such measures on behalf of ordinary foreign visitors. This conduct in itself demonstrates that decisions were made within the Department to place Lai within a class receiving special treatment. We find this conduct more than adequately demonstrates the State Department\u2019s special interest in this foreign visitor, one whose presence in the United States is of significance to our nation\u2019s foreign affairs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">We have no difficulty concluding that the State Department can confer \u201cofficial guest\u201d status not solely through ministerial acts, but by its informal conduct as well. The statutory language and legislative history do not indicate that Congress was concerned with the method by which the Secretary of State designates foreign visitors as \u201cofficial guests.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To the contrary, the record shows that, in practice, the Chief of Protocol\u2019s formal designation does not dictate when and what federal resources will be expended in the treatment of foreign visitors on our soil. Sensitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>diplomatic considerations animate such decisions as these.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">We are satisfied that Congress intended to extend federal prosecutorial jurisdiction to cases such as this one. An Indian dignitary was on United States soil. A Hindu, he was a member of a group that had been attacked by Sikh extremists in the recent past. Had harm come to him in the United States, such a thing was no matter of governmental indifference and might well have affected our foreign relations with India. In light of this, it would be both short-sighted and small-minded to turn the question of federal jurisdiction on the completion of a ministerial task, when Congress intended that federal prosecutorial machinery be available in matters implicating the conduct of this country\u2019s foreign affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s order dismissing the indictment and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\">. To the extent any facts Eire disputed, on review \"we take all the allegations of the indictment as true.\u201d <em>Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 337, 343 n. 16, 72 S.Ct. 329, 332 n.16, 96 L.Ed 367 (1952); <em>United States v. Barta, </em>635 F.2d 999 (2d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 998, 101 S.Ct. 1703, 68 L.Ed.2d 199 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-23\">. The reader is assured that this is a real case, not a moot one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">. Section 1116(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\u201cWhoever kills or attempts to kill a foreign official, official guest, or internationally protected person shall be punished as provided under sections 1111, 1112, and 1113 of this title, except that any such person who is found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life, and any such person who is found guilty of attempted murder shall be imprisoned for not more than twenty years.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\">. Section 1117 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"A8o\">If two or more persons conspire to violate section 1111, 1114, or 1116 of this title, and one or more of such persons do any overt act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\">. Because we ultimately conclude that the Secretary of State designated Lai an \u201cofficial guest,\u201d we do not reach the question whether Lai qualified as a \"foreign official.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b276-6\">. Defendants also note there is no evidence that Lai was ever invited by the Government. We find no requirement in the language of the statute or in the legislative history that the foreign visitor must have been invited by the Government to obtain \"official guest\u201d status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b277-6\">. Today\u2019s case involves State Department conduct occurring before and during an alleged criminal conspiracy. We do not pass on the issue whether, through formal procedures or through conduct, the Secretary of State may designate an individual an \"official guest\u201d after the occurrence of the criminal acts in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Caceres, </em>440 U.S. 741, 99 S.Ct. 1465, 59 L.Ed.2d 733 (1979), supports our conclusion. <em>Caceres </em>teaches that a court need not enforce an agency\u2019s procedures in a criminal trial, when neither federal law nor the Constitution mandate those procedures. Today\u2019s case involves only statutory interpretation. We conclude that \u00a7 1116 allows the Secretary of State to make \u201cofficial guest\u201d designations either through State Department conduct or through the Department\u2019s formal procedures. Thus, <em>Caceres </em>more than assures us that we are not left at the mercy of the State Department\u2019s internal procedures in this criminal proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
