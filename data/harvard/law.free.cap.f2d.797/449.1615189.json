The Secretary of Health and Human Services (the \u201cSecretary\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s reversal of his determination that the \u201cconcentrated care unit\u201d at St. Elizabeth Hospital (\u201cSt. Elizabeth\u2019s\u201d) is not entitled to reimbursement as a \u201cspecial care hospital inpatient unit.\u201d St. Elizabeth\u2019s appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Secretary\u2019s determination that earnings on funds that it pays into an employee health benefit trust fund must be used to offset interest expense that the hospital accounts for as an \u201callowable cost\u201d under Medicare. We reverse as to the concentrated care unit on the ground that the Secretary\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. As for the investment income offset, we cannot affirm on the grounds offered by the Secretary. Therefore, <em>see SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), we remand this portion of the case to HHS for further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">I. THE CONCENTRATED CARE UNIT</p>\n<p id=\"A3X\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">The Medicare program, Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 <em>et seq., </em>provides hospital insurance benefits to certain classes of people, primarily the elderly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Health care facilities certified as \u201cproviders of services\u201d are reimbursed by the federal government for services rendered Medicare beneficiaries, either directly or through a fiscal intermediary. St. Elizabeth\u2019s is a Medicare provider of services receiving reimbursement through Blue Cross of Wisconsin (\u201cBlue Cross\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-17\">For care provided a Medicare beneficiary, St. Elizabeth\u2019s is entitled to be reimbursed the lesser of either the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of the services or the \u201ccustomary charge\u201d for such services. 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u00a7 1395f(b). Congress has charged the Secretary with promulgating regulations governing computation of the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of services, requiring that any method incorporate accurate cost accounting and an accurate allocation of costs between Medicare and non-Medicare patients:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">The reasonable cost of any service shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used, and the items to be included, in determining such costs for various types or classes of institutions, agencies, and services____ Such regulations may provide for determination of the costs of services on a per diem, per unit, per capita, or other basis, may provide for using different methods in different circumstances, may provide for the use of estimates of costs of particular items of services, and may provide for the use of charges or a percentage of charges where this method reasonably reflects the costs. Such regulations shall ... take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services in order that, under the methods of determining costs, the costs with respect to individuals covered by the insurance programs established by this subchapter will not be borne by individuals not so covered, and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by such insurance programs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The Secretary has promulgated \u201capportionment\u201d regulations that detail how to allocate costs between Medicare and non-Medicare patients \u201cso that the share borne by the program is based upon actual services received by program beneficiaries,\u201d 42 C.F.B. \u00a7 405.452(b). Because St. Elizabeth\u2019s has more than one hundred beds, it must use the \u201cdepartmental\u201d method of apportionment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.452(c)(2). Under this method<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> all units within a hospital are classified as either \u201croutine patient care areas\u201d or \u201cintensive care units, coronary care units, and other special care inpatient hospital units\u201d (herinafter \u201cspecial care units\u201d). A special care unit must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">[T]he unit must be in a hospital, must be one in which the care required is extraordinary and on a concentrated and continuous basis and must be physically identifiable as separate from general patient care areas. There shall be specific written policies for each of such designated units which include, but are not limited to burn, coronary care, pulmonary care, trauma, and intensive care units but exclude postoperative recovery rooms, postanesthesia recovery rooms, or maternity labor rooms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-15\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.452(d)(10).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">The \u201creasonable\u201d daily cost of services provided to Medicare patients in either a special care unit or the routine care areas is based on an \u201caverage cost per diem.\u201d The average cost per diem is computed by dividing the total cost of \u201croutine service\u201d (all services save those provided by such \u201cancillary\u201d departments as x-ray and pharmacy, which traditionally bill separately, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 405.452(d)(2), 405.452(d)(3)) incurred by both Medicare and non-Medicare patients, by the total number of patient days (Medicare and non-Medicare) in that area. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.453(d)(7). To this is added <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>a fraction of total patient charges in the ancillary departments. The total is the \u201creasonable cost\u201d of services. This set of calculations is done separately for each of the special care units in a hospital and then for all of the routine care areas taken together. Thus, whether a particular unit is classified as a routine care area or special care unit may alter the amount of Medicare reimbursement to which a hospital is entitled. St. Elizabeth\u2019s believes that it will not receive adequate reimbursement for the care it provides to Medicare patients if its concentrated care unit (\u201cCCU\u201d) is classified as a routine care area for apportionment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">St. Elizabeth\u2019s CCU is a 21-bed unit, adjacent to but physically separate from its 14-bed intensive care unit, that provides rehabilitation and reorientation to patients suffering from heart trauma. It also cares for stroke patients and other patients who no longer need intensive care but who are not yet ready to return to the routine care wards.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Until 1978, St. Elizabeth\u2019s treated the CCU as a special care unit for apportionment and reimbursement purposes. In January 1978 Blue Cross conducted a study of per diem costs in Wisconsin hospitals. It found that the average per diem nursing salary and average per diem patient cost in St. Elizabeth\u2019s CCU was substantially lower than those in special care units in hospitals of a comparable size. Conversely, it found that the costs in St. Elizabeth\u2019s intensive care unit were somewhat higher than the state average for special care units. Blue Cross reported its findings to the Health Care Financing Administration (\u201cHCFA\u201d), the agency within HHS that administers Medicare. The HCFA instructed Blue Cross to examine whether the CCU qualified, under the regulations, as a special care unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Blue Cross relying on the requirements set forth in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.452(d)(10), <em>supra, </em>determined that the CCU did not qualify as a special care unit. Based on this determination, Blue Cross adjusted St. Elizabeth\u2019s cost reports for 1975, 1976 and 1977 to reflect the CCU\u2019s new status as a routine care area. The difference in reimbursement after adjustment was $34,299, $22,027, and $23,117, respectively, for the three years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">St. Elizabeth\u2019s appealed this adjustment to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board (the \u201cPRRB\u201d), which decided that Blue Cross had erred in classifying the CCU as a routine care area. The Secretary reversed this decision, ruling that the CCU was a routine care area. St. Elizabeth\u2019s brought suit in federal court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin, challenging the Secretary\u2019s final decision. The district court referred the matter to a magistrate, who recommended reversing the Secretary. Magistrate\u2019s Recommendation, No. 82-C-656 (Nov. 2,1984), at 14. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation. <em>St. Elizabeth Hospital, Inc. v. Heckler, </em>No. 82 C 656 (Jan. 30, 1985), at 4, The Secretary appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">We must examine (1) whether the Secretary\u2019s decision that the CCU at St. Elizabeth\u2019s does not qualify as a special care unit is supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the apportionment regulations as mandating only two levels of care is arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">The magistrate ruled that the Secretary had not shown that his finding was supported by substantial evidence. The Secretary argues that the magistrate, whose recommendation the district court adopted without comment, misapplied our holding in <em>Community Hospital of Indianapolis v. Schweiker, </em>717 F.2d 372 (7th Cir.1983). In that case we were asked to review the Secretary\u2019s determination that a physical rehabilitation center \u2014 a hospital unit providing health care and therapy to physically disabled individuals \u2014 did not qualify as a special care unit. There, as here, the question was what was meant by the requirement that care provided in such a unit be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201cextraordinary, concentrated and continuous.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We rejected as \u201cnot implicit in the plain meaning\u201d of \u00a7 405.452(d)(10) the Secretary\u2019s contention that in order to qualify as a special care unit a hospital unit had to treat critically ill patients \u201cin immediate life-threatening situations.\u201d 717 F.2d at 376. Instead, we held that the regulation required only that \u201cthe level of care provided in a special care unit be <em>comparable </em>to the level of care provided patients in ... recognized units.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied). In so doing we rejected the <em>ejusdem generis </em>approach (adopted by several circuits<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) which would require that all special care units treat the critically ill since those cited in the regulation as examples do. <em>See </em>717 F.2d at 378 (Wood, J., dissenting). We examined the administrative record and noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">nursing staff-patient ratios and operational costs of the rehabilitation center were much closer to those of the recognized special care units than to those of the Hospital\u2019s routine service areas. Moreover, the rehabilitation center, like the recognized special care units, did not employ nurse\u2019s aides although such employees are regularly engaged to perform tasks in routine service areas____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 377. We concluded that the <em>level </em>of care provided in the physical rehabilitation center was comparable to that provided in a special care unit, even if the <em>type </em>of care and patient treated was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">In the case before us, as in <em>Community Hospital, </em>the Secretary offered the magistrate comparative data on per diem costs, nursing hours, nursing salaries and depreciation costs. He argued that these tended to show that St. Elizabeth\u2019s CCU had operational costs more \u201ccomparable\u201d to those in the routine care areas than to those in intensive care, a recognized special care unit. The magistrate agreed with the statistical inference: \u201cA statistical comparison shows that the CCU falls between intensive care and routine____ In most areas the CCU is in closer proximity to routine care than to intensive care.\u201d Magistrate\u2019s Recommendation at 9. Nonetheless, he held that these comparisons, taken alone,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> did not provide substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s determination that the CCU was not a special care unit. He held that \u201ca \u2018middle level\u2019 of care can still qualify as a special care unit,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 9, \u201cwhere as here the care being provided is not \u2018routine,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">We agree that the magistrate did not apply <em>Community Hospital </em>correctly. <em>Community Hospital </em>merely held that in deciding whether a hospital unit provides special care the Secretary could not consider dispositive the <em>type </em>of care provided and patient treated; he had to look at the level, or intensity, of care offered. The latter approach would conform to the regulation\u2019s language and its purpose, increasing the accuracy of cost allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>The magistrate properly looked at the same criteria we examined in Community Hospital and determined that the level of care provided in the CCU was not comparable to that provided in one of St. Elizabeth\u2019s special care units. But he then ruled that the CCU should be deemed a special care unit because the care offered was not \u201croutine.\u201d Routine care cannot be the benchmark in these circumstances. The regulatory scheme recognizes that a continuum of types and levels of care are present in any hospital and creates a threshold, a certain point at which the level of care reaches such an intensity that Medicare accounts for it separately for apportionment purposes. This is special care, or care that is \u201cextraordinary, concentrated, and continuous.\u201d All care that falls below that mark is, by definition, routine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It does not matter whether care is considered \u201croutine\u201d in layman's terms; if the care provided in the CCU is not comparable to special care, it is routine. We hold that there was substantial evidence, of the sort we approved in <em>Community Hospital, </em>to support the Secretary\u2019s determination that the CCU was not a special care unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">St. Elizabeth\u2019s also suggests that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the apportionment regulations as mandating only two levels of care is arbitrary and capricious. It does not challenge the regulations themselves (an almost insurmountable burden, since the Secretary\u2019s formal rule-making in this field is entitled to \u201clegislative effect,\u201d <em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 44, 101 S.Ct. 2633, 2640, 69 L.Ed.2d 460 (1981)); rather, it argues that the Secretary is bound to assure accurate allocation of costs between Medicare and non-Medicare patients by reading his regulations as authorizing an \u201cintermediate\u201d level of care subject, like special care, to individualized unit cost determinations. Although the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his own regulations is entitled to considerable deference, we are charged with the task of ensuring that this interpretation is consistent with the language and purpose of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Much of the argument on appeal is over semantics and we believe that the parties\u2019 characterizations of their preferred outcomes as involving \u201ctwo\u201d versus \u201cthree\u201d levels of care only serves to confuse the issue. As we stated <em>supra, </em>all care that is not denominated \u201cspecial care\u201d is considered in the aggregate under the catch-all label \u201croutine care\u201d in determining average cost per diem and hence the reasonable cost of a hospital stay. Each unit that provides \u201cspecial care\u201d is treated separately, with its own average cost per diem and reasonable reimbursement figure. In one sense, then, St. Elizabeth\u2019s is correct in stating that the regulations do not, by their terms, limit reimbursement to two levels of care only. There will be as many reimbursement levels as there are special care units \u2014 plus one (routine care). But the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is supported by the fact that the regulations mention only special and routine care: no third \u201clevel\u201d of care appears in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">What St. Elizabeth\u2019s wishes us to do, in effect, is push down the threshold point that divides special care from routine so that the CCU can also be considered separately for apportionment purposes. With the issue before us thus framed, the question is really whether the point at which the cut-off is currently made \u2014 that is, the definition of \u201cspecial care\u201d \u2014 is arbitrary, capricious and inconsistent with the purpose of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Taking a hospital unit out of routine care and making it a special care unit will (if the costs of that unit are, like the CCU\u2019s, on the higher end of the routine care spectrum) raise the average recorded cost per diem of Medicare patients in the CCU \u2014 and correspondingly lower the average cost per diem of Medicare patients left in a routine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>care area. If Medicare patients were uniformly spread throughout a hospital and were receiving the average amount of services provided in their respective units, it would not matter how the Secretary divvied up the units for reimbursement. There would be no need for any special care units at all. But common sense tells us that this is not the case and that a higher percentage of elderly patients (hence, Medicare beneficiaries) will be receiving hospital care of a more intensive\u2014 and expensive \u2014 kind. If this is the case, computing average per diem cost without differentiating between levels of care would put hospitals at risk of not receiving adequate reimbursement for the care they provide Medicare patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">This effect apparently motivated the 1972 amendments to the apportionment regulations, which first adopted the special care unit classification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This scheme allowed the Secretary to provide a more accurate allocation of costs without creating an unmanageable administrative burden. Certain hospital units with significantly higher costs were separated out, but not so many as to destroy the administrative benefits of aggregation. The question is one of balancing further refinement of allocation against increased administrative costs. We are not sure where another threshold point, <em>more </em>reasonable than the one the Secretary has set, would be found. A hospital would always have the incentive to seek to have its higher cost routine care areas (so long as they were disproportionately Medicare-utilized) accounted for as special care units. St. Elizabeth\u2019s told us at oral argument that Medicare patients are disproportionately represented in the CCU. Thus, it is to its advantage to have the CCU accounted for separately and receive a correspondingly smaller reimbursement amount for those (fewer) Medicare patients in the remaining routine care areas. Of course, as St. Elizabeth\u2019s is at pains to point out, it is to the Secretary\u2019s financial benefit to have the CCU remain a routine care area. But this will not always be the case. If the special care threshold were lowered, other areas in a hospital that benefit the hospital by retaining their routine care designation would also be candidates for special care status. These could be typically Medicare-underutilized units, such as narcotics rehabilitation or neonatal care. (Maternity wards, also typically Medicare-underutilized, are required by the regulation to be considered routine care areas. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.452(d)(10)). The fact that special care unit status is not a one-way street suggests that the increased refinement to be achieved by St. Elizabeth\u2019s proffered interpretation would probably not be so great as to overcome the increased administrative burdens, and certainly not weighty enough to persuade us that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is unreasonable. Classification for cost purposes is an area where judgment and discretion must always play a significant role.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Therefore the judgment insofar as it sets aside the Secretary\u2019s classification of the concentrated care unit is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">II. THE INVESTMENT INCOME OFFSET</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">St. Elizabeth\u2019s provides its employees health insurance through a self-funded insurance plan called the St. Elizabeth Hospital Health Benefit Plan. The Plan is administered as an independent trust \u2014 the St. Elizabeth Health Trust (\u201cTrust\u201d) \u2014 into which St. Elizabeth\u2019s contributes funds on a regular basis, based on needs projected by an actuary. In its 1975, 1976 and 1977 cost reports, St. Elizabeth\u2019s claimed as an allowable cost its contributions into the Trust. The Trust\u2019s assets are invested and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>generate investment income, which must be retained in the Trust and used to pay for employee health care. We must consider here the treatment of this investment income under Medicare\u2019s provider reimbursement scheme. (We will also touch upon the treatment of contributions to self-insurance funds, an issue which has not been appealed to this court but which is related to the investment income offset.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In determining which of a hospital\u2019s expenses may be included in the reasonable cost of a Medicare patient\u2019s hospital stay, \u201c[njecessary and proper interest on both current and capital indebtedness is an allowable cost,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.419(a). The definition of \u201cnecessary\u201d requires that the interest be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">reduced by investment income except where such income is from gifts and grants, whether restricted or unrestricted, and which are held separate and not commingled with other funds. Income from funded depreciation or provider\u2019s qualified pension fund is not used to reduce interest expense. Interest received as a result of judicial review by a Federal court ... is not used to reduce interest expense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.419(b)(iii). The Secretary has interpreted this regulation as requiring that the income earned by the Trust be offset against and reduce St. Elizabeth\u2019s otherwise allowable interest expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">When Blue Cross reopened St. Elizabeth\u2019s cost reports for 1975,1976 and 1977, it denied reimbursement for contributions to the Trust and also denied reimbursement for interest expense to the extent it was offset by income earned by the Trust. St. Elizabeth\u2019s appealed both of these issues to the PRRB, which upheld Blue Cross\u2019 position on both. The HCFA then affirmed the PRRB, and the district court referred both issues to the magistrate, who recommended affirming the Secretary on both. As for allowing the cost of contributions to the Trust, the magistrate noted that while the applicable regulation states that \u201cpremium payments for employee health ... plans\u201d are an allowable cost, the Provider Reimbursement Manual (the \u201cManual\u201d), which contains the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the regulations, states that when payments are made into a self-insurance fund, the cost of contributions is not allowable. Magistrate\u2019s Recommendation at 15. He concluded that it was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion for the Secretary to interpret the regulation providing for reimbursement for premiums as applying to commercial insurance policies only. As to the investment income offset, the magistrate cited Manual section 2161B, which states that \u201cthe provider\u2019s total allowable interest expense under the Medicare program will be offset by income earned by invested insurance reserve funds.\u201d He also noted that investment income from employee health benefit self-insurance is not one of the four enumerated exceptions to the general rule of the income-offset regulation and again concluded that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation was reasonable. Magistrate\u2019s Recommendation at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The district court adopted the recommendation about the income offset without comment but declined to adopt the Magistrate\u2019s recommendation on the treatment of contributions to a self-insurance fund. It rejected the distinction between commercial insurance and self-insurance, finding no warrant in the regulations or in reason and ruled that the amounts contributed into the Trust were allowable. District Court Opinion at 5 (\u201cThe payments made by the hospital for its employees\u2019 health insurance do not lose their status as \u2018premiums\u2019 ... simply because the insurance plan is self-funded____\u201d). The Secretary apparently accepts this decision as he has not appealed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">St. Elizabeth\u2019s, however, appealed the district court\u2019s decision on the investment income offset, arguing that it is unreasonable to read the offset regulation as applying to income earned by a trust fund to which St. Elizabeth\u2019s has no effective access. The Secretary supports his interpretation of the regulation with the two reasons given by the magistrate, <em>supra: </em>(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>that the offset is required by section 2161B of the Manual and (2) that income from an employee health benefit self-insurance fund is not one of the listed exceptions to the general offset rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Section 2161B establishes the conditions under which a provider may be reimbursed for \u201cactual losses\u201d met by a self-insurance reserve fund. One of the eight conditions that a plan must meet to receive reimbursement for such losses is that \u201c[t]he provider\u2019s total allowable interest expense under the Medicare program ... be offset by income earned by invested insurance reserve funds.\u201d Manual, \u00a7 2161B(6). For two reasons, however, we do not think that this condition, relied upon by the magistrate and the Secretary, is dispositive of the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">First, the Manual was amended during the course of this litigation to add new provisions on the treatment of employee health benefit trust funds. Section 2161B, upon which the Secretary relies, now appears to apply only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\"><em>[w]here a provider maintains a selfinsurance program for other than </em>malpractice and comprehensive general liability coverage in conjunction with malpractice coverage, as well as unemployment compensation and workers\u2019 compensation coverage coupled with secondary injury coverage, or <em>employee health-insurance coverage, provided it meets the requirements of \u00a7 </em>2162.7____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Manual, \u00a7 2161B (emphasis supplied). New Section 2162 covers \u201cProvider Costs for Malpractice and Comprehensive General Liability Protection, Unemployment Compensation, Workers\u2019 Compensation and Employee Health Care Insurance\u201d and subsection 2162.7 sets forth the conditions which self-insurance funds must meet in order to be reimbursed for all payments into the trust fund. These amendments for employee health benefit coverage were added in January 1983, Action Transmittal No. 276, and are effective for all cost reports' \u201cunder appeal as of or subsequent to January 15, 1983,\u201d Manual \u00a7 2162.11(c). Therefore, we think there is a real question whether section 2161B still applies to the Trust or whether section 2162, which does not expressly condition reimbursement on an investment income offset, has superseded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">Second, even if section 2162 is not relevant here,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the district court\u2019s decision in this case casts doubt on the continued applicability of section 2161B to employee health benefit trust funds. This section, as noted, instructs providers how to set up a self-insurance plan so that \u201cactual losses\u201d met by the plan can be reimbursed. But the district court ruled that it was unreasonable to distinguish between commercial insurance and self-insurance and that therefore all <em>contributions </em>made by St. Elizabeth\u2019s into the Trust were allowable costs. Therefore, section 2161B is no longer strictly applicable to the St. Elizabeth\u2019s Trust: the offset requirement of section 2161B(6) is a condition precedent to a result \u2014 reimbursement for actual losses\u2014 that St. Elizabeth\u2019s no longer wishes to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">The Secretary also supports his interpretation of the offset regulation by appealing to its language: the regulation lists four exceptions to a general offset requirement and employee health benefit trust funds is not among them. St. Elizabeth\u2019s counters by arguing that when a provider self-insures for malpractice, it need not offset the income earned by the reserve fund: this exception, it points out, is also not among those listed. In support of this claim it points to the requirement in section 2162 that, in order to be reimbursed for all contributions, a malpractice self-insurance fund must ensure that \u201cany income earned by the fund must become part of the fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>and used in establishing adequate fund levels.\u201d Manual, \u00a7 2162.7(B)(6). Since the Trust retains earnings in the same way, St. Elizabeth\u2019s argues that it is arbitrary for the Secretary to apply the offset rule to employee health benefit self-insurance funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">No one has explained why the conclusion about the offset follows from the requirement that earnings be retained,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but the Secretary does not dispute it. In fact, he seizes upon this requirement to distinguish malpractice self-insurance from employee health self-insurance. Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 10. However, section 2162 and its requirement that income become part of the fund applies to employee health benefit self-insurance as well. If there is no offset for malpractice funds (as the Secretary\u2019s silence suggests), then the Secretary has articulated no reason why there should be an offset for investment income generated by St. Elizabeth\u2019s Trust. He cannot rely on the language of the regulation since neither of these forms of self-insurance are expressly exempted from the offset requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In sum, neither of the reasons given us by the Secretary seems to support his interpretation of the offset regulation. Therefore, we vacate and remand to the Secretary for further action consistent with this opinion that part of the judgment concerning the investment income offset. On remand, the Secretary will want to consider (1) whether section 2162 of the Manual applies to the Trust; (2) if not, whether section 2161B applies to the Trust in light of the district court\u2019s decision to allow the cost of self-insurance \u201cpremiums\u201d; and (3) whether malpractice and employee health benefit self-insurance may be distinguished under the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">REVERSED IN PART AND REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-12\">.

The Secretary also argued before the magistrate that <em>Community Hospital </em>was wrongly decided and should be ignored.

We do not deny that there is a logical connection \u2014 the critically ill need a higher level of medical care than those less seriously ill.

[I]n 1972, the Secretary decided ... to amend the regulations ... to remove from the calculations of routine service costs, the cost incurred in furnishing care in special care units. This was done because the program recognized that the costs of furnishing care in these special care units were significantly higher, due to the need for greater staffing and more specialized equipment, than the costs associated with other patient care areas, including intermediate or subintensive care units.

The parties have not addressed the new provisions (although St. Elizabeth\u2019s does contend that they apply to self-insurance for malpractice, <em>see infra). </em>It is possible that the Trust does not meet the requirements imposed on self-insurance funds by section 2162.7 and that therefore the parties deemed this provision irrelevant. According to the Manual, a self-insurance fund that cannot meet the requirements of section 2162.7 is governed by section 2161B.

There is a reasonable argument that keeping income in the fund reduces the level of contributions, which are allowable costs. To that extent, there is an implicit offset. Further, when a provider terminates its participation in Medicare, any excess reserves in the fund (whether from contributions or investment income) must be used to offset allowable costs in the final cost report. \u00a7 2162.3B(4). Thus perhaps, section 2162 was designed to make the offset prescribed in the regulations redundant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
