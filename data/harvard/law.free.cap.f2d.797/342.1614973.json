Since the petition was filed one day late and was two pages longer than the maximum length for such petitions, Fed.R.App.P. 40, petitioner also filed motions to accept his petition despite these deficiencies. Although the original hearing panel has decided to permit the filing of the petition, the members unanimously agree that the petition should, nonetheless, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">There is one major argument raised by the petition: that the hearing panel, in its original decision, <em>Wilkins v. Eaton Corp., </em>790 F.2d 515 (6th Cir.1986), overlooked evidence indicating that Eaton\u2019s proffered reason for discharging the petitioner was merely a pretext for discriminating against him on the basis of age. The petitioner points out that the checklist was replaced shortly after petitioner\u2019s discharge, other checklists were being used by Eaton at the time of his discharge, petitioner was justified in not using the checklist because it was unsafe and other checklists were utilized, petitioner did not refuse to fly, Eaton reversed itself and decided not to consider petitioner\u2019s comments before discharging him, and Eaton singled out petitioner for harsher treatment than a younger pilot, Mr. Saylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">All these facts were brought to our attention when the case was initially argued. We did not overlook any of these factors in deciding the case, and we continue to be convinced that this evidence does not satisfy petitioner\u2019s burden of \u201cestablishing by a preponderance of evidence that age was the determining factor in [petitioner\u2019s] discharge.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Eaton Corp., </em>790 F.2d 515, 523 (6th Cir.1986). This evidence primarily focuses on whether adopting this checklist was a good policy decision \u2014i.e., whether Eaton should have adopted, from the start, a shorter checklist. However, factfinders and federal courts may not focus on the soundness of a corporation\u2019s business judgment, <em>Loeb v. Textron, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 1003, 1012 (1st Cir.1979); rather, the proper inquiry is whether the plaintiff has met his burden of persuasion, by a preponderance of evidence, that his employer discriminated against him on the basis of age. <em>Rose v. National Cash Register Corp., </em>703 F.2d 225, 227 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 939, 104 S.Ct. 352, 78 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983); <em>Laugesen v. Anaconda Co., </em>510 F.2d 307, 313 (6th Cir.1975). It is our firm belief that there is no more than a mere \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence supporting petitioner\u2019s claim, <em>cf. Brady v. Southern Railway Co., </em>320 U.S. 476, 479, 64 S.Ct. 232, 234, 88 L.Ed. 239 (1943); <em>Morelock v. NCR Corp., </em>586 F.2d 1096, 1104 &amp; n. 10 (6th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 906, 99 S.Ct. 1995, 60 L.Ed.2d 375 (1979); <em>Ker</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>wood v. Mortgage Bankers Ass\u2019n of America, Inc., </em>494 F.Supp. 1298 (D.D.C.1980), which is insufficient to support a finding of age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">As noted in our first opinion, there is no evidence that the checklist was adopted to discriminate against older pilots and it is clear that every pilot was required to use it. The fact that Eaton replaced the checklist within one week of petitioner\u2019s discharge does not help petitioner\u2019s case; all pilots were required to use the old checklist in the interim, and it was a matter of general knowledge that Eaton\u2019s adoption of a new checklist was imminent. Similarly, the fact that other checklists were available is irrelevant since Eaton made a business judgment that its employees were to use a specific checklist.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">As was thoroughly discussed in our initial opinion, Saylor and petitioner did not act in a like manner; the fact that the petitioner was fired and Saylor was not, therefore, does not give rise to an inference of age discrimination. We are simply not persuaded by petitioner\u2019s argument that he did not refuse to fly. Petitioner clearly refused to use a checklist against Eaton\u2019s commands, and he refused to fly if he were required to use the checklist. One refusal naturally led to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In his petition for rehearing, petitioner notes that the district court\u2019s decision to reinstate him was premised on the fact that subsequent checklists developed by Mr. Kuta were found to be \u201csafe and acceptable\u201d to petitioner. Petitioner asserts that the trial judge, therefore, concluded \u201cthat there would be no issue over checklists\u201d were petitioner reinstated. Petition for Rehearing at 6. This reasoning clearly illustrates the misconceptions which have persisted throughout this lawsuit. The outcome of an age discrimination claim cannot hinge on whether a particular flight checklist is adopted by a corporation, unless that checklist, or its application, discriminates on the basis of age. There is no such evidence here. In our opinion, it is absolutely irrelevant that the petitioner find a particular checklist safe or unsafe; otherwise, we would be in the business of forcing corporations to change policies for one individual who refuses to adhere to such policies for personal reasons. As noted above, there is also no evidence in this case that the checklist was applied in a discriminatory manner. Being neutral on its face and as applied, the checklist itself cannot form the basis of his age discrimination suit. We adhere to our original reasoning that the additional evidence in this case \u201cdoes not suffice to support as a reasonable probability the inference that but for claimant\u2019s age he would not have been discharged.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Eaton Corp., supra, </em>790 F.2d at 523 (citing <em>Lovelace v. Sherwin-Williams Co., </em>681 F.2d 230, 243 (4th Cir.1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Having previously considered all the arguments raised in the Petition for Rehearing, the petition is accordingly denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
