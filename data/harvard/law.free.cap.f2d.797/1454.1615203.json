In the underlying action, the United States sought to hold O\u2019Crowley and three other individuals liable under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a) (1982)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for unpaid employment taxes that Arlen Trophy Company, Inc. (Arlen) had withheld from the wages of its employees for the last quarter of 1975 and the first quarter of 1976.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> O\u2019Crowley prevailed in the action, and the district court awarded him attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The government appeals only the award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to O\u2019Crowley. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1530-17\">Section 2412(d)(1)(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1530-18\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1457\">*1457</page-number>fied or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1531-6\">28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (West 1985 Supp. &amp; 1986 Supp. IV).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a detailed and thoughtful opinion, the district court concluded that the government had not carried its burden of proving that its position against O\u2019Crowley was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, the district court emphasized that the government did not furnish O\u2019Crowley with any specific statement of fact or law on which the government based its claim against O\u2019Crowley, thus preventing O\u2019Crowley from demonstrating that the government\u2019s position against him was factually and legally untenable. The court also noted that the government failed to investigate the truth of evidence offered by O\u2019Crowley that would have supported O\u2019Crowley\u2019s position, gave unwarranted credence to obviously biased witnesses, and failed to reevaluate whether to continue prosecuting O\u2019Crowley after the government\u2019s claim against Moats had been resolved in Moats\u2019 favor and the district court had awarded Moats costs and attorneys\u2019 fees under the EAJA. The district court therefore concluded that the government had not carried its burden of proving that its position against O\u2019Crowley was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d and awarded O\u2019Crowley costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-7\">Our role on review is limited to determining whether the district court abused its discretion in finding that the government\u2019s position against O\u2019Crowley was not substantially justified. <em>Keasler v. United States, </em>766 F.2d 1227, 1231 (8th Cir.1985). Under this standard of review, the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewable on a de novo basis; its findings of fact are of course subject to the clearly erroneous rule. <em>United States v. 2,116 Boxes of Boned Beef, </em>726 F.2d 1481, 1486 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Jarboe-Lackey Feedlots, Inc. v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 825, 105 S.Ct. 105, 83 L.Ed.2d 49 (1984); <em>Spencer v. NLRB, </em>712 F.2d 539, 563-64 (D.C.Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 936, 104 S.Ct. 1908, 80 L.Ed.2d 457 (1984).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this regard, to the extent that the district court\u2019s findings concerning the strength of positions taken in litigation by the United States are based on assessments of the probative value of the evidence offered by the government, they can be reversed only if clearly erroneous. <em>2,166 Boxes of Boned Beef, </em>726 F.2d at 1486; <em>Spencer, </em>712 F.2d at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b1531-9\">The government does not challenge any particular findings of the district court as clearly erroneous. Nor does the government point to any particular error of law made by the district court in concluding that the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified. Rather, the thrust of the government\u2019s argument on appeal is that the merit of its claim against O\u2019Crowley turned solely on the credibility of certain witnesses. The district court\u2019s application of the EAJA to this case, the government argues, in effect requires the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1458\">*1458</page-number>ment to second-guess the district court in determining whose version of the facts the court would ultimately find credible. The district court\u2019s opinion makes clear, however, that O\u2019Crowley\u2019s ultimate liability under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a) turned on far more than witness credibility. The district court\u2019s primary reason for finding the government\u2019s position against O\u2019Crowley not substantially justified was the fact that the government did not diligently investigate who was responsible for paying Arlen\u2019s taxes. Instead, the government brought claims against several officers and directors of Arlen and Gateway, including O\u2019Crowley, who might possibly have been responsible for collecting or paying Arlen\u2019s employee withholding taxes, hoping that the court would ultimately find one or more of those individuals liable for Arlen\u2019s taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-4\">In light of the district court\u2019s lengthy and well-reasoned opinion explaining its conclusion that the government\u2019s position against O\u2019Crowley was not substantially justified and the government\u2019s failure to point to any error in the district court\u2019s factual findings or application of the law to those findings, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in awarding O\u2019Crowley costs and attorneys\u2019 fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1530-10\">. The Honorable John W.

During the period in question, O\u2019Crowley was chairman of Arlen and president, director, and chief executive officer of Arlen\u2019s holding company, Gateway Sporting Goods Company (Gateway). Of the three other individuals from whom the government sought to collect Arlen's unpaid taxes, Sidney Estridge was chairman and forty percent shareholder of Gateway, Robert L. Moats was controller of Gateway, and Herbert Maslin was president of Arlen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1530-20\">. The case against Moats was resolved in his favor on cross motions for summary judgment, <em>see Moats v. United States, </em>564 F.Supp. 1330 (W.D.Mo.1983), and the district court granted Moats\u2019 application for attorneys' fees and expenses under the EAJA, <em>see Moats v. United States, </em>576 F.Supp. 1537 (W.D.Mo.1984). The government did not appeal either of those decisions. The district court, however, found Estridge and Maslin personally liable for Arlen\u2019s unpaid taxes under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1531-10\">. We are aware that Congress amended section 2412(d) on August 5, 1985, after the district court had awarded O\u2019Crowley costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.

Pursuant to the amendments\u2019 express terms, the amended version governs this case on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 7, 99 Stat. at 186-87. Although the basic standard for the award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees under section 2412(d) remains the same, the legislative history makes clear that the amendments were intended to give section 2412(d) a broader sweep, <em>see </em>H.R.

The amendments thus would not have affected the district court\u2019s decision.

O\u2019Crowley, Jr., under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2412(d) (West Supp.1986) (EAJA). O\u2019Crowley now seeks an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under the EAJA for the fees and expenses he incurred in (1) defending the government\u2019s appeal from the district court's decision in his favor on the merits, which was later voluntarily dismissed and (2) defending the government\u2019s appeal from the district court award of fees and expenses under the EAJA and filing this current EAJA application. We grant O\u2019Crowley\u2019s request except as to the fees and expenses he incurred in defending the appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1532-13\">In the underlying action, the United States sought to hold O\u2019Crowley and three other individuals liable under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672(a) (1982) for unpaid employment taxes that Arlen Trophy Company, Inc. had withheld from the wages of its employees. O\u2019Crowley prevailed in the action. Subsequently, the district court awarded O\u2019Crowley attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under the EAJA. The government appealed both the district court\u2019s decision in favor of O\u2019Crowley on the merits (the \u201csection 6672 action\u201d) and the district court\u2019s award under the EAJA (the \u201cEAJA action\u201d or the \u201cEAJA award\u201d), and the appeals were consolidated. Upon the government\u2019s own motion, however, this court dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>government\u2019s appeal of the section 6672 action in an order dated August 6, 1985. The government continued to prosecute its appeal of the district court\u2019s EAJA award. After oral argument, we affirmed the district court\u2019s award under the EAJA on March 13, 1986. On April 10, 1986, we issued our mandate in the EAJA action. O\u2019Crowley filed his current application for fees and expenses incurred in pursuing both appeals and in filing this application on May 5, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-4\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-5\">A party seeking an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under the EAJA must submit an application for such an award to the court within thirty days of \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) (West Supp.1986), which the EAJA defines as \u201ca judgment that is final and not appealable,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2412(d)(2)(G). The government contends that O\u2019Crowley\u2019s EAJA application to this court is untimely with respect to those fees and expenses O\u2019Crowley incurred in defending against the government\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s decision in the section 6672 action before the government dismissed this appeal on its own motion. With respect to the section 6672 appeal, the government argues, the judgment of this court became \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) on August 6,1985, when this court entered an order dismissing the government\u2019s appeal of the section 6672 action. O\u2019Crowley counters that because the appeal of the section 6672 action and the appeal of the EAJA award were consolidated, the judgment of this court on the appeal of the section 6672 action did not become final until this court\u2019s judgment in the appeal of the EAJA award became final. Thus, O\u2019Crowley contends, his EAJA application is timely as to both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-8\">Although we have found no cases discussing this precise issue, we conclude that the judgment of dismissal on the merits must be treated separately from the judgment affirming the district court\u2019s EAJA award in determining the timeliness of O\u2019Crowley\u2019s EAJA application. In <em>Obin v. District No. 9 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, </em>651 F.2d 574 (8th Cir.1981), this court held that \u201ca claim for attorney\u2019s fees should be treated as a matter collateral to and independent of the merits of the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583. The Supreme Court expressly approved of this characterization in <em>White v. New Hampshire Department of Employment Security, </em>455 U.S. 445, 451, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 1168, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982). We find no rational basis for determining that a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees is collateral to and independent of the merits for some purposes but not for others. We therefore hold that O\u2019Crowley\u2019s application for fees and expenses incurred in defending the government\u2019s appeal of the section 6672 action prior to dismissal is untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1533-9\">Substantial justification</p>\n<p id=\"b1533-10\">We now consider whether the government has met its burden of proving that its position in appealing the district court\u2019s EAJA award was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To meet this burden, the government must show that its position was \u201cclearly reasonable, well founded in law and fact, solid though not necessarily correct.\u201d <em>United States v. 1,378.65 Acres of Land, </em>794 F.2d 1313 (8th Cir.1986). In <em>Cornella v. Schweiker, </em>741 F.2d 170 (8th Cir.1984), we held that whether the government\u2019s position in the underlying action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>was substantially justified and whether the government\u2019s position in appealing a district court award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under the EAJA was substantially justified are separate inquiries. <em>Id. </em>at 171. In other words, merely because the government does not prevail in an appeal of a district court award of fees and expenses under the EAJA does not automatically entitle the prevailing party to an EAJA award for fees and expenses incurred in bringing or defending the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-4\">After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, however, we conclude that under the facts of this case the government was not substantially justified in appealing the district court\u2019s EAJA award. Unlike <em>Cornelia, </em>this is not a case in which the government raised several legal issues of the first impression in the circuit in arguing that an EAJA award was not warranted. <em>See Cornella, </em>741 F.2d at 172; <em>see also Rawlings v. Heckler, </em>725 F.2d 1192, 1196 (9th Cir.1984) (in holding that prevailing party was not entitled to EAJA award for fees and expenses incurred in defense of government\u2019s appeal of a district court EAJA award, the court noted that the government had raised several legal questions that were unsettled in the circuit). Nor is this a case in which, as in <em>Cornelia, </em>the government was <em>defending </em>a district court ruling that the prevailing party was not entitled to an EAJA award but lost on appeal. <em>See Cornella, </em>741 F.2d at 172. Rather, in this case, the government makes precisely the same arguments in contending that it was substantially justified in appealing the district court\u2019s EAJA award as it did when it appealed the district court EAJA award in the first place: that the merits of its claim against O\u2019Crowley turned solely on the credibility of certain witnesses and that the government was thus substantially justified in attempting to hold O\u2019Crowley liable for Arlen\u2019s unpaid withholding taxes under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672. Moreover, the government appealed a district court ruling that its position in the section 6672 action was <em>not </em>substantially justified, rather than defended a district court\u2019s finding in its favor. In circumstances such as these, we hold that the decision of the United States to appeal the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to O'Crowley was not substantially justified. O\u2019Crowley is therefore entitled to the fees and expenses he incurred in defending this appeal and in filing this current EAJA application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-7\">Amount of fees and expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-8\">O\u2019Crowley has submitted evidence documenting the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses he incurred in defending the appeal of the EAJA award and in filing this EAJA application.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The government has not contested either the amount of hours or the hourly rate requested by O\u2019Crowley. Although the evidence submitted by O\u2019Crowley sufficiently supports the number of hours he claims, we find that O\u2019Crowley is limited to a minimum rate of $75 per hour. The EAJA provides that \u201cattorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of $75 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii) (West Supp.1986). O\u2019Crowley did not present any evidence to support a higher rate and we find nothing to indicate that a fee in excess of the maximum $75 per hour rate is justified in this case. We therefore award O\u2019Crqwley $19,768.56 in attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-9\">ROSS, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-10\">For the reasons set forth in my original dissent on the appeal of the district court\u2019s EAJA award, I likewise dissent from the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses for the appeal. I believe the government was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1461\">*1461</page-number>substantially justified in bringing this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1533-6\">. Very late in these proceedings, the government argued that O\u2019Crowley\u2019s EAJA application was untimely as to both appeals because local rule 17(a) requires that attorneys\u2019 fee applications be filed within fourteen days after entry of judgment. 8th Cir.R. 17(a). This argument is wholly without merit. A local court rule cannot supercede a statute that expressly allows prevailing parties thirty days in which to file applications for fees and expenses. <em>See Washington-Southern Navigation Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia Steamboat Co., </em>263 U.S. 629, 635, 44 S.Ct. 220, 222, 68 L.Ed. 480 (1924) (a court rule cannot enlarge or restrict jurisdiction or substantive law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1533-12\">.

O\u2019Crowley also seeks to recover the fees and expenses incurred in attempting to collect the district court judgment in his favor in the section 6672 action. The EAJA, however, does not authorize an award for time spent collecting a judgment from the government. <em>Cole v.
