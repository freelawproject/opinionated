POLLAK, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The question presented is whether the district court erred in modifying an arbitral award that was intended to resolve a dispute arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The question arises in the following way:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Appellant is Newark Typographical Union Local 103, collective bargaining representative of the composing room employees of appellee Newark Morning Ledger. The dispute between the parties is over the amount of weekly wage increase (and attendant cost-of-living increase) composing room employees were entitled to in 1984 pursuant to the 1983 collective bargaining agreement between Local 103 and The Ledger.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">The 1983 collective bargaining agreement \u2014 which amends and extends to 1994 an agreement originally entered into in 1970 \u2014 undertakes to tie the annual wage increases of The Ledger\u2019s composing room employees to those received by comparable employees of daily newspapers in New York City. Section 7-06 of the agreement specifies that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">the increases under this Contract shall be the total value of the weekly increases in wages and cost-of-living adjustments received by the New York Typographical Union No. 6 under its agreement with the Publishers\u2019 Association of New York City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-15\">And Section 7-09 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-16\">In the event that the Publishers\u2019 Association of New York City is disbanded or ceases to negotiate for more than one daily newspaper in New York City, then the increases under this contract shall be the average increases received by the New York Times, New York News and New York Post, to the extent that there are increases granted to any employees under said contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-17\">The negotiations conducted by Local 6 of the New York Typographical Union achieved the following results: Composing room employees of The News, The Post and The Times all received a weekly wage increase of $38. In addition, employees of The News and The Post were promised a lump-sum share of profits payable by April 10, 1985; in lieu of profit-sharing, Times\u2019 employees received in 1984, on top of the $38 wage increase, a weekly increment of $25.93 (plus $.72 cost-of-living) which was, according to President Powers of Local 6, \u201ca bonus of a 4% wage increase\u201d as \u201can incentive for an early agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-18\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-19\">Against this background, Local 103 advised The Ledger that the proper 1984 weekly wage increase was $46.88: This figure appears to have been the sum of $38 (the wage increase common to all three New York dailies) plus one-third of The Times\u2019 \u201cbonus\u201d of $25.93 and one-third of The Times\u2019 $.72 cost-of-living increment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-20\">The Ledger took the position that only a $38 increase was called for, since The Times\u2019 added $25.93 was \u201c \u2018in lieu of a profit sharing program negotiated at the News and Post\u2019____ [tjhese monies represent the equivalent of a diversion from a profit sharing plan to wages, and are not \u2018increases under the contract\u2019 received by the New York Times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Local 103 thereupon filed a grievance against The Ledger, and the matter proceeded to arbitration. At the outset of the arbitration, Local 103 announced that it had reconsidered its position: What its members were entitled to (in addition to the $38 to which The Ledger assented) was the entire $25.93 and $.72 in cost-of-living received by The Times\u2019 composing room employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">En route to fashioning his award, the Arbitrator addressed and decided three predicate issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\"><em>First, </em>the Arbitrator denied The Ledger\u2019s motion to dismiss the grievance based on Local 103\u2019s last-minute change in position: The Ledger had not sought a continuance, and had made no showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\"><em>Second, </em>the Arbitrator rejected The Ledger\u2019s contention that the $25.93 received by The Times employees was not a wage increase but a bonus. \u201cA bonus,\u201d wrote the Arbitrator, \u201cis something that is given above what is due. It is a short term giving; it is [a] one shot deal. After it is paid, what was added to reverts to what was originally due.\u201d The Post and News employees \u201creceived monies above what was due, payable in a lump sum on or before April 10 of the following year after the Plan year. They received a bonus.\u201d By contrast:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">New York Times employees received a permanent change in the \u201cWage Rate and Cost of Living Adjustment provisions of the Contract and Special Agreement.\u201d A permanent change in wages and gross pay paid at the end of each pay period. It cannot be reduced or increased without further bargaining. The New York Times employees received a wage increase. They did not received <em>[sic </em>] a bonus. Why they received this increase is immaterial. It does not matter if it was in lieu of what someone else received. It does not matter if it was for early signing of the contract. What they received was [a] permanent wage increase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-11\"><em>Third, </em>the Arbitrator considered whether, as Local 103 contended and The Ledger denied, the Local 6 agreement was negotiated with the Publishers\u2019 Association rather than directly with the three New York dailies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Arbitrator was not persuaded by Local 103\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">The Arbitrator then announced and explained his award. The substance of that exposition follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">As the Association was in effect disbanded during the negotiations of the \u201cblue book,\u201d \u201cthe increase under this contract [Ledger and Local 103] shall be the average increase provided by the New York Times, New York Daily News and the New York Post, to the extent that there are any increases granted any employees under said contract\u201d. As all parties, including the Star Ledger, received the $38 increase, and only the New York Times employees received an additional increase the $25.93 plus $.72 Cost of Living adjustment, as compared to a bonus the News and Post employees received, I find that the $25.93 plus Cost of Living Adjustment is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-14\">There is nothing in any contract stating that any increases in the New York contract must be in toto. If the Association fails to function, an average of the increases is determined. Mathematically, if all parties negotiating individually, agree on the same increase, the result would be in toto. If News and Post employee [sic] received bonuses, which are not increases, and Times employees received permanent increases, the aver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>age of the increases can not be determined, but any increases granted to any employees under said contract shall be. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">Accordingly, based upon the above, the undersigned finds that under the parties\u2019 collective agreement the employees of the Newark Morning Ledger are entitled to additional money and benefits and direct <em>[sic </em>] that they be paid $25.93 plus .72 cost of living adjustment per week effective the date on which the issue was raised____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">After the filing of the arbitral award, The Ledger, invoking the jurisdiction conferred by the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) and the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10, brought this proceeding in the District Court for the District of New Jersey to vacate, or, in the alternative, to modify, the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The district court concluded that the award, as explained in the arbitrator\u2019s opinion, was incompatible with the collective bargaining agreement, and accordingly modified the award to require the weekly wage increase mandated by the agreement. The proper weekly wage increase, as determined by the district court, was $46.88\u2014 the amount that had been demanded by Local 103, and refused by The Ledger, pri- or to the filing of the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Local 103 has appealed from the decision below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">In considering the relative roles of labor arbitrator and district judge, we start from the premise, articulated by the district court in this case, \u201cthat in order to disturb an arbitrator\u2019s award a court must overcome a strong presumption in favor of the award.\u201d As this court has stated, \u201conly where there is a manifest disregard of the [collective bargaining] agreement, totally unsupported by principles of contract construction and the law of the shop, may a reviewing court disturb the award.\u201d <em>Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co. v. Fletcher, </em>405 F.2d 1123, 1128 (3d Cir.1969). This strict standard means that a reviewing court will decline to sustain an award \u201conly in the rarest case.\u201d R. Gorman, Labor Law 586 (1976). And that is as it should be, for frequent judicial disapproval of the awards of labor arbitrators would tend to undermine a system of private ordering that is of the highest importance to the well-being of employer and worker alike. <em>See </em>Shulman, <em>Reason, Contract, and Law in Labor Relations, </em>68 Harv.L.Rev. 999 (1955). But in that \u201crarest case\u201d of \u201cmanifest disregard of the [collective bargaining] agreement,\u201d the district judge must draw the line. For \u201can arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may of course look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. When the arbitrator\u2019s words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>In this case, we conclude that \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s words [do] manifest an infidelity to this obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The Arbitrator\u2019s difficulty was not apparent at the outset of his analysis. His unimpeachable factual finding that Local 6 negotiated the 1984 increases with the three dailies rather than with the Publishers\u2019 Association set the stage for the Arbitrator\u2019s observation \u2014 mandated by Section 7-09 of the Local 103/Ledger collective bargaining agreement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 that \u201c[i]f the Association fails to function, an average of the increases is determined.\u201d So far so good. But then the Arbitrator took the verbal step which led him away from the collective bargaining agreement and into error: \u201cIf News and Post employee [sic] received bonuses, which are not increases, and Times employees received permanent increases, the average of the increases can not be determined, but any increases granted to any employees under said contract shall be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">To say that \u201cthe average of the increases can not be determined,\u201d where one of the increases is $25.93, plus $.72 cost-of-living, and the other two are zero, is flawed arithmetic. The average can be determined. The average is $8.64, plus $.24, for a total of $8.88. The sum of $8.88 and $38.00 (the base wage increase granted by all three dailies, and conceded by The Ledger) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>$46.88,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the weekly wage increase determined by the district court to be owing to The Ledger\u2019s composing room force.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The Arbitrator\u2019s flawed arithmetic evidently reflected a flawed understanding of the charter from which the Arbitrator derived his authority \u2014 the collective bargaining agreement. Section 7-06 of that agreement contemplates that The Ledger\u2019s composing room employees are to receive \u201cthe total value of the weekly increases in wages and cost-of-living adjustments\u201d received by New York composing room employees when the latter are covered by a master contract negotiated, on the newspapers\u2019 behalf, by the Publishers\u2019 Association. But when joint negotiation via the Publishers\u2019 Association gives way to separate contracts with individual newspapers, Section 7-09 contemplates that The Ledger\u2019s composing room employees are to receive an increase equivalent to the average of the increases agreed to by the three leading dailies. The Arbitrator found that in the case at bar the bargaining process had been of the latter sort, but he did not follow out the logic of his factual finding to the legal conclusion mandated by the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In sum, we, like the district court, \u201ccan find no rational basis for the Arbitrator\u2019s award;\u201d and we therefore agree that the district court was \u201ccompelled to modify the award____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The bedrock of judicial enforceability of, <em>first, </em>the promise to arbitrate, and, <em>second, </em>the arbitral award, is the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that the arbitrator\u2019s \u201caward is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Steelworkers, </em>363 U.S. at 597, 80 S.Ct. at 1361. <em>See </em>Wellington, <em>Judicial Review of the Promise to Arbitrate, </em>37 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 470 (1962). The arbitral award that fails that test is entitled to no deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">. It will be recalled (see text, <em>supra, </em>at p. 163) that under the Local 103-Ledger contract, Section 7-06 calls for payment to Ledger composing room employees of \u201cthe total value of the weekly increases in wages and cost-of-living adjustments received by [Local 6] under its agreement with the Publishers\u2019 Association,\" whereas Section 7-09 provides that if \u201cthe Publishers\u2019 Association ... is disbanded or ceases to negotiate for more than one daily newspaper in New York City, then the increases under this contract shall be the average increases received by the New York Times, New York News and New York Post ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-11\">. In addition to modifying the award, the district court (1) rejected The Ledger\u2019s contention that the Arbitrator should not have proceeded with the arbitration when Local 103 changed its position, and (2) rejected Local 103\u2019s contention that the Arbitrator should have directed the payment of interest on the award. Neither of these questions has been presented to this court on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-12\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s formulation in 1960, in <em>Steelworkers, </em>remains, a generation later, the</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">authoritative exposition of the proper relationship between courts and labor arbitrators. The <em>Steelworkers </em>approach was adumbrated in important respects by Professor Summers\u2019 pioneering article several years before on <em>Judicial Review of Labor Arbitration, </em>2 Buffalo L.Rev. 1, 21-22, 24 (1952):</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">Labor arbitration is a part of the process of collective bargaining: a procedure for administering an agreement and adjusting disputes between the parties. The question is the practical one of the role which the courts should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>play in that procedure to make it serve more adequately the needs of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The difficulty of the question springs from the fact that labor arbitration itself rests upon a basic inconsistency. On the one hand both union and management prize their freedom to bargain. They demand the right to make their own agreement, and once made they insist that no one shall change it. The strength of this feeling is evidenced by the infrequency with which the parties will arbitrate the making of an agreement and the nearly unanimous objection of both parties to what is commonly known as compulsory arbitration. Because of this deep-rooted attitude, the parties usually insist that grievance arbitration be confined to \"interpretation and application\u201d of the agreement. On the other hand, one of the main reasons for arbitration is the failure of the parties to make a completed agreement. No attempt is made to provide explicitly for every potential dispute. On the contrary, gaps may be intentionally left, ambiguous phrases deliberately used, and minor problems left undiscussed. The agreement is signed with both parties knowing full well that many problems remain to be settled through the grievance procedure and by arbitration if necessary. Thus, arbitration becomes the means for completing the agreement. The parties themselves seldom see clearly the inconsistency of demands which they make on the arbitration process and it is this which the courts must discover.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The courts, in supervising labor arbitration, are faced with the dilemma posed by these conflicting desires of the parties. If the courts do not hold a check rein on arbitrators, the parties may be fearful that their agreement will be remade and therefore hesitate to use the arbitration process. But if the courts hold the reins too tightly, the arbitrator loses flexibility and his usefulness is greatly decreased.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Most important of all the arbitrator's qualifications is the fact that he is the product of the parties\u2019 free choice. The parties by agreeing to arbitration indicate a preference for that method of settling their disputes. They establish it as the administrative process best suited to their needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The fact that an arbitrator is an expert aided by a free procedure and vested with power by the consent of the parties does not mean that the courts should exercise no supervisory function. The parties\u2019 consent is but a limited one, and they need some assurance of protection from an arbitrator who may run amuck. Furthermore, judicial review has a preventative as well as curative value. Its very presence keeps arbitrators aware that their power is limited and reduces the temptation to play god for the parties. The need is not for judicial abdication, but for judicial restraint. The court should give full recognition to the expertness of the arbitrator and due deference to the choice of the parties, and substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator only when he was so palpably wrong that to allow his decision to stand would undermine confidence in the arbitration process itself. The test, however, can not be embodied in immutable words, for it is an attitude of tolerance and humility, not a mathematical formula.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b240-12\">. \"In the event that the Publishers\u2019 Association of New York City is disbanded or ceases to negotiate for more than one daily newspaper in New York City, then the increases under this contract shall be the average increases received by The New York Times, New York News and New York Post, to the extent that there are increases granted to any employees under said contract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\">. Those who are troubled by the notion of an \"increase\u201d of \"zero\u201d may find it easier to think of increases of, respectively, $38 (The Post), $38 (The News) and $38 + $25.93 + $.72 (The Times). The average of these increases is also $46.88.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\">. Judge Mansmann\u2019s dissenting opinion argues that, \"[b]y focusing on what it calls the \u2018flawed arithmetic\u2019 of the arbitrator, the majority fails to concentrate on what should be the central determination: whether there is any rational basis in the record for the award.\u201d Judge Mansmann's review of the testimony heard by the Arbitrator leads her to conclude that \"the arbitrator\u2019s award can be interpreted as having a</p>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">rational basis in the record. The strong national policy favoring the arbitration of labor disputes requires no more than that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">Giving full scope to the dissent\u2019s valiant effort to impute rationality to the arbitral award, we are persuaded that the Arbitrator\u2019s own exposition of his thought processes shields the award from that imputation. And we do not think that the \"strong national policy favoring the arbitration of labor disputes\u201d \u2014 a policy to which, as judges, we unreservedly subscribe \u2014 requires a court to disregard what an arbitrator says in order to justify what the arbitrator does.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b241-13\">MANSMANN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AEd\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">This appeal once again requires us to apply the standards governing the judicial review of arbitration awards. The law in this area is well-settled. We are required to affirm the arbitrator\u2019s decision \u201cso long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960) <em>(\u201cEnterprise Wheel </em>\u201d). The dispute before us involves the application of that law. Because I believe that the majority and the district court err in finding that the award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, I would reverse the entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">\u201cWhen the parties include an arbitration clause in their collective-bargaining agreement, they choose to have disputes concerning constructions of the contract resolved by the arbitrator.\u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local Union 759, International Un</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>ion of United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers of America, </em>461 U.S. 757, 764, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 2182, 76 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983). The judicial scope of review over arbitrators\u2019 decisions is therefore extremely narrow. \u201c[A] federal court may not overrule an arbitrator\u2019s decision simply because the court believes its own interpretation of the contract would be the better one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Courts must defer even to arbitrators\u2019 decisions which may be ambiguous. As the Supreme Court of the United States explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">Arbitrators have no obligation to the court to give their reasons for an award. To require opinions free of ambiguity may lead arbitrators to play it safe by writing no supporting opinions. This would be undesirable for a well-reasoned opinion tends to engender confidence in the integrity of the process and aids in clarifying the underlying agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqB\"><em>Enterprise Wheel, </em>363 U.S. at 598, 80 S.Ct. at 1361 (footnote omitted). In the absence of a violation of a specific command of law, fraud, partiality, or other misconduct on the part of the arbitrator, a reviewing court may disturb an award \u201conly where there is a manifest disregard of the agreement, totally unsupported by principles of contract construction and the law of the shop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1128 &amp; n. 27. We will affirm an award \u201cif the [arbitrator\u2019s] interpretation can in any rational way be derived from the agreement, viewed in the light of its language, its context, and any other indicia of the parties\u2019 intention.\u201d <em>Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co. v. Fletcher, </em>405 F.2d 1123, 1128 (3d Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In arriving at its determination that the arbitrator\u2019s award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, the majority erroneously focuses on mathematical formulas and its own interpretation of the language of the agreement. I believe that the majority\u2019s approach is error and that the arbitrator\u2019s award should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">The collective bargaining agreement provides that composing room employees, who are members of the defendant union, will receive increases equal to the weekly increases and cost-of-living adjustments negotiated by the New York Typographical Union No. 6 (\u201cNew York Union\u201d) under its agreement with the Publisher\u2019s Association of New York City (\u201cPublishers\u2019 Association\u201d). The agreement also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">In the event that the Publishers\u2019 Association of New York City is disbanded or ceases to negotiate for more than one daily newspaper in New York City, then the increases under this Contract shall be the average increases received by the New York Times, New York Daily News and New York Post, to the extent that there are increases granted to any employees under said contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">It is the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of this provision which is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">The Publishers\u2019 Association did not participate in the negotiations with the New York Union in 1984. Instead, each of the three New York papers listed in section 7-09 reached separate agreements with the union. The employees of all three papers received a weekly wage increase of $38. The employees of the News and the Post also received a lump-sum profit-sharing provision. The employees of the Times, in lieu of a profit-sharing provision, received an additional weekly wage increase of $25.93 plus a $.72 cost of living increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">The arbitrator decided that the plaintiff\u2019s employees were entitled to the increases negotiated by the Times: $38 plus $25.93, in lieu of profit-sharing, and $.72, cost of living increase, or a $64.65 weekly increase. The arbitrator reasoned, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">If News and Post employee[s] received bonuses, which are not increases, and Times employees received permanent increases, the average of the increases can not be determined, but any increases granted to any employees under said contract shall be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">Concluding that the arbitrator\u2019s award has no rational basis in the record, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>majority rejects the decision. The majority explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">To say that \u201cthe average of the increases can not be determined,\u201d where one of the increases is $25.93, plus $.72 cost-of-living, and the other two are zero, is flawed arithmetic. The average can be determined. The average is $8.64, plus $.24, for a total of $8.88. The sum of $8.88 and $38.00 (the base wage increase granted by all three dailies, and conceded by The Ledger) is $46.88, the weekly wage increase determined by the district court to be owing to The Ledger\u2019s composing room force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The majority adds in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">Those who are troubled by the notion of an \u201cincrease\u201d of \u201czero\u201d may find it easier to think of increases of, respectively, $38 (The Post), $38 (The News) and $38 + $25.93 + $.72 (The Times). The average of these increases is also $46.88.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In so holding, the majority ignores the admonition of Professor Summers, which it quotes in its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">The court should give full recognition to the expertness of the arbitrator and due deference to the choice of the parties, and substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrator only when he was so palpably wrong that to allow his decision to stand would undermine confidence in the arbitration process itself. The test, however, can not be embodied in immutable words, for it is an attitude of tolerance and humility, not a mathematical formula.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Summers, <em>Judicial Review of Labor Arbitration, </em>2 Buffalo L.Rev. 1, 24 (1952). By focusing on what it calls the \u201cflawed arithmetic\u201d of the arbitrator, the majority fails to concentrate on what should be the central determination: whether there is any rational basis in the record for the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Although it is ambiguous in part, the arbitrator\u2019s decision does draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator found that the Times employees had received wage increases for purposes of section 7-09. The arbitrator also found that the Times employees received those increases in lieu of the profit-sharing plans received by the News and the Post employees. Both the profit-sharing plans and the Times increases were equivalent to approximately a 4% increase in wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The arbitrator implicitly found that the parties to the collective bargaining agreement did not anticipate the use of profit-sharing plans as compared to traditional wage increases. Indeed, the record reflects that the profit-sharing schemes were adopted because the News and the Post were in financial trouble \u2014 the Times was not. The arbitrator apparently desired to afford some weight to the profit-sharing plans but concluded that it was impossible to average the three plans. Thus, he awarded the full amount of the Times increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">The arbitrator\u2019s award is supported by evidence in the record indicating that under previous \u201cme too\u201d wage provisions the plaintiff had paid increases equal to the total value of the benefits package negotiated by the New York Union. The only two witnesses at the arbitrator\u2019s hearing both testified that in the New York negotiations the parties negotiated a lump sum increase which included wages and other benefits. David Crocket, Vice-president and newspaper representative of the New York Union, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-14\">Well, let\u2019s say we negotiate $12. We did that in 1965, exactly $12. Then we decided from the $12 to allocate, if the members so desire by referendum, vote monies to welfare, to pension, to anything else they may want to buy under the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">Albert Chodash, a member of the defendant who participated in the negotiations with the plaintiff, testified that the defendant would receive the full amount of any package negotiated by the New York Union. Mr. Chodash explained under cross-examination by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">There is no direct provision for a bonus. However, it was understood that any monies received by New York Typo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>graphical Union we would get. As an example, you mentioned vacations. If they received \u2014 and I\u2019m using an arbitrary figure of $20 and they took $10 to buy vacations, while you may not allow us to buy vacations, you would have given us the $20. You have through the 10 years, whatever the amount was, no matter what they did with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In light of the testimony at the hearing, I am unwilling to find that the arbitrator\u2019s award does not have a rational basis in the record. The arbitrator may legitimately draw upon the history between the parties, the so-called \u201claw of the shop,\u201d in addition to principles of contract construction. <em>Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co., </em>405 F.2d at 1128. In the absence of a direct conflict between the award and the language of the collective bargaining agreement, we should enforce the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the agreement and the law of the shop. <em>See Super Tire Engineering Co. v. Teamsters Local Union No. 676, </em>721 F.2d 121, 124 (8d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 83, 83 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The majority errs when it ignores the arbitrator\u2019s view and applies its own principles of contract interpretation. <em>United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO v. American Smelting &amp; Refining Co., </em>648 F.2d 863, 869 (3d Cir.1981) (\u201cAlthough these are forceful arguments as a matter of contract interpretation, courts are not free to refuse to vacate arbitration awards merely because they might have interpreted the contract differently were it up to them in the first instance.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1031, 102 S.Ct. 567, 70 L.Ed.2d 474 (1981). The courts are not permitted to \u201cdisturb ambiguous, unclear, and even deliberately opague arbitration opinions because \u2018the policy in favor of the peaceful resolution of labor disputes through arbitration outweighs any damage which arbitration might cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arco-Polymers, Inc. v. Local 8-74, </em>671 F.2d 752, 755 (3d Cir.) (quoting <em>Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butchers Workmen of North America, Local 195, AFL-CIO v. Cross Brothers Meat Packers, Inc., </em>518 F.2d 1113, 1120 (3d Cir.1975)), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 828, 103 S.Ct. 63, 74 L.Ed.2d 65 (1982). Indeed, as we said in <em>Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co., </em>\u201c \u2018whether the arbitrators misconstrued a contract\u2019 does not open the award to judicial review.\u201d 405 F.2d at 1128 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">I believe the arbitrator\u2019s award can be interpreted as having a rational basis in the record. The strong national policy favoring the arbitration of labor disputes requires no more than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Because I believe that the arbitrator\u2019s award \u201cdraws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement, I would reverse the decision of the district court and reinstate the award of the arbitrator.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
