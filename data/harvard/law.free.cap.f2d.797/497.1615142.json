Darden\u2019s Title VII complaint was filed <em>pro se, </em>and the district court subsequently denied his motion for appointment of counsel. Some months later, the district court granted summary judgment to Illinois Bell on two of Darden\u2019s three claims; the parties entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the third claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Darden now appeals the district court\u2019s treatment of his request for counsel and conclusions regarding the merits of his claims. We affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings on both issues, although not without reservations on Darden\u2019s request for counsel. In order to aid district courts in their treatment of requests for counsel, this opinion not only clarifies our previous holdings, but also establishes procedural guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-21\">Illinois Bell hired Darden in October 1975, and his subsequent employment history was marred by numerous charges of tardiness and absenteeism. \u25a0 Illinois Bell discharged Darden for tardiness in 1976 but reinstated him in December 1977 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>effect a settlement of his grievance. From January 1978 until his final discharge in October 1979, Illinois Bell charged Darden with more instances of tardiness, placing him on probation several times and in some cases suspending him. During this period Darden filed two charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC): the first, filed in January 1979, alleged that Illinois Bell had for racial reasons passed over Darden for transfers and promotions. Darden, Illinois Bell, and the EEOC executed an agreement settling this charge in March 1979 by establishing a job performance assessment program. The second charge, filed in August 1979, alleged that in retaliation for Darden\u2019s first EEOC complaint, Illinois Bell was engaging in a pattern of harassment by disciplining him more severely for tardiness than other employees. This claim was not settled because Darden was permanently discharged on October 17, 1979 for an unexcused absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">After his termination, Darden amended the remaining EEOC charge to include a complaint based on retaliatory discharge. In November the EEOC issued its opinion finding \u201cno reasonable cause\u201d to believe that Illinois Bell had disciplined or discharged Darden either because of his race or in retaliation for his previous EEOC complaint. The EEOC then issued a right to sue letter and on January 17, 1980, Darden filed his <em>pro se </em>suit. Darden separately grieved the discharge through his union and submitted to arbitration. In February 1981, the arbitrator determined that Illinois Bell had \u201cjust cause\u201d to discharge Darden and that Darden had failed to prove that Illinois Bell had fired him for discriminatory or retaliatory reasons. Subsequently, the trial court denied Darden\u2019s request for counsel and, relying in part on the arbitrator\u2019s decision, granted summary judgment to Illinois Bell on Darden\u2019s claim that Illinois Bell had no just cause to discharge him and had discriminated against him in violation of Title VII. We granted Darden\u2019s request for appointed counsel for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Darden\u2019s first issue on appeal concerns the district court\u2019s treatment of his requests for counsel. Darden apparently made two such requests: although the first does not appear on the district court\u2019s docket, the court on March 6, 1981, issued an order denying appointed counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Darden made a second request on May 22, 1981, to which the district court made no response. Darden\u2019s position is that both the district court\u2019s refusal to appoint counsel and its failure to respond to the second request constituted an abuse of discretion. <em>See Jones v. WFYR Radio/RKO General, </em>626 F.2d 576, 578 (7th Cir.1980) (\u201cdenial of counsel will only be overturned for an abuse of discretion\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds, Randle v. Victor Welding Supply Co., </em>664 F.2d 1064 (7th Cir.1981) (plaintiffs cannot take interlocutory appeals from denials of their counsel requests).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The court\u2019s initial decision to deny Darden appointed counsel is to be analyzed, as Darden correctly points out, under the guidelines discussed in <em>Jones, supra. See, e.g., McKnight v. United States Steel Corp., </em>726 F.2d 333, 337 (7th Cir.1984). Those guidelines \u201carticulate[] three factors to be weighed by the district court: the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the plaintiff\u2019s. diligence in attempting to obtain a lawyer, and the plaintiff\u2019s financial ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>to retain counsel.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>626 F.2d at 577. Darden claims that the district court failed to undertake a well-reasoned consideration of any of these factors, since the record does not reveal that Darden had any opportunity to present the court with his objections to the EEOC\u2019s findings on the merits, or that he was aware that he should provide the court with information about his attempts to find a lawyer and his financial status. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny appointed counsel because the court correctly determined that Darden\u2019s Title VII claims had no merit. Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s treatment of the counsel request demonstrates that while the factors enunciated in <em>Jones </em>are unambiguous, the process that the court must undergo in order to implement them appropriately is less than clear. We will briefly discuss this process before turning to the court\u2019s treatment of the individual factors in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">It is apparent from the nature of the <em>Jones </em>factors that any one of them may be determinative in a particular case. That is, if a discrimination claim lacks merit, counsel will not be appointed regardless of the plaintiff\u2019s diligence in seeking representation or lack of financial means.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, a plaintiff with a very strong case may be refused appointed counsel because he or she is able to pay for an attorney. A judge does not necessarily err, therefore, by basing the counsel decision on one factor alone. Nevertheless, the object of the undertaking is to ensure appropriate decisions at both the district court and appellate levels by gathering and preserving on the record as much information as is reasonably feasible at the most opportune stage in the proceedings. Thus, even if the district court is convinced that one factor is determinative, it should preserve on the record information relevant to the other two <em>Jones </em>factors, as detailed below at pages 7-8. Since it is the plaintiff who must provide the court with this information, the court should ensure an adequate record by providing \u201csome guidance to the plaintiff regarding the factors that it may consider ... and the showing that will be expected of plaintiff.\u201d <em>Poindexter v. FBI, </em>737 F.2d 1173, 1184 (D.C.Cir.1984). Although this record-creating process need not be elaborate, it will lessen the likelihood that the district court\u2019s decision will be attacked as baseless, as well as the necessity for remand should the district court\u2019s assessment of the determinative factor be overturned on appeal. We turn now to examine the <em>Jones </em>factors individually and the adequacy of the district court\u2019s inquiry in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">With regard to the issue of merits, we noted in <em>Jones </em>that the trial court cannot rely solely on the EEOC\u2019s finding of \u201cno reasonable cause\u201d to justify a denial of counsel for lack of merit. \u201cRather, the district court should make some appraisal of the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 626 F.2d at 577. We explained that this appraisal need not be extensive, but we suggested that the court \u201cconduct a brief oral examination of the plaintiff and review the EEOC record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded in <em>Jones </em>that \u201cif the court finds that the EEOC\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence and that the plaintiff\u2019s objections to the determination are insubstantial, it may accord the Commission\u2019s findings weight.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Here, the district judge indicated both in his order denying counsel and in a subsequent memorandum and order that he had requested and reviewed \u201cthe entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>EEOC investigative file\u201d on Darden\u2019s final amended charge. The judge concluded from his review that \u201cthere is insufficient merit to the claim to justify appointment of counsel.\u201d This satisfies our requirement that the district court make an independent determination of the merits from the EEOC file, and the judge\u2019s finding of no merit in Darden\u2019s case was not erroneous. We are concerned, however, by the absence in the record of any indication that Darden had an opportunity to explain to the court his objections to the EEOC\u2019s determination. Our language in <em>Jones </em>made it clear that the plaintiff\u2019s information should be part of the basis of any informed evaluation of a counsel request. We hold, therefore, that in cases in which a counsel request is denied because of the claim\u2019s lack of merit, the record must reflect that the court gave the plaintiff an opportunity to give his or her version of the facts and to object to the EEOC\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">If the court denies a counsel request on merit grounds without providing the plaintiff this opportunity, it risks a remand unless another ground for affirmance appears in the record. A remand is not necessary in this case, however, because when Darden filed his second request for counsel, he put in writing his objections to the EEOC\u2019s \u201cno reasonable cause\u201d determination. Our review of his statement reveals that his objections were insubstantial and on their face involved issues and claims that were put before the Commission. Thus, even had Darden communicated these objections to the district court before its ruling on the first motion, the outcome would not have been different. We caution, however, that a district court should not supplant this \u201cmerits dialogue\u201d with a plaintiff by relying on the plaintiff to put his or her views of the merits into the record at a later date. Even if a plaintiff did so, in most cases we doubt whether the record would be sufficiently complete for us to determine, as we were able to do here, that, the plaintiff\u2019s objections are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The two other <em>Jones </em>factors similarly should not be overlooked. We noted above that the record should demonstrate that the district judge informed the plaintiff that he or she should submit evidence of attempts to retain counsel and financial status. This information can be made available to plaintiffs either verbally or in a printed page appended to the court\u2019s form Title VII complaint. The notification can be brief and simple; its object is not to create a procedural right in the <em>pro se </em>plaintiff, but to provide the court with a basis on which to make its determination. After all, a decision made in the absence of a basis is an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The district court here implied that its decision to deny appointed counsel was grounded in all three <em>Jones </em>factors, although the record fails to reflect that the court had any basis on which to evaluate Darden\u2019s efforts to obtain counsel and his lack of financial ability. Nevertheless, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny Darden\u2019s request because of his claim\u2019s lack of substantive merit. We emphasize, however, that in order to avoid reversal for an incorrect assessment of one of the factors, a district court should not limit the record to its review of that one factor. Instead, a complete record would reveal that the Title VII plaintiff was informed of the requirements for appointment of counsel and was given an opportunity to attempt to satisfy those requirements. As we noted above, this manner of handling requests for counsel is important to increase the chances of correct decisions\u2014 both at the trial and appellate levels \u2014 on requests for counsel and to avoid costly and time-consuming remands. The D.C. Circuit noted in <em>Poindexter </em>that \u201c[t]he goal, of course, is to make a sound determination as to whether appointment is appropriate. Achievement of this goal is most likely if the relevant information is before the court.\u201d 737 F.2d at 1184. We thus affirm the district court\u2019s March 6, 1981 denial of counsel, subject to the precautions outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Darden makes a final claim concerning appointment of counsel: his second request, filed on May 22, 1981, received no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>response from the court. Darden suggests that the district court\u2019s failure to act on this motion constituted an abuse of discretion. We decline to hold that the court abused its discretion when it made no comment on a motion filed less than three months after its denial of a previous request. In general, however, the court should encourage plaintiffs to update requests for counsel, provided that new information is available or that their situations have changed. This illustrates why it is so important for courts at the outset to inform plaintiffs of the <em>Jones </em>factors: once plaintiffs have made their initial requests based on those factors, courts can limit their review of subsequent motions to new materials or changed circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">To summarize, we affirm the district court\u2019s refusal to appoint counsel, based on the fact that Darden\u2019s underlying claim was of insufficient merit. We suggest, however, that plaintiffs be informed at the outset of the factors on which their requests will be decided and be given some opportunity to object to the agency determination of their claim\u2019s merits. At a minimum, then, the <em>pro se </em>plaintiff should be informed: (1) that he or she has an opportunity to provide the court with an assessment of the merits, including the opportunity to enter objections to the EEOC\u2019s decision; (2) that diligence in attempting to procure counsel is relevant and that some showing of diligence should be made; and (3) that financial ability to pay for counsel is relevant and that he or she should provide the court with a statement of financial status. We further encourage district courts to facilitate periodic updating of counsel requests. These procedures will ensure that counsel requests contain sufficient facts for efficient, informed decision-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">We come now to Darden\u2019s contention that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Illinois Bell. A review of the district court\u2019s decision reveals that it was based on sound reasoning and an appropriate use of the arbitrator\u2019s determination, and the decision therefore is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Darden\u2019s suit, as it developed in the district court, contained three claims: (1) the claim that Illinois Bell discharged Darden without just cause; (2) the claim that the discharge was violative of Title YII because it was motivated by racial discrimination and the desire to retaliate for Darden\u2019s EEOC charges; and (3) the claim, later settled, that Illinois Bell had breached the agreement executed in March 1979, concerning the company\u2019s failure to promote Darden. On appeal, Darden now seeks to recharacterize his suit as also including a discrimination claim based on the underlying failure to promote and one alleging discrimination in disciplinary <em>procedures, </em>as opposed to discharge. Since these claims were not before the arbitrator, Darden urges us to hold that the district court accordingly erred in granting Illinois Bell summary judgment. The district court record is not susceptible of this reading of the suit, however. Darden submitted to that court an extraordinarily careful and well-organized position statement and memorandum that clearly set forth the three claims noted above. Moreover, the parties conducted the litigation according to these parameters. It is too late, therefore, to recast the issues in order to find error in the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">Turning to Darden\u2019s final assertion, that the district court gave too much weight to the arbitrator\u2019s determination when it granted summary judgment on the first two claims, we find no error. First, the district court properly construed Darden\u2019s \u201cjust cause\u201d claim as a contractual one <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and therefore was correct in holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>that Darden could not seek review of the arbitration award without alleging that the union breached its duty of fair representation in the arbitration proceedings. <em>Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, </em>424 U.S. 554, 567, 96 S.Ct. 1048, 1057, 47 L.Ed.2d 231 (1976). Since Darden did not make that allegation, the arbitrator\u2019s determination on the \u201cjust cause\u201d issue must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The arbitrator\u2019s decision on the Title VII claim is <em>not </em>entitled to complete deference, however. <em>Alexander v. Gardner-Denver, </em>415 U.S. 36, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974). The Supreme Court in <em>Gardner-Denver </em>refused to make a holding regarding the specific weight to be given to an arbitrator\u2019s decision, but stated that a court could accord \u201cgreat weight\u201d to a determination that gave full consideration to the Title VII claim. The Court cautioned, though, that Congress had entrusted the \u201cultimate resolution of discriminatory employment claims\u201d to the judiciary. <em>Id. </em>at 1025 n. 21. The district court was well aware of this and accorded the arbitration decision \u201cgreat weight,\u201d while recognizing that \u201cgreat weight\u201d is not the same as \u201cbeyond dispute.\u201d The \u201cgreat weight\u201d standard was appropriate here, since the arbitrator clearly construed the collective bargaining agreement in accord with Title VII to proscribe racially discriminatory and retaliatory discharges, and thus fully considered Darden\u2019s Title VII claim. Reviewing the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Illinois Bell had not discharged Darden for either of these illicit reasons, along with the totality of the evidence (which, as Darden himself acknowledges, was the same evidence that had been before the arbitrator), the district court did not err when it held that Darden had failed to create a genuine dispute as to the real reason for his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\">. This settlement renders moot the jurisdictional question raised by this panel. Darden had appealed the district court's summary judgment order before a final resolution was achieved on the third claim, after the district court granted his petition for certification for immediate appeal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). Although we requested briefing on the appropriateness of this appeal, the fact that the third claim has since been resolved means that a final judgment now has been entered on all of Darden's claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-5\">. The sequence of events highlights, as Darden points out, the difficulty of proceeding without counsel. Darden filed his complaint and petition to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on January 17, 1980, and the district court denied the petition on January 25, 1980. Although Darden paid his filing fee within a month, the clerk failed to file and serve Darden\u2019s complaint on Illinois Bell until March 3, <em>1981 </em>\u2014more than a year after suit was filed. The court shortly thereafter made its ruling on the request for counsel. While Darden claims no prejudice resulting from this delay, we urge the district courts to make special efforts to protect <em>pro se </em>litigants from lengthy delays. Specifically with regard to requests for counsel, district courts should engage <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs in a dialogue, <em>see infra </em>pp. 501-502, at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-6\">. The merits determination is made more difficult by the fact that the plaintiff is unrepresented and is thus far less likely to present his or her claims in their best light. We need not decide here just how much of an argument on the merits the plaintiff must have, since Darden\u2019s Title VII claims clearly had no merit. It should be noted that there is a spectrum of merit-related decisions that extends between summary judgment determinations and dismissals for frivolousness. The determination involved in the Title VII appointed counsel context is much closer to the latter than the former because of Congress\u2019s concern for unrepresented Title VII litigants and because, as we noted above, most unrepresented plaintiffs will fail to present the merits of their cases skillfully.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\">. Courts also may want to re-evaluate <em>successful </em>requests for appointed counsel at periodic intervals. Should the plaintiffs financial situation improve, the court may order that some or all of counsel fees be borne by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b577-15\"> Even if the \"just cause\u201d claim encompassed a Title VII claim, Darden was not harmed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>court's deference to the arbitration award since all of his Title VII claims were independently reviewed by the court. <em>See infra </em>p. 504.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b578-8\">EASTERBROOK, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ac5\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">I join the opinion of the court. Although pro se litigants are not generally entitled to be told the law, see <em>Jacobsen v. Filler, </em>790 F.2d 1362 (9th Cir.1986), for the judge is not an ombudsman, it is humane as well as prudent to help the pro se litigant learn the essential ingredients of a request for appointed counsel. Knowledge makes it easier for a person to vindicate his substantive rights and for the judge to pass on the litigant's claims. Simple notices of preliminary steps, especially how to apply for counsel, are wise judicial administration. The court makes it clear, however, that not all wise things create personal rights. I hope we shall not see complaints about the adequacy of the notice, as opposed to the substance of the judges\u2019 decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The court properly leaves open questions concerning the extent to which judges should appoint counsel under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l). The statute does not require district judges to appoint counsel whenever an impecunious plaintiff has been unable to persuade a lawyer to bring a colorable case. A judge should find out <em>why </em>counsel declined to take the case. If no one would take the case because the plaintiff was obnoxious or because other cases were stronger on the merits, a judge ought not to appoint counsel. This would force the civil rights bar to displace strong cases with weak ones; lawyers should be able to handle the strongest cases first.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">One reason why judges do not review prosecutors\u2019 decisions to pick some cases rather than others is that they cannot see the full menu of choices and therefore cannot make intelligent decisions about which cases are the best available. <em>United States v. Schwartz, </em>787 F.2d 257, 266 (7th Cir.1986). There is a similar problem deciding which cases need the assistance of counsel. Some litigants will handle their own cases better than others; the assistance of counsel should be used only when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>its marginal benefit is greatest, but this is hard to tell from a review of the case file. And lawyers must exercise judgment in choosing from the palette available. If a good lawyer skilled in Title VII law would decline to represent a paying client with a 20% chance of prevailing, a judge ought not compel that same lawyer to take the case of an indigent plaintiff with a 15% chance of prevailing. A colorable claim is not enough. Indigents are not entitled to preferential treatment. All who claim scarce resources must pay, stand in line, show a superior entitlement, or all three.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Congress did not doubt the value of voluntary transactions in allocating legal services. The statute authorizing the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in civil rights cases, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, depends on voluntary arrangements as the mainstay of civil rights enforcement. Attorneys\u2019 time should go first where it is most valuable. People claiming to have been injured by defective products must persuade lawyers to take their cases, and as a rule people claiming to have been injured by violations of Title VII also should abide the judgment of the bar about whose case is strongest. Yet if a person has trouble getting a lawyer because the bar is hostile to civil rights claims, or because the anticipated attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1988 are insufficient, then there is a stronger reason to appoint counsel. Unless fees under \u00a7 1988 are enhanced to take account of the risk of losing \u2014 whether through a multiplier or by the contingent fee device when the stakes are high \u2014 fees will be systematically too small. See <em>Kirchoff v. Flynn, </em>786 F.2d 320, 325-26 (7th Cir.1986). So the appointment of counsel under \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) may be an important tool. But it is not one to be used reflexively. A large bar is engaged in Title VII practice. This bar brings many cases, some with excellent chances and some marginal. This court has not been flooded with colorable cases, prosecuted pro se, that leave us wondering why no member of the bar would assist. Experience should lead us to rely on the care of the legal profession and of the district courts to decide when cases should proceed with counsel. See <em>Merritt v. Faulkner, </em>697 F.2d 761 (7th Cir.1983), at 764-66 (majority opinion), 769-71 (dissenting opinion). I do not understand today\u2019s decision to diminish the discretion of the district courts to make prudent judgments about whether to conscript members of the bar to take cases when they have good reasons to do other work instead. See <em>Maclin v. Freake, </em>650 F.2d 885, 886 (7th Cir.1981).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
