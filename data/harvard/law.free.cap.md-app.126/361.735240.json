It arises from the dissolution of the marriage of Edward S. Digges, Jr., appellant/cross-appellee, and Wendy W. Digges, appel-lee/cross-appellant. The parties were divorced on July 28, 1995, after twenty-six years of marriage, on the ground of a two year separation. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1991 Repl-VoL), \u00a7 7-103(5) of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d). In conjunction with the divorce, the court awarded sole custody of the couple\u2019s three minor children to Ms. Digges. For purposes of calculating child support and alimony, the trial court found that Mr. Digges had voluntarily impoverished himself, and ordered him to pay 1) child support in the amount of $1,312.62 per month; 2) indefinite alimony in the amount of $2,250 per month; and 3) and appellee\u2019s counsel fees, in the amount of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Thereafter, in an unreported, <em>per curiam, </em>opinion, this Court affirmed the lower court\u2019s determination that appellant had voluntarily impoverished himself. Nevertheless, we determined that the trial court erred in its conclusion as to appellant\u2019s earning potential. Accordingly, we remanded the matter to the trial court to re-compute appellant\u2019s potential income, and to reconsider appellant\u2019s obligations for child sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>port, alimony, and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Digges v. Digges, </em>No. 493, September Term, 1996, 114 Md.App. 720 (filed February 25, 1997)(hereinafter, <em>\u201cDigges I </em>\u201d). Appellant now challenges the trial court\u2019s rulings on remand, and presents several issues for our review, which we have rephrased and consolidated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">I. Did the court err in using appellant\u2019s potential income in determining the awards for child support, alimony, and attorney\u2019s fees, rather than his actual income?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">II. Did the court err in awarding indefinite alimony to appellee?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In her cross appeal, appellee presents one issue for our consideration, which we have also rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">For purposes of determining the amount of the award of indefinite alimony, did the court err by including income from appellee\u2019s part-time job?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">We answer each question in the negative. Accordingly, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Factual Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Mr. and Ms. Digges were married on May 31, 1969. Five children were born to the couple: Courtney, bom October 3, 1974; Edward III, born April 27, 1976; Ashley, born October 27, 1979; John Bradford, born May 17, 1981; and Brittany Anne, born September 19,1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Appellant holds a bachelor\u2019s degree from Princeton University and a law degree from the University of Maryland School of Law. After his admission to the bar, Mr. Digges began a successful and lucrative career as a commercial litigator with a distinguished Baltimore law firm. In 1984, appellant founded and became the managing partner of the Annapolis law firm of Digges, Wharton, and Levin, earning a substantial income. After Mr. Digges founded the Annapolis firm, the Digges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>family lived on a waterfront property in Kent County, Maryland called \u201cHinchingham.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Ms. Digges received her bachelor\u2019s degree in elementary education from Towson State University in 1970. Between 1970 and 1974, she taught in Baltimore City and Anne Arundel County. When the couple\u2019s first child was born in 1974, appellee left her job as a school teacher and became a full-time homemaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In November 1989, appellant was indicted in federal court on six counts of mail fraud. Those charges stemmed from an allegation that Mr. Digges fraudulently overbilled one of his firm\u2019s clients, Dresser Industries, Inc. (\u201cDresser\u201d). On January 16, 1990, appellant voluntarily consented to disbarment. Digges subsequently pled guilty to one count of mail fraud and was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Morgantown, West Virginia from May 7, 1990 until April 27, 1992. In addition, Mr. Digges was fined $80,500, and ordered to pay one million dollars in restitution to Dresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Dresser industries ultimately obtained a judgment of three- and-one-half million dollars against appellant and his two law partners, jointly and severally. Although Mr. Digges filed for bankruptcy, the judgment was not discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">On September 28, 1992, Ms. Digges was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Notwithstanding the news, appellant left the marital home the next day. It was later discovered that appellee suffers from a \u201cstress related condition,\u201d but not multiple sclerosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">On August 30,1994, appellant filed a complaint for absolute divorce in the Circuit Court for Kent County. Thereafter, on October 11, 1994, appellee filed a counterclaim, alleging desertion and adultery. Ms. Digges sought rehabilitative and indefinite alimony, sole custody of the couple\u2019s children, child support, a monetary award, costs, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Trial was held from May 25,1995 through June 1,1995. At trial, Martin Kranitz, an expert in vocational evaluation, testified on behalf of Ms. Digges. He opined that appellant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>potentially earn from $60,000 \u2014 $75,000 as a non-attorney representative for Social Security clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">On July 28, 1995, the court filed a written Memorandum Opinion, Order and Judgment. The court prefaced its discussion of the background facts with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqy-dedup-0\">[E]xcept for her ability to give a fair market value on property, the court gives full credibility to the testimony of Wife. On the other hand, the court does not find Husband to be as creditable [sic] a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In making its rulings as to alimony, child support, and counsel fees, the court found that, in 1994, Ms. Digges earned approximately $3,200.00. The court observed that appellee \u201cis looking for full-time employment as a teacher where she would probably earn approximately $30,000.00 per year.\u201d The court also recognized that Mr. Digges \u201chas not maintained regular employment since his release from prison in 1992, [but] he either directly or through his family was able to provide approximately $5,000.00 per month to [Ms. Digges] for the support and maintenance of the family.\u201d That support, however, \u201cended coincidentally with the filing of [Ms. Digges\u2019s] Response to the Complaint in October of 1994.\u201d Moreover, the court concluded that since his incarceration, Mr. Digges had \u201cchosen to deprive himself of resources with the intention of avoiding financial obligations, which not only include the Dresser judgment, but include child support and spousal obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The court examined each of the factors prescribed in F.L. \u00a7 ll-106(b) regarding alimony. In a section entitled \u201c[t]he ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party\u2019s needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony\u201d, <em>see </em>F.L. \u00a7 ll-106(b)(9), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">Husband claims he is unable to obtain gainful employment until after he has completed his master\u2019s degree from the University of Pittsburgh. He claims that he is unable to work in the field of law as anything more than a paralegal, due to his conviction for mail fraud. At the time of his conviction, Husband surrendered his license to practice law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Since his release from prison, Husband has occasionally worked as a consultant, where at one point he was paid $75,000.00. He has also assisted his father and other family members by giving advice and by helping to maintain the family properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">While not all mail fraud convictions result in disciplinary sanctions being imposed by the Court of Appeals, the facts of this case which indicate fraudulent billings to clients would likely indicate the imposition of sanctions. It is understandable why Husband surrendered his license to practice law prior to sanctions being sought. That does not, however, explain why Husband has not sought gainful employment. Husband uses his conviction as a reason for not having employment. He has no history of rejection from application for employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">He also uses his current enrollment in a Master\u2019s for Business Administration as a reason for not being employed. There has been no proof that the program in which he is enrolled is a full-time program which would prohibit him from maintaining employment while completing his additional education. The program appears to be designed for the working student.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">This court is convinced that Husband refuses to maintain gainful employment because he has no intention of satisfying the judgment lodged against him by Dresser. Presumably, if he has no visible earnings, Dresser has nothing to garnish or attach. Clearly husband has chosen to deprive himself of resources with the intention of avoiding financial obligations, which would not only include the Dresser judgment, but include child support and spousal obligations. In making this finding, the court has considered the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">a. Husband\u2019s current physical condition is good;</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">b. Husband is a graduate of Princeton; he holds a Law degree and is soon to have a Master\u2019s in Business Administration\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>c. Husband\u2019s employment as an attorney changed at the time of his conviction, however, he has had three years since his release in which to obtain gainful employment;</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">d. Husband, either directly or indirectly, provided for his wife and family prior to her response to his complaint for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">e. Husband has shown no effort toward finding or retaining employment;</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">f. Husband is seeking a Master\u2019s in Business Administration, a form of retraining, however, he is making no effort toward obtaining employment while seeking that retraining;</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">g. Husband has not supported his children or maintained his spouse since October of 1994;</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">h. Husband was a very successful attorney and since his release from prison has held himself out to be a \u201cconsultant\u201d with one client having paid him $75,000.00;</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">i. Husband\u2019s official address is at the Hinchingham farm in Kent County, however, at any given time he can be found at family property in Southern Maryland or with a friend in Baltimore County. The court finds that the Husband\u2019s job market would encompass the mid-Atlantic region. The court finds that there is room in the market for business consultants such as someone with Husband\u2019s credentials;</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">j. The court will also consider at this time that Husband maintains a comfortable life style, including his membership at the Princeton Club in New York City.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\"><em>See John O. v. Jane O., </em>90 Md.App. 406, 422, 601 A.2d 149 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">Husband has voluntarily impoverished himself. Therefore, the court finds that Husband has the ability to meet his own needs while meeting the needs of his Wife. <em>Husband earns $75,000.00 from one client, therefore, the court finds Husband is capable of earning at least $75,000.00 per year from outside sources and that he receives at least $25,000.00 per year \u201ccompensation\u201d for services rendered to his family, albeit that compensation has been labeled as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>\u201cloans\u201d and \u201cgifts.\u201d The court finds that Husband is capable of earning at least $100,000.00 per year in total. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">As we noted, the court found that after appellant\u2019s release from prison, he earned $75,000.00 from one client, for consulting services. This finding was based on evidence that while appellant was in prison, he provided consulting services to Gary VanWaeynberge, a fellow inmate. Appellant testified that he offered VanWaeynberge \u201c \u2018advice relative to ventures that he [VanWaeynberge] was attempting to get under way here in the United States one way or the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Digges I, </em>slip op. at 7. The court then calculated appellant\u2019s child support obligation based on an estimated annual salary of $100,000.00 for him, and a salary of $6,000.00 per annum for appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">On August 30, 1995, the court amended its judgment, concluding that, as of June 30, 1995, appellant was $11,813.58 in arrears in child support, and $20,250.00 in arrears in alimony. Although the court originally ordered rehabilitative alimony, it revised the award by making the alimony permanent. The court explained that \u201c[a]fter [Ms. Digges] will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, the respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.\u201d <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 11-106(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Appellant subsequently appealed to this Court. He argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court was clearly erroneous in finding that he had voluntarily impoverished himself. In appellant\u2019s view, \u201cthe only reason for his current state of \u2018impoverishment\u2019 is his conviction, incarceration, and surrender of his license to practice law.\u201d <em>Digges I, </em>slip op. at 9. Appellant also challenged the court\u2019s awards, arguing that they were improperly based on an erroneous finding that he had an earning potential of $100,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">In <em>Digges I, </em>we affirmed the court\u2019s ruling that appellant had voluntarily impoverished himself. We held that \u201cthe evidence was sufficient to show that the primary cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>appellant\u2019s impoverishment was not his incarceration nor the loss of his law license but his total lack of interest or effort in attempting to find and secure regular, gainful employment.\u201d Further, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">Slothfully, [appellant] waited for more than a year after his release from prison to start graduate school and even then he selected a part-time educational program designed for a person who held a part-time job. By showing initiative, Digges, like his fellow students, could have worked and attended college. We are persuaded that a rational trier of fact could have found that Digges was voluntarily impoverished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\"><em>Id., </em>slip op. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Nonetheless, we reversed the court\u2019s finding that appellant had a potential income of $100,000.00. That income figure was based in large measure on the court\u2019s determination that, subsequent to Digges\u2019s release from prison, one client had paid him $75,000.00 for consulting services. We concluded, however, that the trial judge erred in finding that appellant had earned the $75,000. We explained: \u201cApparently, the trial judge confused the $75,000.00 figure with the actual figure of $87,500.00 and then assumed the money was paid for services rendered while imprisoned and not as a loan.\u201d We also found that even if appellant had earned $75,000.00 as a consultant in prison, \u201cthere was no evidence to support the assumption that he could continue to earn that amount of income on a regular basis\u201d when released. Accordingly, we remanded \u201cfor a reevaluation of Digges\u2019s potential income and for a re-determination of the appropriate level of child support based upon the guidelines.\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 14. Further, we indicated that, \u201c[o]n remand, the trial court, in its discretion, <em>may receive additional evidence regarding potential income, inclvding testimony as to appellant\u2019s income since the case was originally tried.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Significantly, we rejected appellant\u2019s claim that the award of alimony could not be calculated based on appellant\u2019s potential income. To the contrary, we said that potential income is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>relevant to a consideration of \u201c[t]he ability of the party from whom alimony is sought to meet that party\u2019s needs while meeting the needs of the party seeking alimony.\u201d <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(9). With respect to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, we also noted that F.L. \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(b) requires the court to consider \u201cthe financial resources and financial needs of both parties.\u201d We observed that \u201c[t]he factors underlying awards of alimony, monetary award, and counsel fees are so interrelated that, when a trial court considers a claim for any one of them, it must weigh the award of any other.\u201d Slip op. at 17 (quoting <em>Doser v. Doser, </em>106 Md.App. 329, 335 n. 1, 664 A.2d 453 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">From October 20, 1997 through October 22, 1997, the circuit court conducted a remand hearing. Ms. Digges testified about her ordeal in securing adequate housing and providing for her children during the pendency of the divorce proceedings. She explained that Hinchingham had originally been titled to the parties as tenants by the entireties, but claimed that her name was removed from the deed without her consent. Although appellee\u2019s signature appeared on a deed conveying her interest in the property, she averred that the deed was notarized by one Loretta M. Poole, a woman whom Ms. Digges claims she never met. Around the time that appellant\u2019s legal troubles began, appellant, who was then the sole owner of the property, conveyed Hinchingham to his father.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although appellant\u2019s father allowed Ms. Digges and the children to live at Hinchingham until October 1994, economic assistance from the Digges family ceased when Ms. Digges filed her counterclaim for absolute divorce. Consequently, in October 1994, appellee and the children moved to a rental property. Then, on May 26, 1995, the family was evicted from the rental property, and they were forced to live rent free at a local church. Subsequently, Ms. Digges and the children moved to a two-bedroom apartment in Chestertown. Appellee testified that she slept on a mattress on the floor in the living room so that her two youngest children could sleep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>in the bedrooms. As a result of the family\u2019s eviction and economic uncertainty, appellee claimed at trial that she suffered from anxiety, sleeplessness, and severe allergies. She also acknowledged that she is particularly afraid of being evicted again.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Charles Smolkin, an expert witness in the field of vocational assessment and income potential, testified for appellee. Smol-kin did not testify at the first trial. In Smolkin\u2019s view, appellant\u2019s background was best suited to the field of telecommunications consulting. Citing the 1996-1997 edition of the <em>Licensing Occupational Outlook Handbook, </em>published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Smol-kin stated that appellant \u201cfit the profile of a junior or senior partner in a consulting firm.\u201d The average salary in 1994 for such a position was $194,000.00. Smolkin opined that appellant is capable of annual earnings ranging between $120,000 and $194,000. In this regard, Smolkin explained that given appellant\u2019s work as a telecommunications consultant, he is capable of overcoming much of the stigma associated with his disbarment and mail fraud conviction. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">[ATTORNEY FOR APPELLEE]:. What role or influence do you feel that the felony conviction and the disbarment play in terms of his work in the area of consulting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">SMOLKIN:<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> The disbarment is important because I had to consider whether he\u2019s likely to be readmitted to the bar anytime soon, which, of course, would negate my having to make a judgement [sic] because he has already demonstrated his abilities in that arena. And I have no evidence that he is going to be readmitted to the bar anytime in the near future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">[ATTORNEY FOR APPELLEE]: With regard to the felony conviction as it relates to the type of work that he\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>doing and as it dovetails with his history of employment, how do you feel that that plays a role if at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">SMOLKIN: Do you know, in talking to him, if I didn\u2019t know the reality, I would say there\u2019s no felony conviction. And I think that is important because he\u2019s ... as a ... as a consultant, he is dealing with a field that does not require licensing and there\u2019s no necessary objective standard. And as he explained it to me, it appeared very logical that he had ... was an outstanding attorney who, through a gross misunderstanding of the billing method at a time when they weren\u2019t necessarily so contractual, ended up being a victim and serving time because he was a victim not because he did anything wrong. Now, I know that facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag0\">[ATTORNEY FOR APPELLEE]: Do you believe ... do you believe that, based on your interview, he\u2019s able to portray the victim role in a way that is convincing in terms of sales and marketing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">SMOLKIN: Yes. I ... I believe that he can ... he can take this conviction and explain it in a very logical manner and make the bad guy the government and the good guy Mr. Digges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">[ATTORNEY FOR APPELLEE]: Do you believe that ... the felony conviction is a significant hurdle or obstacle? SMOLKIN: It\u2019s an obstacle that would be significant for most people but not for Mr. Digges, not in this field.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Mr. Digges\u2019s income tax returns reflected income in 1995 of $10,617.00. In 1996, he reported $29,558 on his income tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">On December 9,1997, the court issued its written opinion, in which it discussed, <em>seriatim, </em>each of the factors set forth in F.L. \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b) regarding alimony. Six pages of the court\u2019s analysis on remand concerned the question of whether Mr. Digges could meet his own needs while meeting the needs of appellee and the couple\u2019s children. In addition, the court focused on Smolkin\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>In its opinion, the court made the following findings regarding appellant\u2019s employment history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">[T]he evidence revealed that Mr. Digges was employed by the law firm of Piper/Marbury in 1971. By 1977, he was a partner for that firm. In 1984, he earned approximately $375,000 spending half of his efforts in marketing and developing the firm\u2019s client base. At the end of March, 1984, he left that firm and became managing partner for his own firm, Digges, Whorton [sic], and Levin. In 1988, Mr. Digges earned approximately $750,000. According to Mr. Smolkin\u2019s research, this figure is almost seven times more than the average yearly salary of the most experienced lawyers in private industry in 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">Except for doing work for his family, he was not employed during 1992, 1993, and 1994, the years following his felony conviction. During 1995 and the main part of 1996, Mr. Digges worked as a part-time consultant for a telecommunications company called Telvest. From the end of 1996 to the present he has been employed as a consultant with Corcom.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The court also found that appellant has continued to avoid finding new employment. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">Mr. Digges has made little or no effort at finding and retaining meaningful employment. Although the Court acknowledges that Mr. Digges currently works part-time for Corcom, testimony revealed that his position evolved out of casual conversations between himself and the owners, who are social friends, rather than any real effort to secure employment. Those facts are consistent with the answers that Mr. Smolkin received when he asked Mr. Digges how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>he hopes to obtain consulting positions. Mr. Digges apparently answered that \u201che lets it be known\u201d that he is seeking employment in the consulting field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">To date, Mr. Digges has yet to prepare a curriculum vitae or fill out even one application for a job. In Mr. Smolkin\u2019s opinion, Mr. Digges will never fill out an employment application because he considers such a task to be \u201cbeneath\u201d him. When asked why he had not prepared a curriculum vitae, Mr. Digges told Mr. Smolkin that he has been working on obtaining his MBA. However, Mr. Digges\u2019s transcript from the University of Pittsburgh reveals that he is enrolled in a Flex Program designed for working adults. The program requires residence for only two weeks out of twelve. Despite the liberal schedule, Mr. Digges has completed the requirement for only eight credits toward his MBA. He has failed to meet the minimum standards on three credits, he had failed three credits, and he has twenty-five credits with unfinished work. Mr. Smolkin testified that given his academic achievements, Mr. Digges\u2019s performance at the University of Pittsburgh is almost incomprehensible. Thus, Mr. Smolkin concluded that [appellant\u2019s] poor performance further evidences is [sic] lack of effort at finding or obtaining employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Further, the court noted that appellant \u201cexpects to earn approximately $50,000 in the upcoming year.\u201d Notwithstanding his mail fraud conviction, the court also found that appellant had an annual earnings potential of $150,000.00. Nevertheless, the court conceded that appellant could not immediately reach the $150,000 plateau, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">In reaching this decision, this Court accepts the proposition that someone entering a new field, even with Mr. Digges\u2019s extraordinary capabilities, will require a period of time during which he can reestablish his contacts. Therefore, the Court finds that from October 31, 1994 to October 30, 1996, Mr. Digges had the potential to earn $85,000 per year; from October 31,1996 to October 30, 1997, he had the potential to earn $100,000; from October 31, 1997 to October 30, 1998 he has the capability to earn $125,000 until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>finally reaching his full earning potential of $150,000 per year on October 31,1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In addition, the court recognized that appellant \u201chas an extensive support system\u201d. The court also observed that appellant \u201ccontinues to have memberships in the Princeton Club and the Mid-Ocean Club in Bermuda despite his limited income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">As to Ms. Digges\u2019s income, the court found that since the time of the first trial, she had obtained full-time employment as a teacher at the Radcliffe Creek School in Kent County, earning a salary of $27,000 per year. She was certified to teach special education using the \u201cOrtin Gillinham\u201d method. Additionally, Ms. Digges earned an additional sum of $2,230.00 by teaching during the summer vacation. The court also found that appellee \u201ccontinues to earn approximately $240/ month by tutoring privately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">A financial statement completed by Ms. Digges on October 20, 1997 indicated that, on the eve of the remand hearing, she had expenses of $30,912 per year.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court found, however, that the October 1997 figure was too low, and represented an \u201cunrealistic indieation[ ] of what Mrs. Digges should spend per month in order to procure adequate housing and sustenance for herself and the Digges children.\u201d Accordingly, the court found that beginning in October 1997, Ms. Digges required $39,000.00 per year to meet her expenses. The court calculated appellant\u2019s child support obligation based on appellant\u2019s graduated \u201cpotential\u201d incomes, and Ms. Digges\u2019s \u201cactual\u201d incomes. The court summarized its findings regarding the parties\u2019 incomes in the following chart:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\">Because the court used a progressive scale to calculate appellant\u2019s potential income, his child support obligation varied from year to year. The child support also fluctuated because the court took into account that Ashley would turn eighteen in October 1997, that John would turn eighteen in May 1999, and that Brittany would reach her majority in September 2000. The court again utilized a chart to set out its ruling:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b402-29\">With regard to alimony, the court found that \u201can award of alimony for an indefinite period of time is proper in this case.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-30\">Mrs. Digges has made as much progress toward become self-supporting as can reasonably be expected given her medical condition and her current educational background. She can only increase her income by obtaining a Master\u2019s Degree in Education. Yet even if she does obtain a graduate degree, testimony revealed that her yearly earnings will only increase by approximately $5,000. That increase would place her estimated yearly earnings between $30,000 to $35,000. Mr. Digges [sic] maximum earning potential beginning in 1999 is $150,000 or five times as much. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Another chart distilled the court\u2019s ruling as to alimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b403-33\">Additionally, the court awarded Ms. Digges $76,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, which represented <em>% </em>of the $99,102.93 appellee claimed she had incurred. The attorney\u2019s fees were to be paid in monthly installments of $1,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-34\">In sum, then, appellant was ordered to pay: 1) child support according to the graduated chart that appears on page 17 of this opinion, as well as arrears of $15,619.33; 2) indefinite alimony of $1,875 per month from October 31, 1994 through October 31, 1995; $1,625 per month from October 31, 1995 through October 30, 1996; $741.67 per month thereafter; and arrears of $31,078.38; 3) attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of $76,000, and interest commencing from the date of the order; and 4) all open court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-35\">We will include additional facts in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-36\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b403-37\">I. The \u201cScarlet Letter\u201d of Voluntary Impoverishment</p>\n<p id=\"b403-38\">Appellant contends that, on remand, the court erred in \u201cperpetuating\u201d a \u201cscarlet letter\u201d of voluntary impoverishment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ignoring the \u201cdynamic\u201d, \u201cfluid\u201d, and \u201cevolving\u201d circumstances that occurred following the original trial. Asserting his \u201cscarlet letter\u201d argument with respect to the awards of alimony, child support, and counsel\u2019s fees, appellant asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">[I]s a conclusion of \u201cvoluntary impoverishment\u201d relative to a certain timeframe [sic] to be a \u201cbranding\u201d that becomes inescapable even though economic circumstances change and evolve into more crystal-like terms so as to ease the mechanical application process for purposes of child and spousal support?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In particular, appellant argues that the trial court erred \u201cin not utilizing ... evidence ... of \u2018actual earnings\u2019 as a basis for spousal \u2018rehabilitative\u2019 support and child support findings.\u201d He contends that the court\u2019s determination of potential income works an \u201cinjustice,\u201d because it defies \u201cthe reality of [his] available resources.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the issue of potential earnings \u201chad become no longer relevant due to intervening economic developments.\u201d Thus, Mr. Digges complains that the trial court \u201cproceeded statically as though despite the passage of time its primary obligation pursuant to this Court\u2019s earlier decision was to simply perform \u2018a re-evaluation of Mr. Digges\u2019s potential income.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">According to appellant, the combined alimony and child support payments \u201cnearly equal [his] disposable \u2018actual\u2019 earnings without regard for his having to underwrite his own living expenses.\u201d Concerning the period between October 1994 and October 1997, appellant alleges that the court\u2019s order fails to reflect an \u201cincome shares\u201d model. Instead, he argues that he has been saddled with a disproportionate share of the burden. With regard to the period between October 1997 and September 2000, appellant avers that modification of an award for prospective purposes may only be achieved by a Motion for Modification, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 12-104. Finally, appellant contends that the court erred in considering the resources of appellant\u2019s extended family in awarding counsel\u2019s fees. Appellant\u2019s many claims are unavailing. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>At the outset, we reject any suggestion by appellant that the trial court was obligated to revisit the issue of voluntary impoverishment on remand. To the contrary, we resolved that issue in <em>Digges I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In <em>Goldberger v. Goldberger, </em>96 Md.App. 313, 327, 624 A.2d 1328, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 453, 632 A.2d 150 (1993), we said that \u201ca parent shall be considered Voluntarily impoverished\u2019 whenever the parent has made the free and conscious choice, not compelled by factors beyond his or her control, to render himself or herself without adequate resources.\u201d <em>Goldberger </em>also outlined the factors to be considered in determining whether a parent has become voluntarily impoverished. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">1. his or her current physical condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">2. his or her respective level of education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">3. the timing of any change in employment or financial</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">circumstances relative to the divorce proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">4. the relationship of the parties prior to the divorce proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">5. his or her efforts to find and retain employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">6. his or her efforts to secure retraining if that is needed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">7. whether he or she has ever withheld support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">8. his or her past work history;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-16\">9. the area in which the parties live and the status of the job market there; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-18\">10. any other considerations presented by either party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-19\"><em>Id. </em>at 327, 624 A.2d 1328 (quoting <em>John O. v.

Tseronis, </em>106 Md.App. 275, 282-83, 664 A.2d 427 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-20\">Appellant also quarrels with the court\u2019s reliance on his \u201cpotential\u201d income. Once a court determines that a parent has become voluntarily impoverished, the court must determine the party\u2019s potential income. <em>Goldberger, </em>96 Md.App. at 327, 624 A.2d 1328; <em>see Wills v.

Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. 212, 221, 649 A.2d 24 (1994). Accordingly, in <em>Digges I, </em>upon affirming the court\u2019s predicate finding that appellant had voluntarily impoverished himself, we ordered a \u201cre-evaluation of Digges\u2019s <em>potential </em>income\u201d and a \u201cre-determination of the appropriate level of child support based upon the guidelines.\u201d <em>Digges I, </em>slip op. at 14. Therefore, we perceive no error in the court\u2019s failure to base its alimony and child support awards on appellant\u2019s \u201cactual\u201d income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Section 12-201(b) of the Family Law article defines \u201cincome\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">(1) actual income of a parent, if the parent is employed to full capacity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">(2) <em>potential income of a parent, </em>if the parent is voluntarily impoverished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">(Emphasis added). Further, F.L. \u00a7 12-201 (f), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arg-dedup-0\"><em>Potential </em>income.\u2014 \u201cPotential income\u201d means income attributed to a parent determined by the parent\u2019s employment potential and probable earnings level based on, but not limited to, recent work history, occupational qualifications, prevailing job opportunities, and earnings levels in the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">In determining a party\u2019s potential income, <em>Goldberger </em>instructs the trial court to consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">1. age</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">2. mental and physical condition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">3. assets</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>4. educational background, special training or skills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">5. prior earnings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">6. efforts to find and retain employment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">7. the status of the job market in the area where the parent lives</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">8. actual income from any source</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">9. any other factor bearing on the parent\u2019s ability to obtain funds for child support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-11\"><em>Goldberger, </em>96 Md.App. at 328, 624 A.2d 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Although it was not required to do so, the trial court, on remand, carefully re-examined the evidence of voluntarily impoverishment, again discussing each of the factors set forth in <em>Goldberger. </em>The court concluded that the \u201cscarlet letter\u201d of which appellant now complains continued to be well deserved, as Mr. Digges had yet to take the steps necessary to achieve an income approaching his abilities. Significantly, much of the court\u2019s analysis focused on appellant\u2019s conduct in the time between the first trial and the remand. The court noted, for example, that at the time of the remand hearing, appellant drove a leased 1997 Honda Accord and shared the rent of his Timonium condominium with Katharine Kerr, his girlfriend. She testified that she spends approximately three nights per week at the condominium and contributes $875.00 of the $1375.00 monthly rent. Additionally, appellant maintained his memberships in the Mid-Ocean Club in Bermuda and the Princeton Club in New York. Further, at the time of the remand hearing, appellant performed consulting work for Corcom. The court observed, however, that his position there \u201cevolved\u201d out of casual conversation with social friends; appellant never even prepared a <em>curriculum vitae. </em>Moreover, the court discounted appellant\u2019s claim that he was spending his time pursuing a graduate degree. Although appellant was enrolled in a \u201cFlex Program designed for working adults\u201d, he had completed only eight credits toward his MBA since 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Without question, these findings belie appellant\u2019s claim that the court approached the voluntary impoverishment in a \u201cstatic\u201d way, or failed to examine events that occurred subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>quent to the initial trial. Moreover, we see no \u201cintervening economic developments\u201d that undermined the court\u2019s finding as to voluntary impoverishment. Nor did the court err in its award of \u201cprospective\u201d child support for the period between November 1997 and September 2000. The court\u2019s task on remand was to make a \u201cre-determination of the appropriate level of child support based on the guidelines.\u201d <em>Digges I, </em>slip op. at 14. Because the ruling did not constitute a \u201cprospective modification\u201d of child support, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Haught v. Grieashamer, </em>64 Md.App. 605, 497 A.2d 1182 (1985), is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We are also unpersuaded that the court erred in considering appellant\u2019s potential income in awarding attorney\u2019s fees. In our earlier opinion, we determined that the court made a factual error in concluding that appellant had an immediate potential income of $100,000. Citing <em>Doser v. Doser, </em>106 Md.App. 329, 335 n. 1, 664 A.2d 453 (1995), we observed that when an appellate court vacates an award for alimony or child support, it \u201coften vacate[s] the remaining awards for evaluation,\u201d including an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Digges I, </em>slip. op. at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Family Law \u00a7 ll-110(b) provides that a court \u201cmay order either party to pay to the other party an amount for the reasonable and necessary expense of prosecuting or defending the proceeding.\u201d But, F.L. \u00a7 11 \u2014 110(c) requires that, before making such an award, the court \u201cshall consider:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">(1) the financial resources and financial needs of both parties; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">(2) whether there was substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Ms. Digges requested the court to order attorney\u2019s fees in her behalf for the cost of her defense of the original divorce action, a contempt hearing related to appellant\u2019s failure to pay child support, and for the appeal and remanded proceedings. Appellee claimed that she incurred legal fees in the amount of $99,102.93. Addressing the factors set forth in F.L. \u00a7 11-110(c), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The financial resources and financial needs of both parties have been discussed at length throughout this opinion. Mrs. Digges\u2019s financial resources are limited while Mr. Digges is capable of earning a large income <em>while enjoying substantial resources from his extended family. </em>Mrs. Digges\u2019s needs are great at this time, while Mr. Digges\u2019s financial needs are being met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">The Court of Special Appeals determined that there was substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the original proceeding. Additionally, this Court finds substantial justification for prosecuting the contempt hearing and the present action. Therefore, the Court finds it reasonable and proper for Mr. Digges to pay a portion of Mrs. Digges\u2019s counsel fees and costs of litigation under the facts of this case and in consideration of the various awards which are to be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The Court will order Mr. Digges to pay four-fifths of Mrs. Digges\u2019s counsel fees and expenses of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">In our view, the trial court\u2019s ruling also conformed to our instructions in <em>Digges I </em>with respect to family gifts. There, we made it clear that, on remand, the court could consider any \u201cgifts\u201d that appellant might receive from his family. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">The trial court on remand should consider the <em>total financial resources </em>and conditions of both parties. <em>The court may, in its discretion, place a cash-value on the \u201cgifts\u201d received by Digges and use that determination in considering the first factor of section ll-110(b). See Petrini, supra, </em>336 Md. at 467, 648 A.2d 1016. The court is also free to consider, in its discretion, all aspects of appellant\u2019s current situation, including his lifestyle <em>and ability to earn income in the future, </em>as well as his current debts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\"><em>Digges I, </em>slip op. at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">In sum, we conclude that what appellant describes as a \u201cscarlet letter\u201d was nothing more than a faithful application by the lower court of the mandate of this Court. In light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>appellant\u2019s voluntary impoverishment, we perceive neither error nor abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s ruling on remand as it related to the calculation and application of appellant\u2019s potential income.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">II. Indefinite alimony</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Appellant next contends that the court abused its discretion in awarding Ms. Digges permanent, rather than temporary, alimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s award of alimony, an appellate court will not reverse the judgment unless it concludes that \u201cthe trial court abused its discretion or rendered a judgment that was clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Crabill v. Crabill, </em>119 Md.App. 249, 260, 704 A.2d 532 (1998); <em>see Tracey v. Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 388, 614 A.2d 590 (1992); <em>Brodak v. Brodak, </em>294 Md. 10, 28-29, 447 A.2d 847 (1982). \u201c[Ajppellate courts will accord great deference to the findings and judgments of trial judges, sitting in their equitable capacity, when conducting divorce proceedings.\u201d <em>Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 385, 614 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The amount and duration of alimony is governed by F.L. \u00a7 11-106. In <em>Tracey, </em>328 Md. 380, 614 A.2d 590, the Court of Appeals made clear that the \u201cpurpose of alimony is not to provide a lifetime pension, but where practicable to ease the transition for the parties from the joint married state to their new status as single people living apart and independently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, 614 A.2d 590 (citing the report of the Governor\u2019s Commission on Domestic Relations Laws(1980)). It is clear, therefore, that under F.L. \u00a7 11-106, the \u201cpolicy of this State is to limit alimony, where appropriate, to a definite term in order to provide each party with an incentive to become fully self-supporting.\u201d <em>Jensen v.

F.L. \u00a7 ll-106(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\"><em>Award for indefinite period. </em>\u2014 The court may award alimony for an indefinite period, if the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">(1) due to age, illness, infirmity, or disability, the party seeking alimony cannot reasonably be expected to make substantial progress toward becoming self-supporting; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">(2) even after the party seeking alimony will have made as much progress toward becoming self-supporting as can reasonably be expected, the respective standards of living of the parties will be unconscionably disparate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">In making an award of alimony, the trial court is required to consider all of the factors set forth in F.L. \u00a7 ll-106(b). <em>Doser, </em>106 Md.App. at 355, 664 A.2d 453. To be sure, the court \u201cneed not use formulaic language or articulate every reason for its decision with respect to each factor. Rather, the court must clearly indicate that it has considered all the factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 664 A.2d 453 (citations omitted). If the court fails to make clear that it has considered all of the factors, then the record, as a whole, must reveal that the court\u2019s findings were based on a review of the statutory factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">According to Mr. Digges, the court erred in awarding indefinite alimony because, by the time of the remand, appel-lee \u201cha[d] progressed through the essentially rehabilitative periods and ha[d] become once again self-supporting in her chosen profession.\u201d Appellant points out that Ms. Digges secured a full-time teaching position two-and-a-half years after the divorce decree, whereas the trial court surmised in its original opinion that it would take her four years to become self-supporting. Moreover, appellant disputes that the parties\u2019 living standards would be \u201cunconscionably disparate\u201d, even if he were able to earn his \u201cpotential\u201d salary. Appellant claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Within the context of 1998, an actual Schedule C income of \u00b1$42,500 (Appellant\u2019s projected) is not unconscionably disparate with an actual income of \u00b1$32,500 (Appellee\u2019s projected); or, as to 1997, an actual Schedule C income of \u00b1$37,500 (Appellant\u2019s) is not unconscionably disparate with actual income of \u00b1 $30,000 (Appellee\u2019s).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We find no error or abuse of discretion. Preliminarily, we note that the income figures quoted above by appellant ignore the court\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s \u201cactual\u201d income was the result of voluntary impoverishment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the question of whether potential income may be used to calculate alimony was decided in <em>Digges I. </em>Therefore, it is the law of the case. In our previous opinion, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">Based on the plain meaning of the words used by the General Assembly in section ll-106(b)(9), the court on remand should consider the ability of appellant to meet his \u25a0 own needs as well as those of his former spouse. <em>When considering this ability, the court is entitled to consider not only what Digges earns but what he could earn if he fully applied himself</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Slip op. at 16 (emphasis added). Thus, appellant\u2019s potential income was an important focus of the court\u2019s analysis as to the disparity in the parties\u2019 standards of living. After evaluating each of the factors enumerated in F.L. \u00a7 ll-106(b), the trial court was entitled to find, from the evidence, an unconscionable disparity, based on appellant\u2019s potential income in excess of $100,000, as compared to appellee\u2019s projected income of $30,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">To be sure, a \u201cformerly dependent spouse ordinarily is not entitled to have his or her standard of living \u2018keep pace\u2019 with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>that of the other spouse after the divorce, or to share in the other spouse\u2019s future accumulations of wealth.\u201d <em>Blaine v. Blaine, </em>336 Md. 49, 70, 646 A.2d 413 (1994); <em>see Cole v. Cole, </em>44 Md.App. 435, 443, 409 A.2d 734 (1979). Nevertheless, <em>Blaine </em>also affirmed that \u201cthe provisions of indefinite alimony serve as a restraint upon the doctrine of rehabilitative alimony, protecting the formerly dependent, and less financially secure, spouse from too harsh an existence after the divorce.\u201d <em>Blaine, </em>336 Md. at 70, 646 A.2d 413. Here, although appellee had achieved some degree of self-sufficiency, her standard of living will remain perpetually inferior to that of Mr. Digges. The court noted that even if Ms. Digges obtains a master\u2019s degree, her income will only rise by about $5,000. Appellant\u2019s potential income exceeded appellee\u2019s by a factor of five.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We do not suggest that any gap in the parties\u2019 incomes would automatically entitle Ms. Digges to indefinite alimony. <em>See Tracey, </em>328 Md. at 393, 614 A.2d 590 (declining to adopt a \u201chard and fast rule\u201d regarding any disparity between the incomes of parties contesting indefinite alimony). But, numerous Maryland cases demonstrate that income disparities of the magnitude present in this case may form the basis for indefinite alimony. In <em>Caldwell v. Caldwell, </em>103 Md.App. 452, 463-64, 653 A.2d 994 (1995), we affirmed an award of indefinite alimony on the ground that the parties\u2019 standard of living was unconscionably disparate when the party seeking alimony earned 43% of her spouse\u2019s after-divorce income. Similarly, in <em>Broseus v. Broseus, </em>82 Md.App. 183, 195-97, 570 A.2d 874 (1990), we held that a court did not abuse its discretion in awarding indefinite alimony to a homemaker who, after nineteen years of marriage, returned to the work force with an annual salary of $19,674. The party seeking alimony held a bachelor\u2019s degree in \u201cmedical sciences,\u201d but had not been employed outside the home during most of the parties\u2019 marriage. Her husband\u2019s salary at the time of trial was $56,-411.52 per year. Likewise, in <em>Bricker v. Bricker, </em>78 Md.App. 570, 577, 554 A.2d 444 (1989), we upheld indefinite alimony when the party seeking it earned 35% of her husband\u2019s salary. <em>Accord Kennedy v. Kennedy, </em>55 Md.App. 299, 307, 462 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>1208 (1983)(affirming indefinite alimony when spouse earned 34% of her husband\u2019s annual income).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Other factors enumerated in F.L. \u00a7 ll-106(b) may also have undergirded the court\u2019s ruling. For instance, the court was entitled to consider the \u201ccontributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family\u201d, and the \u201ccircumstances that contributed to the estrangement of the parties.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(5),(6). By his own admission, appellant\u2019s conduct has been \u201cthe root of the family\u2019s economic devastation.\u201d By any measure, that devastation has been catastrophic. Ms. Digges and the children have endured the transition from Hinchingham to a cramped Chestertown apartment, as well as a substantial decline in income, from as much as three-quarters of a million dollars to an annual income of just over thirty thousand dollars. It is also noteworthy that, after the birth of the parties\u2019 children, Ms. Digges was the proverbial \u201cstay at home mom.\u201d Appellant\u2019s meteoric rise in the legal profession would arguably not have been possible without her non-monetary contributions to the \u201cwell-being of the family\u201d. Thus, the court was entitled to conclude that in the wake of appellant\u2019s equally meteoric fall, appellee should not be left to suffer the burden of the family\u2019s precipitous economic decline.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In this regard, <em>Holston v. Holston, </em>58 Md.App. 308, 473 A.2d 459 (1984), is instructive. There, the parties had been married 15 years at the time of separation and were only 39 years of age at the time of trial. When the wife was a college student, she left school to marry, and took a job so that her husband could pursue his education to become a dentist. On appeal, the wife challenged the award of rehabilitative alimony, contending that the court should have awarded indefinite alimony. We recognized that the wife would encounter difficulty obtaining an education and acquiring marketable skills because of the \u201cnecessity [for the wife] to provide and care for five minor children.\u201d <em>Holston, </em>58 Md.App. at 323, 473 A.2d 459. Because the wife had contributed substantially to the husband\u2019s career, was not at fault in the divorce, and there was no doubt that the standards of living would be unconscio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>nably disparate even if the wife obtained employment, we found that the court abused its discretion in failing to award indefinite alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We are mindful that all but one of the parties\u2019 children have now reached the age of majority. Nevertheless, in view of the \u201cgreat deference\u201d we accord \u201cto the findings and judgments of trial judges, sitting in their equitable capacity,\u201d <em>Tracey, 328 </em>Md. at 385, 614 A.2d 590, we perceive no error in the court\u2019s award of indefinite alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">III. Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In her cross-appeal, Ms. Digges contests one aspect of the court\u2019s ruling. She asserts that the court erred when, in determining her projected income for purposes of alimony, it included the $240.00 per month she earned from tutoring. Ms. Digges complains that she \u201chas been forced to tutor students in the late afternoons, evenings, and on Saturdays to pay basic necessities\u201d, in part because of appellant\u2019s failure to pay child support and alimony during the pending litigation. Ms. Digges contends that the court\u2019s consideration of her part-time earnings is \u201ccontrary to the legislative intent of an equitable, fair, and just award of alimony.\u201d In his reply brief, appellant responds with a two-sentence retort:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">FL \u00a7 12-201(c)[l] defines \u201cactual income\u201d as meaning \u201cincome from any source.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court did not err in this particular redetermination on remand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_bQ\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, the Court of Appeals has made clear that the use of the phrase \u201call income\u201d in F.L. 11-106(b)(ll)(i) does not require a court to include income from part time employment in calculating an alimony award. In <em>Tracey, supra, </em>328 Md. 380, 614 A.2d 590, the Court upheld a trial judge\u2019s <em>exclusion </em>of part-time income, stating that \u201cincome\u201d as it is used in that section means \u201cwages or salary from <em>regular, full-time employment, </em>i.e., money earned during the normal work week as is appropriate to a given occupation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 614 A.2d 590 (Emphasis added). In that case, the court awarded indefinite alimony to a woman who, after twenty-six years of marriage, earned $15,381.88 as a full-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>time civilian payroll technician for the federal government, compared to her spouse\u2019s income of $57,973.25 as a supervisor for a utility company. <em>Id. </em>at 382-83, 614 A.2d 590. At the time of the divorce, Ms. Tracey supplemented her income with money from a part-time job at a fast food restaurant. In calculating the alimony award, the trial court excluded the part-time earnings, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">I believe that one is not required to work two jobs. Neither of them during their lifetime[s] had two jobs of employment. They each had one job.... And one does not have to work all the hours she does....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 383, 614 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">On appeal, Mr. Tracey contended that the phrase \u201call income\u201d in F.L. \u00a7 11 \u2014 106(b)(ll)(i) required the court to include Ms. Tracey\u2019s part-time income in its calculation. The Court of Appeals disagreed. In its view, the \u201cparamount goal\u201d of the alimony provisions of the family law article was \u201cto create a statutory mechanism leading to equitably sound alimony determinations by judges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 614 A.2d 590. A literal reading of \u201call income\u201d would hamper the efforts of trial judges to arrive at a \u201cjust\u201d alimony award. <em>Id. </em>at 388-89, 614 A.2d 590. The Court noted that \u201c[p]art time work is often tenuous in prospect and short in duration. To include such income as a matter of course may ultimately result in a false picture of a party\u2019s economic self-sufficiency or security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">For a payroll clerk like [Ms. Tracey], thirty-five to forty hours per week is undoubtedly the norm. The trial court found [Ms. Tracey\u2019s] second, part-time job at McDonald\u2019s to be temporary work, in the nature of a stop-gap, filling the interim between the Traceys\u2019 final separation and the resolution of their financial affairs attendant upon divorce. [Ms. Tracey] worked at McDonald\u2019s as many as twenty or twenty-five additional hours each week. Her work week of sixty to sixty-five hours can only be described as burdensome.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The alimony statute does not consign [Ms. Tracey] to an existence of unremitting toil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 614 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Accordingly, we reject the notion that the trial court was required to include appellee\u2019s part-time income in its alimony calculation. On the other hand, <em>Tracey </em>does not <em>prohibit </em>the court from including part-time wages as \u201cincome\u201d. To the contrary, the <em>Tracey </em>Court merely rejected \u201can approach based on rote or formula\u201d in favor of one compatible -with the Legislature\u2019s \u201cstated aim of judicial flexibility....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 614 A.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">We agree with Ms. Digges that she \u201cshould not be punished for her work ethic nor commuted to a life of drudgery simply because she has shouldered a disproportionate share of the responsibility of providing for the Digges children.\u201d In our view, however, the court\u2019s award of $741.67 per month of indefinite alimony beginning in October 1996, in addition to $42,000 in alimony for the period between October 31, 1994 through October 30, 1996, is an adequate award. Viewed as a whole, the court\u2019s award reflects a careful consideration of appellant\u2019s total income, including the money she earns from tutoring. The court apparently determined that it is reasonable for a teacher to supplement her income in this way, particularly when there are no young children in the home, and the total number of hours required for both jobs does not seem too onerous. In short, it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion to tailor a \u201cjust\u201d award.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
