GETTY, Judge (Ret\u2019d, Specially Assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Who, if anyone, is entitled to the proceeds of a group life insurance policy stemming from the death of Maria Rivas? The question is easily understood; the answer is more complicated, due to the bizarre circumstances giving rise to the competing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Xuang Ky Tran was employed by IIT Research Institute at the time of his death on April 2, 1996. As a full-time employee, Tran obtained an accidental death and dismemberment policy issued by Continental Casualty Company (CNA) to the holder, IIT. Tran opted for a plan that provided life insurance for a spouse of a full-time employee. Tran and Maria Rivas were married on September 6,1990; they had no children.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The amount payable upon Tran\u2019s death was $300,000, the amount payable on the death of his wife was $150,000. On April 2,1996, an argument erupted between Tran and his wife. She called 911 for assistance and during the conversation Tran killed her and immediately thereafter committed suicide by shooting himself with the same gun he used to murder his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The claimants are An and Vanessa Diep, who are the brother and sister of Tran,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Dr. and Mrs. Hector Rivas, the parents of Maria Rivas. CjMA filed a Complaint of Interpleader and paid the proceeds of $150,000 covering Maria Rivas into the Registry of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The Dieps and Dr. Rivas filed cross motions for summary judgment. The case was heard in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on April 27, 1998. The court held that the policy was unambiguous and that the $150,000 was to be paid to Dr. Rivas. Additionally, the court ordered that inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>est on the award was to be calculated from the date of the court order directing CNA to deposit the money with the court until the date of the judgment, April 27, 1998,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Dieps have appealed from those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Briefly, the general rule of construction of insurance policies in Maryland is to apply the terms of the contract in deciding the scope and limitations of the coverage. <em>Chantel Associates v. Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co., </em>338 Md. 131, 656 A.2d 779 (1995). The objective is to ascertain the intent of the parties to the agreement by viewing the policy as a whole, rather than by emphasizing one provision to the exclusion of another. Each provision or clause, whenever possible, shall be given effect by construing the language in its usually accepted meaning. <em>Empire Fire and Marine Company v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>117 Md.App. 72, 95-96, 699 A.2d 482 (1997). The nature of the policy and the purpose it was intended to serve are important considerations in determining intent. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 699 A.2d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The Dieps claim they are entitled to the proceeds of the policy under the \u201cPayment of Claim\u201d section, which provides for payment to the employee\u2019s designated beneficiary or relatives as set forth in the policy. They also contend that they are not disqualified by the Slayer\u2019s Rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Dr. Rivas claims the proceeds on the theory that Maria Rivas, his daughter, was the \u201cinsured\u201d for the purpose of the policy on her life. He contends that several persons may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>insured under the terms of the policy and each may have separate interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\n<em>The Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Initially, the policy states the effective date and term, which is one year. CNA reserves the right to non-renew after the first insurance year on any premium due date. Other relevant policy provisions are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">DEFINITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u201cWe,\u201d \u201cOur\u201d and \u201cUs\u201d mean the Continental Casualty Company, Chicago, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u201cInsured\u201d means the eligible person whose insurance is in force under the terms of this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\u201cInsured person\u201d means the insured and the insured family members of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">\u201cPrincipal Sum\u201d means the amount of insurance, as shown in Statement 3 of the Application, which applies to the Insured Person.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">ELIGIBLE PERSONS</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">All persons described in Statement 2 of the application are eligible for insurance under this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">Eligible Family Members</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">The eligible persons becoming insured under this policy may also insure their eligible family members. Eligible family members, if any, are described in Statement 2 of the application. A person may not be insured under this policy as both an eligible person and an eligible family member. An eligible dependent child may not be insured as a dependent child of more than one insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">Exclusions</p>\n<p id=\"b161-16\">This policy does not cover any loss caused or resulting from:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>4. Suicide or a suicide attempt while sane or self-destruction or an attempt to self-destroy while insane;....</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Individual Terminations</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The insurance of any insured will cease on the earliest of the following dates:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">1. On the date this policy is terminated;</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">2. At the end of the Grace Period if the Holder fails to pay the required premium;</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">3. On the premium due date that falls on or next follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq-\">a. The date the Insured ceases to be associated with the Holder in a capacity that makes him eligible for this insurance; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">b. The date the insured attains the age at which he is no longer an eligible person as stated in Statement 2 of the Application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">The insurance of any insured family member will cease on the earliest of the following dates:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">1. On the date insurance for the Insured terminates; or</p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">2. On the premium due date that falls on or next follows the date such person ceases to be an eligible family member as described in Statement 2 of the Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">CERTIFICATES</p>\n<p id=\"b162-16\">We will deliver certificates, to the Holder for issuance to each insured. The certificates will describe the benefits and to whom payable, the limits of this policy and where it may be inspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-17\">UNIFORM PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b162-18\">ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, the Application and any attached papers constitute the entire contract between the parties. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b162-20\">WRITTEN PROOF OF LOSS: Written proof of loss must be given to Us within 90 days after the date of such loss.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Unless the Insured Person is legally incapacitated, written proof must be given within 1 year of the time it is otherwise due.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">PAYMENT OF CLAIM: Benefits for loss of life of the Insured will be paid in accordance with the beneficiary designation in effect at the time of payment. If no such designation is in effect at that time, the benefits shall be paid to the surviving person or persons in the first of the following classes of successive preference beneficiaries of which a member survives the Insured:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The insured\u2019s (a) spouse; (b) children, including legally adopted children; (c) parents; (d) brothers and sister[s]; or (e) estate____</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Benefits for loss of life of any insured family members will [be] payable to the Insured, if living, otherwise in the same manner as above.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Benefits for other than loss of life are payable to the Insured. All accrued benefits unpaid at the death of the Insured will be payable in the same manner as above.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">The trial court, at the conclusion of argument by counsel, rendered the following decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">The issue before the court is contract interpretation. There are definitions within the policy. For example, the definition^] say \u201cinsured\u201d means eligible person. Under \u201celigible person\u201d the family members are included.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-12\">The policy states under the caption of eligible persons, all persons described in Statement 2<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> are eligible for insurance under this policy. Included in Statement 2 are an insured employee, an insured spouse, an[d] insured dependent children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>A claim form supplied by the insurance company asked for the name of the insured in full. It identifies Maria Reavis [sic]. Defendants filled in Ms. Reavis\u2019 [sic] name above the heading, name of the Insured when they submitted their claim to CNA insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">Benefits cannot be triggered unless the insured person, be it an employee, the spouse, or the dependent child[,] is injured or killed. Ms. Reavis [sic] was insured for her life. Benefits were triggered on her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">A common sense reading of the policy dictates this result. Therefore, summary judgment is granted in favor of Dr. Reavis [sic] and summary judgment for the cross defendant \u25a0 is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Contrary to the court\u2019s assertion that the definitions say \u201cinsured means eligible person,\u201d the definition says \u201cInsured means the eligible person whose insurance is in force under the terms of this policy.\u201d That reference is to the employee whose status as a full-time employee triggers the issuance of the policy. Family members are identified in the policy under the definition of \u201cInsured Person,\u201d which provides that \u201cInsured Person means the insured and the insured family members of the insured.\u201d Of course, both the insured and his designated family members are eligible for insurance under the policy. In short, the policy distinguishes between who is the insured and who are the persons receiving insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The trial court referred to Maria Rivas as being \u201cinsured for her life.\u201d We construe that statement to mean that she had insurance <em>on </em>her life. She was not necessarily insured for her entire life had the murder not occurred, because eligibility of a spouse, as set forth in Addendum 1 of the Application, is from \u201cage 18 through 70.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">In dicta, the court indicated that the Slayer\u2019s Rule did not appear to be applicable in this case, but that issue was not decided in light of the court\u2019s granting Dr. Rivas\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We shall, therefore, address first the Dieps claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>1. The Dieps Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">The Dieps argue that they are entitled to the proceeds of the policy on the life of Maria Rivas because all of the benefits under the policy are payable to the employee, if living, and to the employee\u2019s designated beneficiary or relatives when the employee is deceased. They allege that they are innocent of any involvement in the death of their sister-in-law; that they are not claiming on behalf of the estate of their brother; that their claim is based solely on the express terms of the policy; and that Maria Rivas had no right to designate a beneficiary, because the policy expressly provided that the proceeds of the policy were payable to Tran, the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The hill the Dieps must climb is the Slayer\u2019s Rule. We hold, for the following reasons, that the Dieps as a matter of law are ineligible to receive the proceeds of insurance on the life of Maria Rivas. The Maryland Legislature has not enacted a \u201cSlayer\u2019s\u201d statute governing whether a murderer may be enriched by taking any portion of the estate of the victim. We have, however, judicially adopted the Slayer\u2019s Rule, which is founded upon principles of equity, justice, morality, and on the ground of public policy. The first Maryland case to address the issue was <em>Price v. Hitaffer, </em>164 Md. 505, 165 A. 470 (1933). The Court held that the heirs and personal representatives of the husband who killed his wife and immediately thereafter committed suicide were excluded from participation in the distribution of the estate of the wife. The Court also indicated that the same principles should be applied where a beneficiary of a life insurance policy murdered the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The maxim that one cannot profit from his own wrong was followed in <em>Chase v. Jenifer, </em>219 Md. 564, 150 A.2d 251 (1959), holding that a beneficiary acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter was barred by the Slayer\u2019s Rule from receiving benefits payable from the victim\u2019s life insurance policy. Where the killing is unintentional, such as accidental, or grossly negligent amounting to involuntary manslaughter, the beneficiary\u2019s rights under the policy are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>barred. <em>Schifanelli v. Wallace, </em>271 Md. 177, 188-89, 315 A.2d 513 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The Dieps contend that their claim is not based upon being an heir or representative of Tran\u2019s estate, that they are claiming under the terms of the policy. They also interpret the case law as prohibiting only the person responsible for the intentional killing from profiting by his felonious- action. We disagree with the assertion that only the killer is precluded from sharing property generated by his own crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In <em>Ford v. Ford, </em>307 Md. 105, 109, 512 A.2d 389 (1986), the Court of Appeals cited with approval the holding in <em>Price </em>(which adopted the Slayer\u2019s Rule) that \u201ca murderer, or his heirs or representatives through him, ordinarily may not profit by taking any portion of the estate of one murdered.\u201d The equitable maxims of the common law which the Court followed in <em>Price </em>\u201capply not only in the case of intestacy, but equally to benefits by way of wills and life insurance policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, 512 A.2d 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The Court made abundantly clear in <em>Ford </em>that</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">As established by <em>Price, Chase </em>and <em>Schifanelli, </em>the present status of the law of Maryland is:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">1) A person who kills another</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">a) <em>may not </em>share in the distribution of the decedent\u2019s estate as an heir by way of statutes of descent and distribution, or as a devisee or legatee under the decedent\u2019s will, nor may one collect the proceeds as a beneficiary under a policy of insurance on the decedent\u2019s life when the homicide is felonious and intentional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">b) <em>may </em>share in the distribution of the decedent\u2019s estate as an heir by way of statutes of descent and distribution, or as a devisee or legatee under the decedent\u2019s will and <em>may </em>collect the proceeds as a beneficiary under a policy of insurance on the decedent\u2019s life when the homicide is unintentional even though it is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>result of such gross negligence as would render the killer criminally guilty of involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-5\">2) These principles apply not only to the killer but to those claiming through or under him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 512 A.2d 389. <em>Accord: Sherman v. Robinson, </em>319 Md. 445, 573 A.2d 34 (1990); <em>Johnson v. Hebb, </em>729 F.Supp. 1524 (D.Md.1990); <em>Sherman v. Sherman, </em>804 F.Supp. 729 (D.Md.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Based upon the case law discussed herein, we hold that the secondary beneficiaries are precluded from receiving the proceeds of the insurance on the life of the victim, Maria Rivas. By reason of his intentional murder of his wife, which is not disputed, Tran never acquired any interest in the proceeds of the coverage purchased by Tran for his wife. He is precluded by the Slayer\u2019s Rule from receiving the proceeds payable upon her death. Tran never having acquired any right to the proceeds, the secondary beneficiaries have no interest to assert because their claim is through Tran as surviving brother and sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The holding in <em>Ford </em>states expressly that the Slayer\u2019s Rule is applicable to those claiming \u201cthrough or under\u201d the slayer. Tran\u2019s brother and sister are without question claiming through and under Tran, who was the insured as defined in the policy. The Dieps also state, and we agree, that they are not guilty of any wrongdoing. That fact, however, has no bearing on eligibility. If the law provided that innocent secondary beneficiaries were not excluded by the Slayer\u2019s Rule, the public policy reason for the rule would be eroded significantly and, arguably, the murder/suicide statistics would increase dramatically. Thus, although the trial court did not rely on the Slayer\u2019s Rule in denying the Dieps motion for summary judgment, as the court would have had no discretion in the application of that rule to the undisputed material facts of the instant case, we can affirm the denial of the motion on the ground of the application of the Slayer\u2019s Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>2. The Rivas Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Dr. Rivas argues that, for the purpose of claiming the proceeds of the coverage for his daughter, she was an insured as defined in the policy. According to Dr. Rivas, Maria was an insured \u201cbecause the policy defines \u2018Insured\u2019 to include \u2018Eligible Person,\u2019 and Maria was an \u2018Eligible Person\u2019 under Statement 2, Addendum I.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We disagree with Dr. Rivas\u2019s interpretation of the policy definitions. The Definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy, as we stated earlier, uses the words \u201celigible person\u201d to define the individual owner of the policy, <em>i.e., </em>the employee. The policy states, \u201c \u2018Insured\u2019 means the eligible person whose insurance is in force under the terms of this policy.\u201d Eligibility for a policy is dependent on being a full-time employee of the holder. Maria Rivas was not the insured, she was an \u201cinsured person\u201d by reason of the fact that her husband, Tran, elected to provide coverage for her as a spouse. An insured person is separately defined as \u201cInsured person means the insured and the insured family members of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Maria Rivas had no control whatever over this policy. This was a single policy issued to Tran. Only he could select the beneficiary of the principal sum, and only he could decide whether to include his wife as an insured person. By the express terms of the policy, only he was the named beneficiary on the life of Maria Rivas. She could not designate a beneficiary]</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Notwithstanding that Maria Rivas was not the insured as defined in the policy, she was an insured person, or insured family member, and benefits were payable upon her accidental death. In order to effect the intent of the parties, the policy is viewed as a whole, without emphasis on any particular provision. Sul<em>lins v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>340 Md. 503, 667 A.2d 617 (1995). In <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. Molloy, </em>291 Md. 139, 153, 433 A.2d 1135 (1981), the Court of Appeals cited with approval the following language set forth in <em>Howell v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>130 N.J.Super. 350, 327 A.2d 240, 243 (App.Div.1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>There is much to commend the view that, unless the terms of an insurance policy are plainly to the contrary ... the obligation of the carrier should be considered several as to each person injured, and the fraud or misconduct of one insured should not bar recovery by the innocent co-insureds to the extent of their respective interests in the property involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In <em>Howell, </em>the term \u201cinsured\u201d was defined in a homeowner\u2019s policy as the \u201cnamed Insured\u201d and the named insured\u2019s spouse if a resident of the named insured\u2019s household. The named insured set fire to the house and committed suicide while it was burning. The Court held that the contract rights of the innocent spouse were several, not joint, and thus not subject to forfeiture by the unilateral acts of the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We conclude that similar reasoning should be applied herein. Maria Rivas was clearly an insured person under the terms of the policy. Benefits were triggered upon her death as a result of her husband\u2019s felonious act. Because her husband and those claiming through him are precluded from receiving the death benefit, payment to the members of the class set forth in the policy are payable to Dr. Rivas. Under the Payment of Claim provision of the policy, payments on the life of the insured are payable to the named beneficiary. If no such designation is in effect, the benefits are payable to the insured\u2019s successive preference beneficiaries, which in this case are the Dieps, who are also disqualified as a matter of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The payment provisions for loss of life of an insured family member, on the other hand, are payable to the insured, if living, \u201cotherwise in the same manner as above.\u201d A reasonable interpretation of the phrase \u201cin the same manner as above\u201d means to follow the schedule of successive beneficiaries of the deceased family member. It does not mean to select the next in line of the insured\u2019s family. If that had been the intention, the policy would have said so. We conclude that the same procedure applies no matter whether the insured or the insured family member dies, but the benefits are payable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the preference beneficiaries of the person whose death has triggered a claim. By parity of reasoning, we are able to affirm the grant of summary judgment on this basis, not relied upon by the trial judge because she would have had no discretion to deny it on this ground as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Finally, Dr. Rivas did not appeal the prejudgment interest issue. The policy did not provide for prejudgment interest. The court awarded interest from the date of the order directing CNA to deposit the $150,000 in the Court Registry until the date of judgment, April 27,1998. We perceive no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\">. The Dieps claimed the proceeds, as secondary beneficiaries of the coverage provided to both Tran and Maria Rivas, although they did not litigate the $300,000 claim, probably because of the suicide exclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">. The policy did not provide for the payment of interest. Under such circumstances, the award of prejudgment interest is within the discretion of the trier of fact. <em>See Crystal v. West and Callahan, Inc., </em>328 Md. 318, 343, 614 A.2d 560 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\">. As a matter of public policy, the Slayer\u2019s Rule precludes a perpetrator from sharing in the victim's estate. <em>See Price v. Hitaffer, </em>164 Md. 505, 165 A. 470 (1933). The trial judge, in dicta, indicated that the rule did not apply in this case.
