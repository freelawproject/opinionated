(NAH); Richard T. Fields, M.D.; Stewart P. Axelbaum, M.D.; and Harshad R. Mody, M.D. (appellees).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants claimed that appellees breached the applicable standard of care by failing to diagnose an alleged shunt malfunction in Darwin on August 18, 1988, and that a proper diagnosis would have prevented the child\u2019s subsequent injuries that have left him in a chronic vegetative state.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Appellants filed their original complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and named only NAH and Dr. Fields as defendants. Dr. Fields resides and carries on business solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>in Anne Arundel County; NAH conducts business solely in Anne Arundel County. On March 20, 1992, Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge Richard T. Rombro ruled that appellants had filed their suit in the wrong venue and transferred the action to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The Anne Arundel County Circuit Court set a trial date for June 1994. On May 17, 1994, appellants moved to stay the Anne Arundel County proceedings because they wanted to add two new defendants to the case \u2014 Drs. Mody and Axelb-aum. As required by title 3, subtitle 2A, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code (1998 Repl. Vol &amp; Supp.1998), appellants initially filed their claims against Drs. Mody and Axelbaum in the Health Claims Arbitration Office on May 20, 1994.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the parties agreed to waive arbitration in December 1995, the arbitration panel chairman signed a transfer order on February 20, 1996, allowing appellants to proceed with their case against Drs. Mody and Axelbaum in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Rather than moving to lift the stay in the Anne Arundel County action by adding Drs. Mody and Axelbaum to that pending case, appellants filed a new complaint in Baltimore City Circuit Court. Appellants\u2019 basis for filing in Baltimore City was that Dr. Mody regularly conducted business and maintained his medical office there. In the Baltimore City complaint, appellants not only named Drs. Mody and Axelb-aum as defendants, but they also set forth claims against NAH and Dr. Fields \u2014 the same claims already pending in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. On June 3, 1996, Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge David B. Mitchell granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss and imposed sanctions against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>appellants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Meanwhile, on February 22,1996, appellants made a motion in the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court to transfer that pending action back to Baltimore City. On August 2, 1996, Circuit Court Judge Lawrence H. Rushworth held a hearing on the motion. At the time of that hearing, neither Dr. Mody nor Dr. Axelbaum had been added to the Anne Arundel County action. Judge Rushworth denied the motion to transfer at the conclusion of the August 2 nd hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">On August 9, 1996, appellants amended their original complaint by naming Drs. Mody and Axelbaum as defendants in the Anne Arundel County action. Dr. Mody was served with process on August 19, 1996. The record is unclear as to when Dr. Axelbaum was served with process, but he filed an answer to the amended complaint on September 17, 1996; Dr. Mody filed his answer two days later. At no time after August 9, 1996, did appellants renew their motion to transfer the case back to Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On October 30, 1996, Judge Rushworth bifurcated the case on the issues of liability and damages. Subsequently, the trial judge held a hearing on appellees\u2019 motion in limine to exclude Darwin from the courtroom during the liability portion of the trial. After hearing arguments and watching a videotape of a day in Darwin\u2019s life,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Rushworth granted the motion, finding that Darwin did not have the ability to communicate with his attorneys, nurses, or parents; that he would be unable to provide any assistance to his attorneys in preparing his case; that he would be unable to understand or comprehend the proceedings; and that his presence served no purpose other than to prejudice the jurors against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Trial commenced on October 7, 1997. At the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 case, on October 17,1997, Judge Rushworth granted NAH\u2019s and Mody\u2019s motions for judgment. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Drs. Fields and Axelbaum on October 21, 1997, having concluded that neither doctor \u201cdeparted from accepted standards of care in the treatment of Darwin Green.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Appellants filed this timely appeal and present four questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">1. Did ... the Circuit Court for Baltimore City err as a matter of law in transferring [appellants\u2019 action to Anne Arundel County ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">2. Did ... the Circuit [C]ourt for Anne Arundel County err in denying [appellants\u2019 motion to transfer [their] action back to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City once Dr. Mody was added to the action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">3. Did the trial court err as a matter of law in barring the [p]laintiff, Darwin Green[,] from attending his own trial as a result of his physical and mental disability, in that such exclusion violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, as well as fundamental notions of equal access to justice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">4. Did the trial eourt err in allowing [appellees to present a theory of their case that is against Maryland case law as stated in <em>Mehlman v. Powell?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">We answer all of the questions in the negative and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">Darwin Green was bom on February 12, 1977, with a medical condition called hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus causes increased pressure on the brain due to an excessive accumulation of fluid. When Darwin was nine days old, doctors placed a shunt in the right ventricle of his brain that drained the extra fluid to another part of his body in order to prevent the build-up of intracranial pressure.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">In 1981, when he was approximately four-and-a-half years old, Darwin complained of headaches and vomiting. Doctors determined that Darwin\u2019s shunt was not functioning properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>and performed surgery to correct the problem. For the next several years, Darwin experienced no problems with his shunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">On the morning of August 17, 1988, Darwin was with his father when he began complaining that he had a headache. Darwin\u2019s father gave him Tylenol and later testified that it was not unusual for Darwin to have headaches and that Tylenol normally cured the problem. On this day, however, the Tylenol did not work, and Darwin continued to complain of a headache. Later that day, Darwin felt nauseous, began vomiting, and refused to eat. His father continued to give him Tylenol, but Darwin\u2019s condition did not improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The next morning, August 18, 1988, Darwin was still complaining that he had a headache. In addition, Darwin appeared drowsy and was still refusing to eat. Darwin\u2019s father gave him another dose of Tylenol but this again failed to relieve the child\u2019s symptoms. At this point, Darwin\u2019s father became very concerned and decided to take his son to the emergency room at nearby North Arundel Hospital, located in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Darwin and his father arrived at the hospital at 11:05 a.m. Dr. Fields, the on-call physician in the emergency room, examined Darwin at 1:00 p.m. At that time, Darwin was complaining of a severe headache. Dr. Fields ordered several laboratory tests, including an emergency CT scan. Darwin was also given Vicodin, a prescription pain killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Darwin\u2019s CT scan was reviewed by Dr. Axelbaum, a radiologist at NAH. Dr. Axelbaum noted the presence of shunts in Darwin\u2019s brain as well as a number of other abnormalities, but he interpreted these results as all old changes. Dr. David Buchholz, appellants\u2019 medical expert, later opined at trial that Dr. Axelbaum breached the standard of care when he reported that the changes were all old while failing to report to Dr. Fields that there \"was a possibility that the results could represent new change or a blocked shunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Dr. Fields contacted Dr. Mody, the neurologist on-call at the hospital. Dr. Mody advised that Darwin could be released once his headache was relieved. It is unclear when Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Axelbaum placed his written findings in Darwin\u2019s emergency room (\u201cER\u201d) chart. Dr. Buchholz later testified that if Dr. Axelbaum\u2019s findings were not in the ER chart when Dr. Fields spoke with Dr. Mody, then neither Dr. Fields nor Dr. Mody breached the standard of care. If Dr. Axelbaum\u2019s findings were in the chart and Dr. Fields read it to Dr. Mody, then Dr. Fields also complied with the standard of care, according to Dr. Buchholz. Dr. Buchholz said, however, that if Dr. Axelb-aum\u2019s notations were on the chart and Dr. Fields failed to read them to Dr. Mody in their entirety, then Dr. Fields would have breached the standard of care. Dr. Buchholz could not say which of these three scenarios actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">At 2:45 p.m., Darwin\u2019s headache was gone, and he was able to tolerate fluids. Dr. Fields consulted with Dr. Lee, Darwin\u2019s primary care pediatrician, who informed Dr. Fields that he would see Darwin in his office for a follow-up the next day. Dr. Fields\u2019s final diagnosis was a \u201cvascular headache.\u201d He released Darwin from the hospital at 3:05 p.m. with instructions to follow up with Dr. Lee the next day. Darwin then left the hospital and went to his father\u2019s home, located in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">After his release from NAH, Darwin continued to complain of a headache at his father\u2019s home. That evening, his father gave him another Vicodin as prescribed by Dr. Fields. The next morning, August 19, 1988, Darwin was still complaining of a headache. His father took Darwin to Dr. Lee\u2019s office in Anne Arundel County for his follow-up appointment. Dr. Lee examined Darwin and noted that he had a headache, appeared drowsy, and had a staggering gait. Dr. Lee contacted Darwin\u2019s neurosurgeon, who referred Darwin to the University of Maryland Hospital, located in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Dr. Buchholz was later to testify that Darwin\u2019s condition at Dr. Lee\u2019s office was \u201cworse\u201d than it was the day before at NAH and that the worsening of his condition was related to increasing intracranial pressure caused by his still undiagnosed shunt malfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Darwin and his father arrived at the University Hospital at 3:55 p.m. on August 19, 1988. The University Hospital ER records note that Darwin was weak, drowsy, and lethargic; that he walked well the day before but \u201ctoday can hardly walk by himself\u2019; and that his headache was \u201cworse today.\u201d Darwin\u2019s shunt was tapped<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the emergency room and a CT scan was performed. The shunt tap revealed that Darwin had increased intracranial pressure. From this information, emergency room doctors correctly diagnosed Darwin as having a probable shunt malfunction, and at 11:05 p.m., Darwin was admitted to the neurosurgery service of the University Hospital. Corrective surgery was not performed immediately, however, and the next day, August 20,1988, Darwin experienced a cardiac arrest as a result of his shunt blockage. Doctors were able to revive and stabilize him, but the cardiac arrest caused extensive and irreversible damage to Darwin\u2019s brain. This damage has left Darwin in a permanent vegetative state.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Dr. Buchholz\u2019s expert opinion was that, given Darwin\u2019s medical history and the symptoms that he was exhibiting at NAH, the doctors should have performed a shunt tap on Darwin on August 18, 1988. According to Dr. Buchholz, if a shunt tap had been performed at NAH, it would have revealed that Darwin had increased intracranial pressure at that time. This information would have led the doctors to the proper diagnosis that Darwin\u2019s symptoms were caused by shunt malfunction. Dr. Buchholz opined that once a correct diagnosis had been made, if Darwin had been properly managed from that point on and received a shunt revision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> then his subsequent cardiac arrest on August 20,1988, could have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In addition, Dr. Buchholz testified that, between the time of Darwin\u2019s discharge from NAH and his arrival at the University of Maryland Hospital in Baltimore City, Darwin had in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>creased symptoms from his intracranial pressure, but his injuries were not irreversible at that point. According to Dr. Buchholz, if a shunt revision had been done at University Hospital on August 19, 1988, or during the morning of August 20, 1988, Darwin would have avoided his cardiac arrest and would not have suffered any permanent injury. Dr. Buchholz admitted, however, that if Darwin had been referred to the University of Maryland Hospital by NAH on August 18, 1988, there was no evidence that his course of treatment at the University of Maryland Hospital would have been any different, other than that his treatment would have started twenty-four hours earlier.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\n<em>Issue 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">A. <em>\u201cWhere the Came of Action Arose\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In December 1991, appellants filed their initial complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against NAH and Dr. Fields. Defendants immediately challenged venue. At a March 20, 1992, hearing, Judge Rombro found that both NAH and Dr. Fields were residents of Anne Arundel County, that they both maintained offices and engaged in business solely in Anne Arundel County, and that appellants\u2019 cause of action arose in Anne Arundel County. Based on these findings, he ruled that Baltimore City was an improper venue for the suit and transferred the case to Anne Arundel County. On appeal, appellants claim that Judge Rombro erred in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Section 6-201 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code (1998 Repl.Vol.) (hereinafter \u201cCJ\u201d) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">(a) <em>Civil Actions. </em>\u2014 Subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 6-202 and 6-203 and unless otherwise provided by law, a civil action shall be brought in a county where the defendant resides, carries on a regular business, is employed, or habitually engages in a vocation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">(b) <em>Multiple Defendants. </em>\u2014 If there is more than one defendant, and there is no single venue applicable to all defendants, under subsection (a), all may be sued in a county in which any one of them could be sued, or in the county where the cause of action arose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">CJ \u00a7 6-202 reads, so far as here material:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">In addition to the venue provided in \u00a7 6-201 or \u00a7 6-203, the following actions may be brought in the indicated county:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">(8) Tort action based on <em>negligence </em>\u2014 Where <em>the cauce of action arose;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">All parties agree with Judge Rombro\u2019s finding that, at the time the complaint was filed in Baltimore City, both NAH and Dr. Fields were Anne Arundel County residents who maintained their offices and conducted their business solely in that County. As such, neither party disputes that Anne Arundel County was the only proper venue under C J \u00a7 6-201 because it provided \u201ca single venue applicable to all defendants.\u201d Nevertheless, appellants note that CJ \u00a7 6-202(8) provides an alternative venue in negligence actions, allowing plaintiffs to bring suit in the county where the cause of action arose. <em>See Wilde v. Swanson, </em>314 Md. 80, 92, 548 A.2d 837 (1988) (holding that when multiple venues are proper under both CJ \u00a7 6-201 and CJ \u00a7 6-202, the plaintiff can choose to proceed under either section \u2014 \u201cNeither section enjoys a priority over the other\u201d). Appellants maintain that, under CJ \u00a7 6-202(8), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>venue was proper in Baltimore City because their cause of action arose there.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Whether the court was right in transferring the case to Anne Arundel County depends, in part, upon the meaning of the phrase \u201cwhere the cause of action arose.\u201d Maryland appellate courts have not had occasion to interpret this phrase in the context of our venue statutes, but prior decisions have interpreted similar language contained in section 11 \u2014 108(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code (1998 RepLVol.) (hereinafter CJ \u00a7 11 \u2014 108(b)). Section ll-108(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\"><em>Limitation on amount of damages established. </em>\u2014 (1) In any action for damages for personal injury <em>in which the cause of action arises </em>on or after July 1, 1986, an award for noneco-nomic damages may not exceed $850,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Armstrong, </em>326 Md. 107, 604 A.2d 47 (1992), the Court of Appeals held that, with respect to CJ \u00a7 ll-108(b), a cause of action \u201carises\u201d when facts exist to support each element of the cause of action. <em>See id. </em>at 121, 604 A.2d 47 (citing <em>Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, </em>87 Md.App. 699, 724-25, 591 A.2d 544 (1991)). The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aok-dedup-0\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion that a cause of action in negligence ... arises \u201cwhen facts exist to support each element.\u201d In a negligence claim, the fact of injury would seemingly be the last element to come into existence. The breach, duty, and causation elements naturally precede the fact of injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>see Owens Corning v. Bauman, </em>125 Md.App. 454, 480, 726 A.2d 745 (1999) (\u201cEach of the elements of a claim must be met before a cause of action arises \u2014 \u201d); <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Wood, </em>119 Md.App. 1, 45, 703 A.2d 1315, <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. 494, 709 A.2d 139 (1998) (\u201c[A] cause of action for negligence ... arises when the injury first occurs.\u201d); <em>Anchor Packing Co. v. Grimshaw, </em>115 Md.App. 134, 153, 692 A.2d 5 (1997), <em>vacated in part sub nom. Porter Hayden Co. v. Bullinger, </em>350 Md. 452, 713 A.2d 962 (1998) (stating that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>cause of action arises \u201cwhen all the elements of the claim are satisfied\u201d); <em>DiLeo v. Nugent, </em>88 Md.App. 59, 77, 592 A.2d 1126 (1991) (concluding that a medical malpractice cause of action arises \u201cwhen a negligent act, coupled with the resulting harm, amounts to a legally cognizable wrong\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Although the cases just referenced deal with <em>when </em>a \u201ccause of action arises\u201d in the context of CJ \u00a7 ll-108(b), we see no reason why the same interpretation of the phrase should not be applied to <em>where </em>a \u201ccause of action arises\u201d under CJ \u00a7 6-202(8). <em>See Engel v. Gosper, </em>71 N.J.Super. 573, 177 A.2d 595, 598 (N.J.Super. Ct. Law Div.1962) (noting that state statute dictating that a wrongful death cause of action arises <em>when </em>death occurs also makes it \u201creasonable to conclude that [a wrongful death] cause of action arises <em>where </em>death occurs\u201d (emphasis added)). We therefore hold that, under CJ \u00a7 6-202(8), \u201cwhere the cause of action arises\u201d is the place where all the elements of the negligence claim (duty, breach, causation, and injury) are satisfied. In negligence cases, because injury is the last element to come into existence, a cause of action in negligence arises <em>where the injury first occurs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Appellees argue that a cause of action in contract or tort arises <em>where the alleged breach occurs. </em>Appellees cite <em>Kane v. Schulmeyer, </em>349 Md. 424, 708 A.2d 1038 (1998), in support of this position. Other than citing to <em>Kane, </em>appellees fail to point to any case that holds that a cause of action arises at the place of the breach. <em>Kane </em>does not hold that a cause of action in contract or tort arises where the breach occurs \u2014 the specific holding of <em>Kane </em>is that, in an action involving the breach of an agreement to pay money, a cause of action for breach of contract arises where payment was to be made; if no place of payment is specified in the agreement, then the cause of action arises where the creditor resides or has its place of business. <em>See id. </em>at 438, 708 A.2d 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">At issue in <em>Kane </em>was the breach of an agreement to repay a debt. In such actions, the breach and damages arising from the breach will always occur in the same place. In other words, as soon as the debtor fails to make payment at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>proper place, the creditor has incurred damages at that location. The <em>Kane </em>Court did not address the issue of where a cause of action arises when the breach occurs in one county and the injury occurs in another. As such, <em>Kane </em>does not support appellees\u2019 argument that a cause of action arises where the breach occurs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>We therefore reject appellees\u2019 interpretation of the language in CJ \u00a7 6-202(8) and hold that a cause of action in negligence arises where the injury first occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">B. <em>Where Did Darwin First Suffer Injury ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Appellants presently contend that because Darwin suffered his cardiac arrest and brain damage at the University of Maryland Hospital in Baltimore City, the cause of action arose in Baltimore City because this is where he manifested injury proximately caused by NAH\u2019s and Dr. Fields\u2019 alleged breach of the standard of care. On the other hand, appellees maintain that, after his discharge from NAH on August 18, 1988, and due to his undiagnosed shunt malfunction, Darwin incurred pain and suffering injuries in Anne Arundel County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>before he was transported to Baltimore City, and therefore the cause of action arose in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In <em>Edmonds v. Cytology Services, </em>111 Md.App. 233, 681 A.2d 546 (1996), <em>aff'd sub nom., Rivera v. Edmonds, </em>347 Md. 208; 699 A.2d 1194 (1997), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">A patient sustains an \u201cinjury\u201d ... when, as a result of the tort, he or she first sustains compensable damages that can be proven with reasonable certainty. Therefore, the patient could suffer an \u201cinjury\u201d as a result of a negligent misdiagnosis, when (1) he or she experiences pain or other manifestation of an injury; (2) the disease advances beyond the point where it was at the time of the misdiagnosis and to a point where (a) it can no longer effectively be treated, (b) it cannot be treated as well or as completely as it could have been at the time of the misdiagnosis, or (c) the treatment would entail expense or detrimental side effects that would not likely have occurred had treatment commenced at the earlier time; or (3) the patient dies. This is not, of course, an exhaustive checklist; the overriding inquiry in all cases must be when the patient first sustained legally compensa-ble damages. In any event, the injury occurs, as we have observed, when legally compensable tort damages <em>first </em>occur, regardless of whether those damages are discoverable or undiscoverable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 270, 681 A.2d 546 (citations omitted). Given this definition of injury, we agree with appellees that Darwin first suffered injury in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">During discovery, one of the interrogatories propounded to appellants was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">Describe in detail the injuries, disabilities, and infirmities which you claim that [Darwin] sustained as a result of the occurrence which is the subject matter of this suit, and when each such injury, disability, or infirmity occurred. Appellants\u2019 answer to this interrogatory was:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">At the time [Darwin] was in the care of the Defendants <em>at North Arundel Hospital, </em>the child\u2019s <em>intracranial pressure was constantly increasing causing neurological deterioras</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>tion </em>moving him inevitably toward and ultimately causing massive brain injuries....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">(Emphasis added.) This interrogatory answer shows that appellants claimed that the defendants caused Darwin to suffer injury in the form of \u201cneurological deterioration\u201d and increased intracranial pressure while at NAH, located in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">In addition, at trial, appellants\u2019 medical expert, Dr. Buch-holz, testified that if the doctors at NAH had properly diagnosed Darwin as having a shunt malfunction on August 18, 1988, then he would have been referred to the University of Maryland Hospital twenty-four to twenty-five hours earlier for a shunt revision. <em>See supra </em>note 7. Instead, because of this alleged misdiagnosis, Darwin was sent to his home in Anne Arundel County. While at his home, Darwin experienced pain and suffering in the form of headaches and drowsiness caused by his increasing intracranial pressure. The next day, at Dr. Lee\u2019s office in Anne Arundel County, Darwin continued to complain of a headache and drowsiness, and Dr. Lee also noted that Darwin had a \u201cstaggering gait\u201d \u2014 a common symptom of increased intracranial pressure. Overall, Darwin\u2019s condition continued to worsen after his release from NAH, and this worsening took place in Anne Arundel County. In short, Darwin experienced pain and suffering injury in Anne Arundel County due to appellees\u2019 alleged negligent failure to diagnose the blocked shunt. Darwin\u2019s pain and suffering could have been limited if he had been referred immediately to the University of Maryland Hospital for a shunt revision. In this regard, Dr. Buchholz testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">Q Okay. Now, in response to ... whether Darwin Green had sustained injury between the time he was seen at North Arundel Hospital and the time of his [cardiac] arrest, some time around midday on the 20th, you had mentioned ... that [Darwin] had sustained no irreversible injury. But, in fact, you\u2019re willing to go further than that and say that he sustained no injury whatsoever; is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>A I mean, <em>if you mean symptoms as being some form of injury, he had some symptoms which had increased. </em>But I think in the sense that we really mean the term some sort of permanent damage, that is true that he had not sustained permanent damage prior to the arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In sum, because appellants\u2019 own evidence showed that Darwin <em>first </em>experienced injury in the form of \u201cneurological deterioration\u201d and pain and suffering in Anne Arundel County, the cause of action arose in that county. Accordingly, Judge Rombro did not err in transferring the case out of Baltimore City.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fact that Darwin experienced more serious injuries later in Baltimore City is of no consequence for venue purposes \u2014 the cause of action was complete as soon as Darwin first experienced <em>any </em>injury from the alleged negligent acts of NAH and Dr. Fields.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\n<em>Issue 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Both sides agree that Dr. Mody carries on his business and maintains an office in Baltimore City. Appellants\u2019 second claim is that Judge Rushworth erred in failing to transfer the case back to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City once Dr. Mody was added to the action. Appellants argue that the addition of Dr. Mody to the case made venue proper in Baltimore City under the multiple defendant provision of CJ \u00a7 6-201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Appellants\u2019 argument is without merit because, at the time that Judge Rushworth denied appellants\u2019 motion to transfer the case back to Baltimore City, Dr. Mody had not been named as a defendant in the case. The court denied appellants\u2019 motion to transfer on August 2, 1996. Appellants did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>not amend their complaint to add Dr. Mody to this case until August 9, 1996. Thereafter, appellants never renewed their motion to transfer. Because Dr. Mody was not a defendant in the case at the time Judge Rushworth decided the motion, there was no basis for him to grant the transfer. As such, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">\n<em>Issue 3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Appellants next contend that the trial court erred as a matter of law in excluding Darwin from the courtroom during the liability phase of the trial because such exclusion was: (A) a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213 (1994) (hereinafter \u201cADA\u201d); (B) a violation of federal and state due process; and (C) a violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments\u2019 implicit right guaranteeing the public access to trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">A. <em>Americans With Disability Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12165 (1994), deals with discrimination against disabled persons by public entities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 12132 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">Subject to the provisions of this subchapter, no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Federal regulations implementing the requirements of the ADA state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) (1999); <em>see Weinreich v. Los Angeles County Metro. Transp.

Therefore, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Judge Rushworth\u2019s ruling constituted a violation of the ADA, this would only give Darwin a separate cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>action for injunctive relief against the trial judge in his official capacity as a judicial officer of the State<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 it would not constitute reversible error in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Thus, whether Judge Rushworth\u2019s exclusion of Darwin from trial violates the ADA is irrelevant to the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">B. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Appellants also argue that the exclusion of Darwin from the liability phase of the trial violated his due process rights under the United States and Maryland Constitutions. For reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">A party does not have an absolute right to attend trial. <em>See Helminski v. Ayerst Lab., </em>766 F.2d 208 (6th Cir.1985); <em>Marks v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>562 F.Supp. 759, 768 (E.D.Pa.1983), <em>aff'd, </em>727 F.2d 1100 (3rd Cir.1984); <em>Cary v. Oneok, Inc., </em>940 P.2d 201, 204 (Okla.1997). Although there is no Maryland case law specifying the circumstances under which the exclusion of a party from trial offends due process, many courts faced with this issue have adopted the reasoning used by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Helminski. See, e.g., Hines v. Wilkinson, </em>163 F.R.D. 262, 265-68 (S.D.Ohio 1995); <em>Province v. Center for Women\u2019s Health &amp; Family Birth, </em>20 Cal.App.4th 1673, 25 Cal.Rptr.2d 667, 675 (1993) (noting that <em>Helminski </em>\u201csurveyed, considered, and discussed the rules which had been applied to a broad range of cases\u201d dealing with the exclusion of parties from trial); <em>Cary, </em>940 P.2d at 205; <em>Bremner v. Charles, </em>312 Or. 274, 821 P.2d 1080, 1085 (1991), <em>modified by, </em>313 Or. 339, 832 P.2d 454 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In <em>Helminski, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that the minor plaintiffs mother\u2019s exposure during pregnancy to a surgical anesthetic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>manufactured by the defendant caused injury to the minor\u2019s nervous system when he was a fetus. <em>See </em>766 F.2d at 210. The defendants moved to exclude the minor from trial, arguing that his appearance before the jury would be prejudicial to their case. <em>See id. </em>at 213. At the time of trial, the minor required twenty-four hour a day care, did not speak, was not toilet trained, and had an extremely low IQ. <em>See id. </em>at 210. The trial judge bifurcated the proceedings and excluded the minor from the liability phase of the trial. <em>See id. </em>at 211. On appeal to the Sixth Circuit, the plaintiffs argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the exclusion of the minor deprived him of his Fifth Amendment right to due process. <em>See id. </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The <em>Helminski </em>court held that, although a plaintiff does not have an absolute right to be present in the courtroom, due process prevents a court from arbitrarily excluding a party from trial. <em>See id. </em>According to the court, in cases where the plaintiff has a severe injury that may potentially prejudice the jury and the plaintiff is unable to comprehend the proceedings or aid counsel, exclusion of the plaintiff does not offend due process. <em>See id. </em>at 217. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">Although under some circumstances the mere sight by a jury of a severely injured plaintiff may evoke juror sympathy, juror sympathy alone is insufficient to establish juror prejudice. Generally, the jury will follow the court\u2019s instructions and fulfill its promise to decide the case solely on the facts. On the other hand, there may be occasions when the mere presence of a party would render the jury unable to arrive at an unbiased judgment concerning liability. Should such a case arise and the presence of the party would not aid the fair administration of justice, the trial court can exclude the plaintiff or limit his presence. A party\u2019s involuntary exclusion under these circumstances would not constitute a denial of due process. Nevertheless, absent disruptive behavior, involuntary exclusion of a party who is able to comprehend the proceedings and aid counsel would constitute a denial of due process since exclusion of such party would deny him the right to obtain a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>Id.; see also Morley v. Superior Court, </em>131 Ariz. 85, 638 P.2d 1331, 1334 (1981) (holding that plaintiff, who was comatose, required a tracheostomy to breathe, was fed via a feeding tube, and was unable to communicate with his lawyers, was properly excluded from liability phase of trial because his presence would prejudice the jury); <em>Dickson v. Bober, </em>269 Minn. 334, 130 N.W.2d 526, 530 (1964) (holding that because plaintiff was unable to testify or comprehend the proceedings, he possessed no absolute right to be present at trial so long as his rights were protected by his attorney and guardian who brought the action on his behalf).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The <em>Helminski </em>court set forth a two-step inquiry to determine whether a party\u2019s exclusion from trial comports with due process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">[T]he defendant who seeks to exclude a handicapped plaintiff must establish at a hearing that the plaintiffs presence would prevent or substantially impair the jury\u2019s performance of its factfinding task. The requisite showing of prejudice cannot be satisfied simply by establishing that a plaintiff has a physical or mental injury; the party seeking the exclusion must establish that the party\u2019s appearance or conduct is likely to prevent the jury from performing its duty____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">Should the [trial] court determine that the party\u2019s mere presence would be prejudicial, the court must next consider whether the party can understand the proceedings and aid counsel. If the trial court concludes that the party can comprehend the proceedings and assist counsel in a meaningful way, the party cannot be involuntarily excluded regardless of prejudicial impact; in such a case, cautionary instructions will protect the interests of the defendant in a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 218. The court then stated that if a trial court concludes that the plaintiffs presence would substantially prejudice the jury and the plaintiff would be unable to assist counsel or comprehend the proceedings, then the trial judge should bifurcate the case into separate trials on liability and damages, and exclude the plaintiff from the liability phase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>See id. </em>at 217. The court noted, however, that the exclusion of a party from the damages portion of the proceedings would never be appropriate. <em>See id. </em>Applying this analysis to the facts of <em>Helminski, </em>the Sixth Circuit found error because the trial judge never observed the minor plaintiff to determine whether his appearance would prejudice the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 218. Nevertheless, the <em>Helminski </em>court concluded that this error was harmless and affirmed the trial judge\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Applying the <em>Helminski </em>analysis to the case at bar, we find no constitutional violation in Darwin\u2019s exclusion from the liability portion of the trial. Prior to the start of trial, Judge Rushworth held a hearing on the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude. Judge Rushworth stated that he had read the <em>Helminski </em>case, had the opportunity to watch a \u201cday in the life\u201d video<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> film that showed Darwin being tended to by his nurses, and had considered Darwin\u2019s medical records. Judge Rushworth then stated on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">Let me address that video which goes on at length showing the Plaintiff virtually motionless except for some eye blinking and except for periods of time when instruments were inserted by way of the feeding tube and the suctioning from the neck or throat area which the court understands by the records is done periodically, perhaps as often as every two hours. At that point, there is some jerking movement that lifts his legs and the extension of his arms above and about the bed he lies in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">---- Unlike the judge in <em>Helminski </em>this Court then has an opportunity short of actually visiting with the [pjlaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>and the time in light of the fact that we are going to try this case in the morning precludes that visit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">But short of that, the [cjourt feels confident to do some fact finding. And those facts are that and this particular [pjlaintiff does not have the ability to communicate in any fashion with counsel or his parents or the nurses in this video. And the [cjourt is convinced that he will not be able to aid his counsel in prosecuting the case and offering any sort of input beyond that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">____ The [cjourt finds then that he is reduced to the vegetable state. That there can be no purpose in presenting the [pjlaintiff short of prejudice to the [djefendant\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">____ In this instance, there can be no input to the [pjlaintiffs counsel. The Court cannot arbitrarily deny a party\u2019s right to be present during trial because of the party\u2019s appearance, but the possibility of prejudice is to be weighed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">And in this instance, the [cjourt finds that it is great beyond the extension of any instructions that could be offered and will be offered in all likelihood in any case as to sympathy or prejudice public opinion. In this instance, the [cjourt finds that ... to grant a fair trial which would go to all parties would require excluding the [pjlaintiff----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">The burden of persuasion is on the moving party and they have carried that burden in this instance. The [djefendant who seeks to exclude a handicapped plaintiff must establish that the presence of the plaintiff would prevent and substantially impair the jury\u2019s performance. The impairment or the prejudice must be so great that the jury instructions will not likely correct that prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">And having viewed the tape, the [cjourt is convinced that any viewing of the [pjlaintiff in person or by video would leave any party in a position to be emotionally struck and otherwise feeling sympathy for the [pjlaintiff. This trial is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>also a matter which is bifurcated. We addressed the matter of liability. And so, therefore, the [c]ourt sees no necessity as it would if and when we are at the state of the position of the trial addressing damages to have the [p]laintiff present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">Obviously, if the case were not bifurcated, or at least, I think, the [c]ourt would have a different slant on the particular circumstances which at some point it will certainly be necessary going beyond liability to address damages and then, of course, to have the [p]laintiff presented if th[ose] are the wishes of the prosecutors of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The above-quoted findings show that Judge Rushworth went to great lengths to ensure that Darwin\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by arbitrarily excluding him from trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">C. <em>Public Access to Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Appellants\u2019 final argument against Darwin\u2019s exclusion is based on the right of the public to attend trials. <em>See Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, </em>448 U.S. 555, 581, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973 (1980) (holding that the right to attend trials is implicit in the guarantees of the First Amendment). Appellants argue that \u201c[i]f Darwin Green were not a party to this action, and were merely an observer, he would have had every right to public access to the court proceedings under [the law]. It follows that Darwin Green had every right to be present in court as a party to this action.... \u201d We disagree with appellants\u2019 premise. Just as the right of a party to attend trial is not without limitation, the right of the public to attend a trial as an observer is also not absolute. The Supreme Court in <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>noted this very fact in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">We have no occasion here to define the circumstances in which all or parts of a ... trial may be closed to the public, but our holding today does not mean that the First Amendment rights of the public and representatives of the press are absolute. Just as a government may impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions upon the use of its streets in the interest of such objectives as the free flow of traffic, so may a trial judge, in the interest of the fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>administration of justice, impose reasonable limitations on access to a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 581 n. 18, 100 S.Ct. 2814 (citations omitted). Thus, it is clear that Darwin did not have an absolute right to attend the trial as an observer \u2014 the trial judge had discretion to exclude anyone from the courtroom \u201cin the interest of the fair administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the fact that Judge Rushworth already concluded that Darwin\u2019s presence would prejudice the proceedings, there was no abuse of discretion in barring Darwin from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">D. <em>Other Matters</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">What we have said thus far concerning Darwin\u2019s exclusion from the courtroom is dicta. Even if we were to have decided that Darwin should not have been excluded from the courtroom, appellants have failed to show that the error was prejudicial. <em>See Bradley v. Hazard Tech. Co., </em>340 Md. 202, 206, 665 A.2d 1050 (1995) (\u201cUnless an appellant can demonstrate that a <em>prejudicial </em>error occurred below, reversal is not warranted.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">As noted previously, the trial court granted a motion for judgment in favor of NAH and Dr. Mody at the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case. The propriety of the grant of judgment was not challenged in this appeal. Whether Darwin had been in the courtroom during the entire trial up to the point where the motions were granted could not possibly have helped appellants prove their case against NAH or Dr. Mody.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">With respect to Drs. Fields and Axelbaum, the jury answered \u201cno\u201d to the special verdict form question, \u201cdo you find the plaintiff has proven that [either Dr. Fields or Dr. Axelb-aum] departed from accepted standards of care in the treatment of Darwin Green?\u201d If Darwin had been present during every minute of the trial, his presence could not have affected the answer to that standard of care question.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">Darwin Green must demonstrate his condition in order to illustrate an element of the applicable standard of care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>involved in this specific case. The standard of care for the proper treatment of a patient is not cut and dry but rather is necessarily fluid depending upon differing circumstances. One vital element in determining the standard of care in a given circumstance is clearly the foreseeable consequences of committing an error. A case in which it is known to the physician that a mistake has a very high likelihood of devastating injury to the patient must obviously be handled with the utmost care. The risk to the patient, at least in part, dictates the required caution to be exercised by the physician. A splinter must be removed more carefully from a brain than from a finger. What informs this exercise of care if the physician\u2019s awareness of foreseeable possible consequences of error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">This is pure sophistry. The jury was well aware of Darwin\u2019s vegetative state. During Dr. Buchholz\u2019s direct examination, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">Q [PLAINTIFF\u2019S COUNSEL] Now, what happened ... to Darwin as a result of the cardiac arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">A As a result of the cardiac arrest, he suffered ... decreased oxygen ... and blood supply to the brain. He suffered brain damage from those two things in the course of his arrest, and <em>he is now in a chronic vegetative state.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3E\">(Emphasis added.) Furthermore, during closing argument, plaintiffs counsel stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any dispute that Darwin was injured and that he is currently in a persistent vegetative state.\u201d Finally, voluminous medical records from Darwin\u2019s stay at the University of Maryland Hospital were introduced into evidence. These records clearly set forth Darwin\u2019s post-cardiac arrest condition. Accordingly, appellants have failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from the \u201cerror\u201d of excluding Darwin from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\n<em>Issue h</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Appellants\u2019 final assertion is that the trial judge erred by allowing appellees to present a theory of their case that was against Maryland case law as set forth in <em>Mehlman v. Powell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>281 Md. 269, 378 A.2d 1121 (1977). In <em>Mehlman, </em>the Court of Appeals held that an emergency room physician\u2019s misdiagnosis of a patient\u2019s condition was still a proximate cause of the patient\u2019s death, despite the fact that it may have been accompanied by the subsequent negligence of other physicians. <em>See id. </em>at 275-76, 378 A.2d 1121. Appellants take issue with a number of statements made by defense counsel during opening and closing statements that they believe gave the jury the impression that if the jury found that doctors at the University of Maryland Hospital were negligent or caused Darwin\u2019s injuries, then the jury could not conclude that either Dr. Fields\u2019s or Dr. Axelbaum\u2019s actions were the proximate cause of Darwin\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">This issue has not been preserved for appellate review. None of the statements that appellants point to in the brief were objected to at trial. As such, this claim is waived. <em>See Grier v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 534, 544-45, 698 A.2d 1133 (1997), <em>rev\u2019d an other grounds, </em>351 Md. 241, 718 A.2d 211 (1998) (objections to improper argument of counsel must be made either contemporaneously or before jurors are excused from courtroom to preserve issue for appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">It is true that appellants did make a motion in limine prior to trial to exclude any discussion before the jury of the negligence of the University of Maryland Hospital. Nevertheless, a motion in limine is not the equivalent of a continuing objection \u2014 when a party makes a motion in limine to prevent counsel from making an argument and the motion is denied, the party who made the motion must object at the time the argument is made to the jury in order to preserve the objection for appellate review. <em>See Reed v. State, </em>353 Md. 628, 643, 728 A.2d 195 (1999) (when a motion in limine is denied, a contemporaneous objection to evidence must be made when the evidence is admitted at trial to preserve the issue for appellate review); <em>United States Gypsum Co. v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>336 Md. 145, 174, 647 A.2d 405 (1994); <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 356, 535 A.2d 445 (1988); <em>Collier v.

Confining litigants to the issues set forth in the \u201cQuestions Presented\u201d segment of their brief ensures that the issues presented are obvious to all parties and the Court. <em>See DiPino v.

Zitter, Annotation, <em>Place Where Claim or Cause of Action \"Arose\" Under State Venue Statute, </em>53 A.L.R.4th 1104 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On the other hand, federal courts have taken a variety of different approaches in determining where a cause of action \"arises\u201d under the federal venue statute (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391). <em>See generally, </em>Annotation, <em>What Is the Judicial District \"In Which the Claim Arose\" for Venue Purposes Under 28 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1391(a) and (b), </em>59 A.L.R. Fed. 320 (1982). Prior to 1990, title 28, section 1391(a), of the United States Code placed venue in diversity cases in the federal district \"in which the claim arose.\u201d Some federal courts, like most state courts, interpreted this language as permitting venue only in the jurisdiction where the plaintiff first suffered injury (\"place of injury\u201d test). <em>See, e.g., Delta Educ., Inc. v. Langlois, </em>719 F.Supp. 42, 49 (D.N.H.1989); <em>Wade v. Olympus Indus., </em>695 F.Supp. 730, 734 (S.D.N.Y.1988); <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Bowmar Pub. Co., </em>445 F.Supp. 780 (D.Md.1978). Most federal courts, however, adopted one of two tests to determine where a claim arose \u2014 the \"weight of contacts\u201d test or the \"substantial part\u201d test. <em>See Missouri Hous. Dev. Comm\u2019n v. Brice, </em>919 F.2d 1306, 1309 (8th Cir.1990); <em>Frontier Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. National Hotel Corp., </em>675 F.Supp. 1293, 1300 (D.Utah 1987); <em>Hodson v. A.H. Robins Co., </em>528 F.Supp. 809, 813 (E.D.Va.1981), <em>aff'd, </em>715 F.2d 142 (4th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Under the \"weight of contacts\" test, venue is proper in the district that has the most significant ties to the claim, and not proper in a district where merely insignificant conduct took place. <em>See Brice, </em>919 F.2d at 1312; <em>Broadcasting Co. v. Flair Broadcasting Corp., </em>892 F.2d 372, (4th Cir.1989); <em>Frontier, </em>675 F.Supp. at 1301; <em>Hodson, </em>528 F.Supp. at 813; <em>Quinn v. Bowmar Pub. Co., </em>445 F.Supp. 780, 783 (D.Md.1978); <em>Hindu Incense v. Meadows, </em>439 F.Supp. 844, 847 (N.D.Ill.1977); <em>California Clippers, Inc. v. United States Soccer Football Ass\u2019n, </em>314 F.Supp. 1057, 1063 (N.D.Cal.1970); <em>Philadelphia Hous. Auth. v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp., </em>291 F.Supp. 252, 260 (E.D.Pa.1968). It is noteworthy, however, that federal courts applying the \"weight of contacts\" test have given significant weight to the location of the injury in analyzing where a claim arose. <em>See Hodson, </em>528 F.Supp. at 814; <em>Grappone, Inc. v. Subaru of America, Inc., </em>403 F.Supp. 123, 133 (D.N.H.1975) (adopting the \"weight of contacts test\u201d but noting that \"the place of injury should be given great weight and consideration by the court\u201d). Other federal courts have used the \"weight of contacts\u201d test only in complex cases where injuries are present in multiple districts; for simple tort cases, these courts have stated that the \"place of injury\u201d test applies. <em>See California Clippers, </em>314 F.Supp. at 1063; <em>Philadelphia Hous. Auth., 291 </em>F.Supp. at 260 (\"While it may be well to find that a tort claim arises in the jurisdiction where injury occurs, antitrust actions are not susceptible to such simplistic rationale.\u201d) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The \u201csubstantial part\u201d test places venue in the district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. <em>See, e.g., Lamont v. Haig, </em>590 F.2d 1124, 1134-35 (D.C.Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>1978); <em>Commercial Lighting Prods., Inc. v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>537 F.2d 1078, 1080 (9th Cir.1976); <em>Medical Emergency Serv. Assocs. v. Duplis, </em>558 F.Supp. 1312 (N.D.Ill.1983); <em>Hodson, 528 </em>F.Supp. at 815; <em>Thornwell v. United States, </em>471 F.Supp. 344, 355-56 (D.D.C.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In <em>Leroy v. Great Western United Corp., </em>443 U.S. 173, 99 S.Ct. 2710, 61 L.Ed.2d 464 (1979), the Supreme Court had the opportunity to interpret section 1391, but (he Court did not expressly endorse any particular test for determining where a claim arises. The Court determined where a claim arose by balancing the various relevant contacts between the claim and the districts. <em>See id. </em>at 186, 99 S.Ct. 2710. Lower courts interpreting <em>Leroy </em>concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis implicitly rejected the \"place of injury\u201d test and indirectly endorsed the \"weight of contacts\u201d approach. <em>See Missouri Hous. Dev. Comm\u2019n, </em>919 F.2d at 1311; <em>Broadcasting Co., </em>892 F.2d at 372; <em>Dody v. Brown, </em>659 F.Supp. 541, 550 (W.D.Mo.1987) <em>(\u201cLeroy </em>did not overrule those cases applying the weight of the contacts test.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">The confusion among the federal courts ended in 1990 when Congress adopted the \u201csubstantial part\u201d test by replacing the \"claim arose\u201d language in section 1391 with \u201ca judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a)(2) &amp; (b)(2) (1994 &amp; Supp.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Even though many federal cases have determined that a claim \"arises\u201d in a district other than the place of injury, appellees make no argument that wc should adopt a \"weight of contacts\u201d or \"significant part\u201d approach. In addition, we note that the Court of Appeals in <em>Kane </em>expressly rejected these approaches to venue. The <em>Kane </em>Court noted that there were a \"bewildering variety of tests to ascertain where claim arose\u201d under the federal venue statute and that there was no need for Maryland courts \"to wander into that thicket.\u201d 349 Md. at 438-39 n. 6, 708 A.2d 1038.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b438-9\">. The interrogatory and its answer, and the testimony showing that Darwin first experienced injury in Anne Arundel County, were elicited after the Circuit Court for Baltimore City made its venue ruling. Nevertheless, it would be an exercise in futility to remand this case to determine where Darwin first experienced injury when appellants\u2019 own evidence shows that Darwin incurred pain and suffering injuries in Anne Arundel County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b439-10\">.
