Together, the three parcels of land contain approximately two hundred acres. All of the property is situated within a larger, 886 j\u00e9 acre tract called \u201cSideros,\u201d surveyed by Richard Cat\u00f3n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 1843.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The historical pedigree of the tracts has been contested for decades, and the briefs are not altogether helpful in eludicat-ing the factual contentions. Two of the three pieces of land have historical nicknames that assist in referring to the parcels. One bears the name \u201cWolf Pen,\u201d and consists of 71 acres. The other, \u201cHornet\u2019s Nest\u201d, is a 14 acre tract situated northwest of Wolf Pen. The third tract consists of 115 acres of land, and we shall refer to it as \u201cthe third tract.\u201d Although its location is disputed, appellant asserts that the third tract is situated between Wolf Pen and Hornet\u2019s Nest, and he claims ownership by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">On April 15, 1996, Ms. Schaffer filed an action to quiet title against Porter in the Circuit Court for Allegany County. Ms. Schaffer claimed record title ownership to all three tracts of land, stemming from her title to Sideros. In an amended complaint filed on September 17, 1996, she also claimed ownership of all three tracts, by adverse possession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his answer to appellee\u2019s amended complaint, Porter asserted record title to Wolf Pen and Hornet\u2019s Nest, and title to all three tracts by adverse possession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>After a three-day trial, the court (Leasure, J.) concluded that appellee had superior record title to Hornet\u2019s Nest and the third tract. The court further concluded that although Porter\u2019s chain of title to Wolf Pen stemmed from a patent that pre-dated appellee\u2019s patent to Sideros, appellant failed to meet his burden of locating the tract within Sideros \u201cwith reasonable certainty.\u201d The court also rejected Porter\u2019s claim of adverse possession. Accordingly, the court entered judgment in favor of Ms. Schaffer. That judgment spawned this appeal. Porter presents three issues for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">I. Did the trial court err in concluding that appellant did not establish with reasonable certainty the location of \u201cWolf Pen\u201d within the present description of \u201cSideros\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">II. Did the trial court err in placing the burden of proof on appellant to prove his title to \u201cHornet\u2019s Nest?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">III. Did the trial court err in concluding that appellant did not establish title to the disputed land by adverse possession?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">We answer each question in the negative. Accordingly, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">At trial, appellee presented a chain of title to the original patent of Sideros, which was issued in 1845. Appellant\u2019s chain of title to Wolf Pen and Hornet\u2019s Nest stemmed from a deed dated March 20, 1906, conveying portions of a farm owned by Amos Robinette to Frank Troutman, appellant\u2019s predecessor in title. Appellant claimed that Robinette\u2019s interest in Wolf Pen and Hornet\u2019s Nest derived from the original patents for both tracts. The patent for Hornet\u2019s Nest was issued in 1795 to Thomas Beall of Samuel; the patent for Wolf Pen was issued in 1841 to Robinette. Appellant did not make a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>of record title to the third tract, however. Rather, his claim to that tract was based entirely on adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">We shall describe each party\u2019s record title claims separately. As each party\u2019s argument involves the interpretation of land patents issued in previous centuries, it is helpful to survey, by way of background, Maryland\u2019s land patent system. <em>Land Patents in Maryland,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">A land patent \u201chas been defined as a grant of some privilege, property, or authority, made by the government or sovereign of a country to one or more individuals... .When used in connection with real property, it means the title deed by which a government, either state or federal, conveys its lands.\u201d 1 Logan D. Fitch, <em>Abstracts and Titles to Real Property </em>\u00a7 142 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The patent process in Maryland has its roots in the charter given to George Calvert, Lord of Baltimore, by Charles I, in 1632. The Maryland Charter created in the Barons of Baltimore a \u201cgrand fief or honor, to be held of the Crown by the tenure of free and common socage,\u201d which included an annual presentation to the King of two Native American arrows as a seal of the <em>Lord Proprietor\u2019s </em>\u201ctenure of petit sergeantry.\u201d John M. Brewer and Lewis Mayer, <em>The Law and Rules of the Land Office of Maryland </em>1 (1871); <em>see also </em>John Kilty, <em>The Landholder\u2019s Assistant </em>(1808); <em>Matthews v. Ward, </em>10 G. &amp; J. 443, 450-51 (1839). When the colony of Maryland became the State of Maryland, the power of the Lord Proprietor to grant land passed to the judges of the Land Office, a position now represented by the Commissioner of Land Patents. Md.Code (1974, 1996 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 13-201 of the Real Property Article; <em>see Marquardt v. Papenfuse, </em>92 Md.App. 683, 690-91, 610 A.2d 325, <em>cert. denied, </em>328 Md. 93, 612 A.2d 1316 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The transition from colony to state did not change the method for obtaining a patent, as the Land Office adopted the same warrant procedure employed by Lord Baltimore and his successors. An applicant who wished to claim vacant lands was required to apply to the Land Office for a warrant of survey or resurvey. That warrant compelled the county sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>veyor to conduct a survey within one year of the warrant. Adjacent landowners were notified of the survey. <em>Maryland Coal &amp; Realty Co. v. Eckhart, </em>25 Md.App. 605, 610, 337 A.2d 150 (1975); <em>see </em>Brewer and Mayer, 12-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Several types of warrants could be obtained by a prospective grantee. The early case of <em>Cunningham v. Browning, </em>1 Bland 299, 310-12 (1827), is helpful in identifying a variety of warrants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">There were under the Proprietary\u2019s government, and still are, five different modes of beginning to obtain title to lands, or, in other words, five several kinds of warrants____ If it be his object ... to obtain a certain quantity of vacant land any where, without regard to any particular space, or tract ... the register of the land office gives him a <em>common warrant, </em>directed to the surveyor, commanding him to lay out the specified quantity of land____ But if required by the applicant, ... the register will insert a particular description of the land ... in the warrant itself; which specification gives to it the denomination of a <em>special warrant.... </em>But, if the applicant had already obtained a title ... and only wished to add to it some contiguous vacancy, he may obtain ... a <em>warrant of </em>resurvey____ [I]f any one had caused a particular tract of land to be surveyed, but had failed to comply with the conditions ... and ... to take out a patent ... any one else ... may obtain ... a <em>proclamation warrant </em>authorizing the applicant to take up the same lands---- And finally, any one by ... setting forth that a ... tract of land had actually escheated by the death of the ... owner intestate and without heirs, may obtain immediately ... an <em>escheat </em>warrant....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">(Emphasis added); <em>see Marquardt, </em>92 Md.App. at 691-92, 610 A.2d 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-16\">After the surveyor completed his work and returned a certificate of survey, the certificate remained with the Land Office for six months. During that time, any interested party could enter a caveat. The Commissioner\u2019s resolution of the caveat was final as to the patent, but it did not resolve all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>questions of title in the land, because \u201ca patentee could only take subject to all prior claims, encumbrances, and equities....\u201d <em>Eckhart, 25 </em>Md.App. at 610-11, 337 A.2d 150. Thus, \u201cthe general rule of the Land Office in doubtful cases was to let the patent issue, for if it were granted, the question thereafter could be brought before a court of law or equity to vacate the patent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 337 A.2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>Schaffer\u2019s Record Title to \u201cSideros\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Appellee claims a direct chain of title to the original land patent of Sideros. In 1843, Richard Cat\u00f3n obtained a warrant of resurvey for Sideros. The resulting survey described Side-ros as containing 886 <em>% </em>acres. Cat\u00f3n died shortly after the survey was completed. In 1845, however, a patent for Sideros was issued to Caton\u2019s four daughters. Subsequently, the Cat\u00f3n lands were placed in a trust managed by the Alexander Yearley firm of Baltimore (the \u201cYearley Trustees\u201d). The Yearley Trustees continued to manage Sideros, along with the remainder of Caton\u2019s vast holdings in Allegany county, long after the last of the Cat\u00f3n daughters died.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As part of their duties, the Yearley Trustees submitted annual reports to the court. On April 5,1922, the Yearley Trustees executed a deed conveying Sideros to \u201cHarry W. Yonker\u201d, appellee\u2019s father.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The deed provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the sum of One Dollar in hand paid, the said party of the first part [the Trustees] does hereby grant and convey unto the said party of the second part [Yonkers], all the right title and interest of the parties to said cause No. 2227 Equity, in and to a tract of land called \u201cSideros\u201d, situate, lying and being in Election District No. 3, in Allegany County, Maryland originally patented December 24th, 1845 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>to Mary Ann Wellesly and others for 886-1/2<footnotemark>[6<em>]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>acres, <em>except so much of the same as stated in the Report of Sale above mentioned, </em>said original trust being described as follows:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In the 18th Report of the Trustees, filed on November 22, 1921, the trustees reported the sale of Sideros to Yonkers, but provided the following exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">\u201c... excepting the part containing 106 <em>% </em>acres sold to R. Buey on June 26th, 1893, and the part containing 199 acres sold to William Somerville in September, 1913, <em>and also excepting all parts of said original tract to which others may have a better title than the parties to this cause.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArS\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">On July 17, 1945, the property was conveyed to appellee in joint tenancy with her father. Following her father\u2019s death in 1951, appellee succeeded to her father\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Robert Plummer, a surveyor, testified as an expert witness for Schaffer. Appellee\u2019s counsel asked Plummer to identify the boundaries of Sideros on a \u201cdeed plot\u201d of Sideros, entered into evidence as a joint exhibit. The plot was prepared by Larry J. McKenzie, appellant\u2019s expert, in 1986. The parties also entered as a joint exhibit a survey prepared by McKenzie in 1998, which identified appellant\u2019s proposed locations of Wolf Pen, Hornet\u2019s Nest, and the third tract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After examining that survey, Plummer testified that all three tracts were situated within the area of the Sideros patent. In Plummer\u2019s view, however, Wolf Pen could not be located where it is described on the 1998 McKenzie plat, because Wolf Pen\u2019s location on McKenzie\u2019s survey does not correspond to the twentieth, twenty-first and twenty-second lines of \u201cSugar Creek Camp.\u201d The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE: As shown on this map that Mr. McKenzie ... Wolf Pen being down here as identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>on the map ... do you agree as a surveyor to a reasonable degree of certainty used in your trade or profession that Wolf Pen is located right here where it\u2019s shown in this map?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">PLUMMER: No sir, I could not say so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE: Okay. Is it your testimony then that Wolf Pen cannot be located where it\u2019s located here based on the patent metes and bounds descriptions that you\u2019re aware of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">PLUMMER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\u2756 <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE: Again in the [Wolf Pen] patent itself it says the beginning point runs then with the lines of Sugar Creek Camp?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">PLUMMER: It says adjacent to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">COUNSEL FOR APPELLEE: Lines twenty, twenty-one, and twenty-two as drawn. Then the obvious question, Is Wolf Pen as shown on this map adjacent to lines twenty, twenty-one, and twenty-two?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">PLUMMER: No sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">\n<em>Porter\u2019s Record Title to \u201cHornet\u2019s Nest\u201d and \u201cWolf Pen\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Appellant obtained a deed to Wolf Pen and Hornet\u2019s Nest in 1968. He asserts that Hornet\u2019s Nest and Wolf Pen were both part of the \u201cRobinette Farm,\u201d which his direct predecessor in title acquired by deed in 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">Hornet\u2019s Nest was originally patented to Thomas Beall of Samuel in 1795. Thus, the patent for Hornet\u2019s Nest pre-dated the patent for Sideros. On December 31, 1796, Beall conveyed the property to Isaac Walton. On April 30, 1831, appellant contends that the tract was conveyed from William Wilson, who had inherited it from Walton, to Nathan Robi-nette.</p>\n<p id=\"pABt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Wolf Pen was patented to Amos Robinette in 1841. A certified copy of the patent was introduced at trial as a joint exhibit. The patent provides, in its entirety:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">Know ye that whereas Amos Robinett<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> of Allegany County has surveyed and laid out for him a tract or parcel of land called \u201cWolf Pen\u201d, lying in the County aforesaid, and containing seventy one acres, by virtue of thirty-three acres, part of a common warrant for fifty-three acres, obtained by him the tenth day of January Eighteen hundred and thirty nine, as appears, as he having fully compensated for said land according to law, the State of Maryland doth therefore hereby.grant unto him the said Amos Robinett the said land called \u201cWolf Pen\u201d, lying in Allegany County, aforesaid, beginning at a bounded white oak, standing on the north side of the Wolf Pen Ridge, and south thirty degrees east about fifty perches<footnotemark>[10]</footnotemark> from Town Creek, and running thence, south eleven degrees west twenty three perches, south seventy three degrees east thirty two perches, south sixty degrees east thirty two perches, south sixty degrees east twenty perches, south eighty degrees east forty six perches, south forty eight degrees east forty perches, to three black oak saplings, growing from one stump and marked with three notches each, north thirty four degrees east twenty eight perches, south sixty two degrees east twenty perches, north fifty eight degrees east forty perches, to the centre between a hickory and white oak marked with six notches each standing at the head of a hollow, north forty-five degrees west fifty perches, north twenty seven degrees west twenty eight perches, north sixty degrees west forty six perches, north seventeen degrees west eighty five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>perches, to a white oak marked with six notches, south sixty five degrees west thirty eight and one half perches, to two pines marked with six notches each, south thirty six degrees east sixty six perches, south fifteen degrees east fifty two perches, to a white oak marked with six notches, south twenty degrees west twenty eight perches, west twenty seven perches, north sixty degrees west thirty eight perches, north forty five degrees west thirty four perches, to a chestnut oak marked with six notches, then by a straight line to the beginning containing seventy one acres, <em>according to the certificate of survey thereof taken and returned into the Western Short Land Office bearing date the eighteenth day of December Eighteen hundred and twenty nine, </em>and there remaining together with all rights, profits, benefits and privileges therewith belonging, to have and to hold the same unto him the said Amos Robinett, his heirs and assigns forever, given under the great seal of the State of Maryland this twenty fifth day of March, Eighteen hundred and forty one.

Brown\u2019s survey provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">By virtue of thirty three acres, part of a Common Warrant for fifty three acres, granted out of the Land Office for the Western Shore to Amos Robinett of Allegany County bearing date the tenth day of January Eighteen Hundred and Twenty Nine, which said part was by [illegible], and the nineteenth day of February Eighteen Hundred and Twenty Nine, located for the said Amos Robinett, in a Book kept by me <em>for the purpose of adjoining the twentieth, twenty first and twenty second lines of a Tract of land called \u201cSugar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>Tree </em>Camps\u201d<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark> <em>surveyed for John [illegible] Jones, and extending from said lines east for quantity.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In 1905, George W. Robinette, an heir of Amos Robinette, initiated a complaint against his co-heirs to partition the Robinette Farm. By deed dated March 20,1906, court appointed trustees of the disputed property conveyed the Robinette farm to Frank Troutman. The deed provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">WHEREAS, by a decree of the Circuit Court for Allegany County, bearing date May 10th, 1905, and passed in a case in said Court depending, Whereas George W.

Bible, who, in turn, conveyed it to Robert B. Lawrence on November 2, 1912. By deed dated February 24, 1920, Lawrence conveyed the property to Omar Vance. On December 2, 1944, Omar Vance conveyed the property to Ora Vance. Thereafter, on June 12, 1968, Ora Vance conveyed the property to Charles and Charlotte Burgess. Appellant acquired his interest from the Burgesses by deed filed and recorded on June 14, 1968. The \u201cFIRST PARCEL\u201d conveyed in the deed is described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">FIRST PARCEL: ALL that tract or parcel of land containing 2621/2 acres of land more or less, situated on Town Creek near Flintstone, Allegany County, Maryland and comprising five (5) tracts of land known as \u201cCrabtree Folly\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>a tract of land called \u201cRose\u201d, <em>and a tract of land called \u201cWolf Pen\u201d, a tract of land called \u201cHornet\u2019s Nest\u201d, </em>all of which tracts and parcels of land herein conveyed are particularly and fully described in the deed from J.W.

McKenzie testified as an expert witness for Porter. His survey of the property, previously disputed by Plummer, placed Wolf Pen to the southeast of Hornet\u2019s Nest, with the western edge abutting a small portion of \u201cContention, 1st Part.\u201d McKenzie stated that his survey located several of the corners described in the Wolf Pen patent. He described finding the stone pile between a hickory and a white pine, which was described as the starting point of the eighth line in the Wolf Pen patent. McKenzie also explained that \u201cthe patent called for seventy one acres and we came up with 70.83.\u201d According to McKenzie\u2019s survey, Wolf Pen intersects but does not join the twentieth, twenty first, and twenty second line of \u201cSugar Creek Camp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>Adverse Possession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Appellant presented various witnesses at trial in support of his claim of title to all three tracts by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Bernard Zlomack, a forester with the Department of Natural Resources (\u201cDNR\u201d), testified that in 1969 Porter implemented a Forest Recourse Management Plan in which the DNR helped Porter manage the land according to guidelines established by Porter. Zlomack testified that Porter\u2019s objectives for his property were to manage wildlife and timber. As part of the plan, the DNR assisted Porter in the removal, harvest, and planting of trees on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Paul Smith, a logger, testified that in 1970 or 1971, he thinned trees for Porter in an area identified by the DNR as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u201cCircle 11\u201d. It is adjacent to Trespass Road, on the tract of land called \u201cContention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Harry Hartman, also a forester with the DNR, testified that he had personal knowledge of a thirty-six inch white oak tree and a rock pile on the north slope of the mountain. He testified that a thirty-six inch white oak is approximately two-hundred years old.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Porter testified that, in 1972, he commissioned a perimeter survey of the area. In addition, in 1973 he extended an existing road from his home to another road traversing the property called \u201cTresspass Road.\u201d Porter opened the road because the only other means of egress from Porter\u2019s property crossed a stream and was impassable when the water was high. The new road crossed portions of Wolf Pen as well as the third tract. Porter also testified that he has \u201cnever spoken to [appellee] in the thirty years [Porter has] had the property. Nobody ever said one word to [him] or complained about the boundary lines or anything____\u201d Furthermore, he testified that no one used the property for recreational purposes without his permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Ms. Schaffer also produced witnesses in support of her adverse possession claim. John Trivett testified that in the early 1950\u2019s, before he entered military service in 1958, he cut timber for Ms. Schaffer north and south of Trespass Road. Harry Moyer, who was raised on Polish Mountain, testified that Harry Yonkers employed him in the early 1950\u2019s to cut timber north and south of Trespass Road. Keith Price testified that he helped Ms. Schaffer post signs on the disputed property beginning in the early 1950\u2019s. He also testified that he has seen some signs in the past \u201cthree or four years\u201d with Porter\u2019s name on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">Appellee, who graduated from law school in 1942, testified that she has spent most of her life on Polish Mountain. She moved there originally in 1922 when her father purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Sideros. Her residence was interrupted only by a four-year period in which she lived in England, and a brief time in the Philippines in 1959. Further, she testified that she has paid taxes on the property since she acquired an interest in it in 1945. In support of her assertion, appellee furnished tax bills in the name of appellee or her father dating from 1945 to the date of trial. Even when abroad, she stated that she mailed a signed check to the tax office in Elizabeth, Maryland; employees at the tax office \u201cfigured it up, filled it out, and paid [the taxes].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Ruling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">On August 1, 1998, the court granted Ms. Schaffer\u2019s complaint to quiet title. The order stated: \u201cThe Court determines that Plaintiff has superior record title to the property in dispute and that the defendant has failed to establish his claim of adverse possession.\u201d A written opinion filed with the order explained the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court found that \u201cthe credible evidence, including the testimony of the parties\u2019 respective surveyors, establishes that the disputed acreage is within the original metes and bounds description of \u2018Sideros.\u2019 There is no evidence that Plaintiff or her predecessor in title conveyed any portion of \u2018Sideros\u2019 to Defendant or his predecessors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The court then examined the record title claims of appellant to Wolf Pen and Hornet\u2019s Nest. Regarding Wolf Pen, the court found that even though the original patent to Wolf Pen pre-dates the patent to Sideros, appellant failed to \u201cestablish the location of Wolf Pen\u2019 in relation to the disputed parcel.\u201d \u00a1 The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">The original warrant of resurvey indicates the parcel adjoins Lines 20, 21 and 22 of a patent known as \u201cSugar Tree Camp\u201d. The surveyors for both parties agree as to the location of \u201cSugar Tree Camp\u201d. As plotted by the Defendant, \u201cWolf Pen\u201d is not adjacent to these lines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">Similarly, the patent of \u201cWolf Pen\u201d notes its beginning point to be on the \u201c... north side of Wolf Penn Ridge- and South thirty degrees East about Fifty perches from Town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Creek.\u201d With a perch equalling approximately 16.5 feet, this would cause the beginning point to be approximately 825 feet from the identified creek. In contrast, the Defendant identifies the beginning point of \u201cWolf Pen\u201d as being approximately 4500 feet east of the creek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">Further, the Defendant places \u201cWolf Pen\u201d as adjoining yet another patent identified as \u201cContention\u201d. The parties agree as to the location of \u201cContention\u201d, which was surveyed in 1795. The original patent of \u201cWolf Pen\u201d makes no reference to \u201cContention\u201d or to any other patent other than \u201cSugar Tree Camp.\u201d In summary, while the patent \u201cWolf Pen\u201d is senior to \u201cSideros,\u201d the Defendant has failed to establish with any reasonable degree of certainty its location. It may or may not be within the disputed area. Therefore, Defendant\u2019s claim based on his record title must fail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The court also concluded that the 1906 deed purporting to convey Hornet\u2019s Nest to Frank Troutman, Porter\u2019s predecessor in title, could not have done so, because Hornet\u2019s Nest had never been conveyed to Amos Robinette or his heirs. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">Defendant\u2019s record claim to \u201cHornet\u2019s Nest\u201d is predicated on a deed from Trustees appointed in the partition sale of the Amos Robinette Farm (No. 5652 Equity) in 1906. However, a review of that proceeding includes testimony from the Plaintiff, George W. Robinette, recorded on April 19, 1905. He was questioned regarding the property included in the farm in the following exchange:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">Q. What tracts belong to the farm you have mentioned not mentioned in the will of Amos Robinette, which were acquired as part of said farm not through will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">A. Contention, Rose, <em>he bought Hornet\u2019s Nest at Trustee\u2019s sale but never got any deed for it </em>he took up Wolf Pen. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Since \u201cHornet\u2019s Nest\u201d was never conveyed to Amos Robi-nette or his heirs, the record title to the Defendant is incomplete and inferior to the title of the Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>After considering Porter\u2019s claim of adverse possession, the court found that defendant\u2019s \u201cacts of dominion on the tract\u201d were not \u201csufficiently pronounced and continuous in nature to charge the record owner with notice that an adverse claim to the property was being asserted.\u201d The court also determined that \u201c[t]he property is unfenced and without a visible line of demarcation from other parcels.\u201d The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aap-dedup-0\">Evidence of posting is somewhat unclear. The Defendant testified he has posted the perimeter with no trespassing signs. However, another defense witness indicated he helped the Defendant in posting signs, but not in the area in dispute. He described the posting taking place in other portions of Defendant\u2019s property. Further, Plaintiff disputes that Defendant posted in the disputed area and insists she has, in fact, erected no trespass notices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In addition, the court found that Ms. Schaffer has paid taxes on the property since 1922. Further, the court rejected Porter\u2019s claim that his implementation of the DNR Forest Resource Management Plan established an adverse use. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">Defendant produced evidence that for a number of years he has placed his farm, including the tract in question, in a woodland management program with the State of Maryland. The primary objectives were to provide a wildlife habitat and to improve the timber stand. As part of that plan, approximately 11,000 trees were planted in 1970. However, it appears these trees were planted in a field belonging to the Defendant which is not part of the property in dispute. As a further part of the program, trees were identified by a forester for select cutting. These were, in fact, cut by the Defendant during the 1970\u2019s. This involved approximately 100 trees in an area of approximately five acres. Some of this acreage was in the disputed area, but some was in other property belonging to the Defendant. The exact locations of this cutting was not established. Such cutting in an unenclosed area does not establish adverse possession to a tract of over 200 acres. See, <em>Malone v. Long, </em>128 Md. 377, 97 A. 643.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>On November 10, 1997, the court denied Porter\u2019s motion to alter or amend judgment.

Any person who appears of record, or claims to have a hostile outstanding right, shall be made a defendant in the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The purpose of an action to quiet title is to \u201cprotect the owner of legal title \u2018from being disturbed in his possession and from being harassed by suits in regard to his title by persons setting up unjust and illegal pretensions----\u2019 \u201d <em>Wathen v. Brown, </em>48 Md.App. 655, 658, 429 A.2d 292 (1981)(quoting <em>Textor v. Shipley, </em>77 Md. 473, 475, 26 A. 1019 (1893)). In pressing such a claim, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing both possession and legal title by \u201cclear proof.\u201d <em>Stewart v. May, </em>111 Md. 162, 173, 73 A. 460 (1909); <em>see Polk v. Pendleton, </em>31 Md. 118, 124 (1869)(stating that the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>must prove \u201cclear legal and equitable title to land connected with possession\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">A helpful notation in 65 Am.Jur.2d <em>Quieting Title </em>(1972 &amp; Supp.1998) describes the various burdens of proof that traditionally apply to a quiet title action. The notation states, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00a7 78 Complainant\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">In a quiet title action, or a proceeding to remove a cloud from title, the burden of proof rests with the complainant as to all issues which arise upon essential allegations of his complaint. He must prove title in himself if the answer denies his title or if the defendant claims title adversely.... Complainant in a quiet title action must present clear or satisfactory proof of title to be entitled to relief; if the showing in this respect leaves judicial conscience in doubt, relief will be denied. As frequently stated, the complainant\u2019s right to relief depends upon the strength of his own title, not upon the weakness of the title of his opponent. Thus, it has been said that a plaintiff has no interest in land if he himself does not own it, and that whomever the court determines to be the true owner is of no concern to him. Having failed to establish title in himself, he cannot complain of insufficiency of the evidence upon which the court adjudged title to be in the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00a7 79 Defendant\u2019s burden of proof</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">Where a defendant, in an action to quiet title, substantially asserts and relies upon a fact as an affirmative issue, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>must establish such fact. The burden rests upon the defendant to establish a title which he has set up to defeat the complainant\u2019s claim of ownership____ A patent, which is the highest evidence of title, is prima facie valid, and if its validity can be attacked at all, the burden of proof is upon the defendant to show how the patents were faulty or incomplete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">(Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">With regard to a claim based on record title, the statute requires that the plaintiff show, at a minimum, \u201ccolor of title.\u201d \u201cColor of title\u201d denotes \u201cthat which in appearance is title, but which in reality is not good and sufficient title.\u201d <em>Gore v. Hall, </em>206 Md. 485, 490, 112 A.2d 675 (1955). In order for title based on a deed to \u201cgive color,\u201d it must be \u201cso far <em>prima facie </em>good in appearance as to be consistent with the idea of good faith on the part of the party entering under it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490-91, 112 A.2d 675. In <em>Spicer v. Gore, </em>219 Md. 469, 476, 150 A.2d 226 (1959), the Court defined \u201ccolor of title\u201d as \u201ctitle papers good enough in appearance and ostensible effect to give [the party claiming title] the right to the bona fide belief they held that they owned the land.\u201d <em>See also Baker v. Swan\u2019s Lessee, </em>32 Md. 355, 358 (1870).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">With these principles in mind, we turn to consider the court\u2019s analysis of the record title claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">I. Record Title Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">A. Wolf Pen</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">The court concluded that the patent for Wolf Pen was issued prior to the patent for Sideros. Therefore, appellant\u2019s record title claim to Wolf Pen ordinarily would be superior to appellee\u2019s, because a patent gives title by relation to the date of the surveyor\u2019s certificate. <em>Smith\u2019s Lessee v. Devecmon, </em>30 Md. 473 (1869); <em>Steyer v. Hoye, </em>12 G. &amp; J. 202 (1841); <em>Eckhart, </em>25 Md.App. at 617-19, 337 A.2d 150. Nevertheless, the court concluded that Ms. Schaffer\u2019s claim to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>land was superior to appellant\u2019s claim, because Porter \u201cfailed to establish the location of \u2018Wolf Pen\u2019 in relation to the disputed parcel.\u201d In reaching its conclusion, the court focused on inconsistencies between the survey prepared by McKenzie, appellant\u2019s expert, and the description found in the 1841 patent and the 1829 survey upon which the patent was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">As the court interpreted the 1829 survey, Wolf Pen was intended to lie parallel to the 20th, 21st and 22nd lines of \u201cSugar Tree Camp.\u201d But the McKenzie survey situated Wolf Pen so that it intersected a line of Sugar Tree Camp; the survey did not show Wolf Pen as parallel to it. Moreover, the court noted several other discrepancies between the McKenzie survey and the 1841 patent. For example, McKenzie placed Wolf Pen adjacent to the parcel named \u201cContention.\u201d Yet the 1841 patent did not mention \u201cContention\u201d, although \u201cContention\u201d was known at that time. The court also observed that the 1841 patent began its metes and bounds description of Wolf Pen at a point fifty perches (i.e., 825 feet) from Town Creek. At trial, appellant testified that Town Creek was located considerably farther from Wolf Pen.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the court found appellant\u2019s evidence at odds with the 1841 patent and the 1829 survey, the court concluded that appellant \u201cfailed to establish with any degree of reasonable certainty\u201d the location of Wolf Pen.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Porter attacks the court\u2019s finding on several fronts. First, he discounts the importance of the 20th, 21st and 22 nd lines of Sugar Tree Camp. Although the preamble to the 1829 survey refers to those lines, the metes and bounds description in the 1841 patent does not. McKenzie testified that when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>patent description of Wolf Pen is actually plotted, Wolf Pen does not lie parallel to Sugar Tree Camp. In McKenzie\u2019s opinion, the reference in the survey to Sugar Tree Camp is an \u201cindependent description of the land.\u201d Therefore, it is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Appellant contends that if Wolf Pen was meant to be parallel to the lines of Sugar Tree Camp, the patent description would have described the lines of Wolf Pen as running \u201cwith\u201d the pertinent Sugar Tree Camp boundaries, or \u201cwith the lines reversed.\u201d Furthermore, appellant argues that if Wolf Pen is not located where the McKenzie survey claims, the legal descriptions of properties contiguous to Wolf Pen are jeopardized. The legal description of an adjacent tract called \u201cWest Mountain,\u201d for example, is described by reference to a stone pile at the end of the 8th line of Wolf Pen.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Additionally, appellant attacks the thoroughness of appel-lee\u2019s expert, Robert Plummer. Porter complains that Plum-mer \u201cconducted no independent survey of \u2018Sideros\u2019 or Wolf Pen\u2019 to either confirm or refute [McKenzie\u2019s] survey.\u201d Rather, his \u201cefforts were confined to computer plotting based upon the record description of the lands involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We perceive neither error nor abuse of discretion. The initial burden of proof fell on Ms. Schaffer, as the plaintiff, to show by \u201cclear proof\u2019 that she was in possession under \u201ccolor of title.\u201d She met that burden by furnishing as evidence the chain of title to Sideros, and by establishing, through expert testimony, a metes and bounds description of the Sideros patent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thereafter, the burden shifted to appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>lant to establish his title. Ultimately, the court\u2019s ruling turned on a finding of fact as to whether the McKenzie survey was accurate in its description of the disputed property. We cannot say, upon review, that the court\u2019s resolution of that factual issue was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">An integral aspect of establishing record title to real property is proving its on-the-ground location. In the early case of <em>Neel v. Hughes, </em>the Court said: \u201cEvery conveyance must either on its face, or by words of reference, give to the subject intended to be conveyed, such a description as to identify it. If it be land it must be such as to afford the means of locating it.\u201d 10 Gill <em>&amp; </em>J. 7, 10 (1838). Because appellant had the burden of proving his title, it was incumbent upon him to prove not only that he had an unbroken chain of title, but also that Wolf Pen was located in the place he claimed. Here, the court found that appellant was unable to show the contours of the parcel he claimed by virtue of the Wolf Pen patent. In finding that appellant \u201cfailed to establish with any reasonable certainty its location,\u201d the court rejected appellant\u2019s evidence regarding an essential aspect of proving title.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In this regard, the case of <em>McDonough v. Roland Park Co., </em>189 Md. 659, 57 A.2d 279 (1948), is instructive. There, an 1849 deed conveyed a tract of land located on Smith and Old Pimlico Roads in what was then Baltimore County. The deed purported to reserve from the conveyance \u201cthe graveyard situated upon said ... parcel of ground the same to be fifty feet square and to be used only as a burial place by [the grantor] and his heirs with free ingress and egress thereto at all times hereafter by [grantor] and his heirs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 57 A.2d 279. In 1947, ninety-eight years after the reservation, the Roland Park Company (\u201cThe Company\u201d) acquired the property and brought a bill to quiet title as to the reservation. The Company alleged that none of the conveyances since 1849 contained the reservation. Furthermore, the Company could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>not locate the graveyard anywhere on the property. The evidence at trial supported the Company\u2019s claim. One longtime resident of the area testified that \u201cthere was supposed to be\u201d a graveyard on the property, but as far as he knew no one had actually been buried there. <em>Id. </em>at 661, 57 A.2d 279. An heir of the original grantee testified that she \u201chad always heard her mother speak of having a graveyard left to her out m the direction of Pimlico,\u201d but she did not know where it was. <em>Id. </em>at 668, 57 A.2d 279. The Court of Appeals held that having failed to establish the location of the graveyard, the heirs of the original grantor could not benefit from the 1849 reservation. The Court said: \u201cTo hold this reservation still in effect would be to hold that any part of the 30 acres conveyed by the deed was subject to the reservation, and would cloud the title to the whole 30 acres.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665, 57 A.2d 279. <em>See also Lock v. Bennartz, </em>470 S.W.2d 801, 802 (1971)(holding that a plaintiffs attempt to quiet title failed because the plaintiff could not furnish \u201ccompetent evidence that the description in the deed includes any or all of the real estate which is admitted by the parties to be the subject of controversy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The more recent case of <em>Chappell v. Donnelly, </em>113 N.C.App. 626, 439 S.E.2d 802 (1994), also provides guidance to us. There, plaintiffs sought title to a contested strip of land adjacent to their neighbor\u2019s property. As evidence of record title, the plaintiffs offered a deed that contained a metes and bounds description of the property. The plaintiffs\u2019 expert witness attacked the metes and bounds description relied upon by the defendants, but offered no proof as to the alleged boundaries. Thereafter, the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The intermediate appellate court affirmed, noting that the \u201caspect of the plaintiffs proof ... known as \u2018putting the land on the ground\u2019 \u201d was a factual question to be determined by the finder of fact. <em>Id. </em>439 S.E.2d at 805. It reasoned that testimony of a surveyor as to the location of the boundaries on the ground is necessary because \u201c \u2018[a]s to the identity of the land ... a deed seldom, if ever, proves itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>439 S.E.2d at 805-806 (quoting <em>Seawell v. Boone\u2019s Mill Fishing Club, Inc., </em>249 N.C. 402, 106 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>S.E.2d 486, 488 (1959)). The <em>Chappell </em>court concluded that the plaintiff \u201coffered the deeds in their record title to establish ownership, but failed to tender any evidence indicating the on-the-ground location of the disputed boundary lines referenced in those deeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>439 S.E.2d at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Similarly, appellant\u2019s attempted proof of record title to a portion of Sideros is insufficient unless appellant can show, by clear proof, the on-the-ground location of Wolf Pen. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s analysis properly turned on whether, as a factual matter, the McKenzie survey accurately depicted the location of the tract described in the Wolf Pen patent. In our view, the trial court\u2019s resolution of that factual determination was consistent with established principles of survey and boundary law.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The trial court properly looked to the 1829 survey as evidence of where the original surveyor intended Wolf Pen to lie. It is a fundamental principle of boundary law that the court\u2019s paramount objective in resolving boundary disputes is to fulfill the intention of the parties to the original instrument. <em>Zawatsky Construction Co. v. Feldman Development Corp., </em>203 Md. 182, 187, 100 A.2d 269 (1953)(observing that the principles of boundary law \u201care merely guides for ascertaining the intention of the parties\u201d to the original instrument); <em>see Wood v. Hildebrand, </em>185 Md. 56, 42 A.2d 919 (1945); <em>Maryland Constr. Co. of Baltimore City v. Kuper, </em>90 Md. 529, 45 A. 197 (1900); <em>Kelso v. Stigar, </em>75 Md. 376, 24 A. 18 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The 1829 survey is quite helpful in ascertaining the intent of the 1841 grant. The survey claimed, in its preamble, that it was made \u201cfor the purpose of adjoining the twentieth, twenty first and twenty second lines of a Tract of land called \u2018Sugar Tree Camps\u2019 \u201d. The 1841 patent expressly stated that the grant was made to Robinette \u201caccording to the certificate of survey thereof taken and delivered into the Western Shore Land Office bearing date the eighteenth day of December Eighteen hundred and twenty nine.\u201d Therefore, the court determined that appellant\u2019s survey, which did not adjoin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>20th, 21st and 22 nd lines of Sugar Tree Camp, was at odds with the original patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">This result is also consistent with the commonly applied principle that \u201c[a] grant calling for a survey incorporates all matters concerning that survey as if the same were explicitly contained in the grant.\u201d Joel M. Leininger, <em>Land Surveying, </em>in BOUNDARY LAW MARYLAND 1, 34 (Edward J. Gilliss et al., 1996); <em>see Caldwell Land and Lumber Co. v. Ervin, </em>150 N.C. 41, 63 S.E. 356, 357 (1908)(stating the \u201crule that a line actually run by the surveyor, which was marked and a corner made, entitles the party claiming under the patent or deed to hold accordingly, notwithstanding a mistaken description of the land in the deed, <em>presupposes that the patent or deed is made in pursuance of the survey, and that the line which was marked and the comer which was made were adopted and acted upon in making the patent or deed, and therefore gives them controlling effect\u201d) </em>(Emphasis added). Thus, \u201cwhere a conveyance is about to be made, and the parties go upon the land and have the line marked and surveyed, the line so fixed and intended will prevail over any inconsistent description in [a subsequent] conveyance.\u201d 11 C.J.S. <em>Boundaries </em>\u00a7 49 (1938 &amp; Supp.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We also note that, \u201c[a]s a general canon of boundary law, it is well-settled that a call to an adjoining boundary takes precedence over a metes and bounds description in the same instrument.\u201d <em>Ski Roundtop, Inc. v. Wagerman, </em>79 Md.App. 357, 367, 556 A.2d 1144 (1989).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Therefore, as between a modern survey that is consistent with a call to an adjoining boundary and one consistent with the metes and bounds description but at odds with the adjoining boundary, the one faithful to the adjoining boundary ordinarily controls. As we see it, the 1829 survey makes clear that the metes and bounds description of the 1841 patent was intended to correspond to the lines of Sugar Tree Camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Furthermore, while the law generally prefers a line retraced according to natural monuments, such as a tree or an identifiable rock, <em>Delphey v. Savage, </em>227 Md. 373, 378, 177 A.2d 249 (1962), Maryland courts have recognized that \u201c[t]he line of an adjacent tract, if known and established, may as well be a call in a deed as a natural object.\u201d <em>Dundalk Holding Co. v. Easter, </em>195 Md. 488, 494-95, 73 A.2d 877 (1950); <em>see also Ramsay v. Butler, Purdum &amp; Co., </em>148 Md. 438, 442, 129 A. 650 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Here, the court was presented with substantial evidence that the McKenzie survey was inconsistent with other aspects of the 1841 patent, apart from Wolf Pen\u2019s relationship to Sugar Tree Camp. The patent description began at \u201ca bounded white oak standing on the north side of Wolf Pen Ridge and South Thirty Degrees East about Fifty perches from Town Creek.\u201d Even if, as appellant contends, his testimony placed Wolf Pen some 500 to 600 yards from Town Creek, rather than 4500 feet, the closest point was certainly farther than the 825 feet called for in the patent description. In addition, the McKenzie survey begins from a point in a ravine on the western edge of Wolf Pen, not at a bounded white oak on the Wolf Pen Ridge, as called for in the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We are also unpersuaded by appellant\u2019s criticism of appellee\u2019s expert. Plummer testified that he was a licensed surveyor in Allegany County who had visited the site and researched the various metes and bounds descriptions in the original patents at issue. He was admitted without objection as an expert surveyor. In a non-jury case, matters involving the credibility of witnesses and conflicts in the evidence are firmly within the purview of the trial judge, sitting as the trier of fact. <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>324 Md. 551, 567, 597 A.2d 1359 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 1007, 112 S.Ct. 1765, 118 L.Ed.2d 427 (1992); <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 112, 472 A.2d 953, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 873, 105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155 (1984); <em>Troy v. Hart, </em>116 Md.App. 468, 475, 697 A.2d 113, <em>cert. denied, </em>347 Md. 255, 700 A.2d 1215 (1997); <em>Weisman v. Connors, </em>76 Md.App. 488, 500, 547 A.2d 636 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>314 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>497, 551 A.2d 868 (1989). This rule applies with equal force to the testimony of an expert. As the trier of fact, the court was entitled to give Plummer\u2019s testimony the weight and value the court believed it should have. Our role is not to substitute our judgment for that' of the court, unless the court\u2019s factual findings are clearly erroneous. <em>See Gwynn v. Oursler, </em>122 Md.App. 493, 502, 712 A.2d 1072, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 662, 719 A.2d 1262 (1998); <em>Oliver v. Hays, </em>121 Md.App. 292, 306, 708 A.2d 1140 (1998). Thus, the court was entitled to credit Plummer\u2019s testimony that Wolf Pen was not located where it was shown in the McKenzie plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In sum, the evidence adduced at trial supported the court\u2019s conclusion that appellant failed to identify Wolf Pen\u2019s on-the-ground location within Sideros, and that appellant failed to meet his burden of proving superior record title to the Wolf Pen tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">B. Hornet\u2019s Nest</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in placing upon him the burden of proving title to Hornet\u2019s Nest. As we noted, Ms. Schaffer introduced evidence of a direct chain of title to the 1845 patent of Sideros. She also introduced evidence that convinced the court that Hornet\u2019s Nest was within the territory defined by the Sideros patent. Appellant, for his part, traced title through Robinette to a 1795 patent of Hornet\u2019s Nest issued to Thomas Beall of Samuel. Because the court found that Hornet\u2019s Nest was never conveyed to Amos Robinette, one of appellant\u2019s predecessors in title, it concluded that appellant\u2019s title to the parcel was \u201cincomplete and inferior to the title of Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Appellant offers no argument to rehabilitate his own record title. Rather, he attacks the court\u2019s decision to quiet title in appellee, relying on the maxim that the plaintiff in a quiet title action \u201cmust recover, if at all, upon the strength of his own title, and not by reason of the weakness of that of the defendant____\u201d <em>Joseph v. Bonaparte, </em>118 Md. 591, 593, 85 A. 962 (1912). Thus, appellant contends that even if he is not entitled to Hornet\u2019s Nest, neither is Ms. Schaffer, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Thomas Beall patent predates the Sideros patent. Appellant states: \u201cProving that Appellant does not have good legal title is of no benefit to Appellee who has the affirmative duty to prove her own title.\u201d If appellant\u2019s position is correct, the court below should have refused to quiet title in either party, unless it found that one or the other proved title by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Although appellant\u2019s argument is cast in terms of burdens of proof, we perceive another fundamental issue: In adjudicating an action to quiet title, is the court called upon to decide, as between the parties, who has the better title? Or, is the court to refrain from quieting title in either party unless one demonstrates title as against all the world? Stated otherwise, was the court below correct in quieting title in appellee despite evidence, presented by appellant <em>after </em>appellee had established <em>prima facie </em>title, that an unidentified third party may have superior title by virtue of a previous patent?</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In support of his position, appellant refers us to canons of ejectment law, as articulated in <em>Joseph v. Bonaparte, </em>118 Md. 591, 593-94, 85 A. 962 (1912). There, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">Unless the plaintiff in ejectment shows a legal title and a right to possession, not barred by the statute of limitations, he cannot recover in ejectment under the settled law of this state, no matter what may be the rule in other jurisdictions. In 1 Poe, PI. &amp; Prac. (4th Ed.) \u00a7 260 it is said: Three leading rules are enforced in the trial of ejectment causes: <em>First, the plaintiff cannot recover upon simply proving that his title is stronger or less defective than that of the defendant; </em>nor is it enough for him to show that the defendant had no title whatever, or not so good a one as his own, for the decision of the case does not turn upon any such comparison. He must recover, if at all, upon the strength of his own title, and not by reason of the weakness of that of the defendant, and therefore the defendant may always defeat the action by proof of a clear subsisting title in a stranger. This has always been an established principle of ejectment law in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>If \u201ctitle subsisting in a stranger\u201d defeats an action to quiet title, as it does an action in ejectment, we would agree with appellant that the court erred in quieting title in Ms. Schaffer. Evidence of the prior patent of Hornet\u2019s Nest casts some doubt as to whether the 1845 patent to Sideros conveyed Hornet\u2019s Nest. In our view, however, appellant\u2019s argument fails to take into account the difference between an action in ejectment and an action to quiet title.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Although we have not uncovered a Maryland case directly addressing the issue, the rule in other jurisdictions is that \u201c \u2018a bill to quiet title may not be defeated by showing that the plaintiff\u2019s interest, otherwise sufficient to support the bill, is subject to possibly superior rights in third persons not parties to the suit ... It is enough that the interest asserted by the plaintiff in possession of land is superior to that of those who are parties defendant.\u2019\u201d <em>Sheldon v. Moyer, </em>210 N.W.2d 597, 599 (Iowa 1973) (quoting <em>United States v. Oregon, </em>295 U.S. 1, 24-25, 55 S.Ct. 610, 79 L.Ed. 1267 (1935)). This is in contrast to the rule in ejectment. In Fitch\u2019s treatise, we find the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">The possession which confers jurisdiction in [an action to quiet title] must have been acquired in a lawful way, though the complainant is not bound to show a perfect title as against all the world, <em>as is the case \u00f3f one seeking to recover possession.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Logan D. Fitch, 2 <em>Abstracts and Titles to Real Property </em>\u00a7 517 (1954)(footnotes omitted)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Similarly, in <em>Moore v. Barker, </em>186 Okla. 312, 97 P.2d 776, 779 (1939), the Supreme Court of Oklahoma stated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">It is the prevailing rule in this jurisdiction that in a statutory action to quiet title, plaintiff must recover, if at all, upon the strength of his own title, and not on the weakness of his adversary\u2019s claim. <em>It is not necessary that the plaintiff have title paramount to all others, but he must at least have some interest in title and that interest must be paramount to the claim of his adversary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>(citations omitted)(emphasis added). <em>See also Rucker v. Dooley, </em>49 Ill. 377 (Ill.1868)(stating that \u201cWe do not understand that a plaintiff in a suit to quiet title is bound to show a perfect title as against all the world, <em>as in the case of a party seeking to recover </em>possession.\u201d) (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We believe the rule articulated in the foregoing authorities appropriately reflects the difference between an action in ejectment and an action to quiet title. Historically, quiet title was an equitable remedy, whereas ejectment was a remedy at law. Prior to the merger of law and equity in 1984, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 2-301, plaintiffs were required to determine, as a matter of pleading, whether to proceed in equity or law. The fundamental difference between the two was the question of possession. The \u201cground of equity jurisdiction\u201d in a bill <em>quia timet </em>was the fact of actual or constructive possession. <em>Barnes v. Webster, </em>220 Md. 473, 475, 154 A.2d 918 (1959); <em>see Thomas v. Hardisty, </em>217 Md. 523, 529, 143 A.2d 618 (1958); <em>Textor v. Shipley, </em>77 Md. 473, 475, 26 A. 1019 (1893). Thus, when an owner was not in possession, a bill <em>quia timet </em>would not lie, because the owner could resort to the legal remedy of ejectment. <em>See Glorius v. Watkins, </em>203 Md. 546, 549, 102 A.2d 274 (1954)(rejecting equity jurisdiction because the plaintiff was not in possession, stating: \u201cEquity entertains jurisdiction where, although the complainant fears vexatious litigation due to a cloud on his title, he nevertheless cannot sue in ejectment because he is already in possession.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Possession by the putative owner continues to be a distinguishing feature of an action to quiet title. In 1955, the Legislature enacted Md.Code (1951, 1955 Repl.Vol.), Art. 16 \u00a7 128, the predecessor to the current quiet title provision, now found in R.P. \u00a7 14-108. <em>See </em>1955 Md. Laws, Chap. 376. Real Property \u00a7 14-108 requires a claimant to prove \u201cactual peaceable possession of property\u201d or, in the case of wild lands, \u201cconstructive and peaceable possession of it.\u201d R.P. \u00a7 14-108(a). Ejectment actions involving tenant-landlord disputes and remedies for unlawful possession of the premises after the delivery of a deed were placed in the original jurisdiction of the district court. <em>See </em>R.P. \u00a7 8-402 through \u00a7 8-402.2; R.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u00a7 14-109. In all other cases, \u201ca person who is not in possession of property and claims title and right to possession\u201d may bring an action for ejectment in the circuit court, pursuant to R.P. \u00a7 14-108.1. Nevertheless, in <em>Thomas v. Hardisty, supra, </em>217 Md. at 530, 143 A.2d 618, the Court of Appeals made clear that the quiet title statute did not \u201cderogate or in any way conflict ] with\u201d the \u201cfirmly established\u201d jurisdictional divide between quiet title and ejectment. <em>See Romney v. Steinem, </em>228 Md. 605, 608, 180 A.2d 873 (1962); <em>Cherry v. Siegert, </em>215 Md. 81, 85, 136 A.2d 754 (1957)(stating that the 1955 statute was \u201cmerely declaratory of the law as it existed prior to June 1,1955\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Possession is relevant to a discussion of the burdens of proof in the following sense. In an action in ejectment, it is the defendant who has possession. A possessor should not be ousted by one whose title is weakened by the claim of a third party, because as between a possessor-defendant and the person seeking ejectment, the possessor has a stake in the property, by virtue of his possession, which outweighs the stake of a non-possessing plaintiff whose title is inferior to that of a third party. In a quiet title action, however, the plaintiff, and not the defendant, must prove possession and a legal claim to title <em>before </em>the burden is shifted to the defendant to establish superior title. Therefore, unlike an action in ejectment, the defendant in a quiet title action who cannot establish his own record title has no basis to complain about the strength of the plaintiffs title, even if a third party may have a superior record title claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">To be sure, a plaintiff must establish, as part of a <em>prima facie </em>case, the legal right to possession, either by \u201ccolor or title or claim of right by reason of his or his predecessor\u2019s adverse possession for the statutory period.\u201d R.P. \u00a7 14-108(a). Here, appellee met that burden. She established a direct chain of title to a State patent that purported to convey the land at issue. Thereafter, appellant sought to prove his record title, but he was unable to do so to the court\u2019s satisfaction. Significantly, Porter does not challenge the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>determination as to his own title in the property. Rather, he contends that his evidence concerning the 1795 patent to Thomas Beall should have prompted the court to shift the burden of proof back to Ms. Schaffer, to show that her claim is superior to whomever may legitimately boast title by virtue of the 1795 patent. To shift the burden in this way would require appellee to prove title as against an unidentified person who has not appeared to defend his or her rights as against appellee. Because appellant has not met his burden of proof, the relative strength of appellee\u2019s title as against the rest of the world is of no concern to him. Therefore, the trial court was correct in its application of the burdens of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with the view that \u201cactions to quiet title should not be hampered by needless anomalies, and that the marketability of title should be encouraged and protected whenever it is possible under the law.\u201d <em>Peruzzi Bros., Inc. v. Contee, </em>72 Md.App. 118, 129, 527 A.2d 821 (1987)(citing <em>Cherry v. Siegert, </em>215 Md. 81, 136 A.2d 754 (1957)). The war of paper concerning the Cat\u00f3n lands has continued for decades. Appellant urges that title may not be quieted in Hornet\u2019s Nest because of a possible claim by an unidentified third party who has not stepped forward to assert his right. In our view, that is not a basis to deny appellee\u2019s request to quiet title as to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Ms. Schaffer\u2019s established title in Sideros was sufficient to justify the court\u2019s conclusion regarding record title. Therefore, we turn to consider appellant\u2019s adverse possession claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">II. Adverse Possession</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Appellant challenges the court\u2019s finding regarding adverse possession. In our view, the trial court was neither clearly erroneous nor legally incorrect in concluding that appellant had not shown \u201cactual, open, [and] notorious\u201d possession of the property. <em>Barchowsky v. Silver Farms, Inc., </em>105 Md.App. 228, 241, 659 A.2d 347, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 301, 666 A.2d 1236 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>In order to establish title by adverse possession, \u201ca claimant must show continuous possession of the property for 20 years in an actual, open, notorious, exclusive, and hostile manner, under claim of title or ownership.\u201d <em>Barchowsky, </em>105 Md.App. at 241, 659 A.2d 347; <em>see Costello v. Staubitz, </em>300 Md. 60, 67, 475 A.2d 1185 (1984); <em>East Washington Railway Co. v. Brooke, </em>244 Md. 287, 294, 223 A.2d 599 (1966); <em>Goen v. Sansbury, </em>219 Md. 289, 295, 149 A.2d 17 (1959); <em>Miceli v. Foley, </em>83 Md.App. 541, 552, 575 A.2d 1249 (1990). In evaluating a claim, the pertinent inquiry is whether the claimant has proved the elements \u201cbased on the claimant\u2019s \u2018objective manifestation\u2019 of adverse use, rather than on the claimant\u2019s subjective intent.\u201d <em>Barchowsky, </em>105 Md.App. at 241, 659 A.2d 347 (quoting <em>Miceli, </em>83 Md.App. at 552, 575 A.2d 1249). Moreover, the claimant bears the burden of proof. <em>Costello, </em>300 Md. at 67, 475 A.2d 1185; <em>see Hungerford v. Hungerford, </em>234 Md. 338, 340, 199 A.2d 209 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s claim because, in its view, appellant failed to show that \u201chis possessory acts of dominion on the tract were sufficiently pronounced and continuous in nature to charge the record owner with notice that an adverse claim to the property was being asserted.\u201d The court focused on three aspects of appellant\u2019s proof. First, the court discounted appellant\u2019s claim that he had posted no trespassing signs on the property. The court noted that \u201cthe property is unfenced and without a visible line of demarcation from other parcels\u201d and that another defense witness testified that much of Porter\u2019s posting occurred on other portions of appellant\u2019s property, not the area in dispute. Moreover, the court credited Ms. Schaffer\u2019s testimony that she erected no-trespassing signs on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The court also rejected appellant\u2019s contention that open and notorious possession was established by the inclusion of the disputed property in a woodland management program. The court found that the trees planted as part of the management program were planted on a field belonging to Porter that was not part of the contested land. Furthermore, the court found that the approximately 100 trees felled as part of the program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>were confined to a small five-acre area, only part of which was located in the disputed territory. Relying on <em>Malone v. Long, </em>128 Md. 377, 97 A. 643 (1916), the court concluded that \u201c[s]uch cutting in an unenclosed area does not establish adverse possession to a tract of over 200 acres.\u201d The court also considered that appellee, and not Porter, had paid taxes on the property in question since 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We are mindful that adverse possession claims depend in part on the nature of the land in question. In <em>Goen v. Sansbury, supra, </em>219 Md. at 296, 149 A.2d 17, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">[I]n determining whether there has been actual possession of property, there must be considered its character and locality, and the uses and purposes for which it is naturally adapted, since possessory acts of an outlying and uncultivated piece of land may be proved by acts of ownership somewhat different from those required with regard to land under enclosure and actual cultivation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Thus, acts sufficient to demonstrate possession of wild, undeveloped forest may fall short of the activity needed to establish possession of developed property. Nevertheless, something more than \u201cmere occasional use of land\u201d is needed. <em>Barchowsky, supra, </em>105 Md.App. at 241, 659 A.2d 347. With regard to unenclosed timberland, the Court of Appeals has held that \u201cevidence of the cutting and hauling of timber therefrom is not itself sufficient, because such acts might be nothing more than successive trespasses.\u201d <em>Gore v. Hall, </em>206 Md. 485, 490, 112 A.2d 675 (1955); <em>Malone v. Long, </em>128 Md. 377, 380, 97 A. 643 (1916); <em>Peters v. Tilghman, </em>111 Md. 227, 240-41, 73 A. 726 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">As we see it, the court was entitled to conclude that appellant proved little more than the sort of \u201coccasional use\u201d described in <em>Barchowsky. </em>The court found, as a matter of fact, that the woodlands management program affected only a small portion of the land appellant claims by adverse possession. The fact that the disputed land appears in the aerial map of appellant\u2019s conservation zone is not dispositive, as very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>little tangible effort to assert dominion over the property-resulted from its inclusion in the boundaries of the DNR program.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Appellant relies on <em>Peters v. Staubitz, </em>64 Md.App. 639, 498 A.2d 661 (1985), for the proposition that \u201cthere are circumstances in which the creation of an animal sanctuary (wildlife habitat) might constitute an actual use for purposes of adverse possession.\u201d In <em>Staubitz, </em>a claimant asserted title by adverse possession to a fenced, triangular lot on the banks of the Whitehall River in Anne Arundel County. Part of the property had been developed by the claimant and contained a boat landing, boathouse, privy, and a barbecue fire pit. The rest of the land was left \u201cin its wild state as [the claimant] wished the land to be an animal sanctuary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646, 498 A.2d 661. After a non-jury trial, the court found that the claimant had established adverse possession to the entire lot. On appeal, however, this Court reversed as to the wild lands. Judge Rosalyn Bell, writing for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">The evidence ... does not support the court\u2019s finding that appellee acquired title to the remainder of the triangle where the animal sanctuary is located. Under some circumstances, a claimant\u2019s creation of an animal sanctuary might constitute an actual use for purposes of adverse possession. In this case, however, there is no evidence that appellee used the animal sanctuary. He merely allowed \u201c[a] large part of the disputed triangle ... to grow wild [because he] desires the wild nature of the ground as an animal sanctuary ...\u201d This is not sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 647, 498 A.2d 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Although we agree that use of land as an animal sanctuary <em>may, </em>in some circumstances, constitute actual possession, appellant\u2019s aspirations for the woodlands at issue here do not rise to the level contemplated by the Court\u2019s <em>dicta </em>in <em>Staubitz. </em>We are satisfied that the trial court did not err as to appellant\u2019s adverse possession claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
