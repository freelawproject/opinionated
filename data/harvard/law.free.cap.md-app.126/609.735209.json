(\u201cHoncho\u201d); Excalibur Cable Communications, Inc. (\u201cExcalibur\u201d); Maryland Cable Partners L.P. (\u201cMaryland Cable\u201d); and Byers Engineering Company (\u201cByers\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">After a motions hearing, the court determined that appel-lees were entitled to summary judgment, based on the doctrine of primary assumption of risk. From that ruling, appellant timely noted his appeal. Crews has posed one question for our consideration, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">Did appellant assume the risk of a gas explosion based on his occupation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that appellant is barred from recovery under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk, because his injury was a foreseeable risk of his occupation. Therefore, we shall affirm the trial court\u2019s order granting appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Maryland Cable retained Excalibur to install cable lines in Bowie, Maryland. Excalibur, in turn, hired Honcho to perform the necessary excavation. Hollenbach was an employee of Honcho. Prior to the excavation, Byers was retained to locate and mark the buried utility lines in the area where the digging was scheduled to occur. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1991 Repl. Vol.), Art. 78, \u00a7 28A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Hollenbach was using machinery to dig a hole in the vicinity of 11405 Trillum Lane in Bowie, he struck a natural gas line owned by Washington Gas. Apparently, neither the police nor the fire department was promptly notified about what had happened. Eventually, the fire department was notified of the situation by someone a mile and a half away, who smelled gas. More than two hours after the natural gas line was struck, Washington Gas was also notified of the leak. The incident caused the release of a large volume of natural gas that permeated the ground and necessitated the evacuation of the surrounding neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Upon notification of the occurrence, Washington Gas dispatched a crew to the site to dissipate a volatile gas leak. Appellant, a veteran gas man with over twenty years of service, was the foreman of the crew in charge of repairing the leak. Unfortunately, while appellant and his crew were at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>tempting to repair the leak, an explosion occurred, severely injuring appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In his complaint, Crews alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Hollenbach negligently \u201cshot\u201d a hole through a natural gas line (Count I); Honcho is responsible for the negligent actions of Hollenbach, its employee (Count III); Excalibur negligently hired, selected, and supervised Honcho (Counts V, VI, and VII); Excalibur had the non-delegable duty to lay cable lines in the vicinity of utility lines (Count VIII); Hollenbach, Honcho, Excalibur, and Maryland Cable are strictly liable for injuries caused by the abnormally dangerous activity of digging around public utilities (Counts X and XVI); Maryland Cable is responsible for the negligent actions of its employee-agent, Honcho (Count XI); Maryland Cable negligently selected and supervised Honcho (Counts XII and XIII); Maryland Cable had the non-delegable duty to lay cable lines in the vicinity of utility lines (Count XIV); Byers failed to use due care in marking the utility lines in the vicinity where the digging occurred (Count XVII); and the combined negligence of Hol-lenbach, Honcho, Excalibur, Maryland Cable, and Byers led to appellant\u2019s injuries (Count XIX). Additionally, Byers filed cross-claims against Hollenbach, Honcho, Excalibur, and Maryland Cable; Hollenbach and Honcho filed cross-claims against Byers; and Excalibur filed a cross-claim against Byers. We turn to explore in more detail the events that culminated in appellant\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">On November 3, 1997, Excalibur filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, alleging that appellant\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of primary assumption of risk. Maryland Cable moved for summary judgment on December 19,1997, adopting Excalibur\u2019s legal argument. The court denied Excalibur\u2019s motion to dismiss on December 17, 1997, although the order was not docketed until February 6,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Thereafter, on April 21, 1998, appellant was deposed. He acknowledged that there was a pronounced smell of gas in the area when he arrived at the scene. The following colloquy between Maryland Cable\u2019s counsel and appellant is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Q: Okay. Now, you told us earlier that there was a heavy smell of gas in the area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">A: At that particular area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">Q: Well, you mean the area that you were working?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">A: Yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">Q: Is there a point that you recognize that gas smell to be so heavy that you know that it\u2019s dangerous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">A: <em>Well, we always are taught that any type of gas leak or odor is always dangerous.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">\n<em>And we understand that.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-11\">Q: So when you smelled that heavy smell of gas that day on this job, you know that \u2014 you knew that the atmosphere was dangerous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-12\">A: Well, yeah. <em>We knew that that area that we was working in could be dangerous.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-13\">Q: Okay. And you knew that that danger included the danger that a fire would start, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-14\">A: We were aware that fire will start behind natural gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-15\">Q: Okay. And you knew that there was that two-inch plastic pipe that had the static electricity problem, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-16\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-17\">Q: And that static electricity problem you knew could cause sparks, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-18\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-19\">Q: No?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-20\">A: The only time electric \u2014 it cause [sic] sparks when you deal with the pipe itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-21\">As I stated before, that\u2019s why we have to use what they call a spray on the pipe before you put a squeeze on it, because when you squeeze the pipe off, that\u2019s when\u2014 almost gets shut off, that\u2019s when the electronic takes over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Q: How about if you get into close proximity of the pipe or touch the pipe with the metal bucket of the backhoe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">A: No, it would not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">Q: Are you sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">A: Well, I never knew it could set off like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">Q: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">A: I\u2019m not saying that it won\u2019t, but I never knew it to do that before. But, anything can set it off, gravels [sic] or rocks that hit together, hitting metal. That could set it off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">Q: For instance, the metal bucket of your backhoe stringing a rock as you were digging\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">Q: \u2014you knew that that could create a spark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">A: We knew that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-14\">Q: And you knew that if the spark occurs, you could have a fire and an explosion, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-15\">A: That\u2019s correct, but as I said before, that it have to be worked [sic], regardless. You know what I mean? It have to be repaired, [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-16\"><em>It\u2019s a chance you have to </em>\u2014 that <em>we go through. </em>Then again, [sic] there\u2019s the other exception to the rule, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-17\">Q: <em>So you know that there is this risk of fire, correct? </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-19\">A: <em>That\u2019s correct.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-20\">Q: But you also know that part of your job is accepting that risk, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-21\">A: To the circumstance, yes. But on this occasion that it happened, it didn\u2019t have to be this way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-22\">Q: What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-23\">A: Because if the person, I\u2019ll say, that dug \u2014 that did that had moved in the proper procedure their way, I wouldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>have had to have been there to get into this thing. You know what I mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">Q: All right. But once something like that had happened, regardless of the reason, <em>once damage has occurred to a gas pipe and you\u2019re called out there to make the repair as part of your job, you know that there is a risk of fire and you know that it\u2019s part of your job to accept that risk, correct? </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">A; <em>Yes. </em>I accept that responsibility when we first got hired, but there is a control of gas that we usually deal with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aaz-dedup-1\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">On April 23, 1998, Excalibur filed a \u201cSupplemental Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d Attached to its motion was a partial transcript of appellant\u2019s deposition, which it contended demonstrated that Crews \u201caccepted the risk of fire and explosion as part of his job.\u201d A motions hearing was held on April 24,1998.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">At the hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel suggested that the case concerned the issue of primary assumption of risk, in relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>to \u201cwhether the policemen and firefighter\u2019s rule applies to this case.\u201d Crews\u2019s attorney explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">[Tjhere\u2019s two types of assumption of the risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">There\u2019s assumption of the risk in the policemen and firemen\u2019s rule, which says ... if I can paraphrase it, that any time a police officer or a firefighter enters on to a premises, that police officer or firefighter can\u2019t sue the landlord for \u2014 any negligent acts that they\u2019ve done or anybody associated with the premises, for any negligent act that they\u2019ve done, even though he injures himself in the course of his duties. Because, as a matter of public policy, we will not allow him to sue____ [H]e\u2019s not an invitee. He\u2019s not a ... licensee....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">So there\u2019s this ... broad general rule upon which they are relying ... by analogy, what [appellees are arguing] is that, since a gas man has to go out and fix gas leaks that he is covered by that very broad ... rule which, it\u2019s our position, only applies to policemen and firemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">What I ... am trying to say is ... this entire issue turns on whether primary assumption of the risk applies or doesn\u2019t apply. Because in our view, ... [appellees] have not presented evidence that, in this particular case on this particular time, Mr. Crews voluntarily assumed ... this risk. Certainly, there\u2019s inherent risk in any gas leak, and that\u2019s part of [appellant\u2019s] complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">Appellant urged the court not to apply the primary assumption of risk doctrine, because it would amount to an improper extension of the so-called Fireman\u2019s Rule. Appellant\u2019s counsel explained that appellant, a civilian, primarily provided \u201cgeneral maintenance work to [the gas] lines,\u201d and thus the public policy behind the Firemen\u2019s Rule was not applicable to him. To the contrary, appellant contended that various provisions in Maryland law evidenced a clear intent to \u201cdifferentiate between police officers and firefighters and the rest of the world.\u201d Further, appellant explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>In this case we don\u2019t have ... a public official performing a duty. We have a private citizen. Who is a gas man. Who\u2019s sent by his employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">The defense is under a statutory obligation in this case to call \u201cMiss Utility\u201d and \u2014 I think the Court has heard the commercials probably a thousand times by now, to \u2014 because there is an obligation on them to avoid striking utility lines. And \u2014 so there\u2019s ... an affirmative duty placed on [appel-lees] to actually perform their job reasonably so they don\u2019t create this kind of situation. \u2756 * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">Gas men are not exposed to a risk of explosion all the time like fire and police are exposed to the numerous risks which they take. They are only exposed to risks when somebody messes up ... and damages their line, or, on very rare occasion [sic] I imagine, there\u2019s an actual breakdown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">We have special worker\u2019s compensation laws which cover and compensate in some ways for the policemen and firemen\u2019s inability to recover in tort in cases like this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Appellant also asked the court to consider the \u201crescuer doctrine.\u201d In his view, \u201ca rescuer can leave a position of safety to go into save the lives and property of others, and we will judge that person not by what a cool ... reasonably prudent person would do ... we will judge that person very leniently, based on the facts and circumstances with which he is presented at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Excalibur\u2019s counsel argued that, for the purposes of its motion, it made no difference whether one spoke of primary or secondary assumption of risk. He argued that the undisputed facts showed that, \u201con March 23, 1996, ... a man with some 20 years experience with the Washington Gas Company ... went out to repair a known gas leak. It was leaking enough for the neighborhood to be evacuated ... [and] in the process of fixing this gas leak an explosion occurred. ' He was burned. His job was to go out and fix these leaks.\u201d Further, Excalibur\u2019s counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>The case law indicates in those situations that, because the risk is inherent to the job that [appellant] ... undertook, it does not matter what various causes brought him to this particular location where he had to perform his duties. It simply means that, as long as he encounters the risk as part of his job and is injured because of that risk, he may not proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">The issue, pure and simple, is primary assumption of risk. This man assumed the risk as part of his job. The allegations of the complaint make that abundantly clear. If [we] accept them as true ... this case should be dismissed as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">According to Maryland Cable\u2019s counsel, dismissal was warranted even under a secondary assumption of risk theory. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">Mr. Crews clearly states that he knew the risk ... knew that the atmosphere in the location of the occurrence was dangerous, was heavy with gas, and he proceeded to\u2014 knowing that risk, he proceeded to excavate with a front-end loader, and a fire ensued while the location was under Mr. Crew\u2019s control. He was the job foreman. He was the senior Washington Gas person on the job at the time. The location was under his control, and the fire started while the location was under his control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Appellant countered that in neither Excalibur\u2019s motion to dismiss, nor in Maryland Cable\u2019s motion for summary judgment, which was filed without an affidavit or a deposition transcript, did appellees raise the issue of whether appellant had secondarily assumed the risk. Moreover, appellant\u2019s lawyer claimed that Crews\u2019s deposition did not provide all the facts necessary to decide the issue of secondary assumption of risk. He pointed to the lack of information concerning appellant\u2019s \u201cknowledge about the length of time that the gas pipe had been hit,\u201d and whether Crews voluntarily encountered the risk. He also suggested that appellant did not know that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>appellees failed promptly to notify the police or fire department about the occurrence. Further, appellant\u2019s counsel asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">Now, there\u2019s a real difference \u2014 and we\u2019ve got an expert reviewing this \u2014 I suggest that there can be a real difference in the level of risk between going to a gas leak which just happened and going to a gas leak which had been pouring gas into the ground ... for over two hours, which is what happened here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">So when you talk about someone ... assuming a risk, they have to know and appreciate the full nature and extent of the risk. Not just that there\u2019s an inherent risk in gas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">It\u2019s intrinsic in the nature of natural gas that there could be an explosion. And, no matter what [appellant] does ... in his expert performance as a gas man who\u2019s been doing this for 27 years and has been called on to repair gas leaks before, he certainly is the person who\u2019s called out there to make the call ... and do what he\u2019s supposed to do. But when you talk about knowing and appreciating the full nature of the risk, that piece of evidence, in and of itself, would \u2014 is critical to his knowledge \u2014 to his knowledge of the ... risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In the court\u2019s view, appellant was \u201ca fellow who is really in the business of remedying gas leaks,\u201d who should not be characterized as an \u201cordinary citizen.\u201d Rather, appellant was a \u201ctroubleshooter for the gas company.\u201d Indeed, the court characterized appellant as \u201cthe Red Adair of the gas leak.\u201d Accordingly, the court rejected appellant\u2019s arguments, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">[T]he central issue is whether or not the plaintiff in this case, Mr. James Crews, who worked for Washington Gas Company for some 20 years, assumed the risk of checking into a gas leak that had been reported to his company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">He was an expert gas pipe repair technician, and he was sent to the property where the gas leak had occurred for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the specific purpose of inspecting and addressing the problem. That was his job. That he knew what he was doing and appreciated the risks associated with doing his job is clear in this case. And that he specifically assumed the risk of his job is also clear, and I think that\u2019s a matter, not for the jury to decide, but for the Court to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">Accordingly, I see no issue with respect to Mr. Crews going to this jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">And so, I\u2019m constrained to ... give judgment ... against the plaintiff \u2014 in favor of the defendants who raised this motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Nevertheless, the judge declined to state whether he was specifically applying the Fireman\u2019s Rule, explaining that his \u201copinion speaks for itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Appellant\u2019s counsel noted that only Excalibur and Maryland Cable had moved for summary judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if the Court wants to act ... or if there are any other motions under the circumstances.\u201d The court responded: \u201cIt ought to be cleaned up, really, once and for all. I just could, maybe, sign the order in favor of \u2014 maybe the easy thing to do is just dismiss the \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it ought to be done \u2014 we ought to clear it up. Why don\u2019t you all present an order and I\u2019ll sign the order. Get ... everybody\u2019s name on, and I\u2019ll sign it.\u201d Consequently, counsel for Byers and counsel for Iiollenbach <em>&amp; </em>Honcho each orally \u201cmov[ed] that the case be dismissed ... under the theory [of] the Court in making its ruling.\u201d For the record, appellant opposed their motions for the reasons previously asserted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Thereafter, the court entered summary judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment, we evaluate \u201cthe same material from the record and decide[] the same legal issues as the circuit court.\u201d <em>Lopata v.

He also contends that the court erred in applying the Fireman\u2019s Rule, because appellant was merely a civilian employee of Washington Gas. With respect to the Fireman\u2019s Rule, appellant admittedly engaged in a dangerous line of work that clearly affects public safety. But, he argues that he is not a professional rescuer, or a public employee, and he claims that a gas man\u2019s relationship to the public is not equal to that of a fireman or policeman. Moreover, he asserts that the Fireman\u2019s Rule is premised on unique and important public policy considerations that are not implicated here. Further, Crews complains that the court failed to consider several important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>issues, not yet explored, including: \u201c[C]ould Mr. Crews have refused to attempt to dissipate the gas leak?\u201d; \u201cDid [appellant] apprehend the particular danger posed by a leak that had been leaking for over two hours?\u201d; and \u201cIs this type of leak abnormally dangerous or of a type normally handled by Mr. Crews?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Appellees seem to focus on the doctrine of primary assumption of risk, rather than the Fireman\u2019s Rule. They assert that the injury Crews suffered was \u201ca foreseeable risk inherent to his occupation.\u201d In this regard, they note that Crews was called to the scene of the incident for the very purpose for which he was employed, i.e., to repair a gas leak, and he \u201csuffered a well known and foreseeable risk of being a gas repairman \u2014 a gas explosion.\u201d Further, appellees posit that it is irrelevant whether the particular situation was abnormally dangerous, whether appellant could have refused to attempt to dissipate the leak, or whether appellant knew of or appreciated the particular danger posed by the leak. Instead, appel-lees contend that the dispositive issue is \u201cwhether the hazard or condition [appellant] encountered was a hazard generally recognized as being within the scope of dangers identified in the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Alternatively, appellees maintain that appellant\u2019s recovery is barred by the \u201cmore traditional \u2018secondary assumption of risk\u2019 \u201d doctrine. They contend that appellant knew, appreciated, and voluntarily exposed himself to the specific risk he encountered. Appellant responds that his conduct in attempting to repair the gas leak did not constitute secondary assumption of risk, because he did not \u201cappreciate the specific danger involved in the Bowie gas leak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Primary assumption of risk is a concept distinct from secondary assumption of risk. A primary assumption of the risk defense generally applies when the defendant lacks any duty to protect the plaintiff from the particular risk, and thus the defendant cannot have breached a duty of care owed to the plaintiff. In contrast, a secondary assumption of risk occurs when a plaintiff voluntarily chooses to encounter a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>risk created by the defendant. In <em>Schroyer v. McNeal, </em>323 Md. 275, 284, 592 A.2d 1119 (1991), the Court of Appeals acknowledged: \u201cAlthough the definition of assumption of risk is well settled in Maryland, ... [the] .application of the defense \u2014 determining when and how to apply it \u2014 is yet rather difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">In W. Page Keeton et al., <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 68, at 480 (5th ed.1984)(hereinafter, <em>Prosser and Keeton </em>), the authors posit that the doctrine of assumption of risk has been used in \u201cseveral different senses, which traditionally have been lumped together under one name, often without realizing that any difference exists.\u201d <em>See also Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 284, 592 A.2d 1119 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 496A, comment c, at 561). Prosser and Keeton articulate three different \u201csenses\u201d of assumption of risk: \u201cthe express consent perspective\u201d; \u201cthe misconduct defense perspective\u201d; and \u201cthe duty perspective.\u201d <em>Prosser and Keeton, </em>\u00a7 68 at 480-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The express consent perspective applies when a plaintiff, in advance, gives \u201cexpress consent to relieve the defendant of an obligation toward him, and to take his chance of injury from a known risk arising from what the defendant is to do or leave undone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480. The concept of the misconduct defense applies when a plaintiff \u201cis aware of a risk that has already been created by the negligence of the defendant, yet chooses voluntarily to proceed to encounter it....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481. The duty perspective, commonly referred to as \u201cprimary assumption of risk,\u201d occurs when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqL\">the plaintiff voluntarily enters into some relationship with the defendant, with the knowledge that the defendant will not protect him against one or more future risks that may arise from the relation. He may then be regarded as tacitly or <em>impliedly </em>consenting to the negligence and agreeing to take his own chances. Thus, he may accept employment, knowing that he is expected to work with a dangerous horse; or ride in a car with knowledge that the brakes are defective, or the driver incompetent.... [T]he legal result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>is that the defendant is simply relieved of the duty which would otherwise exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><em>Prosser and Keeton </em>at 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In <em>Flowers v. Sting Security, Inc., </em>62 Md.App. 116, 135, 488 A.2d 523 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>308 Md. 432, 520 A.2d 361 (1987), the Court of Special Appeals quoted 2 F. Harper &amp; F. James, <em>The Law of Torts </em>(1956) \u00a7 21.1 at 1162, to explain the different kinds of assumption of the risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">The term assumption of risk has led to no little confusion because it is used to refer to at least two different concepts, which largely overlap, have a common cultural background, and often produce the same legal result. But these concepts are quite distinct rules involving slightly different policies and different conditions for their application. (1) <em>In its primary sense the plaintiffs assumption of risk is only the counterpart of the defendant\u2019s lack of duty to protect the plaintiff from that risk. </em>In such case plaintiff may not recover for his injuries even though he was quite reasonable in encountering the risk that caused it. Volenti non fit injuria. (2) <em>A plaintiff may also be said to assume a risk created by a defendant\u2019s breach of duty towards him, when he deliberately chooses to encounter that risk. </em>Hereafter <em>we shall call this </em>\u2018assumption of risk in secondary sense.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arq-dedup-1\">(Footnotes omitted and emphasis added in <em>Flowers).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The elements of the affirmative defense of secondary assumption of the risk are quite familiar. The defendant must establish that: (1) the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk of danger; (2) the plaintiff appreciated that risk; and (3) the plaintiff voluntarily encountered the risk of danger. <em>ADM Partnership v. Martin, </em>348 Md. 84, 90-91, 702 A.2d 730 (1997); <em>see Neal v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>117 Md.App. 460, 466, 700 A.2d 838, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>348 Md. 329, 703 A.2d 656 (1997) , <em>cert. denied after remand, </em>350 Md. 277, 711 A.2d 869 (1998); <em>Liscombe v. Potomac Edison Co., </em>303 Md. 619, 630, 495 A.2d 838 (1985). Ordinarily, it is for the jury to determine whether a plaintiff knew of the danger and appreciated the risk. <em>Prosser and Keeton </em>\u00a7 68 at 487. \u201cOn the other hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>when it is clear that a person of normal intelligence in the position of the plaintiff must have understood the danger, the issue [concerning knowledge and appreciation of the danger] is for the court.\u201d <em>Schroyer v. McNeal, </em>323 Md. at 283-84, 592 A.2d 1119 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In <em>Tucker v. Charles Shoemake d/b/a Rio Vista Plaza, </em>354 Md. 413, 731 A.2d 884 (1999), the Court of Appeals made clear that the Fireman\u2019s Rule is a \u201cpublic-policy grounded doctrine,\u201d at 419, 731 A.2d 884, founded on the special relationship between public safety officers and the public. Consequently, the Fireman\u2019s Rule ordinarily precludes recovery by a fireman or a policeman from private parties, in tort, for injuries sustained in the course of executing professional duties. In <em>Flowers v. Rock Creek Terrace Ltd. Partnership, </em>308 Md. 432, 447-48, 520 A.2d 361 (1987), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">[A]s a matter of public policy, firemen and police officers generally cannot recover for injuries attributable to the negligence that requires their assistance. This public policy is based on a relationship between firemen and policemen and the public that calls on these safety officers specifically to confront certain hazards on behalf of the public. A fireman or police officer may not recover if injured by the negligently created risk that was the very reason for his presence on the scene in his occupational capacity. Someone who negligently creates the need for a public safety officer will not be liable to a fireman or policeman for injuries caused by this negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Appellant asserts that the lower court erred because it applied the primary assumption of risk doctrine. Yet, he also contends that the court erred by applying the Fireman\u2019s Rule. As we see it, the trial court applied the doctrine of primary assumption of risk, not the Firemen\u2019s Rule. Moreover, it appears to us that appellant conflates the related principles of primary assumption of risk and the Fireman\u2019s Rule; he discusses the concepts interchangeably, as if they are one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>In our view, the Fireman\u2019s Rule, seems to constitute a species of primary assumption of risk. Although the two doctrines share important similarities, they are primarily distinguished by the public policy factor that undergirds the Fireman\u2019s Rule. A review of <em>Flowers </em>underscores the distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In <em>Flowers, supra, </em>308 Md. 432, 520 A.2d 361, a fireman was injured \u201cwhen he fell twelve stories down an open elevator shaft while responding to a fire in an apartment building.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 520 A.2d 361. Thereafter, he sued the building owners, the security guard company, and the elevator manufacturer, claiming a general \u201cfailure to maintain the property in a safe condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that, \u201cas a matter of public policy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 447, 520 A.2d 361, the suit was precluded by the Fireman\u2019s Rule, because the owner of the premises had no duty to keep the property safe for a fireman. Writing for the Court, Judge Eldridge said: \u201c[I]t is an analysis of the relationship between firemen and the public whom they serve which best explains the fireman\u2019s rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 520 A.2d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Recognizing the public policy factor as a key component of its decision, the <em>Flowers </em>Court observed that, unlike firemen and policemen, other public employees, such as postal workers, are generally entitled to due care. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, \u201c[foremen are engaged by the public to encounter risks inherent in .firefighting; they assume those risks, and therefore they should not recover for fire-related injures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 520 A.2d 361. Moreover, in the Court\u2019s view, \u201can accident involving an open elevator shaft ... is within the range of the anticipated risks of firefighting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451, 520 A.2d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In its analysis, the <em>Flowers </em>Court referred to the \u201csomewhat analogous ... assumption of risk doctrine applied in negligence cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 520 A.2d 361. In that regard, the Court quoted from <em>Krauth v. Getter, </em>31 N.J. 270, 157 A.2d 129 (N.J.1960), the seminal case discussing assumption of the risk as a rationale for the fireman\u2019s rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>\u201cThe rationale of the prevailing rule is sometimes stated in terms of \u2018assumption of risk/ used doubtless in the so-called \u2018primary\u2019 sense of the term, and meaning that the defendant did not breach a duty owed, rather than that the fireman was guilty of contributory fault in responding to his public duty____ Stated affirmatively, what is meant is that it is the fireman\u2019s business to deal with that very hazard and hence, perhaps by analogy to the contractor engaged as an expert to remedy dangerous situations, he cannot complain of negligence in the creation of the very occasion for his engagement. In terms of duty, it may be said there is none owed the fireman to exercise care so as not to require the special services for which he is trained and paid.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMj\"><em>Flowers, </em>308 Md. at 445-46, 520 A.2d 361 (quoting <em>Krauth, </em>157 A.2d at 130-31) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Several other Maryland cases have recognized the concept of primary assumption of risk with regard to employees generally. <em>See, e.g., Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 284 n. 5, 592 A.2d 1119 (observing that the Second Restatement of Torts identifies four \u201csenses\u201d of the doctrine of assumption of risk); <em>Flowers, </em>308 Md. at 445, 520 A.2d 361; <em>Baltimore County v. State, Use of Keenan, </em>232 Md. 350, 360-62, 193 A.2d 30 (articulating the differences between assumption of risk and contributory negligence and noting that commentators have classified the doctrine of assumption of risk into several types); <em>Miller v. Michalek, </em>13 Md.App. 16, 25, 281 A.2d 117 (1971) (finding that there was \u201cno assumption of risk by [the plaintiff] ... in the primary sense, by express agreement\u201d). Moreover, in cases from other jurisdictions, employees have been found to have assumed certain risks, in the primary sense, by virtue of their professions or occupations, notwithstanding the absence of public policy considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\"><em>Bull S.S. Lines v. Fisher, Use of Himself and Globe Indem. Co., </em>196 Md. 519, 77 A.2d 142 (1950), is particularly useful in our analysis. There, the Court considered whether a \u201cship ceiling carpenter,\u201d who was injured when a load of lumber attached to the ship\u2019s boom swung toward him and hit him in the chest, could recover for his injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 522-23, 77 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>A.2d 142. The defendant argued that the carpenter was barred from recovery because he was an experienced waterfront worker, \u201cthoroughly familiar with the nature of the operation, that he took the chance of the risks incident to it, [and] that the winchman was thereby relieved from any duty toward him----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, 77 A.2d 142. Although the parties did not couch their arguments in terms of primary versus secondary assumption of risk, the Court seemed to apply the doctrine in its primary sense. In distinguishing assumption of risk from contributory negligence, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">Assumption of risk has a different basis and affects not the negligence of the plaintiff, but the degree of care which the defendant has to exercise under the circumstances.... \u201cIn its primary and proper sense, it means that the plaintiff has consented to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him, and to take his chance of injury from a known risk---- He makes the choice at his own risk, and is taken to consent that the defendant shall be relieved of responsibility. The legal position is then that the defendant is under no duty to protect the plaintiff. It is not a question of any negligence on the part of the plaintiff, who may be acting quite reasonably, and it is immaterial whether he has exercised proper caution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 524, 77 A.2d 142 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">The Court determined that the \u201canswer to ... [the] question [of whether the carpenter assumed the risk] depended] largely upon what risk the appellee assumed____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, 77 A.2d 142. The Court observed that one in a dangerous position \u201c \u2018might be held bound to anticipate and so assume dangers from operation in ordinary course, yet not to anticipate and assume the risk of rare casualties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 77 A.2d 142 (citation omitted). Because it was not clear that the risk of being hit by the boom was a risk inherent in working as a ship\u2019s ceiling carpenter, the Court concluded that \u201cthe issue of what risk was assumed by the ... [carpenter] was properly left to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 77 A.2d 142. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>[E]very risk is not necessarily assumed by one who works in a dangerous place or at a dangerous occupation. He assumes only those risks which might reasonably be expected to exist, and, if by some action of the defendant, an unusual danger arises, that is not so assumed. Where there is a dispute whether the risk is assumed or not, that question should be left to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 526, 77 A.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\"><em>Maltman v. Sauer, </em>84 Wash.2d 975, 530 P.2d 254 (1975), also provides guidance. There, members of an Army helicopter crew were killed when their helicopter crashed en route to the scene of an automobile accident. Their estates were denied recovery in a suit lodged against the accident victim. The Supreme Court of Washington recognized: \u201cThose dangers which are inherent in professional rescue activity, and therefore foreseeable, are willingly submitted to by the professional rescuer when he accepts the position and the remuneration inextricably connected therewith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257 (citation omitted). It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">[T]he proper test for determining a professional rescuer\u2019s right to recovery under the \u201crescue doctrine\u201d is whether the <em>hazard ultimately responsible for causing the injury is inherently within the ambit of those dangers which are unique to and generally associated with the particular rescue activity. </em>Stated affirmatively, it is the business of professional rescuers to deal with certain hazards, and <em>such an individual cannot complain of the negligence which created the actual necessity for exposure to those hazards. </em>When the injury is the result of a hazard generally recognized as being within the scope of dangers identified with the particular rescue operation, the doctrine will be unavailable to that plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added). Applying that standard to the facts in issue, the Washington Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">A danger unique to helicopter rescues is the possibility of a mechanical malfunction in the airplane or pilot error, either of which could cause a crash. Therefore, a helicopter crew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>is specially trained to meet those known hazards. They are hazards within the ambit of those dangers unique to and generally associated with this particular rescue operation .... [T]hese hazards are not hidden, unknown, and extra hazardous dangers which would not be reasonably anticipated or foreseen by the decedent professional rescuers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\"><em>Dyer v. Superior Court (Hasou), </em>56 Cal.App.4th 61, 65 Cal.Rptr.2d 85 (1997), is also noteworthy. That case involved a tow truck operator who was injured while attending to a disabled vehicle located off the freeway. The California appellate court held that the operator could not recover from the driver of the disabled vehicle because, under the primary assumption of risk doctrine, the driver owed no duty of care to the operator \u201cto maintain his car in running order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92. The court stated: \u201cIn our view, it is good social policy to encourage motorists ... to rely on the contractual arrangements for aid from private towing services, rather than to discourage them by imposing upon them a potential liability for asking for help.\u201d <em>Id. See also, e.g., Peters v. Titan Navigation Co., </em>857 F.2d 1342, 1345 (9th Cir.1988) (affirming summary judgment for a shipowner regarding claims brought by a hydraulic system repairman injured by slipping on spilled hydraulic fluid, because \u201cthere is no negligence liability when a repairman is injured by the very condition he is hired to repair\u201d); <em>Rosenbloom v. Hanour Corp., </em>66 Cal.App.4th 1477, 78 Cal.Rptr.2d 686, 688 (1998) (concluding that because shark bites are an occupational hazard of shark handling, under the primary assumption of risk doctrine \u201cno duty is owed to protect the shark handler from the very danger that he or she was employed to confront\u201d); <em>Herrle v. Estate of Marshall, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 1761, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 713 (1996)(stating that certified nurses aide in convalescent home for mentally incompetent patients may not recover from injuries caused by one of the patients); <em>Bryant v. Glastetter, </em>32 Cal.App.4th 770, 38 Cal.Rptr.2d 291 (1995) (concluding that tow truck operator could not recover from drunk driver when he was struck and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>killed by another car while working to haul away the drunk driver\u2019s car); <em>Cohen v. McIntyre, </em>16 Cal.App.4th 650, 20 Cal.Rptr.2d 143, 146 (1993) (finding veterinarian barred from recovering for bite because the injury occurred during an \u201cactivity for which he was employed and compensated and one in which the risk of being ... bitten is well known\u201d); <em>Nelson v. Hall, </em>165 Cal.App.3d 709, 211 Cal.Rptr. 668 (1985) (finding veterinarian assistant who was bitten by a dog was barred from recovery under the doctrine of primary assumption of risk).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We recognize that there may be circumstances when the doctrine of primary assumption of risk would not apply to a person employed to repair a gas leak, who is injured in the course of doing so. Similarly, in <em>Flowers, </em>this Court recognized an exception to the application of the Fireman\u2019s Rule, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">The animating principle is that even under the assumption of risk rationale for the [Fireman\u2019s] Rule, a fireman does not assume <em>all </em>risks to which he may be exposed in the course of fighting a fire, but \u201cassumes <em>only </em>those <em>hazards </em>which are <em>known or can reasonably be anticipated </em>at the site of the fire.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\"><em>Flowers, </em>62 Md.App. at 136-37, n. 10, 488 A.2d 523 (citation omitted). Later, in its <em>Flowers </em>decision, the Court of Appeals also acknowledged that even \u201cfiremen and policemen are not barred from recovery for all improper conduct.\u201d <em>Flowers, </em>308 Md. at 448, 520 A.2d 361. Indeed, the Court recognized: \u201cThe owner or occupant of the premises must ... abstain from willful or wanton misconduct or entrapment. This encompasses a duty to warn of hidden dangers, where there was knowledge of such danger and an opportunity to warn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 520 A.2d 361. The Court added: \u201c[I]n some circumstances, when a fireman is outside of the anticipated occupational risk of fighting a fire he may be entitled to ordinary due care.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Tucker, supra, </em>also recognizes that the Fireman\u2019s Rule does not necessarily bar recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ery for negligence when a public safety worker is injured when responding to an emergency. There, the Court concluded that the Fireman\u2019s Rule did not bar a police officer\u2019s recovery for injuries he sustained when he stepped on a manhole cover and fell into an underground valve compartment while responding to a domestic dispute at a privately owned trailer park community. The Court reasoned that the Fireman\u2019s Rule did not preclude recovery, because the officer was not injured by the \u201crisk that occasioned his presence at the trailer park.\u201d At 419, 731 A.2d 884. The Court further stated: \u201c[T]he negligence alleged to have caused Officer Tucker\u2019s injuries was independent and not related to the situation requiring his services as a police officer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Unlike in <em>Tucker, </em>appellant\u2019s injuries were clearly related to the situation requiring his services as a gas man. Indeed, his injury resulted from the gas leak he was called upon to repair. <em>Cf. Tucker, </em>at 421, 731 A.2d 884 (observing that if the officer had \u201csuffered some injury due to a negligent condition in the trailer where the domestic dispute was or had been in progress, the Fireman\u2019s Rule likely would apply\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Appellant complains that there are issues relevant to whether he primarily assumed the risk, which the trial court did not consider and that the record did not address, such as the nature of the risk, whether appellant had a choice to respond to the scene, and whether appellant knew that the gas had been leaking for some two hours when he arrived at the scene. It is clear to us that these matters, including the apparent delay of some two hours in reporting the gas leak, do not defeat the application of the doctrine of primary assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">There is no basis to conclude that a gas company is always promptly advised about a possible gas leak. Indeed, it seems just as likely that a gas company would not immediately learn about a gas leak, for any number of reasons. To illustrate, a line could develop a leak in the middle of the night, and no one might realize it until hours later. Or, a citizen might be unsure of the nature of an odor, particular one that he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>encounters outside, and thus may fail to take prompt precautionary measures. When a gas leak repairman accepts a position with the gas company, he does not assume only those risks associated with the least dangerous gas leak, or one that is reported within minutes of the occurrence. Rather, he assumes the dangers associated with gas leaks generally. To be sure, the risk from a gas leak of some two hours in duration should have been as readily anticipated by a gas leak repairman as the open elevator shaft was to the fireman in <em>Flowers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The facts in our recent case of <em>Boddie v. Scott, </em>124 Md.App. 375, 722 A.2d 407 (1999), stand in marked contrast to this matter. That case presented a situation of an injury to an electrical repairman that resulted from events well beyond what reasonably might have occurred in his line of work as an electrician. Accordingly, we upheld the jury verdict in favor of the electrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In <em>Boddie, </em>the electrician was severely injured while trying to assist a homeowner with a kitchen fire negligently caused when the homeowner left oil cooking on the stove. <em>Boddie, </em>124 Md.App. at 378, 722 A.2d 407. Upon discovering the fire, the homeowner screamed for the electrician, who was repairing a defective outlet, saying: \u201c \u2018[Pjlease, sir, come help me, my house is on fire.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The electrician ran to the kitchen and observed flames \u201c\u2018towering all the way up to the ceiling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>As the homeowner stood \u201c \u2018scared\u2019 \u201d and silent, <em>id., </em>the electrician wrapped newspaper around the handle of the pan, walked \u201cbriskly towards the front door,\u201d <em>id., </em>and then \u201churled the flaming pan\u201d outside. <em>Id. </em>In the process, the electrician was severely injured. <em>Id. </em>at 379, 722 A.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In the electrician\u2019s suit against the homeowner for negligence, the homeowner defended based on assumption of risk. Although the electrician had knowledge of and appreciated the risk, we concluded that he did not voluntarily assume the risk of injury when he decided to remove the flaming pan from the customer\u2019s home. <em>Id. </em>at 388-89, 722 A.2d 407. We reasoned that when a person is faced with either: (1) disposing of a fire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>thereby protecting the home and its contents, or (2) ushering the inhabitants out of the house and letting the fire rage, that person does not really have a choice, because the latter is not a \u201c \u2018viable alternative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 722 A.2d 407 (quoting <em>VanCollom v. Johnson, </em>228 Va. 103, 319 S.E.2d 745, 747 (Va.1984)). Because the homeowner failed to show that the electrician met the thre\u00e9 pronged test set out in <em>ADM Partnership v. Martin, supra, </em>the defense of assumption of risk was not available to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Unlike Crews, the electrician in <em>Boddie </em>clearly was not injured by a work-related condition or situation within the scope of his employment. Rather, he was injured because he happened to be in a home when fire broke out, and he tried to protect the homeowner and her home from the spread of an oil fire. Clearly, an injury from a fire caused by careless cooking is not a risk associated with working as an electrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">In contrast, the risk of an explosion from a gas leak is precisely within the scope of dangers intrinsic to the occupation of a gas leak repairman, much like a helicopter crash for a helicopter rescue team, an animal bite for a veterinarian, or a fireman\u2019s fall down an elevator shaft. As appellant acknowledged in his deposition, \u201cany type of gas leak or odor is always dangerous,\u201d because a fire could always \u201cstart behind natural gas.\u201d Thus, unlike the ship\u2019s carpenter in <em>Bull S.S. Lines </em>or the electrician in <em>Boddie, </em>appellant had reason to anticipate the danger. Indeed, Crews admitted that when working on a volatile natural gas leak \u201canything can set it off, gravels [sic] or rocks that hit together, hitting metal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Crews \u201caccept[ed] that responsibility when ... [he] first got hired.\u201d Clearly, there was a direct causal relationship between the performance of appellant\u2019s duties as a gas leak repairman and the cause of his injury. Because appellant knew that his occupation carried with it certain risks, he may not now be heard to complain when one of those job-related foreseeable risks materialized. Under such circumstances, we agree with the trial court that appellant was barred from recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>In sum, there were no genuine disputes as to material facts. To the contrary, the undisputed facts in the record, most notably those from appellant\u2019s deposition, are susceptible of only one inference: appellant accepted his responsibility as a gas leak repairman to fix leaks in the face of dangers, including fire and explosion. Thus, by virtue of his employment, appellant is deemed to have assumed all reasonably anticipated risks inherent in dealing with such gas leaks. Because we conclude that the trial court properly granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that appellant primarily assumed the risk by virtue of his occupation, we need not reach appellees\u2019 alternative contention that appellant was barred from recovery under a secondary assumption of risk theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-13\">.

In addition, appellees stated in the text of their brief that \"Maryland Cable, Inc. and Maryland Cable Partners allegedly hired Excalibur ... to install the cable lines.\u201d At oral argument, we sought to clarify whether these are two distinct entities. Unfortunately, Maryland Cable's counsel was not one of the attorneys who was arguing the appeal for the appellees.

In his brief, appellant states that the hearing was held on April 27, 1998. Both the d\u00f3cket and the transcript reflect a hearing date of April 24, 1998, however. Curiously, the docket indicates that the April 24, 1998 hearing was set on March 3, 1998 with respect to Excalibur\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. Yet, as of March 1998, only Maryland Cable had actually moved for summary judgment; Excalibur did not file its \"Supplemental Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d until April 23, 1998. Moreover, only Excalibur and Maryland Cable had ever filed written motions by the time of the April 1998 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">We also observe that, in a sentence in his brief, appellant complains that he did not have 15 days to respond to Excalibur\u2019s supplemental motion.
