Below, plaintiff had a verdict for $50.00 damages and judgment was rendered upon this verdict. The case is here upon the exceptions of defendant taken to the refusal of the court to grant defendant\u2019s motion to set the verdict aside upon the ground that there was no evidence to support it. This is the only question briefed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">One Yail, introduced as a witness by plaintiff, testified in substance that a 1934 model Buick automobile was worth from $95 to $100 less than a 1935 model Buick car in the same condition. The defendant testified that this difference in value was from $25 to $30. This was all the evidence introduced upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\"> The jury was not bound to fix the damages at the exact amount as testified to by either witness, but might consider the testimony of each of them. The verdict for $50, being intermediate between the high and low sums covered by the testimony, cannot be said to be without supporting evidence. <em>Jeffersonville, Madison &amp; Indianapolis Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Tull, </em>37 Ind. 341; <em>Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>58 Ga. 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The ease of <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Fogg, </em>110 Vt. 465, 8 Atl. 2d. 684, cited by defendant, is not in point here. In that case the verdict returned by the jury was not within limits covered by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\n<em>Jtodgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
