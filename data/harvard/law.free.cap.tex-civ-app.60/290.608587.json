W. Flanagan because said testimony tended to establish the location and identity of the mound established by John Summerfield for the southwest -corner of survey 347, block M6. Where the field notes of the original surveyor call for a mound on a base line run by him, from which mound and base line certain surveys and blocks of surveys were platted, and their location depends upon the position and location of such mound, and the location and identity of this mound is in dispute, evidence of general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>reputation in the community may he received to establish the identity and location of the mound.

Therefore if the survey in M-6, except those on west, can be located from their own calls back t\u00f3 M-8, they will be so located regardless of where those on the west line are located, - as they are junior surveys and the others do not call for them, and to so locate them would be in harmony with Hutchinson\u2019s pipe corners and 9-T and S-2 would fit on to M-ll and the Ardrey would be where the jury put it, and it then became wholly immaterial where the west line surveys are.

Summerfield, the surveyor who appellant said made it, was alive and testified in this case, and as to what this monument was considered by the community was not admissible because hearsay. Evidence of common repute as to where certain mounds and lines once were would have been admissible, but this was without challenge proven by Damron and others, and under these circumstances Flannagan\u2019s testimony that it was by common repute the corner of 'these surveys, was inadmissible.

Stafford v. King, 30 Texas, 257.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-6\">Where a survey or series of surveys call for certain lines, corners and connections, these can not be controlled by paroi proof of a survey entirely inconsistent and repugnant to the calls of the grant. 9T, 10T were put in by Summerfield in the office, and called for M-6 and M-ll and must go where M-6 and M-ll are properly located and not where he put a monument in 1876, intending that they should be in harmony with the monument, the question being where is the proper locality of M-6 and M-ll and not where the surveyor wanted them. And especially is this true when Summer-field made no reference to the monuments in his notes for the T-blocks. The court then properly charged the jury that they should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>locate M-6, as Hedrick (he was the surveyor, not Summerfield) intended it should lie, and then put the other blocks on it and determine where the Ardrey was. Anderson v. Stamps, 19 Texas, 460; Masterson v. Ribble, 34 Texas Civ. App., 270.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-5\">In the construction of surveys those calls will be adhered to which are most material and certain, and those rejected which were made by mistake and conjecture, and that construction will prevail which is most consistent with the intention apparent on the face of the grant, and if any calls are rejected; those must be rejected which lead to confusion, and those accepted which most nearly harmonize all the calls, having in view the configuration of the same, quantity and everything tending to most nearly conform to the intention. Lyon v. Waggoner, 37 Texas Civ. App., 205; Sellman v. Sellman, 73 S. W., 48; Hamilton v. Blackburn, 43 Texas Civ. App., 153; Stafford v. King, 30 Texas, 257; Davidson v. Killen, 68 Texas, 406; Blackwell v. Coleman, 94 Texas, 220.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b321-6\">C\u00d3NNEB, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AQE\">We find no reason to disturb the judgment in this case. Appellant claims sections 21 and 22, block S-2, and section 91, block M-ll, and these sections were awarded to him by the judgment below. He makes no claim to the Ardrey survey owned by appellee, which undisputedly lies south of the south line of said sections 21 and 22, the call for the N. E. corner of the Ardrey being for the S. E. corner of section 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The disputed question is as to the proper location of said sections 22 and 21. It appears that blocks 10T, 9T and S-2 were office surveys, and if sections 21 and 22 be located, as appellant contends should be done, by calls for course and distance alone from the well identified corner fixed by John Summerfield on the west boundary line of block M-6, adopted for the S. W. corner of section 347 and N. W. corner of section 346 in said block M-6, then said sections 21 and 22 will lie south and west from the S. E. corner of section 91, block M-ll, which is made the beginning corner of section 21, and so extended would overlap and cover appellee\u2019s Ardrey survey; but we feel unable to say that the jury were unwarranted in finding, as they evidently did, that the calls for section 91, in block M-ll should be given effect. The evidence warrants the inference that in plotting blocks 10T, 9T, S-2 and M-ll the surveyor who made out or adopted the field notes of these several blocks had in mind and was controlled by other lines and objects as well as by the common corners given of sections 347 and 346, block M-6. The north line of block M-ll distinctly calls for the south line of block M-8 and block M-6. The N. W. corner of block M-8 and N. E. corner of block 2Z is distinctly fixed by the evidence at a well identified corner constituting the S. W. corner of section 208, block 6 and the S. E. corner of block B-5, this corner being nine miles south of the well identified N. E-. corner of block B-5. The field notes of block M-8, signed by Hedrick and filed and approved in the Land Office, call for mounds all along the west line of block M-8, and the surveys along the east line of M-6 likewise call for the same mounds, it being the evident intent of the locator of these blocks that blocks 6, B-5, 2Z, M-8 and M-6 should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>adjoin and cover all of the territory included by the outer calls, and the testimony of Hutchinson, who surveyed the west line of M-8 and the east line of M-6, authorizes the inference that along this line he found the. original mounds called for in the field notes of these two blocks; that he fixed therein, allowing for an excess found, iron pipes, thus definitely fixing upon the ground the south lines of block M-8 and block M-6, and by calls for course and distance fixed the south line of block M-ll, fixing as the S. E. corner of said section 91, block M-ll, an iron pipe, and the jury thus evidently fixed the beginning corner of appellant\u2019s section <em>21, </em>block S-2, at the S. E. corner of section 91, block M-ll, for which the field notes in section 21 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">While the testimony of Summerfield fixes the west line of block M-6, we \u2018do not think it necessarily follows therefrom that the east line of this block is to be drawn away from block M-8 for which it calls. The proof tends to show that the eastern tiers of surveys in block M-6 were located before those along the western line, and if the eastern line of the block can be fixed with certainty by the calls for adjoining blocks on the north and east, the surveys on the east should be established in accordance with such calls, regardless of the fact that to go to the western line of the block as established by the Summerfield objects would create an excess. It is not contended that the excess is more than about fifteen hundred varas, which is not so excessive in a line eighteen miles long as to require the rejection of ail calls along the eastern and northern lines of the block. Besides, the evidence of Summerfield as a whole, we think, warrants the inference that in plotting blocks 10T, 9T, M-ll and S-2, other lines and calls than the calls for the long base line of Summerfield were distinctly had in mind and considered; for instance, he states that from the mound on his base line,, now known as the S. W. corner of survey 347, block M-6, McClelland and others ran a line east towards the west line of block M-8; that he then ran in the various courses and distances stated by him and finally connected with McClelland and others, and that at least ten miles of the line east from the S. W. corner of 347 was adopted, and he nowhere states that other calls in these .blocks were disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">What we have said we think will dispose of many of the assignments of error, but we will refer to some of them briefly. We think the rejection of Flannigan\u2019s testimony, complained of in the first assignment, immaterial for the reason that there seems to be but little if any dispute about the location of the S. W. corner of 347, block M-6; the issue and the only issue material as we conceive it under the testimony was whether surveys 21 and 22, block S-2, should be located by calls for course and distance alone from the corners mentioned, or whether the jury might locate these surveys by their calls for sections 91 and 92, block M-ll, and other evidence to which we have referred.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Hor do we think the sixth and seventh clauses of the court\u2019s charge erroneous in ignoring the part Summerfield took in making out the field notes of the surveys in blocks M-6, 9T, 10T, M-ll and S-2. The field notes and surveys purport to have been made by Hedrick, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>and the presumption of law is that the surveys were made as stated in the field notes approved by the General Land Office. It would not do therefore for the court to assume that Summerfield\u2019s testimony indisputably established the fact, as app'ellant contends, that the location of blocks 10T, 9T, M-ll, and S-2 are to be controlled by calls for course and distance alone from the established common corners of 347 and 34,6, block M-6. Moreover, as we have before had occasion to mention, Summerfield\u2019s own testimony tends to show that the blocks named were platted not alone upon the Summerfield base line, but also from other ascertainable lines and corners.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">If paragraph nine of the court\u2019s charge, to which objection is made in the twelfth assignment, is erroneous, but which we do not think, the error was invited by appellant\u2019s special charge Ho. 5. The jury by their verdict did the precise thing that appellant\u2019s special charge Ho. 7 would have instructed them to do had the court given it; its rejection, therefore, can not be material. By appellant\u2019s charges Hos. 8, 10, 11, mentioned in the fifteenth, sev\u00e9nteenth and eighteenth assignments of error, appellant sought to authorize the jury to reject calls other than course and distance from the west line of block M-6 as fixed by the testimony of Summerfield. This we think would have been erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We conclude that all assignments of error should be overruled, and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
