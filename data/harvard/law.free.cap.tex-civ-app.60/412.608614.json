Guthrie v. Lyons, 98 S. W., 432; Kellogg v. McCabe, 92 Texas, 199; 1 Greenleaf, sec. 52; Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Creasen, 101 Texas, 335; Price v. Wakeham, 48 Texas Civ. App., 339; Hazard v.

W. Biggins and G. A. Heilig, alleging that in or about February, 1907, Heilig, as agent for Biggins, sold certain lands for Biggins for $34,386 cash, for which service Biggins agreed to pay Heilig five percent commission, which was $1719.30, which was the usual and customary commission on such matters; that afterwards Biggins paid Heilig $1000, leaving a balance due the latter of $719.30, payment of which has been requested and refused. That on or about August, 1908, Heilig assigned the claim to plaintiff, guaranteeing its payment, whereby Biggins is primarily and Heilig secondarily liable to plaintiff. The prayer was for judgment against both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Heilig made no answer. Biggins pleaded by demurrer and general denial, and specially alleged that it is true he engaged Heilig to sell the land, and setting \u2018forth a letter from him to Heilig dated December 15, 1906, the terms of which he alleges Heilig accepted and undertook to sell the land for $16.50 an acre, for a commission of $1000, which sum he has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Plaintiff by supplemental petition denies that the contract was as alleged by Biggins, and alleges that Biggins verbally agreed to pay him five percent, which agreement was subsequently confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">The verdict was for plaintiff for the. sum claimed with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">We overrule 'the first assignment of error, which is that the evidence did not support the verdict and required a verdict for the defendant. The testimony established the employment of Heilig and that some agreement as to compensation was made. The sole issue developed was as to the terms of the agreement in reference to the compensation, and upon this question the testimony presented a clear issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">We overrule also the second assignment of error, which was that the court erred in not instructing a verdict for Biggins as against Sass because the undisputed evidence shows that if Biggins was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>indebted to any person it was to Heilig and not the plaintiff Sass, and that any moneys, if any, recovered in this proceeding were to go to the payment of a debt of Heilig to a certain bank, and no part of it was to be appropriated to Sass, and no part of it belonged to the latter. It was shown that Sass was security for Heilig on an unpaid note at the bank, and the claim was assigned to him by Heilig to indemnify him. In these circumstances Sass had an interest in the collection of the claim, as well as title thereto by reason of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\">The third' assignment raises a question of the admissibility of certain testimony introduced on behalf of plaintiff. It appears that the following letter was introduced by plaintiff, from Biggins to Heilig:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">\u201cDear Heilig: Here is a letter from Wheelock. You note he offers to pay $3,140 cash and bal. 8% int. for 207 acres on cfar side of this pasture.\u2019 He afterwards offers all cash. This 207 acres is not as good as most any. part of the land. You can show this to your parties if you like. I only want to prove what I say. But I say again, do not urge the deal at $16.50 per acre. Let them turn the offer down and I will sell to some Bryan people at $17.50 or maybe $20 per acre. But be sure and make it plain,and clear that my land is not for sale at less than $20 per acre unless the deal is closed and money paid before February 1. Please send Dr. Gilstrap\u2019s letter back to me. Fair warning to all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\u201cYours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201cJ. W. Biggins.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The letter which the above refers to and which was enclosed with it was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">\u201cWheelock, Texas, January 21, 1907.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">\u201cMr. J. W. Biggins,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">' \u201cWaco, Texas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">\u201cDear Sir: I wish to say that I will take the 207 acres of land on the far side of your pasture at $20 per acre.' Will pay $3,140 dollars in cash down, the rest $1,000 in two notes, Ho. 1, $500 due January 1, 1908; Ho. 2, $500 due January 1, 1909, at 8% int., notes payable on or before these dates. Please make deed as soon as possible, as I desire to put some of the land in cultivation. Submit the deed to Mr. Bobt. Armstrong, my attorney, for approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">\u201c(Signed) W. P. Gilstrap, M. D.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">The last named letter was' admitted in evidence over defendants\u2019 objection and protest. Thereupon, over defendants\u2019 objection, counsel for plaintiff pursued the following cross-examination of defendant Biggins:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-15\">\u201cWho wrote that letter? (meaning the last named letter). Whose handwriting is it in?\u201d 'Ans. \u201cI can\u2019t tell. I do not know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-16\">\u201cDidn\u2019t you write that letter yourself?\u201d Ans. \u201cI did not.\u201d. \u201cIs it not in your handwriting?\u201d \u201cIt is not.\u201d \u201cHow is it that Mr. Gilstrap\u2019s name is written in lead pencil?\u201d Ans. \u201cSir, I never wrote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>that letter nor instigated it.\u201d \u201cHow is it that his name is written in lead pencil when the letter is written in ink? Is it not written in the same color of ink that your letter was written with?\u201d Ans. \u201cI do not know that it is or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">Q. \u201cIs Dr. Gilstrap an educated man?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">A. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he is or not. I know that I got that letter out of the postoffice at Waco from him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">Q. \u201cThis was sent to Mr. Heilig for the purpose of being shown to these gentlemen to urge them up?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">A. \u201cIf it had a purpose it was to corroborate a statement in my letter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">Q. \u201cDr. Gilstrap offers $20 an acre for the most inferior part of your land?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">A. \u201cI did not say that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">Q. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say, \u2018You note he offers to pay $3140 cash and balance 8% interest for 207 acres on far side of your pasture ?\u2019 He afterwards offered all cash?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">A. \u201cThat letter shows for itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">Q. \u201cYour letter is dated January 25. This letter of Dr. Gilstrap to you is dated January 21. How you say in this letter that he afterwards offered all cash. So he offered it between the 21st and 25th. You have not got that letter?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">A. \u201cHo, sir. I think that on the 23d I was down there. I think we then had been there. The 207 acres is not as good as most of any other part of the land. This is true of the prairie land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">The bill discloses that defendant objected to all of said evidence, \u201cbecause immaterial and irrelevant to any issue in the cause; because the manner of the examination of the witness was insulting, provoking and harassing, and intended to he so, and because said evidence and testimony was offered by plaintiff for the purpose of misleading the jury into the belief that the defendant Biggins was trying to perpetrate a fraud upon the purchasers of the land, and thus to improperly and wrongfully prejudice the rights of the defendant, as it was calculated to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">The court qualified the bill by stating that the evidence was admitted on cross-examination =for the purpose of testing the credibility of the witness, and in the opinion of the - court the conduct of plaintiff\u2019s counsel was not undignified or insulting, that it may have been provoking and harassing, and that the court thought the examination was conducted within proper limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">We think the letter was improperly admitted. The issue in the case was what was the agreement or understanding as to Heilig\u2019s compensation. There was nothing in the letter which tended to throw any light upon that issue. It was not a part of the letter written to Heilig, although enclosed with it. The objection that it was not material or relevant to the issue ought to have been sustained. The trial judge admitted it upon the view that it served to test the credibility of defendant. Its usefulness in that respect lay in the probable fact that there was a resemblance between the ink and the handwriting of both the letters, and the fact that the Gilstrap letter was written in ink hut signed in lead pencil, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>affording some basis for a suspicion or argument against defendant that he had manufactured the Gilstrap letter. But this was clearly collateral to the issue because it had no bearing upon it, and such method could not be resorted to for impeachment purposes. Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Creason, 101 Texas, 335; Kellogg v. McCabe, 92 Texas, 202. The examination of defendant in connection with this letter was an aggravation of this error. The assignment is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The fourth assignment is not entitled to consideration under the rules, as it is not accompanied by any statement; and it embodies more than one subject matter of error..</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The fifth assignment complains of plaintiff\u2019s counsel being allowed to ask defendant on cross-examination, \u201cin a provoking, undignified and insulting manner,\u201d certain questions, because \u201cthis testimony was immaterial and irrelevant to any issue in the cause; because the manner of the examination was provoking, insulting and harassing and was intended to be so, and because said questions were \u00e1sked and obtained by plaintiff\u2019s counsel for the purpose of misleading the jury into the belief that defendant Riggins was trying to perpetrate a fraud upon the purchasers of the land and thus to improperly and wrongfully prejudice the right of this defendant, as it did do.\u201d This assignment of error is manifestly multifarious and contrary to the rules and can not properly receive consideration. One error it assigns is that the testimony was foreign to the issue. Another is that the demeanor of counsel was improper. These are separate and distinct questions.
