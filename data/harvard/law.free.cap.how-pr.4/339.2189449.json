It would be intolerable to require specific denials of an entire complaint in other terms. I will not aid in establishing the intricate and voluminous system of pleading under the code, which seems to be growing up in practice. I cannot believe that it was the design of the code-m\u00e1kers; and, until my position is overruled by the Supreme Court, in bench, I shall hold such a denial as this good.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
