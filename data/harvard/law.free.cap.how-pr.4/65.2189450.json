When the note became due it was protested for non-payment, and an action was brought against the maker and endorsers. The endorsers suffered a default, but the defendant Andrews put in an answer, denying the making of the note and of the demand thereof and also alleging that it was without consideration. The answer was verified under the old code by the defendant\u2019s attorney. The The cause being at issue was noticed for trial at the April Bensselaer circuit, but was not reached on the calendar. It was again noticed for trial and inquest at the late June circuit in Bensselaer county, and an inquest was taken by default for the amount of the note. The defendants made no defence. A motion is now made for an order allowing to the plaintiff ten per cent, on the recovery ($311.45) under the \u00a7 308 of the code, on the ground that the defence was unreasonably or unfairly conducted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-7\">C. S. Lester, <em>for the motion.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-8\">C. W. Boot, <em>contra, </em>read an affidavit of the defendant Andrews, .that the defence was put in, in good faith\u2014that the note was given to Wilson and Calkins upon false representations, and that there was not more than one hundred dollars due from him to them when it was given\u2014that he had reason to expect he could prove that the suit was brought by the plaintiff for the benefit of Wilson and Calkins, and after-wards learned that he could not prove it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b69-9\">Willard, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"A3i\">The defendant\u2019s answer was false. He does not now pretend that he did not give the note; nor does the answer set up the pretext that the suit was brought for the benefit of Wilson and Calk-ins, the payees and endorsers. The note having been transferred to the plaintiff before it was due, could not have been impeached by the defendant Andrews, on the ground of a want of consideration. It is quite clear that the defence was merely for delay and without the shadow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>of any legal excuse. It was therefore \u201c unfairly and unreasonably conducted,\u201d within the meaning of the code, \u00a7 308, as it unjustly threw the plaintiff over a circuit. I shall therefore direct that an allowance of ten per cent, on the recovery be made to the plaintiff and be inserted in the record by the clerk.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
