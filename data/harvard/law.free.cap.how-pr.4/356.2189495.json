It was tried at Herkimer circuit in April last. The plaintiff recovered a verdict against Eobinson of $25 damages; but the defendants Myers and Bankins had a verdict of not guilty. The defendants appeared by different attorneys, and pleaded separately. The plaintiff\u2019s attorneys served a copy of a bill of charges and disbursements on the attorneys of the defendants, with a notice of application to the clerk of Herkimer county for the adjustment thereof. The attorneys of the defendants each served a copy of a bill of charges and disbursements, with notice of application to the same clerk at the same time, for their adjustment and insertion in the judgment roll in favor of their respective clients.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-12\">On the day appointed, the attorneys of the respective parties appeared before the clerk, and after the costs against Eobinson had been adjusted, the counter bills were presented for adjustment, to which the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys objected, on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-13\">1. The plaintiff was entitled to costs in the action, and, therefore, the defendants could not be allowed to recover costs in the same action. (Code, \u00a7 305.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>2. The defendants have not obtained any order from the court allowing them to recover costs in the action, (Code, \u00a7 306.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-4\">The county clerk sustained the objections, and refused the defendants\u2019 application, and permitted the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys to perfect their judgment against Eobinson for his damages and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">The defendants made a motion in the nature of an appeal, at the Fulton county circuit for an order requiring the clerk of Herkimer county to adjust, on proper notice, their charges and disbursements,and to correct the judgment roll by adding thereto a judgment in their favor for the amount.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-6\">E. S. Capron\", <em>for the </em>motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APBz\">insisted that his clients were the prevailing party,\u201d within the meaning of section 303 of the code, as between themselves and the plaintiff; that section 305 was to be construed together with section 303, and to be read thus: \u201c Costs shall be allowed of course to the defendant <em>in the actions </em>mentioned in the last section, unless the plaintiff be entitled to costs therein,\u201d <em>against such prevailing defendant; </em>that section 306 referred \u201cto <em>other </em>actions\u201d than those referred to in section 304, which includes only actions at law, and therefore no order of the court Avas necessary for the defendants in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-7\">L. Ford, opposed,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7k\">insisted upon the same points made before the county clerk; and also, that the words, \u201cin other actions,\" contained in section 306, refer to all actions in which there are several defendants, some of whom have a verdict in their favor on the trial and without reference to the character of the action as legal, or equitable. He also insisted that the motion for an order allowing the defendants\u2019 costs, if necessary, should have been made at the coming in of the verdict, at the trial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Willard, Justice, decided substantially, that although the code had abolished the distinction of the forms of action which formerly existed, and had provided that all causes of action shoidd be instituted in one form, yet, for the purposes of costs at least, it had recognized the character of actions as formerly understood. It was so in section 304; all the causes of action therein enumerated were, under the old order, of legal proceedings, actions at law. Section 305 referred to them only, and was to be interpreted as if it read thus: \u201c Costs shall be aEowed, of course, to the <em>defendant </em>in the actions mentioned in the last sections, unless the plaintiff be entitled to costs therein,\u201d <em>against him. </em>He held that the words, \u201c other actions,\u201d contained in section 306,-referred to other causes of action than those enumerated in section 304; and there being no other than equity causes of action, the former action referred to such only.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Ordered accordingly, that the motion be granted, but Avithout costs thereof to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
