INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-28\">This case arises out of an insurance coverage dispute between Third-Party Plaintiffs Texaco Inc. and Texaco Caribbean, Inc., (collectively hereinafter \u201cTexaco\u201d) as the Successor to Vernon Morgan, and several purported insurance carriers Vernon Morgan (\u201cMorgan\u201d) claims have breached contracts to insure Morgan and have refused, in bad faith, to defend and indemnify him against numerous environmental actions. These actions resulted from Morgan\u2019s alleged negligence in allowing hazardous chemicals to be discharged from underground storage tanks at the Tutu Texaco Service Station (\u201cService Station\u201d) into the Turpentine Run Aquifer in St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-29\">Beginning in 1972, Texaco leased property to Morgan from which Morgan operated the Service Station. In September 1976, Morgan discovered the loss of approximately 2,200 gallons of gasoline from a leaking pipe joint. In late 1977, Morgan discovered the loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>approximately 240 gallons of fuel due to a leak in a fuel delivery line. After both discoveries, Morgan apprised Texaco of the situation. On two occasions during the 1980\u2019s, one of three unlined underground storage tanks on the site were taken out of service due to a suspected leak.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">In 1989, various claimants instituted litigation against Texaco and Morgan for damage caused by the aforementioned discharges of hazardous substances from storage tanks and fuel delivery system located at the Site. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-20 to Texaco\u2019s First Amended Third-Party Complaint, annexed to the Affidavit of Paul Leodori as Exhibit A (\u201cTexaco\u2019s Complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">In December 1990 Texaco settled the matter entitled <em>Total Vision, Inc. d/b/a Tutu Water Co., et al. v. Morgan, et al., </em>(Case No.1989-107) <em>(\u201cTotal Vision </em>\u201d) for $700,000. <em>See </em>\u00b6 36 to Texaco\u2019s Complaint. In March 1992 Texaco settled the matter entitled <em>Four Winds Plaza Partnership v. Morgan, et al. </em>(Case No.1989-220) <em>(\u201cFour Winds </em>\u201d) for $2,250,000. <em>See </em>\u00b6 37 to Texaco\u2019s Complaint. On or about February 1994, Texaco settled the matter <em>Harthman et al. v. Morgan, et al. </em>(Case No.1989-220) for $1,000,000 (\u201cHarthman\u201d). All three settlements included the release of all claims against Morgan. <em>See </em>Texaco Complaint at \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Morgan was represented by John Zebedee, Esq. in <em>Total Vision, Four Winds, </em>and <em>Harthman. </em>Texaco paid John Zebedee, Esq. to represent Morgan in these matters. <em>(See </em>Letter from John Zebedee to Michael Frantz dated August 14, 1991 attached as Exhibit N to Leodori Aff.).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Meanwhile, as litigation continued in the Virgin Islands concerning environmental damage, Texaco filed an action against numerous insurers in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles entitled <em>Four Star Oil &amp; Gas Company, et al. v. Allianz Insurance Company et al., </em>Case No. BC 036944 (\u201cCalifornia Litigation\u201d). Included among Texaco\u2019s claims in the California Litigation were its incurred and anticipated liabilities arising at and from the Site. <em>(See </em>Exhibits F, G and H to Leodori Affidavit) Texaco ultimately agreed to a comprehensive release of environmental coverage claims against various insurance companies in the context of the California Litigation. Specifically, pursuant to an \u201cAGREEMENT OF SETTLEMENT, COMPROMISE AND RELEASE\u201d (\u201cRelease Agreement\u201d) dated May 10,1993, CIGNA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> agreed to pay Texaco $20,250,000. The Release Agreement provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-10\">CIGNA shall have no further obligation under the Policies or otherwise to pay for, or to make indemnity or defense payments with respect to, Environmental Damage Claims other than the payments [of $20,-250,000] specified in paragraph 3.2 hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmD\">Release Agreement at \u00b6 3.5</p>\n<p id=\"ATh\">Pursuant to the Release Agreement, a \u201cclaim\u201d was defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeX\">any past, present or future actual or potential claims, insurance claims, reinsurance claims, cross-complaints, third-party claims, rights, proceedings, demands, requests, suits, lawsuits, administrative proceedings, causes of actions, orders, actions, debts, dues, sums of money, accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, contracts, torts, controversies, judgments; executions, liabilities and obligations whatsoever whether in law or equity, including without limitation any and all claims for bad faith, alleged breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, claims for any other alleged misconduct or extracontractual claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">The agreement in \u00b6 2.5 defined \u201cEnvironmental Damage Claims\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-12\">All Claims, losses sustained or costs incurred in connection with Environmental Damage. Environmental Damage Claims include without limitation, any and all Past, \u2022 existing; future or potential: (a) Claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>brought by or behalf of any Person or any actions taken by Texaco (voluntarily or otherwise) in response to any such Claims because of losses sustained or involving, arising out of, or related in any way to Environmental Damage, including, without limitation, Claims to recover cleanup or remediation costs, to impose statutory fines or penalties, or to obtain injunctive or declaratory relief ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">Furthermore, \u00b6 2.9 defined Texaco:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">\u201cTexaco\u201d means Texaco Inc., its past, present, and future employees, officers, directors, principals, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, attorneys, representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns, and any Person insured by any of the Policies including, but not limited to, any named insured, person insured, additional insured, additional named insured, and all Persons identified as Plaintiffs in the Fourth Amended Complaint filed by Texaco in the California Action, including but not limited to, all Persons identified in Exhibits A to D to said Complaint. Notwithstanding anything else in this paragraph 2.9 to the contrary, Texaco shall not include Texaco Canada Inc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Finally, in \u00b64.1, the Release Agreement states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">4.1. In consideration of the promises contained in the Agreement, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6 herein, and except with regard to any obligation CIGNA may independently owe Texaco Canada, Texaco and HIL hereby release and discharge CIGNA from any liability, duty or obligation, known or unknown, (including, without limitation, any duty to investigate, defend or indemnify) for any and all past, pending, or future Environmental Damage Claims under the Policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Two years after the Release Agreement was executed, Texaco settled all of its outstanding claims against Morgan in an agreement executed June 27, 1995 entitled \u201cCONSENT TO JUDGMENT AND ASSIGNMENT\u201d (\u201cthe Assignment\u201d). Under the Assignment, Morgan consented to the entry of judgment against him on the underlying actions in the amount of $16,682,-392. Assignment at \u00b6 2. Having paid off all claims on Morgan\u2019s behalf, Texaco nevertheless agreed not to execute, record, or collect on its judgment against him. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7. In exchange, Morgan agreed to assign to Texaco all claims that Morgan had against \u201cany and all insurance carriers insuring Morgan and/or Texaco Tutu Service Station, for the claims of the Plaintiffs and the crossclaims of Texaco for contribution and indemnity ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">On December 7, 1995, Morgan filed a Third-Party Complaint against several insurers, claiming bad faith and seeking defense costs and indemnity for alleged policies issued by the insurers to Morgan, respecting alleged contamination arising from the leaking underground storage tanks and fuel delivery system at the Site. The defendants included Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, AFIA Worldwide Insurance, CIGNA Corporation, CIGNA International Corporation, Insurance Company of North America, and General Accident Insurance Co. Puerto Rico, Ltd., and American Trust Insurance Co., Ltd. The alleged policies produced by Morgan contain a pollution exclusion. <em>See </em>Statement of Material Facts Not at Issue in Support of Plaintiffs Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Duty to Defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">On March 2, 1998, this Court found that Texaco, not Morgan, <em>was </em>the real party in interest as \u201csuccessor\u201d to Morgan. <em>{See </em>ORDER ON MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT entered on March 2, 1998 annexed to the Affidavit of Paul Leodori as Exhibit L) <em>{See </em>OPINION ON MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT dated March 2, 1998 annexed to the Affidavit of Paul Leodori as Exhibit M).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">In Texaco\u2019s first-amended third-party complaint, filed April 3, 1998, Texaco claims include \u201cbad faith\u201d and \u201cfailure to defend and indemnify\u201d against several of the insurance companies with which Vernon Morgan had contracted: Texaco as successor to Vernon Morgan seeks insurance coverage and payment of its underlying disputes against Morgan as reflected in its judgment of $16,682,-392.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">Texaco now seeks partial summary judgment against Fireman\u2019s Fund based upon Morgan\u2019s Fireman\u2019s Fund insurance policies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>CIGNA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> cross-moves for summary judgment based on the same insurance policies and the Release Agreement. This Opinion discusses both of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">A. STANDARD FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The standard for granting summary judgment is a stringent but surmountable one. That is, summary judgment is appropriate only when the materials of record \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Serbin v. Bora Corp., </em>96 F.3d 66, 69 n. 2 (3d Cir.1996). In deciding whether there is a disputed issue of material fact, the court must graht all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Serbin, </em>96 F.3d at 69 n. 2. The threshold inquiry is whether there are \u201cany genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a find\u00e9r of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Supreme Court decisions mandate that a motion for summary judgment must be granted unless the party opposing the motion \u201cprovides evidence \u2018such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u2019\u201d <em>Lawrence v. National Westminster Bank of New Jersey, </em>98 F.3d 61, 65 (3d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505). Moreover, once the moving party has carried its burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, \u201cits opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to material facts.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Instead, the non-moving party must \u201cby affidavits or by depositions and admissions on file \u2018mak[e] a showing sufficient to establish [that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to each] element essential to that party\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Equimark Commercial Fin. Co. v. C.I.T. Fin. Servs. Corp., </em>812 F.2d 141, 144 (3d Cir.1987) (declaring that a non-movant may not \u201crest upon mere allegations, general denials, or ... vague statements\u201d). Thus, if the non-movant\u2019s evidence is merely \u201ccolorable\u201d or is \u201cnot significantly probative,\u201d the court may grant summary judgment. <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">B. THE POLLUTION EXCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Texaco argues that the Fireman\u2019s Fund policies during the relevant years provided Morgan with a promise to \u201cdefend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such ... property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent.\u201d <em>See </em>Policy Attached As Exhibit B to Plaintiffs Motion For Partial Summary Judgment on the Duty to Defend and Memorandum of Law (\u201cPlaintiffs Memo\u201d). Texaco argues that, as a matter of law, the claims brought by <em>Total Vision, \u25a0 Four Winds, </em>and <em>Harthman </em>against Morgan, concerning his operations of the garage, fall within the scope of coverage provided by Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s insurance policies. CIGNA argues that the pollution exclusion included in the relevant policies is unambiguous and as a matter of law precludes coverage under the facts of this case. <em>See </em>Memorandum of Law of CIGNA in Support of Crossmotion for Defense, Indemnity and to be Held Harmless and Opposition to Texaco Inc.\u2019s and Texaco Caribbean Inc.\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Duty to Defend (\u201cCIGNA\u2019s Response Memo.\u201d) at 22 and Attached as Exhibit R to Leodori Aff.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">The pollution exclusion provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-13\">This insurance does not apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-14\">(o) to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of smoke, vapors, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, toxic chemicals, liquids or gases, waste materials or other irritants, contaminants or pollutants into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>or upon land, the atmosphere or any watercourse or body of water; but this exclusion does not apply if \u2022 such discharge, dispersal, release or escape is sudden and accidental.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><em>See </em>Attached as Exhibit F of Leodori Aff. (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">1. TEXACO\u2019S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">In <em>Buntin v. Continental Insurance Co., </em>525 F.Supp. 1077, 1080 (D.V.I.1981), this Court recognized that \u201cmost insurance policies expressly obligate the insurer to assume the defense of lawsuits arising under the policy.\u201d Specifically, the duty to defend \u201ccomes into play when a claim is made against an insured which may potentially be covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp. v. Firemen\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, et al., </em>626 F.Supp. 882 (D.Vi.1986). In determining whether a duty to defend exists, \u201cthe factual allegations of [the] complaint ... are controlling.\u201d <em>Enron Corporation v. Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation, et al., </em>940 F.2d 307 (8th Cir.1991), <em>citing C.H. Heist Caribe Corp. v. American Home Assurance Co., </em>640 F.2d 479, 483 (3d Cir.1981) (quotation omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">Interpretation of insurance contracts is governed by the Virgin Islands Insurance Code, 22 V.I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1698, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR5\">Every insurance contract shall be construed according to the entirety of the terms and conditions as set forth in the policy and as amplified, extended or modified by any rider, endorsement, or application attached to and made a part hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAF\">22 V.I.C. \u00a7 846. Furthermore, in interpreting an insurance policy, Virgin Island courts should read insurance policy provisions within the context of the entire policy, avoiding ambiguities whenever possible. <em>Coakley Bay Condominium Association v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>770 F.Supp. 1046, 1051 (D.V.I.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">In the instant action, the insurance provision provides that Fireman\u2019s Fund \u201cwill pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... Coverage H. property damage.\u201d <em>See </em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Policy, Attached As Exhibit B to Texaco\u2019s Memo. If this language alone were relevant to the issue of defense, the Court would have no problem with granting to Texaco summary judgment. This language, however, is not the only pertinent wording in the policy, and as discussed above, this Court is obligated to read provisions within the context of the entire policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Although a general duty to defend exists within the policy, the wording of the pollution exclusion clause creates an issue of fact as to whether or not such a duty is precluded by the exclusion. The exclusions specifically provide, in relevant part, for property damage \u201carising out of the discharge ... of ... chemicals, liquids or gases ... into or upon land, the atmosphere or any ... body of water ...\u201d Therefore, a reasonable juror could find that the instant issue of coverage arises under the exclusion, and therefore, Fireman\u2019s Fund would not be under an obligation to defend Morgan against the claims brought against him. As a result, Texaco\u2019s motion will be denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">2. CIGNA\u2019S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">CIGNA argues that the pollution exclusion provision of the insurance policy excludes coverage under the facts of this case. Specifically, CIGNA contends that the leakage of gasoline was a long term occurrence and therefore does not fall under the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d exception to the pollution exclusion, which has the effect of removing an incident from exclusion by Fireman Fund\u2019s policy. <em>See </em>CIGNA\u2019s Response at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">Neither the courts of the Virgin Islands, nor the Restatements of Law have discussed the pollution exclusion in regard to the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d provision. In instances where there is no Virgin Island law on a topic, courts must first turn to the Restate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>ments of Law, as adopted by the American Law Institute. Where the Restatements do not provide guidance, then the common law as generally understood in the United States applies. 1 V.I.C. \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">There is, across the United States, disagreement between insureds and insurers concerning the meaning of the term \u201csudden and accidental\u201d within the context of the pollution exclusion. <em>See Northern Insurance Company of New York v. Aardvark Associates, Inc., </em>942 F.2d 189 (3d Cir.1991). CIGNA makes a prolonged argument that this Court, like many across the United States, should adopt the view that \u201csudden and accidental\u201d means \u201cabrupt.\u201d <em>See </em>CIGNA\u2019s Response Memo. at 22-34; <em>See e.g. E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>693 A.2d 1059 (Del.1997); <em>Armotek Industries, Inc. v. Employers Insurance of Wausau, </em>952 F.2d 756 (3d Cir.1991). Consequently, CIGNA contends, as a matter of law, Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s duty to defend is precluded by the exclusion. <em>See </em>CIGNA\u2019s Response Memo, at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Despite CIGNA\u2019s argument, this Court need not determine the definition of \u201csudden and accidental,\u201d as there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to the onset and duration of the alleged leaks that occurred. CIGNA cites to Texaco\u2019s November 30, 1987 response to EPA\u2019s Information Request as evidence of the protracted timing of the leaks. <em>See </em>Exhibit B to Leodori Affidavit. Neither Texaco\u2019s response of November 30, 1987, nor any submission to this Court, however, makes clear whether or not the suspected leaks that occurred were abrupt or protracted in timing. Looking at the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, a reasonable juror could find that the leaks were \u201cabrupt\u201d in nature. If found to be abrupt, the ambiguity of the term \u201csudden and accidental\u201d would be irrelevant to the case. Thus, a genuine issue remains to be heard and decided by the trier of fact as to Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">C. KNOWN LOSS DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">CIGNA also contends that the doctrines of \u201cKnown Loss\u201d and \u201cLoss in Progress\u201d preclude any obligations on CIGNA\u2019s part to either Morgan or Texaco under the alleged policies. <em>See </em>CIGNA\u2019s Response Memo, at 34. The known loss doctrine is \u201cbased on the fundamental principle that insurance is intended to cover risks which are not definitely known to the insured.\u201d <em>Continental Insurance Company v. Beecham, Inc., </em>836 F.Supp. 1027, 1045 (D.N.J.1993). In contrast, the loss in progress doctrine provides that \u201cone cannot insure a loss that is already in progress.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">The doctrines are founded in the attempt to prevent fraud. <em>See Inland Waters Pollution Control, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>997 F.2d 172, 179 (6th Cir.1993). Insurance policies are created \u201cto protect against fortuitous occasions, but when they are misused to protect against certainties, fraud results.\u201d <em>Astro Pak Corporation v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, </em>284 N.J.Super. 491, 497, 665 A.2d 1113, 1116 (App.Div.1995) (citations omitted). Specificity is vital to these doctrines. In pleading these arguments, \u201cit is crucial for the insurer to clearly articulate that the risk or loss concern refers to a specific risk or loss. In other the words, the doctrine does not apply when an insured simply knows there is \u2018a\u2019 risk of loss, because knowledge of that fact is the very purpose of acquiring insurance ...\u201d 7 Couch on Insurance \u00a7 102:8 (3d ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">CIGNA argues that since Morgan and Texaco knew about the substantial discharge of gasoline from Texaco\u2019s underground storage tanks and fuel delivery system by September 1976, the doctrines of known loss and loss in progress preclude any alleged insurance coverage after the date of discovery. <em>See </em>CIGNA\u2019s Response Memo, at 34. This argument lacks merit. Each alleged leak was a separate and distinct occurrence. For example, Fireman\u2019s Fund issued policies from January 3, 1976 through January 3, 1977, during which time an alleged 2,200 gallons of gasoline leaked from a pipe joint. This is one incident of possible liability about which CIGNA does not contest its potential coverage. Fireman Fund also insured Morgan from January 3, 1977 until January 3, 1978, during which time a <em>separate </em>incident occurred due to a leak in a fuel delivery line. This incident had nothing to do with the original leak and therefore is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>a \u201cknown loss\u201d or \u201closs in progress.\u201d In reviewing the evidence submitted thus far, Fireman\u2019s Fund has not demonstrated as a matter of law that the incidents of leakage were a continuation of one another. Accordingly, without other proof from CIGNA, the doctrines of known loss and loss in progress are not applicable to the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">D. THE RELEASE AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">CIGNA\u2019s crossmotion also seeks summary judgment on Texaco\u2019s duty to defend, indemnify and hold harmless CIGNA, pursuant to the terms of the Release Agreement executed between Texaco and CIGNA. CIG-NA specifically argues that in reading the definition of \u201cEnvironmental Damage Claims\u201d stated in.\u00b62.5 in conjunction with the Release language of \u00b6 3.5, \u201cit is clear that Texaco covenanted and agreed not to bring an action of the nature now pending in this Court against CIGNA.\u201d <em>See </em>CIGNA\u2019s Response Memo. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Despite this contention, the Release Agreement does not as a matter of law state that if Texaco becomes a real party in interest to another person or entities\u2019 claims, it may not pursue those claims. Whether or not the agreement was intended to include Texaco\u2019s current position as Successor to Vernon Morgan is the ultimate issue of material fact and must be presented to a jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Second, CIGNA contends that by entering into the Assignment with Morgan,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Texaco \u201cin effect, transferred its \u2018Environmental Damage Claims\u2019 to Morgan,\u201d thereby violating the warranties contained in the CIGNA/Texaco Release Agreement. CIGNA\u2019s Response at 17. Despite this contention, a jury could very well find, given the evidence and in light of the full meaning of the Release Agreement\u2019s terms, that even if Texaco had been paying Morgan\u2019s defense, costs, the Assignment agreement between Texaco and Morgan had nothing to do with the Release Agreement between CIGNA and Texaco, so that the two agreements were entirely separate matters. Therefore, whether or not the Assignment agreement between Texaco and Morgan transferred any claims that were included in the scope of the Release Agreement is a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">In addition, CIGNA argues that Texaco settled <em>Total Vision, Four Winds, </em>and <em>Harthman </em>actions on Morgan\u2019s behalf. However, CIGNA cannot, as a matter of law, demonstrate that this signifies that the Release Agreement includes by definition all of Morgan\u2019s interests. For this Court to jump to such a conclusion without a trial of the facts would ultimately transform Texaco, an oil company, into an insurance provider for Vernon Morgan, when a jury could find that CIGNA was the intended insurance company-</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">Finally, CIGNA contends that an a'greement must be, as a matter of law, construed so as to give effect to all of its parts, and any construction which would render any of its terms meaningless must be avoided. <em>See </em>CIGNA\u2019s Response at 18, <em>citing Western United Life Assurance Company v. Hayden, </em>64 F.3d 833, 837 (3d Cir.1995); <em>Pan Am. Realty Trust v. Twenty One Kings, Inc., </em>408 F.2d 937, 939 (3d Cir.1969). The Release Agreement can be construed to give effect to all of its parts without necessarily including Texaco, as successor to Vernon Morgan, bringing claims against CIGNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-16\">For example, the Release Agreement states that \u201cTexaco and HIL hereby release and discharge CIGNA from any liability, duty or obligation, ...\u201d Release Agreement at \u00b6 4.1 \u201cTexaco\u201d is defined in \u00b6 2.9. Despite this seemingly comprehensive definition of Texaco, there is no demonstration, as a matter of law, that \u201cTexaco\u201d would include Vernon Morgan\u2019s claims. Following this logic, it is an issue of material fact as to whether or not Morgan is Texaco\u2019s \u201cPredecessor\u201d (or any other inclusive term) with respect to the Release Agreement. The Release Agreement does not, as a matter of law, include claims brought on behalf of Vernon Morgan. Therefore, no responsibility on the part of Texaco to defend, indemnify, and hold CIGNA harmless, is automatically triggered pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>suant to the Release Agreement. A jury must first interpret the limits of the Release Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">For the above stated reasons, Texaco and CIGNA\u2019s motions for partial summary judgment are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">THIS MATTER having come before this Court on the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment of TEXACO, INC. and TEXACO CARIBBEAN, INC., (\u201cTexaco\u201d) Successor to Vernon Morgan and on the Crossmotion for Summary Judgment by CIGNA Corporation, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, as a former member company of AFIA, AFIA, an unincorporated association, improperly designated ,as AFIA Worldwide Insurance, CIGNA International Corporation and Insurance Company of North America (\u201cCIGNA\u201d);</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">The Court having reviewed the record and the submissions of the parties; and</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">For the reasons stated in the Court\u2019s opinion of this date;</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">IT IS this <em>15th </em>day of December, 1998 HEREBY</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">ORDERED that TEXACO\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is DENIED; and it is FURTHER ORDERED THAT CIGNA\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-19\">.

Because this Court is denying Texaco\u2019s motion for summary judgment, it is unnecessary to address points VI, VII, and VIII of CIGNA's Response memorandum. The Court, however, must continue its analysis, as CIGNA in its Response to Texaco\u2019s motion, seeks summary judgment on the same issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">. In its Reply Brief, CIGNA attempts to argue that it is Tutu Texaco Service Station, Inc. not Morgan who is insured under Policy SMP 4926. This is an unsupported argument, as Morgan, the sole stockholder and employee of the service station would be included as a \"person insured\u201d under the coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
