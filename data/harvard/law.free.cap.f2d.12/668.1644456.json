O. Box 146, Mullan, Ida., 8-6-26,\u201d and found by the agents in searching the pool room.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The court, over defendant\u2019s objection, admitted a torn-off part of the newspaper containing the address label heretofore referred to. The label was pasted over part of the title, \u201cIndustrialisti.\u201d Below the title appeared the date September 13, 1925, and across the front of the lop of the page were headlines \u201cI. W. W.,\u201d followed by several words printed in a foreign language, probably Finnish. On the reverse side, the print was entirely in a foreign language, except an announcement at the head of the column that the Industrialisti is the only Finnish daily organ of industrial unionism in America, and is published by the \"Workers\u2019 Socialist Publishing Company at Duluth, Minn. The district attorney called the attention of the jury to the address and the figures indicating the date.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The defendant made no special objection to the admission of the address label, but argues that part of the paper admitted shows that it is a \u201cradical I. W. W. newspaper\u201d and was calculated to prejudice the minds of the jury against defendant. The argument is without evidential support. The record contains no translation of the headlines or of the other matter printed in a foreign language. How, therefore, can defendant expect the court to say that the paper was calculated to prejudice the jury, or that it tended to show that defendant was in sympathy with an organization \u201cin ill repute with good American citizens\u201d ? Kumpula v. United States, 261 F. 49,171 C. C. A. 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">During the course of the trial counsel for the government asked defendant whether Jack Maki, to whom defendant had testified he had rented the place, had not been taken therefrom and convicted for violation of the National Prohibition Act. Defendant objected to the question. Thereupon the district attorney contended that the inquiry was admissible, and added: \u201cThey say he is a law-abiding citizen. Every man in that pool hall was taken from it and either skipped their bonds or served time.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the statements of the district attorney as prejudicial and improper before the jury. The court sustained the objection. Counsel urges that the remarks of the district attorney were prejudicial. But, in the absence of a motion to strike them out, or of a request for an instruction in relation thereto, defendant is in no position to assert error. McDonough v. United States (C. C. A.) 299 F. 30, certiorari denied 266 U. S. 613, 45 S. Ct. 95, 69 L. Ed. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">The court committed no error in allowing a witness to testify that he was acquainted with the general reputation of the Haparanta bar as a place where intoxicating liquor was kept and sold more or less continuously during the six or eight months prior to September 16, 1925.

Cr. 721, 196 P. 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">We have considered the other assignments, and find no ground for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
