In the Ereund patent the wire glass disclosed as used in illuminating slabs for roofing is stated to be \u2018comparatively thin,\u2019 and obviously any thickness can be used.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">The Commissioner of Patents affirmed the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">We affirm the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, upon the ground that the references disclose that the applicant\u2019s claim has been anticipated, and his construction is old in the art.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
