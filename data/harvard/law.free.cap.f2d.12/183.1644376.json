An appeal was taken to the Commissioner of Patents, who affirmed the. Examiner\u2019s deei-sion. Hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The record discloses that the appellee corporation and its predecessors began the manufacture of locks and keys and other hardware in the year 1868, and then adopted the word \u201cYale\u201d as its trade-mark, that being the name of its founders. It has continuously ever since used the word as its trademark, and registered it under the 10-year user proviso of the 1905 act and the supplementary amendment of 1920 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1923, \u00a7 9490). It has advertised the mark for its products, especially its locks and keys, for a long time, at great expense, and the mark has become a commercial asset of very great value.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The appellant corporation, on the other hand, was incorporated in the year 1912, under the name of \u201cInterstate Electric Novelty Company.\u201d In 1919 its name was changed to \u201cFranco Electric Corporation.\u201d In April, 1922, it changed its name to \u201cYale Electric Corporation,\u201d and began selling its products under the name of \u201cYale,\u201d and in November of that year it filed its present application for a registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Upon these facts, and the other proofs contained in the record, we are convinced that the mark sought to be registered is in substance and reality the word \u201cYale\u201d alone, notwithstanding the elliptical and octagonal lines surrounding it in the drawing; that the name \u201cYale\u201d is, and long has been, the salient and characteristic feature of the opposeris corporate name, and the well-known trade-mark under which it has advertised and marketed its products; that the goods of the respective parties are in part sold in the same trade, and are sufficiently alike to probably cause confusion or mistake in the public mind, if offered for sale under the same mark. See Duro Pump &amp; Manufacturing Co. v. California Cedar Products Co., App. D. C.\u2014 , 11 F.(2d) 205, decision of this court handed down February lr 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">We therefore affirm the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, sustaining the appellee\u2019s opposition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
