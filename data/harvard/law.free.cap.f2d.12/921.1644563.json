The corollary to this rule is that under the act no beneficiary has or can have any rights as against the insurer \u2014 i. e., the United States \u2014 except such as have been given and not taken away by the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">The difference between the policy at bar and many issued by private companies is fundamental. In the latter a policy becomes a contract between the insured and the assignee, i. e., the beneficiary; while the status of policies like Stealing's has been authoritatively declared in White v. United States, 46 S. Ct. 274, 70 L. Ed.-, filed March 1, 1926, thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-12\">\u201cThe insurance was a contract, to be sure, * *- * but it was not one entered into by the United States for gain. <em>* </em>\u2019* * ' It was a relation of benevolence, established by the government at considerable cost to itself, for the soldier\u2019s good. * * * If the soldier was willing to put himself into the government\u2019s hands, * * * no one else could complain. The only relations of contract were between the government and him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">At trial plaintiff asserted, \u201cOur action is an action on contract,\u201d and so it is in form\u2014 an action on the policy. The trouble is that the policy does not and cannot express a contract between his beneficiary and the government, until (at all events) the beneficiary\u2019s interest vests by death of the insured; and on this point we quote from the White Case, supra, changing names to suit the present litigation: \u201cSterling\u2019s wife\u2019s interest at his death was vested only so far as he and the government had made it so. They did agree to terms that cut her rights down to\u201d nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-19\">Plaintiff seems to think that physical possession of the policy enabled her to prevent Sterling and the government doing what they otherwise admittedly had good right to do. But the policy was evidence of contract, nothing more; and the Treasury, having statutory power to make regulations, could and did regulate the unexpected case of a hostile wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-20\">We hold that the beneficiary was properly changed, and the verdict below should have been .directed for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-21\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
