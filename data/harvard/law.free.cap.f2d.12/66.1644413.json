Such evidence properly, may be considered in determining whether the person sought to be surrendered is or is not the one charged with crime, and whether he was or was not in the demanding state when the crime is alleged to have been committed. Munsey v. Clough, 196 U. S. 364, 374, 25 S. Ct. 282, 49 L. Ed. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The evidence adduced on the hearing under the writ of habeas corpus was not such as to require the conclusion that the finding of the Governor of Louisiana, evidenced by his warrant of arrest, that the appellant was a fugitive, was clearly overthrown. That finding must stand, as it was not clearly overthrown. Hogan v. O\u2019Neill, 255 U. S. 52, 41 S. Ct. 222, 65 L. Ed. 497. The record does not show that error was committed in discharging the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
