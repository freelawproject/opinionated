St. \u00a7 10365). The motion in arrest was based on the ground that that count failed to charge that the letter alleged to have been opened by the accused was \u201cintrusted to him\u201d or \u201ccame into his possession\u201d as a postal employee, within the meaning of the cited statute. The above-quoted language of the count imports that, when the letter mentioned was opened by the accused, it was in his possession as postmaster. We are of opinion that that count sufficiently informed the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and that the judgment was not subject to be arrested on the ground relied on.
