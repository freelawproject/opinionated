They also alleged that the sums paid Gordon under the con-. tracts were received by him fraudulently. The respondent was alleged to be insolvent, \u25a0 and to have committed specific acts of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-18\">Answers were filed denying the allegations of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">When the ease was called for hearing, the District Court refused to hear evidence in support of the petition, and dismissed it on the ground that the petitioner\u2019s claims, though contractual, were not liquidated, and therefore they did not qualify as petitioning creditors having provable claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-20\">In thus ruling the court erred. It should have received the petitioners\u2019 evidence, and determined the questions arising on the petition. Unliquidated claims arising out of contract are provable, within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St. \u00a7 9585 et seq.), although damage claims for tort are not. 1 Remington on Bankruptcy, \u00a7 257; Grant Shoe Co. v. Laird Co., 212 U. S. 445, 29 S. Ct. 332, 53 L. Ed. 591; Clarke v.

A. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-22\">The decree of the District Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, with costs tb the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
