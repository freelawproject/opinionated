TMs doctrine would require a landlord at Ms peril to always keep Ms leased premises in such a condition that law-breakers could not enter same and commit crime. It would est\u00e1blish that in leasing property it must always be presumed that a trespass or crime may be committed thereon, and that the landlord owes the duty of protecting Ms tenant against the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">As we understand the law, a landlord is not liable to Ms tenants for interference by third persons with the tenant\u2019s possession and business, when no wrongful act of the landlord is shown. 36 Corpus Juris, p. 70; 38 Cyc. 1038; Talbott v. English, 156 Ind. 299, 59 N. E. 857; Worth v. Ware, 90 Neb. 443,133 N. W. 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The proximate cause of the injury here complained of was not the condition of the partition, but was the unlawful criminal act of independent moral agencies, over wMch defendant had no control, with wMch he was not in collusion, and for whose acts he was not responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">We have not referred to the allegation in the declaration that defendant erected the partition in question without first obtaining a permit so to do, as required by section 18 of the Building Code of the District, because it is not claimed that the partition was not, in fact, so constructed as to comply with the law, and also because we do not see how it can in any way render the defendant liable in tMs case. In our view, it makes no difference whether or not he failed to advise plaintiffs just how the partition was constructed, because, for the purpose for wMch it was put in place, it was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
