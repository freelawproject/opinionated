The motion was heard before a judge of the District Court, who entered a decree dismissing the bill, and this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-20\">We are of the opinion that the court erred in dismissing the bill. It is conceded that the District Court, as a federal court and as a court of equity, had jurisdiction and authority to entertain the bill. The mere pendeney of the prior suit in the state court, involving the same subject-matter, did not necessarily operate as a bar to the present proceeding and justify its dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-21\">The complainants\u2019 bill is not a proceeding in rem or to try the title to property, nor does it involve the exercise of possession or control over specific property. Had the respective bills been proceedings in rem or to try the title to property or involved the possession or control of specific property, the jurisdiction of the state court having first attached, the federal court would he precluded from exercising its jurisdiction over the same property to defeat or impair the state court\u2019s jurisdiction, and the bill properly might have been dismissed. But such is not the case, for the bill seeks a personal judgment or decree against the defendants and the dismissal was not authorized. See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226, 43 S. Ct. 79, 67 L. Ed. 226, 24 A. L. R. 1077; McClellan v. Carland, 217 U. S. 268; 30 S. Ct. 501, 54 L. Ed. 762; Boston <em>&amp; </em>Maine R. R. v. Dutille (C. C. A.) 289 F. 320; Covell v. Heyman, 111 U. S. 176, 182, 4 S. Ct. 355, 28 L. Ed. 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">The decree of the District Court is reversed, and the ease is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, with costs to the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
