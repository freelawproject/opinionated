St. \u00a7 1030) by obtaining authority to do business in Illinois, naming a place of business in that state and an agent upon whom service could there be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-22\">Those facts do not constitute a waiver. Keasbey <em>&amp; </em>Mattison Co., 160 U. S. 221, 229, 16 S. Ct. 273, 40 L. Ed. 402. It will serve no good purpose to discuss this question further, except to say that, from a study of the Hohorst Case, 150 U. S. 653, 14 S. Ct. 221, 37 L. Ed. 1211, relied upon by appellant as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>supporting his contention (and many other cases easily found in the books bearing upon the question), in connection with the statutes relating to jurisdiction and venue, it is found that the dismissal by the District Court must be affirmed. Section 48 was not enacted until 1897 (29 Stat. p. 695). In Lumiere v. Wilder, Inc., 261 U. S. 174, 177, 43 S. Ct. 312, 313, 67 L. Ed. 596, the Supreme Court said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-4\">\u201cOrdinarily a civil suit to enforce a personal liability under a federal statute can be brought only in the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant. Judicial Code, \u00a7 51. In a few classes of eases, a carefully limited right to sue elsewhere has been given. In patent cases it is the district of which the defendant is an inhabitant, or in which acts of infringement have been committed, and the defendant has a regular and established place of business. Judicial Code, \u00a7 48; W. S. Tyler Co. v. Ludlow-Saylor Wire Co., 236 U. S. 723 [35 S. Ct. 458, 59 L. Ed. 80S].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
