The presence of this boat was not a proximate and contributing cause of the damages recovered herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-18\">The decree below is modified, so as to discharge the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and, as modified, affirmed, with the costs of this court to the appellant owner of tug No. 10.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
