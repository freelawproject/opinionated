Writ dated March 5, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-10\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Lana, </em>J. The plaintiff was the only witness who testified as to facts bearing on the question of liability of the defendant. The facts are stated in the opinion. \u201cAt the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the presiding judge ordered a verdict for the defendant without requiring the defendant to rest, and at the request of the plaintiff reported the case for the determination of the full court, \u2014 if the ruling was right, judgment to be entered on the verdict; if wrong, the case to be remanded for a new trial.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-11\"><em>F.

From these facts, the jury could draw the inferences that she was in the exercise of due care, that the conductor was negligent in starting the car before she had reached a place of safety upon it, and, if her hold was so broken, that the motorman was- negligent in the manner in which he started the car. <em>Rand </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated </em>Railway, 198 Mass. 569. <em>Lacour </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>200 Mass. 34. <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Pittsfield Electric Street Railway, </em>203 Mass. 283.
