The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was working in a railroad yard, where there were frequent shiftings of cars and passing of locomotives, and he was repairing a track called \u201cthirteen,\u201d adjoining and branching from which was another called \u201cfifteen.\u201d There was evidence tending to show that one Currier, who was the conductor of a shifting crew in this yard, asked the plaintiff\u2019s intestate if he could set \u201ctwo cars in \u201d on track \u201c\u2022 thirteen,\u201d and he was answered, \u201c Yes, you can, but you can\u2019t bother me any more until I have this job done.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Currier replied, \u201c All right,\u201d and soon after put two cars on that track. About half an hour later by Currier\u2019s direction a car was shunted on to track \u201c fifteen \u201d which struck the plaintiff\u2019s intestate as he was stooping at his work on track \u201c thirteen,\u201d very near its junction with track \u201c fifteen \u201d and where the two tracks were ten to eighteen inches apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">It is plain that if there had been no talk between Currier and her intestate the plaintiff could not recover. It was said in <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>184 Mass. 368, 371, \u201c By the nature of his employment a section hand on a steam railroad must look out for passing trains, and such is the settled law of the Commonwealth.\u201d The same rule applies in a freight yard where the danger arises from single cars, locomotives or parts of trains. <em>Byrnes </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>195 Mass. 437. <em>Dolphin </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>182 Mass. 509. <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>159 Mass. 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The conversation with Currier was susceptible of the interpretation that he, being in charge of the shifting, agreed with the plaintiff\u2019s intestate that no cars after the two specifically mentioned would be sent down upon any track in such a way as to interfere with the work the latter was doing on track \u201c thirteen.\u201d If this was found to be the fair import of the language used, then the intestate while so engaged and relying upon this, assurance was relieved of the duty of watchfulness as to cars coming from Currier\u2019s engine. <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>New York, New </em>Haven, <em>Hartford Railroad, </em>188 Mass. 420. <em>Santore </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>203 Mass. 437. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>New </em>York, <em>New </em>Haven, <em>Hartford </em>Railroad, 182 Mass. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
