Street Railway.</em>\n</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b130-10\">If after a street car has come to a full stop the conductor makes way for a woman passenger to get out and she starts to do so, but while she is stepping from the car it starts suddenly and she is thrown to the ground and is injured, these facts are evidence of due care on the part of the passenger and of negligence on the part of either the conductor or the motorman of the car.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-11\">Tort for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by the plaintiff on March 16,1909, by reason of the sudden starting of a box car of the defendant, on which the plaintiff was a passenger, while she was in the act of alighting from it. Writ dated April 16, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-12\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Morton, </em>J., who at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence ordered a verdict for the defendant on the ground that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant.

This was enough to justify the jury in finding that she was in the exercise of due care, having been invited by the conductor to go out of the car, and that either the conductor or the motorman was negligent in starting the car while she was in the act of leaving it. <em>Worthen </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk Railway, </em>125 Mass. 99. <em>Barden </em>v. <em>Boston, Clinton Fitchburg Railroad, </em>121 Mass. 426. <em>Floytrup </em>v. <em>Boston </em>&amp; <em>Maine Railroad, </em>163 Mass. 152, 155. <em>McGlinchy </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>206 Mass. 7. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>206 Mass. 80. The case is not at all like <em>O'Neil </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston Railroad, </em>180 Mass. 576, or <em>Curtin </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>194 Mass. 260, relied on by the defendant. This accident was not caused by any jerk of the car in starting or stopping, but by making a sudden start after the car had come to a full stop for passengers to alight, and while the plaintiff was in the act of alighting.
