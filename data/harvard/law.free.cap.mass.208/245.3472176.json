He has brought this bill against the defendants as trustees of certain property put in trust in 1884 by Mrs. Culliton (who later became Mrs. Chase), seeking to have them directed to hold that property in trust for him. The bill is also brought against the defendants as trustees of certain other property held by them under the will of Mrs. Chase\u2019s mother, and the plaintiff seeks to have them directed to hold in trust for him that portion of the property of Mrs. Chase\u2019s mother the income of which was payable to Mrs. Chase during her life. The basis of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in both cases is the same, namely: On Mrs. Chase\u2019s death her adopted son Woodruff Chase was her only heir and next of kin, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>plaintiff is the only heir and next of kin of his son Woodruff. But th\u00e9 decree affirmed in <em>Phillips </em>v. Chase, 203 Mass. 556, decided that Woodruff Chase never was Mrs. Chase\u2019s heir. That question is <em>res judicata </em>between the plaintiff on the one side and Mrs. Chase\u2019s next of kin by blood on the other; and it is Mrs. Chase\u2019s next of kin by blood who are the persons beneficially interested in the trust property here in question if the plaintiff\u2019s claim through his son is not a good one. It is of no consequence that the plaintiff has brought the bill against the trustees alone, that is to say, without having joined as parties defendant those beneficially interested in the property. The next of kin by blood are the real parties defendant in the case at bar, and the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>applies as much as if they were technically the parties and the only parties to this cause. See <em>In re Defries ; Norton </em>v. Levy, 48 L. T. (N. S.) 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">For that reason it is not necessary to consider the fact that the question decided in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Chase </em>was a question of status, as to which see <em>Hood </em>v. Hood, 110 Mass. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">This disposes of all the plaintiff\u2019s claim except his claim as statutory heir of his wife. This claim is confined to the first property mentioned above. By the terms of that trust this property was to be divided on Mrs. Chase\u2019s death \u201c precisely as said Jeannie P. Culliton had then died unmarried, intestate and possessed of said property in her own right.\u201d The plaintiff asks us to read into the agreement creating that trust after the word \u201c unmarried \u201d the words \u201c to said Culliton,\u201d so that the agreement shall read \u201cprecisely as if said Jeannie P. Culliton had then died unmarried to said Culliton, intestate and possessed of said property in her own right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s first contention is that if the agreement is construed literally it is void because in fraud of the plaintiff\u2019s marital rights. That contention cannot be maintained. This agreement was made in February, 1884. At that time Mrs. Chase was the wife of Culliton. She did not get a divorce from Culliton until June, 1888, and she was married to the plaintiff in January, 1889. Apart from the difficulties raised by the cases of <em>Kelley </em>v. Snow, 185 Mass. 288, and <em>Leonard </em>v. Leonard, 181 Mass. 458, it is plain that the agreement was not in fact made in fraud of the marital rights of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>His second contention is that the words used by Mrs. Culliton should not be given their natural meaning and he has sought to support this contention by citing a great number of cases, beginning with <em>Maberly </em>v. Strode, 3 Ves. 450, and ending with <em>In re Brydone\u2019s </em>settlement, [1903] 2 Ch. 84. These are cases in which the context has led the court to construe the words \u201c die unmarried \u201d to mean die a widow in place of die a spinster. The plaintiff especially relies on <em>Clarke </em>v. Colls, 9 H. L. Cas. 601, and goes so far as to say that it \u201c covers our case exactly except that as a husband is here a direct heir he would come in as such in the first instance instead of through the child.-\u201d That case may be taken as an example of the application to the case at bar of the cases cited by the plaintiff. <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Colls </em>was the case of a marriage settlement of the property of the prospective wife, in which it was provided (in effect) that if her children did not inherit as therein provided the property should go as if she \u201c had died possessed thereof intestate and unmarried.\u201d She died in giving birth to a boy and her son survived her one day. On her husband\u2019s death his legal representative claimed the property as the next of kin of the son. It was held that the words \u201c as if she died intestate and unmarried\u201d meant as if she died intestate and a widow, not as if she died intestate without having been married. This conclusion was reached for the reason that if she had survived her husband and had married again and had had children, the property would have gone to collateral kindred to the exclusion of her own children if the word \u201cunmarried\u201d were construed to mean without having had a husband. The result reached in that case was that the father took, and in the case at bar the plaintiff is trying to make out that he, the father, takes. But there is no other respect in which the two cases are alike. The father took there because his child took and it was held that it could not be assumed that a marriage settlement is intended to exclude the children of any marriage and give the property to collateral kindred. And again, what was done there was to construe the words \u201c if she died intestate and unmarried \u201d to mean if she died a widow. But this plaintiff is not now asking us to construe the words of this agreement in that way. So construed he does not take. What the plaintiff asks us to do is to construe those words to mean as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>if she died unmarried to her first husband. This long array of eases does not help the plaintiff in that contention. All that they decide is that the context may show whether \u201c die unmarried \u201d means die a widow rather than die a spinster.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The context in the case at bar not only does not help the plaintiff in this contention of his but it affords additional reasons for not reading into the agreement the words he asks us to read into it. The whole of the clause relied upon by the plaintiff is in these words: \u201c It being distinctly understood that the said William H. Culliton is not to be included among her heirs-at-law, and that neither he nor his legal representatives are to receive upon the death of said Jeannie P. Culliton any portion of said trust property, which upon her death is to be divided precisely as if the said Jeannie P. Culliton had then died unmarried, intestate and possessed of said property in her own right.\u201d By the first clause Mrs. Culliton, as she was then, had provided that Culliton \u201c is not to be included among her heirs-at-law,\u201d and that \u201c neither he nor his legal representatives are to receive upon the death of said Jeannie P. Culliton any portion of said trust property.\u201d The clause here in question presumably was inserted to add something to that provision. What Mrs. Culliton added was: \u201c which [trust property] is to be divided precisely as if the said Jeannie P. Culliton had then died unmarried, intestate and possessed of said property in her own right.\u201d Culliton was excluded by the first clause. The second clause was to exclude all persons except those who would take if she died unmarried and intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">But in addition to that, construed in the light of Mrs. Culliton\u2019s experience in marrying Culliton, there is every reason to suppose that she wanted to arrange this property (as the words used by her say) so that it would not be an inducement to another man to marry her, that is to say, so that no husband would take it on her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\n<em>Bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
