A finding that they were made before the com. mencement of the actions was justified by the fact that they were given in reply to a letter sent on July 25, 1905, and that the paper bears date July 26, 1905. The actions were not commenced until March 7, 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The paper, taken in connection with the manner of obtaining it, bears internal evidence that the answers were made upon the personal knowledge of the writer, sufficient to warrant the finding to that effect.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AU0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>J.
