The jury were warranted in finding the following facts. On the morning in question the plaintiff, with two other employees, was engaged under the immediate supervision of the defendant\u2019s superintendent in rolling a wheel from the sand mould in which it was cast the day before. The wheel weighed fifteen hundred pounds, its edges were rough and it was still hot. The men were provided with rags to enable them to hold the wheel. After the wheel had been rolled by the three employees for some \u201c two or three rounds,\u201d the superintendent called off the third man, who had been walking backward holding the wheel in front of him, leaving the plaintiff and the other man in charge of the wheel, one on each side of it. One of the witnesses testified that what the superintendent said at this time was: \u201cTwo men take the wheel out and one of you men come here and do something else.\u201d There was a conflict in the evidence on this point. Some of the witnesses testified that the superintendent told the two to hold the wheel while the third man should clean the pathway and open a door for the wheel to go through. The plaintiff and the other employee continued rolling the wheel, but (in the words of one of his witnesses) they \u201c couldn\u2019t keep hold of it and it fell,\u201d crushing the plaintiff\u2019s foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The defendant has contended that the plaintiff was not in the exercise of due care. But that contention is based solely on the ground that the plaintiff disobeyed the superintendent\u2019s order to \u201chold the wheel.\u201d As we have seen, the evidence on that point was in conflict, and this contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">We are of opinion that, having in mind the weight of the wheel, the fact that it was hot, and the further fact that the superintendent originally put three men on the job, the jury were warranted in finding that two men were too few to roll it while it was hot, and that it was negligence on his part to tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the two to continue to roll it after he had called the third man away if the jury found that to be the fact.
