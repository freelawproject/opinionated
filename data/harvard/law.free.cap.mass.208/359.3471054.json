The plaintiff used the day book to refresh his recollection both on his direct examination and on his cross-examination. The defendant denied that the coal was ordered or was delivered. The judge in the course of his charge said to the jury, \u201c There are on the one hand the books, a record made of a sale, and on the other hand the memory of a man.\u201d The defendant excepted to this on the ground that the judge assumed that there was a record in evidence, the account book of the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that this exception could not be sustained, because the presiding judge in referring <em>to </em>the plaintiff\u2019s account book did not say or assume that it was in evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b385-10\">In an action against three trustees, for the price of coal alleged to have been delivered at a building owned by the defendants, where the defendants denied that the coal was ordered or was delivered, the plaintiff testified that he had sold coal to the defendants before on an order given by F, who was one of the defendants, and that he was sure that F had ordered the coal for the defendants although he knew that F was also a trustee of another real estate association in the same town. The defendants did not call F as a witness, and the j udge in the course of his charge instructed the jury that if they thought that F should have been produced as a Witness by the defendants they could give such weight as they thought fit to the fact that he had not been produced. <em>Held, </em>that there was no error in this instruction.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b385-11\">A charge of the judge presiding at a trial, which was objected to as argumentative, here was held not to be in violation of R.

There is a suggestion made by the introduction of Freeman as the trustee, or one of the trustees of the Everett Real Estate Association, that it might have gone there. Freeman has not testified. When a witness is introduced as knowing something about the possible outcome of a trial, and as being able to bring some information and he is not brought by the party who would naturally bring him, whom you would naturally expect to' bring him, you have a right to infer from his absence that if brought his evidence would not be favorable. Uow, Freeman being an associate of Fuller, if there is any intimation that the coal went to Freeman\u2019s building instead of to Fuller\u2019s building, whether there was any obligation to bring him here to inform you of that fact is for you to determine. If you say there was no obligation, you will disregard it. If you say he is getting up such a claim .as that and Freeman should be brought here, you have the right to draw whatever inference you say you ought to draw from the fact that he is not brought here. Whether you say he ought to have brought him or not is entirely for you to judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">\u201c There are on the one hand the books, a record made of a sale, and on the other part the memory of man, and it is for you to determine with the burden of proof upon the plaintiff. The burden is upon the plaintiff in this as in every other case to establish the fact of a sale and delivery by a fair preponderance of the evidence; and that, as I have told you in previous cases and as the counsel for the defendant has reiterated here, if it leaves you in just a balanced state of mind, that does not sustain the burden of proof. The burden of proof is only sustained when the scales tip in favor of the propositions that one party or the other must establish in order to maintain the action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\">\u201c On the matter of the record, I said a record made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ordinary course of business.

The plaintiff testified that he took the order over the telephone from the defendant Fuller, and Fuller testified that he never gave it. In the course of his testimony the plaintiff referred to his day book which was not put in evidence. He explained that it was his practice when an order was given to write it out on a piece of paper which was kept until the order was filled by the delivery of the coal. Then, after the order stated on the slip had been filled, it and the method of filling it were entered on the day book and the slip was thrown away. The plaintiff used the day book to refresh his recollection both on direct and cross-examination, and without objection. The defendants were three trustees who owned the building in question. On cross-examination the plaintiff testified that he had sold coal to the defendants before on an order given by Freeman who was one of the trustees. He was sure that Freeman had ordered coal for the defendants although he knew that Freeman was also trustee of another real estate association in the same town. The three teamsters whose names appeared on the day book as having delivered the coal testified that they did deliver it and the defendant\u2019s janitor testified that no coal was delivered at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">In the course of his charge to the jury the judge told them that \u201c there are on the one hand the books, a record made of a sale, and on the other part the memory of man.\u201d To this part of the charge the defendants took an exception. Their argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ment in support of that exception is that the judge assumed that there was a record in evidence, the account book of the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s account book was not in evidence and the presiding judge did not say or assume that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\">The judge also told the jury that if they thought Mr. Freeman should have been produced as a witness by the defendants they could give such weight as they saw fit to the fact that he had not been produced. There was no error in that.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The last exception is on the ground that the charge of the judge was argumentative, and in support of that contention the defendant has relied on <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Boston Northern Street </em>Railway, 201 Mass. 186, and <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Wellesley Boston Street </em>Railway, 197 Mass. 495. We find nothing in the first of these cases which bears on this question and the charge is not a violation of R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 80, within the rule laid down in the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\n<em>Bxceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
