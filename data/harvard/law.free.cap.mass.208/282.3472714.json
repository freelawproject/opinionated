Writ dated January 16, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-10\">The declaration contained three counts, the first count alleging negligence of a superintendent of the defendant under B. L. c. 106, \u00a7 71, cl. 2, the second alleging a defect in the ways, works or machinery of the defendant under cl. 1, and the third alleging a cause of action at common law in that, among other things, the defendant furnished the plaintiff with unsafe and unsuitable tools, appliances and apparatus to work with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b308-11\">The case was tried before Hitchcock, J. The facts are stated in the opinion. At the close of the evidence, the defendant made four requests for rulings, the first being a request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ruling that upon all the evidence the plaintiff could not recover, and the second, third and fourth being a like request as to each count in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">The judge refused to make any of the rulings asked for. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $7,500 on the third count of the declaration; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-6\">J. <em>Lowell &amp; </em>J. <em>A. </em>Lowell, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-7\"><em>R.

If not conceded by the defendant, there was abundant evidence that the edge splintered, because the tool, having been adjusted for the thickness of the scarf to be planed off, suddenly \u201c dug in \u201d to the cylinder owing to the nut on the automatic cross feed screw, which controlled the movements of the tool, having become so worn as to produce an irregular instead of a uniform action. It also appeared that this condition, described by the witnesses as \u201clost motion,\u201d was known to the defendant\u2019s foreman of the \u201c lathe room,\u201d who must be considered as the defendant\u2019s representative. <em>Ruddy </em>v. <em>George F. Blake Manuf. Co. </em>205 Mass. 172, 181.</p>\n<p id=\"AKq\">But if there was proof of its negligence in furnishing a defective lathe, the defendant contends that the plaintiff, who knew that the machine had not been running properly, assumed the risk, or did not use ordinary prudence to ascertain if there was any lost motion before going on with the work. Ho doubt, as the mechanical experts all agreed, if the plaintiff, who was a skilful machinist and knew of the method, had shaken the cross feed apparatus, the defect although not visually apparent would have been discovered. Yet it is obvious from his evidence that this was not the situation in which he was placed at the time of the accident. Having noticed the irregularity a week before, he then called the attention of the foreman to the lathe, who directed him to perform other work, and in response to the plaintiff\u2019s offer to make the necessary repairs replied, \u201c I will have another man fix this immediately for you.\u201d If the jury believed the plaintiff, there was not only a promise to re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>pair, but a change in the plaintiffs employment while the repairs were being made. But the evidence does not end here. The superintendent on the day of the accident ordered him to resume his former work, and to use the lathe. It is settled by our decisions, that under such circumstances the plaintiff was warranted in assuming that the defect had been remedied, and the question whether by his conduct he assumed the risk, or failed to exercise ordinary care, was for the jury. <em>Jellow </em>v. <em>Fore River Ship Building Co. </em>201 Mass. 464, 467, 468. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Joseph Ross Corp. </em>204 Mass. 477, 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">A verdict having been returned only on the count at common law, the first and second requests therefore were rightly refused. Nor can the remaining exception be sustained. If we assume that the answer of the defendant\u2019s witness who was called as a mechanical expert would have supported its contention, that the breaking of the boring tool was not attributable to the lost niotion, it was for the presiding judge to decide as to his qualifications, and no abuse of this discretionary power having been shown, his adverse decision is not a ground of exception. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated </em>Railway, 200 Mass. 527, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
