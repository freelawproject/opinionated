He claims error concerning (1) the denial of his motion to suppress statements made by him to police officials; (2) the instructions to the jury; (3) the denial of a motion for mistrial based on juror misconduct;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (4) a variance between the Commonwealth\u2019s proof and its bill of particulars. Tavares also requests that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and reduce the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>to a lesser degree of guilt. We conclude that there was no reversible error. However, our review under \u00a7 33E indicates that \u201cthe verdict of conviction of murder in the [first] degree was against the weight of the evidence considered in a large or nontechnical sense . . . ,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>373 Mass. 760, 765 (1977), and we order a reduction of the verdict to murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We summarize the facts. On the evening of May 24, 1979, the defendant, age seventeen, was drinking in the third base dugout of Dias Field in New Bedford. He was accompanied by a friend, Bruce Bookman, age seventeen, and a cousin, Keith Tavares (Keith), age twenty. While in the dugout, the three collectively consumed twelve twelve-ounce cans of beer and a fifth of vodka. They decided to obtain more beer, but were fifty cents short of the purchase price. One of them approached the victim, Jesse Aranjo, as he was passing by the dugout, and asked him for fifty cents. The victim was not known to any of the three men in the dugout.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The victim responded by insulting them. He threatened to return with members of his motorcycle gang to beat them up. A fight ensued between the three men and the victim. The victim was subdued, and the defendant, aided by Keith and Bookman, removed the victim\u2019s clothing and took him into the dugout where they left him. The defendant, Keith, and Bookman then left the ballpark, the defendant taking the victim\u2019s jacket, which he later discarded, and one dollar, which he later lost. The defendant returned to the ballpark shortly thereafter to retrieve a comb he had lost during the fight and saw the victim in the dugout, trying to get up.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">1. <em>The motion to suppress. </em>The body of Jesse Aranjo was discovered at approximately 12:30 p.m. on May 25, 1979. At approximately 2 a.m. on May 26th, the defendant and a female companion went to the police station and asked the officer in charge if the police were looking for him. The officer replied that his records did not indicate that the police were looking for a David Tavares. The officer recommended that Tavares call back later in the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>At about 10:30 a.m., the police went to Tavares\u2019s house and asked him if he would voluntarily come to the station to speak with them. Tavares agreed to go to the station. At that time, Tavares knew of Aranjo\u2019s death. He also knew that the police wanted to speak to him about Aranjo. At the station, Tavares made some incriminating statements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress those statements. The defendant claims that as a result of his youth and inexperience, he made these statements without a knowing and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights as required by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. At the hearing on his motion, the defendant did not deny that he made the statements, nor did he claim that the police used force, intimidation, or trickery to obtain the statements. He also did not allege that the police denied him food, drink, or sleep or that the police used physical brutality. Further, he did not claim that the police failed to advise him of his constitutional rights. The basis for Tavares\u2019s motion was that the statements were coerced because of his lack of experience and his youthful fear of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">After the suppression hearing, the judge made the following findings of fact. At the police station, the defendant was repeatedly advised of the Miranda rights. The defendant indicated to police that he understood these warnings. Before making any statements, the defendant signed a card acknowledging that he understood his rights. Moreover, the judge found that, since the defendant had been arrested on prior occasions, he was familiar with these procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">From listening to a tape recording of the interrogation, the judge found no evidence of any threats, inducements, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>promises of reward. The tapes indicated that the defendant was coherent and appeared to understand what was said during the interrogations. The judge concluded that Tavares knowingly and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that after the waiver the defendant intelligently and voluntarily answered the questions put to him by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s findings as erroneous. He claims that his youth and inexperience vitiated his waiver,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>and that his statements were not voluntary. To support his argument, the defendant cites several studies that have suggested that youths are particularly susceptible to the inherent coerciveness of interrogations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See Gage, Protecting the Juvenile Witness, 17 J. of Family L. 439, 451 (1978); Note, Interrogations in New Haven, The Impact of Miranda, 76 Yale L.J. 1519, 1577 (1967). Relying on these studies, the defendant claims that because of his special sensitivity to police pressure in his first statement to the police, he took more than his share of responsibility for the fight with Aranjo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial judge\u2019s determination that a voluntary waiver was made, the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>not be disturbed, if they are warranted by the evidence, and his resolution of conflicting testimony will be accepted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santo, </em>375 Mass. 299, 303 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tabor, </em>376 Mass. 811, 822 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>362 Mass. 542, 550 (1972) (Hennessey, J., concurring). Although the judge\u2019s ultimate findings are open for review, \u201ca finding of voluntary waiver is \u2018entitled to substantial deference by this court.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>374 Mass. 132, 138 (1977), aff\u2019d, 439 U.S. 280 (1978).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tabor, supra. </em>However, \u201c [o]ur appellate function requires that we make our independent determination on the correctness of the judge\u2019s \u2018application of constitutional principles to the facts as found . . . .\u2019 <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>430 U.S. 387, 403 (1977).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 550 (1977). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilborne, </em>382 Mass. 241, 251 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">A judge\u2019s finding that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights is not the only prerequisite to admissibility. A judicial determination of voluntariness is also constitutionally required. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368 (1964). \u201cIn determining admissibility in the first instance the judge is undoubtedly bound by the dictates of <em>Miranda, </em>i.e., if its prerequisites have not been fully met, the confession is without more involuntary as a matter of law, hence inadmissible and insubmissible. But an incriminating statement may also be inadmissible and insubmissible because not factually shown to have been freely and voluntarily given, even though the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>have been fully met.\u201d <em>Coyote </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 F.2d 305, 309-310 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 992 (1967). See <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Picard, </em>452 F.2d 860, 863-865 (1st Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">At the suppression hearing, the defendant offered no evidence that he was particularly susceptible to police pressure. There was no evidence that he had been drinking in the hours immediately before he spoke to the police. Nor was there any evidence of mental impairment or the use of drugs. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilborne, </em>382 Mass. 241, 253-254 (1981). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hosey, </em>368 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Mass. 571 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>366 Mass. 601 (1975). Indeed, the record indicates that he had completed the tenth grade, had been accepted into the armed forces of the United States, and was married and the father of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The record offers no explanation why the defendant first said that he alone kicked the victim. However, there may be explanations for the defendant\u2019s conduct other than the susceptibility of youth. For example, the defendant may have been acting under a code of silence, with a foolish sense of braggadocio or from family loyalty to his cousin Keith. In any event, we are not free to speculate on matters outside the record. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. 13, 17-19 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u201cA minor may waive constitutional rights and make a confession which is admissible against him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>366 Mass. 601, 605 (1975), and cases cited. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>380 Mass. 1, 4-7 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, supra </em>at 606-608, with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 567-568 (1979), cert. dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980). Whether the facts support the admission of statements made by a minor \u201cmust be determined by an examination of \u2018the totality of all the surrounding circumstances \u2014 both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u2019 <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 226 (1973).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>366 Mass. 601, 606 (1975). In light of the totality of the circumstances, we believe that the judge correctly concluded that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights under <em>Miranda </em>and made the statements voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">2. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant claims three errors in the instructions to the jury: (1) the judge erred in using the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d in defining reasonable doubt; (2) the judge impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the Commonwealth by using language from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. 304, 307 (1926); and (3) the instructions on admissions were prejudicially erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>a. <em>Moral certainty. </em>The defendant claims error in the failure of the judge to grant one of his requests for instructions to the jury. Relying on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Indorato, </em>628 F.2d 711, 720 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1016 (1980), the defendant argues that the judge erred when he equated the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt with proof to a moral certainty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s argument is most unpersuasive, because the defendant requested instructions containing the words \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, instructions containing the words \u201cmoral certainty\u201d have not resulted in reversals. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Previte, </em>648 F.2d 73, 83 (1st Cir. 1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Indorato, supra </em>at 721; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>543 F.2d 431, 436-437 (2d Cir. 1976). Moreover, we believe it is sound policy to adhere to the definition of reasonable doubt set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850), a definition that includes the words \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>378 Mass. 217, 235 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 130 n.12 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">b. <em>Madeiros charge. </em>The defendant also claims that the judge erred when he instructed the jury with language from the instructions quoted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Madeiros, </em>255 Mass. 304, 307 (1926).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>. Trial counsel<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> did not specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>object to this portion of the charge. Although the absence of any objection is relevant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>377 Mass. 123, 131 (1979), we are obliged to review the instructions pursuant to \u00a7 33E to determine whether there is a \u201c \u2018substantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 123 (1979). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>371 Mass. 13,16 (1976).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422, 439 (1980).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The defendant argues that the <em>Madeiros </em>language impermissibly lessens the government\u2019s burden of proof by creating in the minds of the jurors the possibility that guilt may be established by a general concern for public safety. Whatever the merits of that argument in general, it is not convincing in this case. On at least five occasions, the judge instructed the jury that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the crimes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge also defined reasonable doubt in the language of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850). We, therefore, conclude that the defendant has not established that the <em>Madeiros </em>language created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Nevertheless, we believe that \u201c [t]he emotional overtones of [the <em>Madeiros] </em>rhetoric may be criticized as subtly encouraging a jury to accept less proof than it should, so that \u2018the lawless\u2019 will not be \u2018supreme,\u2019 \u201d <em>Bumpus </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>635 F.2d 907, 911 (1st Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003 (1981), and we repeat that \u201c [explanations of reasonable doubt are best made in close reliance on the time-tested lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>guage of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>380 Mass. 545, 551 (1980), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">c. <em>Presumption of voluntariness. </em>The defendant asserts that the judge erred when he instructed the jury that there is a presumption that a confession is voluntary.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> He claims that the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving that a confession is voluntary is reversible error. Since the defendant did not object to the instructions on voluntariness, we review this claim to determine whether there is a \u201c \u2018substantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422, 439 (1980). We would only reverse on a showing of grave prejudice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>371 Mass. 13, 16 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 711 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Our \u201chumane practice\u201d requires that \u201cwhen statements amounting to a confession are offered in evidence, the question whether they were voluntary is to be decided at a preliminary hearing in the absence of the jury. If he [the judge] is satisfied that they are voluntary, they are admissible; otherwise, they should be excluded. If the judge decides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>that they are admissible, he should then instruct the jury not to consider the confession if, upon the whole evidence in the case, they are satisfied that it was not the voluntary act of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>338 Mass. 460, 461-462 (1959), and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>378 Mass. 451, 456 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In the past, we have applied this \u201chumane practice\u201d only to confessions and not to admissions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>262 Mass. 185, 189-190 (1928); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jokinen, </em>257 Mass. 429, 430 (1926); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haywood, </em>247 Mass. 16, 18 (1923). However, \u201c [w]e have in recent years questioned whether the same safeguards might not be required for inculpatory statements which fall short of a confession.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vick, </em>381 Mass. 43, 45 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422, 432 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fournier, </em>372 Mass. 346, 348 (1977). See P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 322 (5th ed. 1981). We see no reason to distinguish between admissions and confessions and conclude that the \u201chumane practice\u201d applies to all incriminating statements made by the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Extending our \u201chumane practice\u201d to admissions, we determine that the defendant has not shown a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. A judge has \u201cno duty to ask the jury to pass on voluntariness unless it is made a live issue at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alicea, </em>376 Mass. 506, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>523 (1978). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>380 Mass. 30, 40 (1980), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 44, 53-55 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>360 Mass. 708, 714-715 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preece, </em>140 Mass. 276, 277 (1885). At trial, the defendant failed to raise the issue of voluntariness, and the defendant requested no instructions on this issue. At no time did the defendant\u2019s testimony focus on the involuntariness of his statements. Rather, the defendant claimed that others had had the motive and opportunity to kill the victim. His testimony was substantially the same as the statement that he made to the police in the third interview. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>\u201c[I]n these circumstances the judge was not obliged to submit the issue of voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements to the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 44, 58 (1980) (Abrams, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Since the judge instructed the jury that there is a presumption that a confession is voluntary, we think it prudent to elaborate further our \u201chumane practice.\u201d The presumption that a confession is voluntary merely places on the defendant the burden of going forward at the suppression hearing with evidence of involuntariness, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>371 Mass. 462, 471 n.3 (1976), and does not apply at trial. Moreover, even at the suppression hearing, this presumption disappears once the defendant has produced some evidence that the statement was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Due process requires the Commonwealth to persuade the judge at the suppression hearing that the statement was voluntary before it is admitted in evidence at trial. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368 (1964); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris supra. </em>\u201c[A] trial judge has a constitutional obligation to conduct a voir dire examination in the absence of the jury where the voluntariness of a confession is in issue and to make an affirmative finding of voluntariness before the jury are allowed to consider it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469. This judicial determination of voluntariness is necessary because of the \u201cprejudice inhering in the admixture of a determination of voluntariness together with the jury\u2019s inescapable consideration of relia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>bility of the confession, and indeed ultimate guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 F.2d 354, 362 (D.C. Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 995 (1967) (Leventhal, J., concurring). See <em>Pea </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 F.2d 627 (D.C. Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Under our \u201chumane practice\u201d the initial screening by the judge is the \u201cbasic determination safeguarding the accused.\u201d <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>(Leventhal, J., concurring). Thus we conclude that before any statement by a defendant to law enforcement officers or their agents may be placed before the jury, the Commonwealth must prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the judge concludes that the defendant\u2019s statements are voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt, that conclusion \u201cmust appear from the record with unmistakable clarity.\u201d <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 538, 544 (1967). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>371 Mass. 462, 472 n.4 (1976). <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Picard, </em>452 F.2d 860, 863 (1st Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Finally, a defendant\u2019s statement is usually \u201cthe key item in the proof of guilt, and certainly one of overpowering weight with the jury.\u201d <em>Clifton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 F.2d 354, 362 (D.C. Cir. 1966) (Leventhal, J., concurring). Therefore, if voluntariness is a live issue at trial, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alicea, </em>376 Mass. 506, 523 (1978), the judge must instruct the jury that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was voluntary and that the jurors must disregard the statement unless the Commonwealth has met its burden.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>See <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>439 S.W.2d 61, 64 (Ky.

Approximately thirty minutes after the deliberations had begun, one of the alternates asked to speak to the judge.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The alternate alleged that a female juror had told the others that the defendant had left school in the tenth grade because he was habitually in trouble and was jailed or arrested. The alternate also alleged that another female juror referred to blacks as \u201ccolored,\u201d and had called a black witness \u201cSapphire,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a patently racist term.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>In the presence of counsel, the judge interviewed each of the deliberating jurors to determine if they heard the statement that the defendant had to leave school because he was in trouble. Not one of the deliberating jurors heard this remark.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The juror who was alleged to have made this comment denied that she made the statement, and no other juror admitted making this statement. After completing this inquiry, the judge found that the defendant had not met his burden of proving that the jury were exposed to extraneous prejudicial information. But even if this statement were made, the judge found that it had no influence on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In the course of his inquiry, the judge also asked each juror whether a defense witness had been referred to as \u201cSapphire.\u201d Five jurors admitted hearing the term \u201cSapphire.\u201d The judge found that a defense witness had been called \u201cSapphire,\u201d but that this term had been used in a jocular manner without any racial prejudice which would affect the verdict.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The record supports these findings. All five jurors who heard the term \u201cSapphire,\u201d individually said that this term was understood as a joke, and that it did not affect their ability to render an impartial verdict. Further, the term \u201cSapphire\u201d was used immediately after the jury heard the testimony of the witness who had been called \u201cSapphire,\u201d on the day before closing arguments and the judge\u2019s instructions. During deliberations, the jury requested additional instructions regarding the difference between unarmed robbery and larceny from the person. After receiving these instructions, the jury found the defendant guilty of the lesser charge of larceny from the person. Later, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial because he concluded that the jurors had been concerned with legal principles and not racial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The defendant argues that in spite of the results of the inquiry, the fact that a racial slur had been used by a juror entitles him to a new trial and nothing less will suffice. We disagree. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 200 (1979), we held that \u201cif specific facts not mentioned at trial concerning one of the parties or the matter in litigation are brought to the attention of the deliberating jury by a juror, . . . such misconduct may be proved by juror testimony.\u201d Because a \u201cright to use juror evidence necessarily implies a method to gather that evidence,\u201d we said that judges may supervise juror interviews to determine if extraneous prejudicial matters had reached the jury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 201. In authorizing these inquiries, we gave the judge broad discretion to make \u201csuch order as he deems appropriate for the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Our decision in <em>Fidler </em>did \u201cnot permit evidence concerning the subjective mental processes of jurors.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 198 (1979). \u201c [Wjhere the juror would testify solely to matters resting in his own consciousness,\u201d the value of such testimony is outweighed by the need to protect juror privacy. <em>Id. </em>In drawing a distinction between \u201covert factors and matters resting in a juror\u2019s consciousness,\u201d we recognized that \u201cdifficult cases\u201d would arise. <em>Id. </em>The defendant\u2019s claim of racial bias is one of these cases.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The Commonwealth has not argued that evidence of racial prejudice relates to the jurors\u2019 mental processes and thus is inadmissible under <em>Fidler. </em>Assuming, without deciding, that the judge acted properly when he asked each deliberating juror whether he had heard any racist comments, see <em>State </em>v. <em>Levitt, </em>36 N.J. 266 (1961); <em>People </em>v. <em>Castaldia, </em>51 Cal. 2d 569 (1959), we find no error. The judge interrogated the jurors and concluded that they could fairly and impartially render a verdict. The judge was \u201cin the best position to judge the weight and credibility of the evidence.\u201d <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977). \u201cThere is no reason to give a judge\u2019s finding of fact less weight in [this] . . . context than we ordinarily would, i.e., we accept his finding unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciminera, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 109, aff\u2019d, 384 Mass. 807 (1981). \u201c[A] finding of fact by the trial judge will not be deemed \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 unless the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, supra. </em>Since a review of the entire record has not left us with a firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, the judge\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motions is affirmed. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>affirming the judge\u2019s rulings, we in no way condone or approve the use of racial slurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">4. <em>Variance between the bill of particulars and the proof offered at trial. </em>The defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the variance between the bill of particulars and the proof offered at trial. Although he concedes that he knew that he was on trial for murder, the degree to be determined by the jury, the defendant says that the bill of particulars suggested that the Commonwealth would attempt to prove murder in the first degree only on the basis of deliberate premeditation and felony-murder and not extreme atrocity or cruelty. Thus, he claims that, when the Commonwealth introduced photographs of the victim to establish extreme atrocity or cruelty, he was surprised and unable to present an adequate defense. The defendant made no objection on this ground at trial, and this contention is not properly before us. We review this claim pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In its particulars, the Commonwealth stated that it would prove that the homicide was committed by \u201cassaulting and beating the victim with the intent to rob and kill\u201d by means of his \u201chands, feet, shoes and clothes.\u201d Prior to trial, the defendant was furnished with copies of the autopsy report which indicated that the victim died from multiple severe blunt injuries. Further, the judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to inspect the evidence in the possession of the Commonwealth, and that evidence included the photographs of the victim. Thus, the defendant was put on notice that the Commonwealth might introduce evidence on the issue of extreme atrocity or cruelty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>379 Mass. 640, 646-647 (1980). We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim that he was surprised by the proof offered by the Commonwealth at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">5. <em>Relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, </em>\u00a7 <em>33E. </em>The court has the obligation pursuant to \u00a7 33E to consider broadly the whole case on the law and the facts and \u201c [ujpon such consideration the court may, if satisfied that the verdict was against the law or the weight of the evidence, ... or for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>other reason that justice may require (a) order a new trial or (b) direct the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.\u201d G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as amended through St. 1979, c. 346, \u00a7 2. \u201cThe search under \u00a7 33E is a . . . general and . . . obligatory one for a result that may be \u2018more consonant with justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>380 Mass. 1, 15 n.20 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seit, </em>373 Mass. 83, 94 (1977). See <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>364 Mass. 145, 150 (1973). Our power, however, is to be used with restraint. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>371 Mass. 600, 604 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The only basis for the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in the first degree is extreme atrocity or cruelty.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The defendant correctly does not claim that the evidence of repeated blows to the victim\u2019s body could not sustain the verdict of murder in the first degree. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>362 Mass. 78, 82 (1972) (crime committed with such savagery and brutality as to constitute murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGarty, </em>323 Mass. 435, 440 (1948) (\u201cRepeated violent blows have been held to evince such ferocity as would warrant a finding of extreme atrocity or cruelty\u201d). Rather the defendant claims that the Commonwealth\u2019s best evidence against him is more consistent with a lesser degree of guilt than murder in the first degree. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence shows that a fight erupted between the victim, the defendant, his cousin Keith, and Bookman. The fight was not a planned encounter, but was a spontaneous reaction to alleged insults by the victim toward the defendant, Keith, and Bookman. Additionally, the Commonwealth\u2019s experts indicated that some of the more savage blows were inflicted by the defendant\u2019s cousin Keith. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Keith was convicted of murder in the second degree by a different jury. Although \u201cmere inconsistency of the verdicts \u2014 i.e., that one jury found [this defendant] guilty of murder in the first degree and another found [Keith] guilty of murder in the second degree \u2014 is not ordinarily enough to impel us to exercise our powers under \u00a7 33E,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>372 Mass. 590, 597, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 869 (1977), we believe that in this case, \u201cthe evidence of murder in the first degree as distinguished from that of murder in the second degree is much less persuasive.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 598. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 750-751 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Further, in deciding whether to \u201cshade the verdict,\u201d we are entitled to give weight to the defendant\u2019s character. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seit, </em>373 Mass. 83, 95 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 750 (1975). At the time of the killing, the defendant was seventeen, married, and the father of a young child. He had completed the tenth grade, was about to enter the armed forces, and had no prior convictions. In short, the defendant \u201cwas not a hoodlum or gangster.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seit, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">With all these factors in mind, we order the verdict reduced to murder in the second degree. The order denying the motion for a new trial is affirmed. We remand this case to the Superior Court where the verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, and the sentence previously imposed, are to be vacated. A verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree is to be entered, and sentence is to be imposed thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-11\"> The defendant was also convicted of larceny from a person, but the indictment was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. Thus, there is no issue before us as to the propriety of this conviction. \u201cAbsent exceptional circumstances, we do not consider appeals on assignment of error on indictments placed on file [with the defendant\u2019s consent] since no appeal may come before us until after judgment, which in criminal cases is the sentence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-12\"> Two other men, Keith Tavares, the defendant\u2019s cousin, and a friend, Bruce Bookman, also were tried and convicted as a result of the victim\u2019s death. Since each man made statements to the police, there were three separate trials. See <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968). Keith Tavares was convicted of murder in the second degree; Bookman was convicted of manslaughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-13\"> Tavares also appeals from the denial of a motion for a new trial based on a claim of juror misconduct.

However, he denied killing Aranjo. Tavares claimed that, when he, Keith, and Bookman left Aranjo in the third base dugout, Aranjo was very much alive and that others had the opportunity to kill Aranjo. Tavares denied kicking Aranjo in the head and chest, where the blows were most savage. The Commonwealth experts were able to identify tread marks, similar to shoes worn by Keith, on the victim\u2019s body, while the defendant\u2019s shoes had no blood on them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\"> We need not address ourselves to whether the Commonwealth must establish that the defendant waived his constitutional rights by a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d see <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 489 (1972), or by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, since the defendant did not raise this issue at trial or on appeal.

Well, a confession is a direct acknowledgement of guilt. What he stated was not a confession. What he stated are considered admissions. The difference between a confession and an admission is that a confession is a direct acknowledgement of guilt on the part of the accused, as contradistinguished from an admission which is a statement by the accused, direct or implied, of facts pertinent to the issue and tending, in connection with proof or other facts, to prove his guilt, but of itself insufficient to authorize a conviction. If you should consider any of the facts admissions as to any particular case, you may consider those. If you should consider that they were a confession \u2014 I think I just suggested to you that they were not confessions, but if you might have a different view, then you would have to consider whether or not, if it was a confession of any particular offense, they were voluntarily made. There is a presumption that even a confession is voluntary and competent if there is no evidence to the contrary. So admissions are to be considered by the jury for whatever value they may have, as I just pointed out to you.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> \u201cWhile this so called.'Massachusetts practice\u2019 was approved in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 378 (1964), the second prong of it \u2014 jury reconsideration \u2014 is not constitutionally mandated.
