The judge then assessed costs in the amount of $450 against Mr. Beit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Beit was not present at the time these costs were imposed. On appeal, Mr. Beit contends that a judge has no authority to assess costs except as authorized by statute. See, e.g., G. L. c. 261, \u00a7\u00a7 1 - 26. We do not agree. We hold that a judge may assess costs against an attorney who fails to appear at a scheduled trial without having obtained a timely continuance. Mr. Beit also argues that if the judge has the authority to assess costs in these circumstances, the attorney is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard. We agree. However, Mr. Beit\u2019s appeal is not properly before us. Hence, we do no more than express our views. <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943). We believe that Mr. Beit was entitled to notice and an opportunity to speak in his own behalf and explain his absence. We assume that the judge therefore will vacate his order imposing costs on Mr. Beit.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>We summarize the facts. In March, 1981, a 1974 divorce libel was set for trial in Essex County on April 23,1981, during a special session intended to alleviate the Essex County Probate Court backlog. On April 22, 1981, one day before the trial date, Mr. Macdonald, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, moved for a continuance. Mr. Beit assented to the plaintiff\u2019s request. The judge found that if the case were removed from the list one day before trial, the session would close. The judge concluded that such a result was unfair to the public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge, therefore, denied the requested continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">On the morning of April 23, 1981, the judge, an assistant registrar, a court officer, a stenographer, the plaintiff, and Mr. Macdonald were present and ready for trial. But the defendant and Mr. Beit did not appear. After a telephone call, a law clerk from Mr. Beit\u2019s office appeared and told the court that Mr. Beit had been suffering from back trouble for two weeks and was unable to attend. The judge terminated the session. After the case was called for trial, the judge received a letter dated April 21, 1981, indicating that Mr. Beit would be unable to attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The judge found that Mr. Beit knew, or should have known, for two weeks prior to trial that he (Mr. Beit) was unable to go forward on the scheduled trial date. Since Mr. Beit did not seek a timely continuance, the judge ordered Mr. Beit to pay $450 in court costs. Mr. Beit appeals from the assessment of costs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>We are met at the outset with the question whether the order requiring Mr. Beit to pay costs is properly before us. Under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 9, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 400, \u00a7 57, \u201c[a] person aggrieved by an order, judgment, decree or denial of a probate court,\u201d may appeal to the full court of the Supreme Judicial Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under this provision, an aggrieved person \u201cmay claim an appeal from interlocutory orders as well as final judgments, but absent a report from the trial judge, G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13, an appeal from an interlocutory order will not be heard by an appellate court until a final judgment has been entered\u201d in the underlying action. <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 779 (1979). See <em>LaRaia </em>v. <em>LaRaia, </em>329 Mass. 92, 93 (1952); <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>326 Mass. 621, 622 (1951); <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Plecker, </em>319 Mass. 560, 564 (1946). See also G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 22. Thus, unless the matter is reported by the trial judge, an attorney who has failed to appear at trial may not appeal an order requiring him to pay costs until final judgment has been entered in the underlying action scheduled for trial. An attorney \u201cought not to have the power to interrupt the progress of the litigation by piecemeal appeals that cause delay.\u201d <em>Vincent </em>v. <em>Plecker, supra </em>at 563 n.1. See <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 779 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Moreover, the doctrine of present execution does not allow an attorney to appeal an order to pay costs before the entry of a final judgment in the underlying action. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>the doctrine of present execution, we have allowed the immediate appeal of interlocutory orders if appeal after final judgment would be futile. See <em>Wax </em>v. <em>Monks, </em>327 Mass. 1, 2-3 (1951); <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>326 Mass. 621, 622 (1951). Cf. <em>Ferrick </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>320 Mass. 217, 219 (1946). However, in <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 781-782 (1979), we held that the doctrine of present execution does not apply to orders compelling discovery, and, therefore, discovery orders are not appealable prior to a final judgment. See <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>402 U.S. 530, 532-533 (1971); <em>Cobbledick v. United States, </em>309 U.S. 323 (1940); 4 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice par. 26.83 [3] (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">We believe that an order requiring an attorney who fails to appear for trial to pay costs is analogous to a discovery order. Both types of orders are imposed to prevent needless delays in litigation. Absent a report by the trial judge, see G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13, we will not allow an attorney to appeal, before final judgment, an order assessing costs and thereby further delay the client\u2019s action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>However, since this case has been fully argued on the merits and raises issues that are of great importance to the bar, the judiciary, and the administration of justice, we deem it appropriate to express our views.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Before assessing costs, the judge correctly determined that it is an attorney\u2019s obligation to seek a timely continuance if he is unable to appear for a scheduled trial.\u00ae \u201cThe duty of an attorney to punctually present himself in court and diligently continue with a trial he has undertaken and not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>delay it for any personal matter reasonably within his control is clear.\u201d <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>43 Cal. 2d 755, 758 (1955). \u201cCounsel for litigants, no matter how \u2018important\u2019 their cases are, cannot themselves decide when they wish to appear, or when they will file those papers required in a law suit. Chaos would result. . . . There must be . . . some respect shown to the convenience and rights of other counsel, litigants, and the court itself.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>308 F.2d 15, 18 (9th Cir. 1962). See <em>Nasser </em>v. <em>Isthmian Lines, </em>331 F.2d 124, 128 (2d Cir. 1964); <em>Flaksa </em>v. <em>Little River Marine Constr. Co., </em>389 F.2d 885, 887 n.1 (5th Cir. 1968). If judges lacked power to compel attorneys to appear, \u201cthe orderly administration of justice [would] be removed from the control of the trial court and placed in the hands of counsel.\u201d <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R.R., </em>291 F.2d 542, 547 (7th Cir. 1961), aff\u2019d 370 U.S. 626 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Judges \u201chave the inherent power to do whatever may be done under the general principles of jurisprudence to insure to the citizen a fair trial, whenever his life, liberty, property or character is at stake.\u201d <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>208 Mass. 162, 179 (1911). \u201cSimply stated, implicit in the constitutional grant of judicial power is \u2018authority necessary to the exercise of . . . [that] power.\u2019\u201d <em>O\u2019Coins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>362 Mass. 507, 510 (1972), quoting from <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>279 Mass. 607, 609 (1932). Further, \u201cevery judge must exercise his inherent powers as necessary to secure the full and effective administration of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Coins, Inc., supra </em>at 574. Among a judge\u2019s inherent powers is the authority to make the court\u2019s lawful orders effective. Exercising this power, a judge may impose reasonable court costs on an attorney who, by fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>ing to obtain a timely continuance, delays the adjudication of legitimate claims and defenses, unnecessarily increases clients\u2019 litigation expenses, and squanders limited judicial resources.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A judge \u201ccannot condone behavior that causes precious time to be wasted away while the court, parties, court personnel, and witnesses await the arrival of an errant attorney.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>State, </em>46 Md. App. 138, 147 (1979). Without an attorney\u2019s presence \u201cthe wheels of justice must, necessarily, grind to a halt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Therefore, an attorney who fails to appear for a scheduled trial without having obtained a timely continuance is subject to sanctions. To hold otherwise would insulate irresponsible lawyers from meaningful accountability for their conduct to the detriment of the general public, litigants, and the vast majority of attorneys who behave responsibly.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">But if a judge requires an attorney to pay court costs, he must afford him fair notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Without procedural safeguards, \u201cserious due process problems would result were trial courts to use their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>inherent power, in lieu of the contempt power.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Bauguess </em>v. <em>Paine, </em>22 Cal. 3d 626, 638 (1978). See Note, Financial Penalties Imposed Directly Against Attorneys, in Litigation Without Resort to the Contempt Power, 26 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 855, 887-892 (1978). Cf. <em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>447. U.S. 752, 767 &amp; n.14 (1980); <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Pfeffer, </em>657 F.2d 252, 257 (10th Cir. 1981). A judge may not use the \u201cinherent power\u201d to avoid the requirements of due process. Like other sanctions<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> costs should not be assessed lightly or without fair notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number><em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piper, supra. </em>Before imposing costs on an attorney who fails to appear, a judge need not provide the attorney with the full panoply of rights afforded to criminal defendants. Fair notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Pfeffer, </em>657 F.2d 252, 257 (10th Cir. 1981). Further, we believe that a judge who exercises his or her inherent power to impose costs on an attorney must articulate the reasons for the sanction. The requirement of articulation of reasons ensures that the judge will act with restraint. See <em>Roadway Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 764 (1980); <em>Gompers </em>v. <em>Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., </em>221 U.S. 418, 450-451 (1911). We also believe that it ensures judicial recognition of the seriousness of imposing sanctions. See Peckham, The Federal Judge as a Case Manager: The New Role in Guiding a Case from Filing to Disposition, 69 Calif. L. Rev. 770, 802 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Applying these principles to this case, we conclude that the judge had the power to order Mr. Beit to pay costs. Although the judge articulated the reasons for imposing a sanction, he failed to give Mr. Beit notice that costs might be imposed. Mr. Beit also had no opportunity to speak in his own behalf and explain his absence. Since Mr. Beit was denied that opportunity, we assume that the Probate judge will vacate his order requiring Mr. Beit to pay $450 in costs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-15\"> The issues raised by this appeal were foreshadowed in Kafka\u2019s, The Trial. \u201c[C]onscious of his own rights, he asked through the telephone what would happen if he failed to put in an appearance. \u2018We shall know where to find you,\u2019 was the answer. \u2018And shall I be punished for not having come of my own accord?\u2019 asked K., and smiled in anticipation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>reply. \u2018No,\u2019 was the answer. \u2018Splendid,\u2019 said K., \u2018then what motive could I have for complying with this summons?\u2019 \u2018It is not usual to bring the powers of the Court upon one\u2019s own head,\u2019 said the voice, becoming fainter and finally dying away. \u2018It is very rash not to do so,\u2019 thought K. as he hung up; \u2018for after all one should try to find out what those powers are.\u2019\u201d F. Kafka, The Trial 290 (Vintage Books 1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\"> Our records indicate that Mr. Beit has been a member of the bar since 1953.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\"> Mr. Beit had entered his appearance for the libellee on September 5, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b869-9\"> The assessment of costs was ordered against \u201cMr. Beit and/or his client.\u201d Thus, we need not reach the issue whether an attorney who is ordered to pay costs for failing to appear must notify his client of this sanction. Where costs are assessed against the lawyer alone, one commentator has suggested that the attorney be required to serve his client with a copy of the order. \u201cThis will insure that the client knows of the sanction, can guard against being billed for it, and can even discharge his attorney if he feels that the event warrants such action.\u201d Peckham, The Federal Judge as a Case Manager: The New Role in Guiding a Case from Filing to Disposition, 69 Calif. L. Rev. 770, 802 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\"> As we read the judge\u2019s remarks, the public includes other litigants, members of the bar, as well as the general public.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Before imposing costs, the judge offered to award attorney\u2019s.fees to Mr. Macdonald\u2019s client. Mr. Macdonald declined the judge\u2019s offer. Mr. Macdonald\u2019s refusal is consistent with most lawyers\u2019 recognition that sanctions can be a two-edged sword. By seeking sanctions, a lawyer \u201ccan provoke resentment and inspire retaliation.\u201d Brazil, Improving Judicial Controls over the Pretrial Development of Civil Actions: Model Rules for Case Management and Sanctions, ABA Research J. 875, 946 (Fall, 1981). Lawyers are reluctant to risk incurring the resentment of other attorneys. Attorneys \u201cwho move in the . . . subworld of litigation, who have developed similar styles of practice, and who know one another or at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>know of one another\u2019s law firms . . . believe they have to live with one another; they expect to encounter one another not only in subsequent lawsuits but also in professional organizations and social settings. . . . [Lawyers are therefore] hesitant to initiate public proceedings to punish other [attorneys] or their clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Macdonald\u2019s refusal to accept reimbursement of his client\u2019s legal fees is the usual response of a litigation attorney. See Renfrew, Discovery Sanctions: A Judicial Perspective, 67 Calif. L.

Courts often have penalized clients for their attorney\u2019s failure to appear. In <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R.R., </em>370 U.S. 626, 636 (1962), the trial court dismissed the plaintiff s case because his lawyer failed to appear at a pretrial conference. Relying on the \u201cinherent power\u201d of the courts \u201cto manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases,\u201d the United States Supreme Court upheld this dismissal. <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R.R., supra </em>at 630-631.
