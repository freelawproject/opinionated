Rohrbough (Rohrbough) sold real estate in Roston at a substantial capital gain. The sales price was to be paid in instalments over a period of six years, pursuant to notes, and the transaction qualified under \u00a7 453 of the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 453 [1976]) for treatment as an instalment sale. Rohrbough elected to report the gain as an instalment sale for Federal income tax purposes, but, for State income tax purposes (G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 63 [e]), he elected to report the gain on his 1971 individual tax return and to pay the tax on the entire gain. In February, 1974, Rohrbough transferred the remaining instalment notes to the taxpayer, Rohrbough, Inc. (corporation), in exchange for 100 shares of stock. Rohrbough owned all the stock in the corporation. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>transfer was a tax free exchange under \u00a7 351 of the Internal Revenue Code. Thereafter, the corporation received instalment payments. In its 1975, 1976, and 1977 Federal income tax returns, the corporation included the taxable gains reflected in the instalment payments in its gross income. In filing its Massachusetts corporate excise returns for the same years, the corporation excluded the gains from its gross income, explaining that the entire tax on the gain had been paid by Rohrbough as reflected in his 1971 Massachusetts individual tax return. The Commissioner of Revenue assessed taxes on these gains to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">On the corporation\u2019s appeal to the Appellate Tax Board (board) from the Commissioner\u2019s denial of abatements, the board ruled that the corporation was entitled to abatements. The Commissioner has appealed to this court. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">We agree with the following conclusions of the board: \u201cSince capital gain treatment has been accorded to the sale for state tax purposes, this has the effect of increasing the basis of the notes to their face value upon the transfer. In that sense, there is no gain in the hands of the corporation and thus the amounts received are not taxable and should not be included in the computation of Massachusetts corporation excise tax. To rule otherwise would be a double taxation of the proceeds from the same transaction which should be avoided. <em>DeBlois </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation, </em>276 Mass. 437 (1931); <em>New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>321 Mass. 683 (1947); <em>Old Colony Trust </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation, </em>346 Mass. 667 (1964).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In computing a corporation\u2019s domestic corporate excise, consideration is given to the corporation\u2019s Massachusetts \u201cnet income\u201d which is arrived at by taking certain deductions from \u201cgross income.\u201d G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(b). </em>\u201cGross income\u201d is \u201cgross income as defined under the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, as amended and in effect for the taxable year,\u201d with certain adjustments not relevant here. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30 (5) <em>(a), </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>amended through St. 1967, c. 755, \u00a7 3. The reference is to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and not simply to the amount of gross income shown on a taxpayer\u2019s Federal income tax return for the same tax year. Although the figure shown as gross income on a taxpayer\u2019s Federal return will normally be the gross income for State tax purposes for the same tax year, this is not always the case. Such a difference exists where, as here, an individual makes differing elections with respect to the tax treatment of instalment transactions under I.R.C. \u00a7 453. See G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 63; <em>Dogon </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>370 Mass. 699, 702 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The Commissioner argues that the corporation is not being subjected to an income tax but to a corporate excise in part based on income (G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38), and that the Legislature has made no special provision for a corporation receiving assigned instalment payments, as it has in G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 63, for individuals. However, the corporation\u2019s basis for the instalment notes was that of the transferor, Rohrbough. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362(a), 1016(b). For State tax purposes, applying the definition of capital gains in the Internal Revenue Code, there is no gain. The basis for State tax purposes was the face value of the notes because Rohrbough, the transferor, had paid a tax on the capital gain in full when he filed his 1971 Massachusetts individual income tax return.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362, 1016(b). See I.R.C. \u00a7 351. The amount received by the corporation equaled the basis of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\"> We need not decide whether, in any event, the provisions of G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 63 (e), should be read to grant the corporation the tax result it seeks. The question would be whether the corporation is a \u201cperson\u201d whose Federal gross income should be modified by eliminating instalment payments taxable federally but already fully taxed by the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
