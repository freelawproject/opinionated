L. c. 152, \u00a7 26, as amended through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>St. 1973, c. 855, \u00a7 1. We conclude that on the particular facts presented, the aggravation of the plaintiff\u2019s prior injury, due to years of standing and walking at work, was not such a personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We summarize the facts as found by a single member of the Industrial Accident Board, and adopted by the reviewing board. The claimant, Walter A. Zerofski, was employed as a foreman by James J. Gallery, Inc. (employer), from 1950 until 1976, when he was laid off for economic reasons. As foreman, he was responsible for moving frozen foods from warehouse to trucks. On the date of his layoff, he was suffering from a serious leg ailment, and was \u201ctotally disabled . . . from doing work on the open market.\u201d There were two contributing causes of this disability. The first was a broken toe sustained in 1964 when a pallet fell on his foot. The second cause was prolonged \u201cstanding and walking on concrete floors\u201d at work between 1966 and 1976, which aggravated the original injury. Although Zerofski\u2019s leg frequently \u201cbroke down\u201d during those ten years, he filed no claims of injury until 1976. Neither the findings nor the transcript points to any specific incidents or work conditions \u2014 other than standing and walking \u2014 as causes of the aggravation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In 1964, when Zerofski sustained his original injury, the employer was insured against workers\u2019 compensation claims by Commercial Union Assurance Companies (insurer), which paid the claims Zerofski filed at the time. In 1966, the employer became self-insured. Zerofski filed a claim against the insurer for his present disability after his layoff in 1976, and a similar claim against the employer in 1977, slightly more than a year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">After a hearing, a single member of the Industrial Accident Board ordered the employer, as self-insurer, to pay Zerofski compensation for total disability, and dismissed Zerofski\u2019s claim against the insurer. The reviewing board affirmed the decision of the single member. The employer appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed the order of the board and ordered the insurer to pay. All parties then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>appealed to the Appeals Court. The Appeals Court affirmed the decision of the Superior Court (12 Mass. App. Ct. 154 [1981]), and we granted further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The principal question in this case is which of the two defendants \u2014 the insurer or the employer \u2014 must pay Zerofski\u2019s compensation. When successive compensable injuries contribute to an employee\u2019s disability, the insurer covering the risk at the time of the most recent injury must assume all payments for the final disability. <em>Carrier </em>v. <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co., </em>370 Mass. 674, 675-676 (1976). <em>Evans\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 435, 436-437 (1938). Therefore, if aggravation of Zerofski\u2019s condition by years of standing and walking at work was a compensable injury and a contributing cause of total disability, the employer must pay total disability compensation. If not, the insurer is chargeable on the basis of the original injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Our workers\u2019 compensation act affords employees broad protection against work-related injury. Recovery does not depend on the fault of the employer or upon the foreseeability of harm. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 496 (1916). <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526, 531 (1915). L. Locke, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 9, at 10 (2d ed. 1981). Instead, it is based on \u201ca unique theory of distribution of the human loss directly arising out of commercial and industrial enterprises.\u201d <em>Madden\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The act provides that employees may collect workers\u2019 compensation for \u201cpersonal injuries] arising out of and in the course of . . . employment.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. This phrase covers a wide range of injuries. Injury \u201carises out of\u201d employment if it is attributable to the \u201cnature, conditions, obligations or incidents of the employment; in other words, [to] employment looked at in any of its aspects.\u201d <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502 (1940). Unlike many workers\u2019 compensation statutes, our act does not require that injury occur \u201cby accident,\u201d so that gradually developed injuries are compensable as well as those caused by sudden incidents. See, e.g., <em>Pell </em>v. <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co., </em>325 Mass. 239 (1950) (eye injury due to made-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>quote light over long period); <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>265 Mass. 497 (1929) (lung disease due to inhalation of granite dust); <em>Hurle\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 223 (1914) (blindness due to repeated exposure to coal gas). Cf. IB A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 37.10 (1980 &amp; Supp. 1981). Further, an employee may recover even when his injury is due in part to his own weakness or vulnerability; the employer must take his employee \u201cas is.\u201d See L. Locke, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 173. If a condition or incident of work aggravates a preexisting health problem, the employee has suffered a \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d and may recover from the employer for his entire disability, without apportionment. <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 493-496 (1916). See, e.g., <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113 (1951) (strain on particular workday aggravated heart condition); <em>Duggan\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 355 (1944) (dust inhalation aggravated tuberculosis); <em>Crowley\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 288 (1916) (injury at work aggravated syphilis). Finally, an identifiable incident or strain need not be unusual or severe to support compensation if the particular employee succumbs to it. See, e.g., <em>McManus\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 171 (1951) (bending over caused hernia).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">There are, however, certain limits on compensable injury, which have taken shape in a line of decisions denying recovery for \u201c[bjodily wear and tear resulting from a long period of hard work.\u201d <em>Spalla\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 416, 418 (1946). <em>Doyle\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 310 (1929), for example, held that a laborer could not recover for a weakened back caused by years of hard labor \u2014 the worker had simply \u201cexhausted his physical energies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312. Similarly, <em>Burns\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 516 (1929), denied recovery to a watchman whose heart failure was due to the aggravating effect of miles of nightly walking at work upon a preexisting heart condition. The watchman\u2019s \u201cultimate breakdown [was] merely the natural effect of exertion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518. Other examples in which recovery has been denied include <em>Begins Case, </em>354 Mass. 594 (1968) (job experiences may have contributed to mental illness), <em>Spalla\u2019s Case, supra </em>(years of hard labor weakened abdominal walls), <em>Reardon\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>Case, </em>275 Mass. 24 (1931) (years of handling tools injured hand), <em>Pimental\u2019s Case, </em>235 Mass. 598 (1920) (years of sitting with poor posture to roll cigars caused nerve disorder), and <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57 (1917) (same). See also <em>Korsuns Case, </em>354 Mass. 124 (1968) (general concern over job security, not proved related to incidents at work, aggravated heart condition).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The line between compensable injury and mere \u201cwear and tear\u201d is a delicate one, as a comparison of the results reached in past decisions reveals. Nevertheless, the distinction is necessary to preserve the basic character of the act. The \u201cpurpose [of the act] is to treat the cost of personal injuries incidental to . . . employment as a part of the cost of business.\u201d <em>Maddens Case, </em>222 Mass. 487, 494-495 (1916). \u201cIt is not a scheme for health insurance.\u201d <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57, 61 (1917). To be compensable, injury must arise \u201cout of\u201d as well as \u201cin the course of\u201d employment, and \u201c[a] disease of the mind or body which arises in the course of employment, with nothing more, is not within the act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Much of the responsibility for separating injuries that are sufficiently work-related from those that are not rests with the Industrial Accident Board, which must determine as a matter of fact whether a causal connection exists between employment and injury. <em>McManus\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 171, 173 (1951). <em>Brzozowski\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 113, 115-116 (1951). The distinction between compensable and noncompensable injuries, however, involves more than the factual problem of causation. In some cases work may be a contributing cause of injury, but only to the extent that a great many activities pursued in its place would have contributed. When this is so, causation in fact is an inadequate test.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Drawing from the nature of the purposes of the act as we have described them, and from the pattern of our decisions over the years, we arrive at the following restatement of the range of harm covered by the act. To be compensable, the harm must arise either from a specific incident or series of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>incidents at work,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or from an identifiable condition that is not common and necessary to all or a great many occupations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The injury need not be unique to the trade,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and need not, of course, result from the fault of the employer. But it must, in the sense we have described, be identified with the employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Zerofski\u2019s complaint against the employer falls on the side of \u201cwear and tear.\u201d Undoubtedly, the initial injury to his toe in 1964 was a contributing cause of his disability, and a compensable personal injury within the meaning of the act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The aggravation of the injury over the next ten years of work, however, did not amount to a personal injury. There is nothing to distinguish these ten years of work from other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>occupations that Zerofski might have pursued. Prolonged standing and walking are simply too common among necessary human activities to constitute identifiable conditions of employment. Therefore, the insurer, and not the employer, is liable for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The Superior Court judge based his award against the insurer upon rates of. compensation effective in 1964, the date of the original injury. The employee contends that the applicable rates were those effective in 1976, when total disability occurred. In support, he cites G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35B, which provides that when an employee has been compensated once, and suffers a \u201csubsequent injury,\u201d compensation should be based on rates in effect at the time of the subsequent injury, \u201cwhether or not [it is a] recurrence of the former injury.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The employee did not argue this issue before the Industrial Accident Board; nor did he have occasion to, in light of the board\u2019s disposition of the case. Further, the record before us on this matter is incomplete. Although we do not believe that the employee should be considered to have lost his right to raise \u00a7 35B, we prefer not to decide the question of applicable rates until the board has addressed it. Therefore, this aspect of the case should be returned for consideration by the board.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in so far as it requires the insurer to pay benefits to the employee, and dismiss the employee\u2019s claim against the self-insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>employer. We remand the case to the Superior Court with instructions to remand to the Industrial Accident Board for determination of the applicable rate of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-17\"> Although the act traditionally has been known as the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d we find the term \u201cworkers\u2019 compensation\u201d more appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-6\"> Our decisions place injuries attributable to specific events at work within the business risks covered by the act, even when employment does not expose employees to an unusual risk greater than that experienced by the general public. <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502 (1940) (injury at work during hurricane). See <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>374 Mass. 633, 638 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> In <em>Albanese\u2019s Case, </em>378 Mass. 14, 18 &amp; n.4 (1979), we suggested \u2014 although we did not decide \u2014 that a stricter standard of proof might apply in cases involving mental illness. There, we permitted recovery for mental illness caused, or at least aggravated, by a \u201cseries of identifiable stressful work-related incidents occurring over a relatively brief period of time.\u201d We express no opinion here on the problem of mental injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> Some of the early decisions of this court applying the \u201cwear and tear\u201d doctrine appeared to require that the injury, to be compensable, must have been \u201cpeculiar to the employment.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57, 61 (1917). This strict statement of the test for compensable injury has been eroded by subsequent decisions. See, e.g., <em>Brown\u2019s Case, </em>334 Mass. 343 (1956) (heart attack caused by \u201cextremely heavy workload\u201d compensable); <em>Pell </em>v. <em>New Bedford Gas &amp; Edison Light Co., </em>325 Mass. 239 (1950) (injury to eyes caused by poor lighting compensable).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> The principles we have restated here are reflected in a 1941 amendment to the act, inserted to bring infectious and contagious diseases within the coverage of the act. The amendment states that such diseases qualify as \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d if \u201cthe nature of the employment is such that the hazard of contracting such diseases by an employee is inherent in the employment.\u201d G.
