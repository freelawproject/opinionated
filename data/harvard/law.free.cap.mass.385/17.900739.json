The bank argues that its claim is superior to the claim of the plaintiff which sold the motor vehicle on execution to satisfy its judgment against the vehicle\u2019s owner. A judge of the District Court ruled for the bank, and the plaintiff claimed a report. The Appellate Division of the District Courts dismissed the report on a ground we find to have been inappropriate. The case is before us on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. We rule in favor of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">We summarize the significant facts' contained in the report. In June, 1976, Josephine I. Tessier borrowed $5,478 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>from the bank. She signed a promissory note and security agreement that stated that a specifically described 1976 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme automobile was security for the loan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The bank issued a check payable to Josephine I. Tessier and Reiter Oldsmobile. Mrs. Tessier\u2019s husband Gerard purchased the vehicle, using the proceeds of the loan to pay for the vehicle, and title was placed in his name only. The title certificate listed him as the owner and listed the bank as a lien holder under a chattel mortgage. Gerard authorized Josephine to use the motor vehicle as collateral and to execute the necessary documents to create the bank\u2019s security interest. This case arises because Gerard did not sign the security agreement, and, as far as the report shows, he did not give the bank directly any written statement that as owner of the vehicle he acknowledged the bank\u2019s security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In January, 1978, about eighteen months later, the plaintiff recovered judgment against Gerard in the amount of $1,817.84 in an action brought in the Springfield District Court. Pursuant to an execution, the motor vehicle was sold in March, 1978, for $3,400. The plaintiff paid the bank $2,831.73 for the release of the bank\u2019s alleged lien on the motor vehicle. When, on the delivery of a copy of the security agreement, the plaintiff discovered that Gerard had not signed the security agreement, the plaintiff made demand on the bank for the return of the $2,831.73. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>bank declined to pay the amount demanded, and the plaintiff commenced this action seeking to recover it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Because the material transactions occurred in 1976, we deal here with the provisions of article nine of the Uniform Commercial Code before its revision in 1979. See St. 1979, c. 512, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A security interest is not enforceable against the debtor or third parties unless certain conditions are met. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-203 (1), as appearing in St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1. Where the collateral is not in the possession of the secured party, as is the case here, three conditions must be met before a security interest in the collateral can attach. There must be a proper security agreement signed by the debtor and containing a description of the collateral (G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-203 [1] [&amp;]); the debtor must have rights in the collateral; and value must be given (G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-204 [1]). When these three requirements for the attachment of a security interest are fulfilled, the security interest then only becomes fully enforceable if it is perfected by recording or by following some similar procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The plaintiff grants that certain of these conditions are met. However, the plaintiff argues that, if Gerard was a debtor for the purposes of \u00a7 9-203 (1), he did not sign a security agreement and that Josephine, by her execution of the security agreement, did not have rights in the collateral so as to create a security interest in the motor vehicle. We conclude that Gerard (as well as Josephine) was a debtor for the purposes of \u00a7 9-203 (1) (b), and, consequently, the bank\u2019s purported security interest is enforceable against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>plaintiff only if Gerard has \u201csigned a security agreement which contains a description of the collateral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We regard Gerard as a \u201cdebtor\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 9-203 (1), because in these circumstances a \u201cdebtor\u201d includes the owner of the collateral, even if he is not obligated on the debt. See G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-105 (1) <em>(d), </em>defining a debtor and set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The provisions of G. L. c. 106, \u00a79-203, deal with the collateral; thus under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-105 (1) <em>(d), </em>the owner of the collateral, Gerard, is a debtor for the purposes of determining rights in the collateral. This conclusion is supported by the decisions of courts which have dealt with this question in similar circumstances. See <em>K.N.C. Wholesale, Inc. </em>v. <em>AWMCO, Inc., </em>56 Cal. App. 3d 315, 319-320 (1976); <em>Southwest Bank </em>v. <em>Moritz, </em>203 Neb. 45, 53-54 (1979); <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>Washington Trust Co., </em>120 R.I. 197, 202 (1978); <em>Clearfield State Bank </em>v. <em>Contos, </em>562 P.2d 622, 624-625 (Utah 1977); <em>In re Corsi, </em>24 U.C.C. Reporting Serv. 216, 217-218 (D. Vt. 1978). See also 6F Bender\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code Service, Willier &amp; Hart U.C.C. Reporter-Digest \u00a7 2-1656.4 (1981); Squillante, The Security Agreement, Part IV, 86 Com. L.J. 235 (1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We turn then to the question whether Gerard signed a security agreement sufficient to create a security interest. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>is not necessary that Gerard have signed a formal security agreement, if there were documents which collectively established an intention to execute a security agreement by the grant of a security interest in the motor vehicle. <em>Matter of Numeric Corp., </em>485 F.2d 1328, 1331 (1st Cir. 1973). The two purposes of the signature requirement are to prevent disputes over which items of property are covered by a security interest and to serve as a Statute of Frauds. <em>Id. </em>A \u201csecurity agreement\u201d is \u201can agreement which creates or provides for a security interest.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-105 (1) <em>(h). </em>An \u201cagreement\u201d is \u201cthe bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances.\u201d G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 1-201 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We must, therefore, look to what agreement or agreements exist and whether Gerard signed any document which with other documents constitutes a security agreement. There was a security agreement signed by Josephine. She signed it with Gerard\u2019s understanding and assent, and the inference is clear the purpose of the loan was to obtain funds so that Gerard could purchase the motor vehicle. Although Gerard did not sign that agreement, it is admitted that Josephine did sign it with his authority but not in his name. But for the absence of Gerard\u2019s signature, the formal security agreement is adequate in all respects to create an enforceable security interest in favor of the bank. If Gerard signed a separate acknowledgment of the existence of the security interest, we think the security interest properly attached (see G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 9-204 (1), as appearing in St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1) and is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Although the report does not contain an application signed by Gerard for the issuance of a certificate of title showing the bank\u2019s security interest, the inference is fairly warranted that he signed such an application. The record contains a certificate of title in Gerard\u2019s name showing the bank\u2019s lien. Under G. L. c. 90D, \u00a7 21, inserted by St. 1971, c. 754, \u00a7 1, \u201c[a] security interest in a vehicle for which a certificate of title is issued under [G. L. c. 90D] is perfected by the delivery to the registrar of ... an application for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>certificate of title containing the name and address of the lienholder.\u201d The owner must execute the application to name the lienholder. G. L. c. 90D, \u00a7 22 <em>(a). </em>We think, therefore, that the record reasonably shows that Gerard signed an application disclosing the bank\u2019s interest in the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We accept the view, generally held, that a security interest in a motor vehicle cannot be created just by completing the process prescribed by a \u201ccertificate of title\u201d statute, nor does a reference to a lien stated on a title certificate alone constitute a security agreement. See <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Erwin, </em>472 F.2d 1118, 1120 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>White </em>v. <em>Household, Fin. Corp., </em>158 Ind. App. 394, 406 (1973); <em>In re Corsi, </em>24 U.C.C. Reporting Serv. 216, 218 (D. Vt. 1978), and cases cited. Contra, <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Ziegler, </em>39 Ill. App. 3d 379, 384 (1976) (2-1 decision). A debtor need not, however, sign a document designated \u201csecurity agreement\u201d in order to satisfy the code requirement that the debtor sign a security agreement. See <em>Komas </em>v. <em>Future Syss., Inc., </em>71 Cal. App. 3d 809, 814 (1977). A combination of documents may meet that requirement. See <em>Matter of Bollinger Corp., </em>614 F.2d 924, 926-927 (3d Cir. 1980) (promissory note, financing statement, and correspondence); <em>Matter of Numeric Corp., </em>485 F.2d 1328, 1331-1332 (1st Cir. 1973) (financing statement and a directors\u2019 resolution); <em>In the Matter of Carmichael Enterprises, Inc., </em>334 F. Supp. 94, 104-105 (N.D. Ga. 1971), aff\u2019d per curiam, 460 F.2d 1405 (5th Cir. 1972) (financing statement and a letter on which the debtor wrote \u201cagreed\u201d); <em>Matter of Fibre Glass Boat Corp., </em>324 F. Supp. 1054, 1055-1056 (S.D. Fla. 1971) (financing statement and letter); <em>In re Center Auto Parts, </em>6 U.C.C. Reporting Serv. 398, 399 (C.D. Cal. 1968) (promissory note and financing statement); <em>Komas </em>v. <em>Future Syss., Inc., supra </em>at 814 (\u201cA writing or writings, regardless of label, which adequately describes the collateral, carries the signature of the debtor, and establishes that in fact a security interest was agreed upon, would satisfy both the formal requirements of the statute and the policies behind it\u201d); <em>Casco Bank &amp; Trust </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Co. v. <em>Cloutier, </em>398 A.2d 1224,1229-1231 (Me. 1979) (promissory note and financing statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">On the basis of these principles, we conclude that the combination of (1) the security agreement signed by Josephine with Gerard\u2019s authority and (2) his written acknowledgment of the existence of the security interest, stated in his application for a title certificate to the motor vehicle, constituted a security agreement signed by the debtor for the purposes of permitting enforcement of the security interest in favor of the bank. There was a clear indication of the security interest both on the security agreement and on the title certificate, and the application for the title certificate was a document signed by Gerard acknowledging the existence of the security interest. No creditor or other third party could reasonably have been misled. See <em>Casco Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Cloutier, supra </em>at 1230-1231. Although the procedures followed by the bank are hardly recommended practices, the bank\u2019s security interest did attach and was perfected before the plaintiff acquired any rights in the motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Entry of judgment for the defendant was correct, and the order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\"> The parties submitted the case on an \u201cagreed statement of facts.\u201d In that agreement, they stated that \u201c[t]he security agreement gave [the bank] a security interest in the [motor vehicle].\u201d The Appellate Division seized on that language to conclude that (1) the plaintiff agreed that the bank had a security interest in the motor vehicle and (2) the agreement was dispositive of the case. If that language were to be read as other than a statement that the security agreement purported to give the bank a security interest in the vehicle, the balance of the statement of agreed facts, and indeed the law suit itself, would be supererogatory. In another part of the \u201cagreed statement of facts,\u201d the bank\u2019s lien is referred to as an \u201calleged lien.\u201d Certainly the plaintiff cannot be found to have conceded the case. The bank rightly does not so argue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\"><em> </em>The bank makes no point before us that the amount of the unsatisfied execution was substantially less than the $2,831.73, which the plaintiff seeks in this action. Perhaps if the bank\u2019s claim that it was a secured creditor were rejected by this court, Gerard, and not the bank, would be entitled to the proceeds of the execution sale in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claim. On the other hand, as between Gerard and the bank, perhaps the bank would be entitled to the balance. The Tessiers are not parties to this action, and we need not decide the point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\"> It seems that the 1979 revisions of article nine would not change the result we reach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\"> General Laws c. 106, \u00a7 9-105 (1) <em>(d), </em>as appearing in St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1, reads as follows: <em>\u201c(d) </em>\u2018Debtor\u2019 means the person who owes payment or other performance of the obligation secured, whether or not he owns or has rights in the collateral, and includes the seller of accounts, contract rights or chattel paper. <em>Where the debtor and the owner of the collateral are not the same person, the term \u2018debtor\u2019 means the owner of the collateral in any provision of the Article dealing with the collateral, </em>the obligor in any provision dealing with the obligation, and may include both where the context so requires\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b34-8\"> If Gerard were not a \u201cdebtor\u201d who must have signed a security agreement to make the bank\u2019s security interest enforceable, we would need to consider whether Josephine had \u201crights in the collateral\u201d so as to make the security interest enforceable against the collateral.
