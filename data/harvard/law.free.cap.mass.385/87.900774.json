The appeal was transferred to this court on our own motion. We conclude that jeopardy had attached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>and thus we reverse the judgment of conviction and order that the indictment be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The facts are not in dispute. The defendant was arraigned on April 21, 1977, in the Municipal Court of the Roxbury District on a complaint charging assault by means of a dangerous weapon. Also arraigned that day was one Willie Perretti, who was charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. Both charges emanated from a racial altercation involving at least four persons; however, the incidents themselves were separate. There was testimony that Perretti threw a bottle at one Merrill Boyd and injured his eye. There was further testimony that the defendant Maloney tried to hit Boyd and another person, William Beck, with his automobile. The cases were called jointly before a District Court judge on July 11, 1977. At that time a District Court had jurisdiction over an assault by means of a dangerous weapon concurrently with the Superior Court (G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26, as amended through St. 1976, c. 235; G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B); it did not have jurisdiction over the crime of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), charged against Willie Perretti. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A. The defendant\u2019s attorney presumed that there was about to be a trial on the merits. However, when he approached the attorney\u2019s table, the clerk stated, \u201cMost likely the court would decline jurisdiction on the assault by means.\u201d Neither the judge nor the prosecutor said anything regarding whether the hearing was to be a trial on the merits or a probable cause hearing. Upon hearing the clerk\u2019s statement, defense counsel \u201cwas not sure what was happening\u201d; nevertheless, he proceeded as if the hearing were a trial, apparently thinking that the judge would accept jurisdiction because there were two separate incidents involved. At the conclusion of the hearing the District Court judge stated that, with respect to each de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>fendant, he would \u201cfind probable cause on the assault and battery [as to Perretti] and decline jurisdiction on the assault [as to Maloney].\u201d The defendant was bound over to the grand jury who subsequently returned an indictment charging the defendant with assault by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The defendant moved in the Superior Court to dismiss the indictment on the ground that he had already been tried in the District Court, and that another trial would place him in double jeopardy. The motion was denied, and thereafter the defendant was tried (along with Perretti) and convicted of assault by means of a dangerous weapon. The defendant was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This case presents the same issue faced by this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, </em>370 Mass. 288, 290-291 (1976), namely, whether the proceeding in a District Court constituted a trial on the merits. If a probable cause hearing was being conducted, no jeopardy would attach. <em>Id. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>362 Mass. 325, 330 (1972). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>331 Mass. 510, 511-512 (1954). See <em>Burhoe </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>289 F. Supp. 408, 411 (D. Mass. 1968). Under the rule, as first stated in <em>Corey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>364 Mass. 137, 141-142 n.7 (1973), if a District Court has jurisdiction of a case concurrently with the Superior Court, a District Court judge must indicate, before the hearing commences, whether he is conducting a probable cause hearing or a full trial on the merits. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clemmons, supra </em>at 291, we inferred that a trial on the merits was being held where the judge gave no indication that he might decline jurisdiction, and where the defendant had every reason to believe that a trial was being conducted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mesrobian, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 355 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 679 (1978). The Commonwealth argues that the instant case is distinguishable because two factors served to put the defendant on notice that a probable cause hearing was being conducted. First, the clerk of the court expressly stated that the judge would most likely decline jurisdiction over the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>fendant Maloney\u2019s case. Second, it argues, and we take notice, that it is not unusual, in a case where there are codefendants and one of them is charged with a crime that is not within the jurisdiction of a District Court, that both defendants will be bound over for trial in the Superior Court. See K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 686 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">We do not agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s arguments. We affirm our prior decisions requiring a District Court judge to announce, before a hearing <em>commences, </em>whether he is conducting a probable cause hearing or a trial on the merits. We note that this requirement is also emphasized in the Standards of Judicial Practice, Trials and Probable Cause Hearings in the District Court Department \u00a7 1:03 (November, 1981). The result here is controlled by our reasoning in <em>Clemmons. </em>The surmise of the clerk, expressed privately to defense counsel, was not sufficient to satisfy the <em>Corey </em>requirement. We add that, of course, it would be sufficient under <em>Corey </em>if the clerk, in the judge\u2019s presence, had informed counsel and the defendant that the proceeding was a probable cause inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">We conclude that a trial on the merits was conducted in the District Court, and that, therefore, jeopardy attached. Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, the verdict set aside, and the indictment is to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\"> General Laws c. 218, \u00a7 26, has since been rewritten to include assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon as being within the jurisdiction of the District Courts.
