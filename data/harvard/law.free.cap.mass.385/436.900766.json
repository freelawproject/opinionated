Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We transferred the report here on our own motion. We answer questions reported as to certain sections of our General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Laws dealing with nonsupport and illegitimacy. G.

Lobo.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Sometime after a complaint was issued charging the defendant with nonsupport under \u00a7 15, the action was redesignated a proceeding under \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant appeared pro se, pleaded not guilty, but admitted to sufficient facts to convict, at a bench trial in the District Court. He was adjudicated the father of the child and the judge entered a pendente lite order of $75 a week, which included $5 a week for \u201carrears.\u201d The defendant\u2019s appeal was entered in the jury of six session of the Boston Municipal Court on April 10, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\"><em>Commonwealth vs. Joseph Trusty. </em>On January 28, 1981, the mother of a two and one-half year old child, in conjunction with an employee of the Department of Public Welfare, obtained a complaint under \u00a7 15 against this defendant. Trusty was adjudicated the father of the child and was found \u201cguilty\u201d after a jury-waived hearing in the District Court. He was ordered to pay $30 a week, plus $10 a week for \u201car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>rears.\u201d His appeal, taken March 13, 1981, was also entered in the jury of six session of the Boston Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><em>Commonwealth vs. David Murray. </em>The defendant was charged under \u00a7 15 with failure to support two illegitimate children, who were then three and one-half and five years of age. The defendant was defaulted, and an arrest warrant issued, after he failed to answer a summons for his appearance. He was arrested and arraigned on March 2, 1981. Prior to trial, the judge dismissed the allegations of nonsupport.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Murray was adjudicated the father of the children and appealed. The appeal was entered in the jury of six session of the Boston Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The questions reported by the judge are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u201c(1) Does M.G.L. Ch. 273, sec. 12 state a civil cause of action despite language in that section regarding the imposition of a sentence after an adjudication of paternity?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u201c(2) Does a defendant charged under Ch. 273, sec. 12 have a right of appeal to the Jury of Six Session (M.G.L., Ch. 218, secs. 26A and 27A) or to the Superior Court Department as indicated in Ch. 273, sec. 12?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u201c(3) Does a defendant have a right to appeal a question of law under Ch. 273, sec. 12 from the primary court to the Appellate Division for resolution?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\u201c(4) If Ch. 273, sec. 12 states a civil cause of action is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a proper party to bring the complaint?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">\u201c(5) Can a trial justice of a primary court impose a <em>pendente lite </em>order under Ch. 273, sec. 12 after the defendant exercises his right to appeal the adjudication of paternity pending the outcome of the trial de nova?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">\u201c(6) Can a warrant be issued for the arrest of a defendant under Ch. 273, sec. 12 where he fails to appear after the issuance of a summons?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">\u201c(7) Does an order for the repayment to the Department of Public Welfare of money expended by it for support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the minor child following a final adjudication of paternity violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Before proceeding to answer the questions reported, we detour for an overview of the statutory provisions for the support of children, born both in and out of wedlock, as they were in effect and material to the present cases. For the purposes of our discussion, the relevant portions of c. 273 are \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In 1911 the Legislature passed the Uniform Desertion Act, which is now codified as G. L. c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 1-10. St. 1911, c. 456. Sections 1 through 10 apply to the failure of a parent to support his or her legitimate children. We examine them first because, by the terms of G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 16,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as appearing in St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 6, the penalties, orders, and payments provided under \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 10 are applicable to proceedings under \u00a7\u00a712 through 18, which deal with the obligations of parents of illegitimate children. We are guided in our inquiry by the necessity of harmonizing, as closely as possible, the procedures governing the provision of support for illegitimate children with the procedures established for obtaining support for legitimate children. <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Amherst, </em>372 Mass. 46, 51 (1977). See <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342, 345 (1978); G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 10. We make such an effort despite the difficulties posed by the failure of the Legislature to clarify the statutory scheme when it amended G. L. c. 273 subsequent to our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>368 Mass. 613 (1975). See St. 1977, c. 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\"><em>G. L. c. 273, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>1-10 (legitimate children). </em>Section 1 of c. 273 provides for punishment \u201cby a fine of not more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both\u201d of \u201c[a]ny . . . parent . . . who unreasonably neglects or refuses to provide for the support and maintenance . . . of his minor child.\u201d G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 2. Under \u00a7 3 the court is authorized to utilize the criminal probation collection system to collect fines imposed in proceedings under \u00a7 1. A probation officer is empowered by \u00a7 3 to make payments to whoever is \u201cactually supporting\u201d the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Section 4<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> makes provision for the fashioning of pendente lite orders, the violation of which is punishable \u201cas for a contempt by the court before which the case is then pending.\u201d If such order is made by a District Court judge, the taking of an appeal does not vacate it. See <em>Kelley, petitioner, </em>292 Mass. 198, 199-200 (1935) (violation of c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4, is a crime, and punishment, by contempt, for failure to comply with pendente lite order is constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Under \u00a7 5, as most recently amended by St. 1979, c. 621, \u00a7 1, the court is empowered to order a defendant who pleads guilty or nolo contendere, or who is convicted under \u00a7 1, \u201cto pay certain sums periodically, for a term not exceeding six years,\u201d to a probation officer, for disbursement as in \u00a7 3. Evidence of a voluntary support agreement, previously executed, is admissible and, if the court finds that the terms are reasonable, an order may include, where appropriate, any arrearages due under the agreement. Section 6 provides for release of a defendant from custody on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>recognizance or bail. Bail that is forfeited may be ordered paid to the probation department for disbursement under \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">As to prosecutions begun under \u00a7 1, \u00a7 7 states in part that \u201c[n]o other or greater evidence shall be required to prove the marriage of the husband and wife, or that the alleged father is the parent of the child, than may be required to prove the same facts in a civil action.\u201d G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 7, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">G. L. <em>c. 273, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 <em>12-18 (illegitimate children). </em>Turning our attention to \u00a7\u00a7 12 through 18, we are faced immediately with the major difference between these sections and the preceding ones: the necessity of an adjudication of paternity under \u00a7 12 or \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 12A makes provision for the administration of blood grouping tests, on motion of the alleged father, in any proceeding to determine the question of paternity. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Possehl, </em>355 Mass. 575 (1969) (State payment of blood grouping tests for indigent defendant in paternity adjudication). See also <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>452 U.S. 1 (1981). Such provisions are obviously necessary because, unlike the situation in the case of legitimate children, the paternity of the father is not presumptively established by the fact of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Under \u00a7 13, after paternity has been determined, the court is empowered to continue the case until the child is born, notwithstanding other laws limiting adjournments or continuances. The court may order payment, to the mother or to a probation officer, of the expenses of pregnancy and confinement. Failure to comply with such orders is punishable, as contempt of court, by a term of imprisonment not to exceed two months. After the adjudication of paternity, \u00a7 14 authorizes the court, \u201cas justice and the welfare of the child require,\u201d to make orders, binding on all parties, for the care and custody of the child.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Section 15,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> like \u00a7\u00a7 1-4 as to a legitimate child, makes the neglect or refusal, by a parent of an illegitimate child, to contribute reasonably to his or her support and maintenance, a misdemeanor. In addition, this section makes the duty of support a continuing one during the minority of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">With this overview of the pertinent provisions of c. 273 in mind, we proceed to the questions reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\"><em>Questions (1), (4), and (6). </em>These questions arise, not surprisingly, with regard to a statutory scheme which has undergone several marked transformations in this century. At common law, there was no legal obligation of the father to support his illegitimate child. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Misiano, </em>373 Mass. 261, 263 (1977). Commonwealth v. Dornes, 239 Mass. 592, 593-594 (1921). But see <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>State, </em>411 A.2d 317, 320 (Del. Super. Ct. 1980) (suggesting that the duty did exist at common law). Such a duty was nevertheless imposed by statute in this Commonwealth as early as 1692, see Province Laws 1692-1693, c. 18, \u00a7 5, the purpose of a \u201cbastardy\u201d proceeding being \u201cto redress ... a civil injury . . . [and] to compel the putative father to aid the mother in the support and maintenance of the child.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>6 Pick. 104, 106-108 (1828). While such proceedings were recognized to contain elements of both civil and criminal actions, <em>id. </em>at 106-107, they were held to be, in substance, civil suits. See <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>194 Mass. 291, 292 (1907); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Makepeace, </em>103 Mass. 50, 53, 56-57 (1869).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">With the passage of St. 1913, c. 563,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cthe statutes of the Commonwealth [began to express] in a criminal context a father\u2019s responsibility for fathering an illegitimate child.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, supra </em>at 614. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dornes, supra </em>at 594; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mekelburg, </em>235 Mass. 383 (1920). These statutes, later codified as G. L. c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 11-19, made the begetting of an illegitimate child a misdemeanor under \u00a7 11 and made \u201cthe non-support of such a child a distinct and continuing of-fence\u201d and a misdemeanor under \u00a7 15. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dornes, supra. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mondano, </em>352 Mass. 260, 261 (1967); <em>Vivori </em>v. <em>Fourth Dist. Court of Berkshire, </em>323 Mass. 336, 337-338 (1948); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Micheli, </em>258 Mass. 89, 91 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Until 1977, \u00a7 12 provided the mechanism for appeals from convictions for \u201cbegetting\u201d under \u00a7 11. With the repeal of \u00a7 11, by St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 7, proceedings to determine the father of the child of unwed parents for purposes of imposing support orders were henceforth governed by \u00a7 12. Prior to the repeal of \u00a7 11, however, we had occasion to examine the criminal sanctions provided in \u00a7 11 for the act of begetting. We concluded that, while a criminal conviction and sentence could not constitutionally be imposed, a complaint under \u00a7 11 \u201cmay be used to initiate a proceeding to adjudicate paternity . . . [and to provide] a basis for an order directing the father to contribute toward pregnancy expenses . . . and the support of the child.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, supra </em>at 618. Having \u201cde-criminalized\u201d \u00a7 11, we nevertheless stated that, absent any action to the contrary by the Legislature, \u201c[a]ny proceeding under \u00a7 11 should be treated in all respects as a criminal proceeding .... For example, paternity must be established beyond a reasonable doubt and the alleged father may not be compelled to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619 n.5. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Misiano, supra </em>at 263-264. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Possehl, supra </em>(State payment of blood grouping tests for indigent defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">With the exception of changes designed to enable c. 273 to withstand constitutional challenge, the Legislature has not yet acted to alter substantially the form of paternity proceedings. Thus, the \u201ccriminal attributes . . . retained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>\u00a7 11,\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Misiano, supra </em>at 264, after <em>MacKenzie </em>and prior to repeal, were simply engrafted to \u00a7 12 by the Legislature in 1977. These procedural trappings of a criminal trial, in addition to the criminal law terminology retained in \u00a7 12,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> lead us to characterize proceedings under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12, as \u201cquasi criminal\u201d in form, but civil in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We distinguish the nature of an action from its procedural format in order to make clear our use of the term \u201cquasi criminal.\u201d Where the action is quasi criminal in form, but the purpose of the proceeding does not contemplate punishment,, it is by nature civil, or remedial. Cf. <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>375 Mass. 733, 746 (1978) (where care and custody proceedings under G. L. c. 119 no longer have as \u201cgoverning principle\u201d the \u201cdiscipline\u201d of the parent, proceedings are \u201ccivil and not criminal in nature\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>365 Mass. 265, 269 (1974) (proceedings under G. L. c. 123A, for commitment of sexually dangerous persons, are \u201ccivil and nonpunitive in nature\u201d). Given that the support and maintenance of children should be shared by those responsible for bringing them into the world, the primary object of a \u00a7 12 proceeding is to identify the father in order to impose on him his obligation and to protect the public from the cost of maintenance. See <em>Vivori </em>v. <em>Fourth Dist. Court of Berkshire, supra </em>at 337-338. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>v. <em>Lanoue, </em>326 Mass. 559, 562 (1950). We have previously held that such a purpose in practice made the \u201cdecriminalized\u201d version of c. 273, \u00a7 11, remedial and in essence civil. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>383 Mass. 410, 412 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, post </em>455 (1982). Compare <em>Custody of a Minor, supra. </em>The same reasoning applies to c. 273, \u00a7 12. We hold that a paternity proceeding conducted pursuant to G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12, is by nature a civil proceeding, the purpose of which is not to find and punish a criminal adversary of the State, but rather to determine whether the accused is the father of the illegitimate child, and, if so, what shall be the reasonable support obligation imposed on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The Legislature has chosen, in enacting G. L. c. 273, to utilize the machinery of the criminal justice system for its enforcement. Compare <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>452 U.S. 1,11-12 (1981). Much, though not all, of the panoply of criminal procedural protections is extended to the putative father.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These procedural trappings of a criminal trial are not, as we have said above, sufficient to make \u00a7 12 proceedings strictly criminal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, we conclude the answer to question (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>is that, because a \u201cconviction\u201d under it is not followed by a fine or by imprisonment, but instead by a support order, \u00a7 12 sounds civilly though proceedings under it are quasi criminal in form. The answer to question (1) is \u201cYes.\u201d The issue raised by question (4) is whether, if G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12, \u201cstates a civil cause of action . . . the Commonwealth of Massachusetts [is] a proper party to bring the complaint.\u201d Having concluded that \u00a7 12 is, in nature, a civil proceeding, we answer question (4) \u201cYes,\u201d for the following reasons. At the outset, it is clear that the Commonwealth properly is a party to a large number of actions civil in nature. See, e.g., G. L. c. 258; G, L. c. 119; G. L. c. 123A. In regard to an analogous child support proceeding, we have noted that the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, G. L. c. 273A, has as its purpose \u201cto provide an effective procedure to compel performance by one under a duty to support dependents in another State.\u201d M_ v. W_, 352 Mass. 704, 706-707 (1967), quoting from <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>336 Mass. 561, 562-563 (1958). Under G. L. c. 273A, \u00a7 5, the Commonwealth has the right to commence support proceedings, in the name of the person entitled to support. Further, under G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 21, the Department of Public Welfare is subrogated to the rights of any welfare recipient and may commence civil or criminal proceedings in its own name, or in the name of the recipient, regarding support. Similar provisions are found in G. L. c. 118E, \u00a7 21E (medical care and assistance payments), and G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 3 (aid to dependent children). Under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 12-18, the Legislature has enacted a statutory scheme not only to protect the interests of illegitimate children, but also those of the State. Historically, this legislation is \u201cconnected with the system of poor relief,\u201d and a main object of such legislation \u201chas been to provide secur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>ity for the [State] liable to support the . . . child.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dornes, </em>239 Mass, at 593-594.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In addition, \u201c [t]he statutory purposes advanced by the Commonwealth [to] support a paternity and child support statute . . . used to establish paternity and oblige the father to contribute toward pregnancy and childbirth expenses . . . [permit] the Legislature to focus statutory attention ... on the fathers of illegitimate children.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>368 Mass, at 616-617. The Commonwealth is a proper party to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">For the same reasons, and in answer to question (6), the furnishing by the State of its name and its criminal justice machinery to compel performance of the duty to support dependent children necessarily comprehends the issuance of arrest warrants after the failure by a named party to comply with a summons. Cf. G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 25, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\"><em>Question </em>(5). Perhaps the most important practical issue presented in this report concerns the authority of a judge of a primary court to impose a pendente lite order under \u00a7 12 when the defendant elects to exercise his right to a trial de nova on the issue of paternity. Defendant Lobo argues that the duty to support an illegitimate child does not arise until a final adjudication of paternity, since the duty is statutory and did not exist at common law. He argues that an appeal de nova has the effect of voiding the adjudication of the primary court, and hence an order based on that adjudication cannot be immediately enforceable. See <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>359 Mass. 661, 666 (1971). But see <em>Rubera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>371 Mass. 177, 183 (1976) (fact that judge in bench trial found defendant guilty not a nullity for all purposes because of appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The answer to the defendant\u2019s argument is found in the statute itself. The Legislature has made provision for temporary orders for the support of the child. General Laws c. 273, \u00a7 4, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>empowers a District Court judge to \u201center such temporary order as may seem just . . . pendente lite\u201d for the support of the child at any time after arraignment and before the entry of an appeal. The next to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the last sentence in \u00a7 4 specifically states that an appeal shall not vacate such order. By the terms of \u00a7 16, see note 10, <em>supra, </em>a judge in the primary court is empowered to enter pendente lite orders after an adjudication of paternity under \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The obligation of paying temporary support pending appeal of an adjudication of paternity works an obvious hardship on a defendant later determined not to be responsible for fathering the child. His chances of later recovering his money may be slim,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> but we see in the statutory pattern a recognition by the Legislature that the interest primarily at stake in the paternity action is that of the child in need of support. Coupled with this is the fact that a \u00a7 12 proceeding is not criminal in nature. Compare G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 391 (filing of appeal from care and protection order does not stay the order appealed from); G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 20 (c) (during appeal of extension of commitment of juvenile to Department of Youth Services, juvenile remains under control of board). <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>384 Mass. 784 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\"><em>Question </em>(2). At the time the appeals in this case were taken, \u00a7 12 expressly provided that \u201c[a]t the sitting when such adjudication is made by a district court, if made after a plea of not guilty, the alleged father may appeal therefrom to the superior court as in other criminal cases.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 212, \u00a7 6, prior to St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 117. The defendants have challenged the jurisdiction of the judge in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>jury of six session to hear these cases. They request a transfer to the Superior Court. We are of the opinion that appellate jurisdiction is properly in the District Court jury of six session. The Court Reorganization Act (Act), St. 1978, c. 478, amended G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A, to create the jury of six session \u201cfor the purpose of hearing appeals by defendants\u201d found guilty of criminal offenses in the District Courts. St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 189. By \u00a7 187 of the Act, G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26, was amended to give the District Courts original jurisdiction over specifically enumerated offenses, including \u201call misdemeanors, except libels.\u201d Adjudications of paternity under G. L. e. 273, \u00a7 12, are not, however, included.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 18, was also amended, by \u00a7 302 of the Act, to read in pertinent part that, \u201c <em>[notwithstanding any other provision of law, </em>a defendant after a finding of guilty, jury waived, in a district court . . . may appeal therefrom and shall thereafter be entitled to a trial de nova in a jury-of-six session\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We think this catchall provision applies to adjudications of paternity. Although paternity is not a \u201ccrime\u201d in the sense of the first sentence of \u00a7 18, sufficient criminal \u201ctrappings\u201d have been retained by the Legislature in \u00a7 12 to indicate that it intended that these de nova appeals also go to the jury of six session. This conclusion is consistent with the action of the Legislature in later amending \u00a7 12 to allow for appeals to a jury of six. See note 21, <em>supra. </em>But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 816 (1980) (appeal taken prior to the effective date of the Act). Such a \u201cgap\u201d as the temporary exclusion of \u00a7 12 adjudications from coverage by c. 218, \u00a7 26, is \u201cvirtually inevitable in any piece of legislation as complex as the court reorganization plan.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germano, </em>379 Mass. 268, 273 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\"><em>Question </em>(3). Although we have held that proceedings under \u00a7 12 are in essence civil, though in form quasi criminal, the appellate division is not the proper forum in which to bring an appeal from an adjudication. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 108. Compare M_ v. W_, 352 Mass, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>710 (\u201c [t]he principal difference between a civil proceeding under c. 273A and a quasi criminal nonsupport prosecution [under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 15] is that appellate review under c. 273A will be by the Appellate Division . . . rather than [as under c. 273] by ... a jury trial de nova\u201d). We are not inclined to hold otherwise in the absence of a clear statement by the Legislature. Furthermore, we note that recent amendments to \u00a7 12 disclose a legislative intention that questions of law continue to be decided as in other criminal cases. See St. 1981, c. 92, and St. 1981, c. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\"><em>Question </em>(7). The last question reported asks whether, after a final adjudication of paternity, a judge may enter an order for the repayment to the Department of Public Welfare (department) of money expended by it for the support of a minor child. Since proceedings in these cases have been brought pursuant either to \u00a7 12 or to \u00a7 15, we answer the question with regard to both provisions of c. 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">First, we recognize the power given, by statute, to the department to \u201ctake all lawful means which shall include, in appropriate cases, the institution of criminal proceedings, to compel all persons bound to support such . . . child or children to support them.\u201d G. L. c. 118, \u00a7 3, as amended through St. 1979, c. 393, \u00a7 69. See G. L. c. 18, \u00a7 21; 106 Code Mass. Regs. 305.033, 305.038, 305.090, &amp; 305.100 (1979). Compare <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>380 Mass. 480, 485 (1980). We conclude, in light of the statutory authorization, that the department is entitled to seek an order for repayment of money expended by it for the support of a child, as \u201caccrued maintenance.\u201d See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Streater, </em>452 U.S. at 4. We examine in turn both \u00a7 12 and \u00a7 15, in order to determine whether the entry of orders with retroactive effect is permissible after proceedings under each of these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Proceedings under \u00a7 15 are discussed more fully in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, post </em>461 (1982). By the terms of our opinion in <em>Chase, </em>no obstacle, constitutional or otherwise, is presented to a retroactive payment order, made after a final conviction of nonsupport and limited to a period of six years next preceding the commencement of the action. By definir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>tian, a conviction for failure to support must encompass the possibility of retroactive orders. <em>Id. </em>at 470-471.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The same does not hold, however, for such orders made after an adjudication of paternity under \u00a7 12. As we have said earlier, see note 13, <em>supra, </em>we discern a legislative expectation that actions involving \u00a7\u00a7 12-14 would be brought from a point a few months before, to one shortly after, the birth of the child. Under these sections, the expenses of the pregnancy and confinement of the mother are properly the subject of an order. Failure to comply with the order would be the basis for an action for nonsupport, or a contempt, or both. But to go further and to allow the imposition of retroactive support orders under \u00a7 12, is to adopt an interpretation of that section not consistent with the legislative scheme. A retroactive support order under \u00a7 12 would have to be based on a finding of a failure to support. Such a finding is reserved to proceedings under \u00a7 15. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Thus, since Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>Edward J. Lobo was transformed from a \u00a7 15 to a \u00a7 12 proceeding, that portion of the amount in the pendente lite order described as \u201carrears\u201d was improper. In Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>Joseph Trusty, although the proceedings were held under \u00a7 15, the portion of the pendente lite order ascribed to \u201carrears\u201d was also improper because it was made before a final conviction of nonsupport. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, supra. </em>This does not affect the remaining portion of these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">We summarize our answers to the questions reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">Question (1): Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">Question (2): To the Jury of Six Session of the District Court Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">Question (3): No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">Question (4): Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">Question (5): Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">Question (6): Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-14\">Question (7): Orders for reimbursement of any kind may be made only after an adjudication that has become final under \u00a7 12 or after final conviction under \u00a7 15; but reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>bursement payments of \u201carrearages\u201d claimed to have been incurred prior to an adjudication under \u00a7 12 are impermissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The cases are remanded to the jury of six session of the Boston Municipal Court for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\"> Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>Carmen Mayo, which was originally included in the cases reported, was later consolidated with another case which raises issues concerning the statute of limitations in paternity cases.

If the alleged father pleads guilty or nolo contendere, or is found guilty, the court shall enter a judgment adjudging him the father of the child; but such adjudication shall not be made after a plea of not guilty, against the objection of the alleged father, until the child is born or the court finds that the mother is at least six months pregnant.

An action is quasi criminal in <em>nature </em>where, in addition to having aspects of criminal procedure, it may be seen to have an unseverable and dominant punitive element incorporated as well, either as a sentence, penalty, or fine. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1972 Chevrolet Van, ante </em>198, 200-202 &amp; n.2 (1982) (forfeiture proceedings pursuant to G.
