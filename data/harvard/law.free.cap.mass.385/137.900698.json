The vehicle was insured by the plaintiff (insurer), and the insurer paid the father the amount of the damage, less a $200 deductible. Because the son was using the vehicle without authority, he was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under his father\u2019s policy. The son had no liability insurance coverage applicable to the damage to the motor vehicle. The insurer brought this action against the son to recover the amount of the loss it paid to the defendant\u2019s father. The insurance policy contained a subrogation clause. We conclude that the insurer, as subrogee, is entitled to judgment against the defendant son for the amount of the loss it paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The action was commenced in the Third District Court of Eastern Middlesex and decided in favor of the defendant on a motion for summary judgment, accompanied by a stipulation of facts. On report to the Appellate Division of the District Courts, the defendant again prevailed. In its opinion, the Appellate Division concluded that it was bound by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sorensen </em>v. <em>Sorensen, </em>369 Mass. 350, 352-353 (1975), which abrogated parental immunity in motor vehicle accidents \u201cto the extent of the parent\u2019s automobile liability insurance coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The Appellate Division noted that the holding in the <em>Sorensen </em>case, that parental immunity was abrogated only to the extent of the insurance coverage, had been seriously questioned. In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>370 Mass. 619, 630 n.4 (1976), which concerned interspousal immunity, this court followed the logic of the reasoning in the <em>Sorensen </em>case, but not its holding, and declined to limit liability in interspousal tort actions to cases where insurance coverage was available. Subsequently, one Justice of this court expressly disavowed the availability of insurance as an essential element for recovery where a child brings a motor vehicle tort action against his or her parent. <em>Pevoski </em>v. <em>Pevoski, </em>371 Mass. 358, 362-363 (1976) (Quirico, J., concurring). Although, as will be seen, we need not answer the question whether the availability of insurance is essential to recovery in a motor vehicle tort personal injury action between parent and child, these recent opinions suggest that the availability of insurance may indeed be irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Here, we are concerned with a tort claim for damage to a motor vehicle and not one for personal injuries. The two <em>pre-Sorensen </em>opinions of this court establishing immunity in actions between parent and child were carefully limited to their facts and involved claims for negligently caused personal injury. <em>Oliveria </em>v. <em>Oliveria, </em>305 Mass. 297, 300 (1940) (parent v. minor child). <em>Luster </em>v. <em>Luster, </em>299 Mass. 480, 484 (1938) (minor child v. father). Intrafamily immunity has never been recognized in contract disputes or in disputes concerning property. <em>Sorensen </em>v. <em>Sorensen, supra </em>at 353. See 1 F. Harper &amp; F. James, Torts \u00a7 8.11, at 647-648 (1956); W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 122, at 865 (4th ed. 1971). Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>has there been intrafamily immunity for tort actions based on negligent damage to property. 1 F. Harper &amp; F. James, <em>supra </em>at 647-648; W. Prosser, <em>supra </em>at 866; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 895G, Comment d (1979). With the doubtful logic of intrafamily immunity in motor vehicle personal injury actions already noted by this court, we decline to create a new common law principle of intrafamily immunity in motor vehicle tort actions arising from negligent damage to a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The defendant argues for the first time here that subrogation should be denied because the defendant son was entitled to the insurance protection purchased by his father. That argument is foreclosed by the stipulation that the son had no liability insurance coverage applicable to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We acknowledge that the defendant\u2019s father may feel obliged in a moral sense to satisfy the judgment obtained against his son. Motor vehicle liability insurance policyholders may reasonably expect that members of their households are covered, at least for damage to the family car, even when that car was used without authority. To insureds such as the defendant\u2019s father, insurance coverage has a hollow quality because, assuming solvency, the family unit collectively obtains no benefit from it. But it has long been part of the motor vehicle insurance law of this Commonwealth that insurance coverage is available only if a motor vehicle is used with the owner\u2019s express or implied consent. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, defining \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy,\u201d first inserted by St. 1925, c. 346, \u00a7 2, using the words \u201cexpress or implied consent.\u201d If any change is to be made in what may be a harsh rule in some instances, it should be a legislative one. Until any change is made, insurers are entitled to enjoy the benefits, as well as to suffer the burdens, of the absence of intrafamily immunity in motor vehicle property damage tort actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The order of the Appellate Division dismissing the report is reversed. Judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
