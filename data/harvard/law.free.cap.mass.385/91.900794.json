It rented many of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>apartments to low income tenants under a Federal rent supplement program. From December, 1973, to November, 1977, Celeste Solomon and her two young sons lived in the basement apartment of a building managed by Gem. In December, 1976, Gem began summary process proceedings to evict Solomon for nonpayment of rent. Solomon, citing floods, trash, rats, roaches, and more, denied that she owed rent. She also filed a counterclaim in four counts, claiming that Gem had (1) broken its implied warranty of habitability; (2) violated its implied covenant of quiet enjoyment; (3) caused Solomon emotional distress through its negligent failure to maintain her apartment; and (4) intentionally inflicted emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Solomon\u2019s counterclaims are based primarily on her allegations of flooding in her apartment. She testified at trial that water and sewage, flowing from an adjoining basement area, flooded her apartment approximately thirty times during her tenancy. Solomon could not recall the date of any of the floods, but was able to name the months in which floods had occurred. She testified that each flood had occurred between twelve and two o\u2019clock in the morning; she described stepping from bed into ankle deep water and slime. Each time this happened, Solomon would spend the night in her kitchen, drinking coffee, and waiting for the morning to call Gem. According to Solomon, a Gem cleanup crew would arrive several hours after her call to pump the water from her apartment. Solomon\u2019s testimony concerning the flooding was corroborated by photographs showing water damage, and by witnesses who had seen water or evidence of water in Solomon\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Solomon did not suffer bodily injury as a result of the flooding. She testified, however, that the floods caused her great emotional anguish. The recurrent water and sewage left her \u201cwithdrawn,\u201d \u201cdepressed,\u201d and \u201cashamed,\u201d unable to work or to care for her children. She began to spend much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of her time in a darkened bedroom, crying, and on two occasions she sent her children to stay with relatives, so that they might escape the conditions in her apartment. Two psychiatric experts testified that Solomon had suffered serious emotional injury as a result of her living conditions, and was in need of substantial psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Gem admits that water entered Solomon\u2019s apartment on several occasions, but denies that thirty \u201cfloods\u201d occurred. At trial, Gem\u2019s employees described in detail Gem\u2019s maintenance procedures and its answering service for tenants\u2019 complaints, and testified that they had no memory or record of repeated reports of flooding in Solomon\u2019s apartment. Gem also gave evidence concerning the structure of Solomon\u2019s building and the possible cause of flooding, and argued that third persons were responsible for any floods that occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The judge granted summary judgment for Gem on Solomon\u2019s count for negligent maintenance, reasoning that a claim of negligence could not support recovery for purely emotional harm unaccompanied by physical injuries. The judge submitted the remaining three counts to the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury returned verdicts for Solomon on each count, awarding her $35,000 for recklessly inflicted emotional distress, $10,000 for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and $1,000 for breach of the warranty of habitability. The judge subsequently awarded Solomon counsel fees, as permitted by the \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d statute, G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, in an amount of slightly more than $40,000. Gem has appealed the judgments entered on the verdicts and fee award. Solomon asserts that she is entitled to recover the total of the three verdicts, and the counsel fees, and has ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>pealed the summary judgment for Gem on her count for negligently-caused emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We affirm the judgments entered for Solomon on her claims for breach of the warranty of habitability, reckless infliction of emotional distress, and attorneys\u2019 fees. We also affirm the judgment entered for Gem on Solomon\u2019s claim of negligence. We vacate the $10,000 award for interference with quiet enjoyment.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">1. <em>Reckless infliction of emotional distress. </em>Our decisions in recent years have firmly established that a plaintiff may recover for emotional distress inflicted recklessly or intentionally. <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140 (1976). <em>George </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>359 Mass. 244 (1971). See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46 (1965). In <em>Agis, </em>we listed four elements necessary to a recovery on this theory. The plaintiff must show \u201c (1) that the actor intended to inflict emotional distress or that he knew or should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of his conduct; ... (2) that the conduct was \u2018extreme and outrageous\u2019 . . . ; (3) that the actions of the defendant were the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s distress; .... and (4) that the emotional distress sustained by the plaintiff was \u2018severe\u2019 . . . .\u201d Agis, <em>supra </em>at 144-145. If each of these elements is proven, the plaintiff can recover for purely emotional suffering unaccompanied by physical injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Gem does not seriously challenge the finding of the jury that Solomon suffered severe emotional distress as a result of the floods in her apartment. Instead, Gem stresses that Solomon did not identify a specific \u201cdefect\u201d in the apartment building that Gem, as landlord, should have repaired. On this basis Gem argues that it did not act recklessly, did not engage in outrageous conduct, and did not cause Solomon\u2019s floods.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The central thrust of Gem\u2019s contentions appears to be that its conduct was not the proximate cause of Solomon\u2019s injuries \u2014 that it was not legally responsible for her misfortune. As Gem points out, the source of the floods was not clear. The water appears to have entered Solomon\u2019s apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>ment primarily from an adjoining basement area. Two waste stacks, admittedly very old, extended from roof to basement collecting waste from the bathrooms, and on occasion may have backed up through a drain in the basement. Gem\u2019s plumber, however, testified that the plumbing system and stacks were in good repair and complied with State plumbing regulations. He also stated that backups in the waste stacks were probably caused by objects that other tenants had introduced through the toilets or roof vents. On the basis of this uncontroverted testimony, Gem argues that it acted reasonably in its plumbing maintenance and therefore was not responsible for the flooding.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Gem\u2019s legal responsibility, however, depends on the duties it owed to Solomon, and Gem\u2019s arguments concerning plumbing misstate the scope of a landlord\u2019s duty to its tenants. We have held that every landlord that rents residential property warrants to its tenants that the premises will be delivered and maintained in a habitable condition. <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>363 Mass, 184 (1973). At a minimum, this warranty imposes on the landlord a duty to keep the dwelling in conformity with the State Sanitary Code. <em>Id. </em>at 200 n.16. <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>377 Mass. 443, 451 (1979). See also <em>Hemingway, supra </em>at 215-219 (Quirico, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). A landlord\u2019s breach of this duty abates the tenant\u2019s obligation to pay rent, even when the landlord is not at fault and has no reasonable opportunity to make repairs. <em>Berman &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>379 Mass. 196 (1979). Further, a landlord that fails to maintain a habitable dwelling for its tenant is liable for resulting personal injuries, at least when the landlord has failed to exercise reasonable care in maintenance. <em>Crowell, supra </em>at 450-451.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">There was evidence at trial that the wall between Solomon\u2019s apartment and the adjoining basement area was extremely porous. There was also testimony suggesting that Gem may have considered cementing the wall to prevent floods, but never carried out this plan. The jury could reasonably conclude that Gem\u2019s failure to do so caused Solo-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>man\u2019s injuries \u2014 that but for Gem\u2019s inaction, no floods would have occurred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>383 Mass. 95, 97-98 (1981); W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 41, at 237 (4th ed. 1971). Further, a section of the State Sanitary Code (received in evidence), provides that apartments must be watertight. 105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 410.000 (1978). In light of our decisions holding landlords responsible for injuries resulting from breaches of sanitary code provisions, Gem\u2019s behavior was a sufficiently \u201cproximate\u201d cause to justify the imposition of liability. W. Prosser, <em>supra </em>at 244. <em>Crowell, supra </em>at 450-452.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Having recognized that an inference was warranted that Gem failed in its duty to prevent the flooding, we find ample evidence in the record from which the jury could conclude that the remaining elements of an action for reckless infliction of emotional distress \u2014 recklessness, outrageous conduct, and severe emotional distress<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 were present. See <em>Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140 (1976). Solomon testified that she had repeatedly complained to Gem of floods. She stated that Gem on each occasion sent a cleanup crew to pump out the water, but never took permanent action. The jury, if they believed this testimony, could find that Gem knew or should have known that unless it fixed the porous wall flooding would occur, and that floods of sewage water were very likely to cause emotional harm. See <em>Agis, supra </em>at 144-145; Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 46, Comment i (1965) (recklessness). The jury could also find that Gem had displayed, over a long and repetitious course, such a pattern of indifference that its conduct was outrageous, \u201cbeyond all possible bounds of decency.\u201d Agis, <em>supra </em>at 145 (quoting from Restatement [Second] of Torts \u00a7 46, Commend d [1965]). See <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Wenk, </em>378 Mass. 592, 595-596 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>In sum, it could be found that Gem violated its duty to Solomon recklessly, by outrageous omission to act, and thereby caused Solomon severe emotional harm. Therefore, the jury were warranted in holding Gem liable for reckless infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">2. <em>Negligence and strict liability. </em>Solomon has appealed the summary judgment against her on her count for negligent maintenance. As the trial judge noted in his order, we have not recognized a cause of action for negligently inflicted emotional distress unaccompanied by physical injury. <em>Dziokonski </em>v. <em>Babineau, </em>375 Mass. 555, 560 n.6, 561 n.7 (1978). <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>365 Mass. 506, 517-518 (1974). Cf. <em>Spade </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston R.R., </em>168 Mass. 285, 290 (1897) (limited on other grounds, <em>Dziokonski, supra </em>at 561). See <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 517-518 (1980). Solomon asks us to abandon the requirement of physical injury in actions brought by direct victims of negligence. See <em>Molien </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hosps., </em>27 Cal. 3d 916, 925-932 (1980); <em>Rodrigues </em>v. <em>State, </em>52 Haw. 156, 169-174 (1970). She also suggests that in the landlord-tenant context, proof of negligence should not be necessary. She argues that the warranty of habitability imposes strict liability on landlords for injuries to tenants caused by unsanitary apartment conditions, including emotional injuries. See <em>Berman </em>&amp; <em>Sons </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>379 Mass. 196, 200-203 &amp; n.9 (1979); <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>377 Mass. 443, 450-451 (1979). Compare <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Coulston, </em>85 Misc. 2d 745 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1976), with <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Justice Court Mut. Hous. Coop., </em>105 Misc. 2d 453 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1980). Cf. <em>Back </em>v. <em>Wickes Corp., </em>375 Mass. 633 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We need not decide whether a tenant could recover for purely emotional harm on a theory of negligence or strict liability, or whether the Legislature intended to authorize such recovery as \u201cconsequential\u201d damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. We have affirmed Solomon\u2019s sizeable recovery for reckless infliction of emotional distress, and she has not demonstrated that she would be entitled to additional compensation if permitted to recover under a lesser standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>of fault. It is perhaps conceivable that the verdict for recklessly inflicted emotional distress did not cover all of Solomon\u2019s suffering. If the jury based their findings of recklessness and outrageous conduct on the repetitious nature of Gem\u2019s conduct, <em>see Boyle v. Wenk, </em>378 Mass. 592, 595-596 (1979), they may have calculated damages from a point sometime after Solomon first began to suffer distress. Solomon, however, has not argued this point, and the possibility of a marginally enhanced recovery is too speculative to warrant our reaching beyond the arguments presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">3. <em>Liability under G. L. c. 186, </em>\u00a7 <em>14. </em>The judge\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees, and parts of his instructions on damages, were based on G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, which imposes civil and criminal liability on a landlord that \u201cwillfully or intentionally\u201d fails to provide essential services that it is obligated to furnish, or \u201cdirectly or indirectly interferes with the quiet enjoyment of any residential premises by the occupant.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>landlord that violates \u00a7 14 is subject to a fine or imprisonment, and is liable to its tenants for \u201cactual and consequential damages or three months\u2019 rent, whichever is greater,\u201d plus costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. See <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>378 Mass. 758 (1979). Gem contends, on several grounds, that \u00a7 14 was inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">First, Gem argues that \u00a7 14 does not create an independent civil action \u2014 that it cannot be the basis of a civil recovery until the landlord has been convicted under its criminal provisions. We reject Gem\u2019s interpretation. The statute states that one who \u201ccommits\u201d any of the proscribed acts is civilly liable; it does not require \u201cconviction.\u201d Moreover, a requirement of prior criminal conviction would defeat the efficiency of the civil remedy as a means by which tenants can enforce the statute and obtain compensation. This is particularly true in the context of summary eviction proceedings. By the express terms of the statute a tenant may apply its claims under \u00a7 14 against a claim for rent by the landlord. If a prior criminal conviction were required, however, tenants would rarely be able to raise such counterclaims in summary eviction proceedings based on nonpayment of rent. A statute should not be read in a manner that defeats its intended utility. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>365 Mass. 265, 269 (1974); <em>Hein-Werner Corp. </em>v. <em>Jackson Indus., Inc., </em>364 Mass. 523, 527 (1974). We conclude, therefore, that a tenant may bring an action for civil damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, without first pursuing criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Second, Gem contends that \u00a7 14 prohibits only intentional conduct by a landlord. As we noted earlier, the jury did not find that Gem intended to harm Solomon. It did find, however, that Gem acted recklessly. With this finding in mind, we consider the purposes, language, and context of \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Section 14 belongs to a body of statutes establishing tenants\u2019 remedies against landlords who fail to provide safe and sanitary housing. See, e.g., G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 127A-127L, c. 186, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 15E, 15F, 18, 19; c. 239, \u00a7 8A. These stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>utes are designed to facilitate enforcement of State housing regulations and to provide relief for tenants deprived of decent homes. See <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>363 Mass. 184, 191-193 (1973). The objectives of these statutes go beyond deterrence of intentional wrongdoing; unsanitary conditions in an apartment cause harm to the occupants whether the landlord has acted intentionally, negligently, or innocently. See G. L. c. 239, \u00a7 8A (no requirement that landlord must have reasonable opportunity to repair before tenant may withhold rent); <em>Berman </em>&amp; <em>Sons </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>379 Mass. 196, 200-204 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Of course, general statutory objectives do not necessarily justify the broadest reading possible. See <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 259 (1952). The Legislature may have contemplated a balance between tenant protection and the legitimate interests of landlords, and therefore may have intended that some degree of fault or foreseeability should be a prerequisite to liability under \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cf. G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 19 (liability for personal injuries, based on failure to make reasonable repairs after written notice from tenant). Our analysis of the language and history of \u00a7 14, however, leads us to conclude that malicious intent is not necessary, and that the statute covers, at the least, reckless conduct such as Gem\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">When \u00a7 14 was first enacted, both categories of prohibited conduct \u2014 failure to provide services and interference with quiet enjoyment \u2014 were modified by the words \u201cwillfully or intentionally.\u201d St. 1927, c. 339, \u00a7 1. In 1973, the statute was rewritten. St. 1973, c. 778, \u00a7 2. The requirement of intentional conduct was retained for failure to provide essential services, but deleted from the quiet enjoyment clause; landlords were now liable for \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d interfering with tenants\u2019 quiet enjoyment of leased premises. One natural inference from this amendment is that the Leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>islature meant to abrogate the requirement of specific intent to disturb quiet enjoyment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The common law background of <em>\u00a7 </em>14 also suggests that malicious intent is not a condition of liability. The phrase \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d is a familiar term in landlord-tenant law, signifying the tenant\u2019s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy \u2014 acts or omissions that \u201cimpair the character and value of the leased premises.\u201d <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>266 Mass. 33, 36 (1929) (quoting from <em>Brande </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>154 Mass. 210, 212 [1891]). See <em>Blackett </em>v. <em>Olanoff, </em>371 Mass. 714 (1977). Every tenancy is deemed to entail an implied covenant that the landlord will not disturb this right during the tenancy. <em>Id. </em>Although early cases applying the covenant of quiet enjoyment required intent on the part of the landlord, e.g., <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Duffy, </em>261 Mass. 149 (1927), more recent decisions have imposed liability whenever the \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of a landlord\u2019s action was interruption of the tenant\u2019s rights. <em>Westland Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>312 Mass. 375, 381-383 (1942). <em>Shindler </em>v. <em>Milden, </em>282 Mass. 32, 33 (1933). See also <em>Blackett </em>v. <em>Olanoff, </em>371 Mass. 714, 716 (1977).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the Legislature chose the words \u201cquiet enjoyment\u201d \u2014 words that have little inherent meaning but a rich background in decisional law \u2014 it must have intended to incorporate these cases into the statute. See <em>Pineo </em>v. <em>White, </em>320 Mass. 487, 491 (1946); <em>Commissioners of Pub. Works </em>v. <em>Cities Serv. Oil Co., </em>308 Mass. 349, 360 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Gem argues that because criminal penalties are possible under \u00a7 14, we should read a requirement of intent into the statute despite the contrary suggestions of its language and background. We disagree. Although we have often stated that penal statutes should be strictly construed, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>374 Mass. 719, 721 (1978), this maxim is a guide for resolving ambiguity, rather than a rigid require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ment that we interpret each statute in the manner most favorable to defendants. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMenimon, </em>295 Mass. 467, 470 (1936). Nor do we perceive any constitutional difficulty that would call for a narrow construction. Although the requirement of due process places some limits on legislative power to penalize innocent conduct, legislatures generally have broad power to define and limit the mens rea element of criminal offenses. See <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>California, </em>355 U.S. 225, 228-230 (1957); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass. 508, 510-512 (1968). See generally <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246 (1952). In framing statutes that create special duties of care for the protection of public health and safety, legislators may impose even strict criminal liability. <em>Morissette, supra </em>at 252-260. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dotterweich, </em>320 U.S. 277, 280-281, 284 (1943). In the present case, we need not extend the scope of \u00a7 14 beyond recklessness, and penalties for reckless conduct are well within the constraints of due process. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivo, </em>369 Mass. 62, 71 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">As its third objection to Solomon\u2019s recovery on her count for interference with quiet enjoyment, Gem asserts that it was wrongly held responsible for the actions of third parties beyond its control. Pointing to its plumber\u2019s testimony that waste backups were caused by tenants\u2019 using unauthorized washing machines or introducing objects into the waste stacks, and to its unsuccessful attempts to evict tenants for using washing machines in their apartments, Gem argues that it was unable to control the source of the flooding. Cf. <em>Blackett </em>v. <em>Olanoff, </em>371 Mass. 714 (1977). This contention echoes Gem\u2019s objections to the verdict for reckless infliction of emotional distress, and we reject it for the same reasons. The water in Solomon\u2019s apartment was a preventable situation, and one that Gem had a duty to prevent. See 105 Code Mass. Regs. 410.500; <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>McCaffrey, </em>377 Mass. 443 (1979); <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>363 Mass. 184 (1973). The jury found in answer to a special question (see note 2, supra), that the water interfered with. Solomon\u2019s quiet enjoyment of her apartment. Therefore, Gem is liable under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>In sum, we hold that a tenant need not seek a criminal conviction before claiming damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Nor must the tenant prove that the landlord intended to interfere with the tenant\u2019s rights, at least as long as the landlord\u2019s conduct was reckless. Finally, Gem is liable to Solomon under \u00a7 14 because it violated its underlying duty to maintain sanitary conditions in her apartment, and thereby permitted repeated flooding to occur that interfered with her quiet enjoyment of her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">4. <em>Evidentiary rulings. </em>Gem challenges the admission of two items of evidence. First, Gem asserts that the judge improperly allowed an expert witness to give an opinion on Solomon\u2019s truthfulness. The witness in question was a psychiatrist who testified, on the basis of an interview with Solomon, that she had suffered serious emotional disturbance as a result of the conditions in her apartment. The judge refused to allow this witness to state directly his opinion on Solomon\u2019s truthfulness during the psychiatric interview, but did permit the witness to testify that he ordinarily assessed patients\u2019 truthfulness. The judge also permitted Solomon\u2019s counsel to ask the witness what factors he had relied on in reaching his conclusion that the floods in Solomon\u2019s apartment were the cause of her distress. Immediately after this question, the judge instructed the jury that they alone were responsible for determining the truth of the parties\u2019 allegations, and that they should consider the witness\u2019s comments on truthfulness only as evidence of the process by which he had formed his opinion and the facts on which he had relied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The witness then answered that he had relied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>part on statements by Solomon concerning conditions in her apartment, and on the fact that she \u201cappeared sincere and honest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The role of an expert witness is to help the jury understand issues of fact beyond their common experience. Under modern standards, expert testimony on matters within the witness\u2019s field of expertise is admissible whenever it will aid the jury in reaching a decision, even if the expert\u2019s opinion touches on the ultimate issues that the jury must decide. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCorte, </em>373 Mass. 700, 705 (1977). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montmeny, </em>360 Mass. 526, 527-528 (1971). See Fed. R. Evid. 704, and Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 704 (July, 1980), which state the rule in very broad terms. An expert may not, however, offer his opinion on issues that the jury are equally competent to assess, such as credibility of witnesses. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>350 Mass. 664, 665-667 (1966). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montmeny, supra </em>at 528-529. On such questions, the influence of an expert\u2019s opinion may threaten the independence of the jury\u2019s decision. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, supra </em>at 667. See McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 12, at 27 (2d ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Nevertheless, the psychiatric witness\u2019s testimony was admissible as an explanation of the basis of his opinion. An expert witness may state the grounds on which he has relied in forming his opinion, as part of the foundation for his testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Auth., </em>352 Mass. 143, 151 (1967). <em>Newton Girl Scout Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Auth., </em>335 Mass. 189, 199 (1956). <em>Cronin </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster St. Ry., </em>181 Mass. 202, 203-204 (1902). Such an explanation may be of great use to the jury in determining what weight to accord the expert\u2019s testimony. In the present case, for example, the jury might have discredited the witness\u2019s testimony if they had concluded from their own observations that Solomon was not sincere. An expert\u2019s testimony explaining the foundation for his opinion should not, of course, serve as a channel for the introduction of unnecessary and prejudicial evidence. See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>152 Mass. 168, 171 (1890). In the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ent case, however, the judge\u2019s warnings that the jury should determine for themselves the credibility of witnesses, and should consider the expert\u2019s comments on sincerity only as explanations of the basis of his opinion, directly addressed the dangers that would have accompanied an unqualified expert opinion on credibility. See McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 12, at 27 (2d ed. 1972). We conclude that when, as here, an expert\u2019s statements concerning matters on which he has relied are admitted for the limited purpose of laying the foundation for his opinion and are presented to the jury in a manner that avoids prejudice to the opposing party, the trial judge\u2019s discretion should not be disturbed. See <em>Newton Girl Scout </em>Council, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Turnpike Auth., </em>335 Mass. 189,199 (1956).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See also Fed. R. Evid. 703; Proposed Mass. R. Evid. 703 (July, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Gem\u2019s second argument respecting evidence is that the judge should not have admitted two tenant complaint slips taken from Gem\u2019s telephone records. The slips were dated January 26, 1978 \u2014 several months after Solomon had moved out of her apartment. They showed that the new tenant had called Gem to complain that the ceilings were leaking and the \u201cbedroom, living room and hall\u201d were \u201cflooded.\u201d The judge admitted these complaint slips for the limited purpose of showing that Gem\u2019s maintenance supervisor had notice of a \u201cflood,\u201d and thereby impeaching his testimony on cross-examination that the only subsequent tenant complaint had involved \u201cseepage through the bedroom window.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Gem argues that Solomon could not properly introduce extrinsic evidence to impeach testimony on \u201ccollateral\u201d matters. The trial judge, however, might reasonably have determined that Gem\u2019s knowledge of complaints received from the tenant who succeeded Solomon, and the maintenance supervisor\u2019s truthfulness concerning tenant complaints, were not collateral to the issues at trial. See 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 1003-1004 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). In any event, a judge, in his discretion, may permit impeachment by extrinsic evidence even on collateral points. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>374 Mass. 293, 300 (1978). <em>Lizotte </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>302 Mass. 217, 218 (1939). In the present case, we find no abuse of discretion; the evidence was not likely to delay the trial or confuse the jury, and there was no unfair surprise to Gem in the use of its own telephone records, other parts of which had already been introduced. Cf. McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 47, at 98 (2d ed. 1972); 3A J. Wigmore, <em>supra </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1001-1002. We conclude that there was no error in the admission of the complaint slips, accompanied by the judge\u2019s careful, limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">5. <em>Damages. </em>Gem objects to the judge\u2019s extensive instructions on damages, arguing that the judge misstated the damages authorized by G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14, and incorrectly permitted the jury to assess redundant damages. Gem did not press these objections after the charge was delivered and before the jury retired, and therefore cannot claim appellate relief on the basis of defects in the instructions. Mass. R. Civ. P. 51 (b), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). In this circumstance, we would not disturb the verdicts if, by any line of reasoning, the jury might have made a correct assessment of damages. Cf. <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Dal, Inc., </em>314 Mass. 460, 462 (1943). However, Gem did file seasonable motions for directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>verdicts and for judgment notwithstanding the verdicts. Mass. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (b), 365 Mass. 814 (1974). Based upon these motions, we think that Gem is entitled to a limited review, confined to the question whether the verdicts were supportable under any view of the case as submitted to the jury. Applying this standard of decision, we have considered the evidence presented, the jury\u2019s findings, and the judge\u2019s instructions, and we conclude that the $10,000 verdict for interference with quiet enjoyment was, inescapably, an award of redundant damages. Therefore, we vacate the judgment on that award. We affirm the remaining awards for breach of warranty of habitability and infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We observe at the outset that much of the confusion that has arisen on the question of damages is attributable to the form in which the case was submitted to the jury. The jury were asked to return separate verdicts on the three counts of Solomon\u2019s claim, and responded by awarding $1,000 for breach of warranty, $10,000 for interference with quiet enjoyment, and $35,000 for infliction of emotional distress. Despite their tripartite form, however, these verdicts represent an assessment of the monetary consequences of a single problem \u2014 the flooding in Solomon\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In our analysis, therefore, we shall take an overview of the claims and corresponding damages, and avoid the misleading influence of the division of verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In his instructions to the jury, the judge outlined the damages available under each of the three theories of recovery advanced by Solomon. For interference with quiet enjoyment, he instructed the jury to award the statutory measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of damages under G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14: actual and consequential damages, or three months\u2019 rent, whichever is greater. Actual and consequential damages, he explained, included rent paid in excess of the apartment\u2019s value, income lost as a result of injury, and \u201cany damage resulting from emotional distress.\u201d For breach of the warranty of habitability, the judge instructed the jury to calculate the difference between rent paid and the value of the apartment in its defective condition. Finally, he described the elements of damage for reckless infliction of emotional distress as lost income, medical and psychiatric expense, and past, present and future pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In light of these instructions, the verdict for interference with quiet enjoyment, if based on Solomon\u2019s actual damages, necessarily duplicated both the lost rental value awarded for breach of warranty, and the items of damage awarded for infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nor can the verdict be justified on the basis of the alternative measure of damages under \u00a7 14 \u2014 three months\u2019 rent. Triple rent damages, as the judge correctly instructed the jury, are appropriate only when they exceed actual and consequential damages. G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>378 Mass. 758, 762 (1979). The jury\u2019s $35,000 verdict for emotional distress \u2014 an item of \u201cactual damage\u201d under the judge\u2019s instructions \u2014 demonstrates that Solomon\u2019s actual damages were greater than three times her rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Solomon suggests that the jury might have arrived at the $10,000 verdict for interference with quiet enjoyment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>assessing three months\u2019 rent for each of a number of separate conditions \u2014 such as rodents, overflowing toilets, and a collapsed ceiling \u2014 that were present in months when no flooding occurred. She explains that three times her monthly rent of $313, assessed for ten violations, would yield a figure of approximately $10,000.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such an award, however, would be inconsistent with the judge\u2019s instructions that all of Solomon\u2019s claims were based on the flooding, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>and we assume, of course, that the jury complied with those instructions. See <em>Stricker </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>283 Mass. 12, 14-15 (1933). Further, such an award would be inconsistent with the purpose we attributed to \u00a7 14\u2019s triple rent clause in <em>Darmetko, supra. </em>We held in <em>Darmetko </em>that a tenant could not recover three months\u2019 rent for each month during which the landlord permitted a violation to continue. We explained that the triple rent clause of \u00a7 14 is an incentive to tenants whose actual damages are slight, not intended for repeated use in calculating damages for a continuing wrong. <em>Darmetko, supra </em>at 762. The same reasoning applies to discrete violations asserted in a single action. When three months\u2019 rent has been assessed for one violation, the incentive function of the triple rent provision is fulfilled. Therefore, we hold that a tenant proceeding under \u00a7 14 may collect only one such award, covering all claims that the tenant has raised or reasonably could have raised in the suit. Further, if actual damages arising from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>single claim or from all claims combined exceed three months\u2019 rent, the triple rent measure has no function, and the tenant\u2019s remedy is limited to actual damages. See <em>Darmetko, id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The limitation does not, Solomon suggests, immunize a once recalcitrant landlord from liability for future violations. If new violations arise after the initial suit is filed, the tenant may recover triple rent in a new proceeding. Further, if the landlord persists in or repeats the original violation after a final judgment in the tenant\u2019s favor, the tenant may repeat his suit and recover a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In sum, taking into account the relationships among the three counts of Solomon\u2019s claim, and the instructions that accompanied their submission to the jury, we find no acceptable basis for the verdict awarding $10,000 to Solomon for interference with quiet enjoyment. The jury could only have reached this verdict by duplicating items of damage subsumed in Solomon\u2019s recoveries for breach of warranty and emotional injury, or by making unwarranted use of the triple rent clause of \u00a7 14. Accordingly, we vacate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">When the improper $10,000 verdict is removed, no overlap remains in Solomon\u2019s damages. The verdict for breach of warranty reflects only lost rental, value, while the verdict for infliction of emotional distress represents only damages for personal injury. Therefore, we affirm the $35,000 and $1,000 verdicts in Solomon\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">6. <em>Attorneys\u2019 fees. </em>After trial, the judge assessed attorneys\u2019 fees of slightly more than $40,000 for Solomon, based-on the fee provision of G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 14. Gem\u2019s primary objection to this award is that the judge improperly considered legal services related to Solomon\u2019s claim for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">A statutory fee award should not cover effort expended on independent claims that happen to be joined with statutory claims in a single proceeding. See <em>Hanner </em>v. <em>Classic Auto Body, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 121, 124 (1980). As we emphasized in our discussion of damages, however, the partition of Solomon\u2019s claims was a matter of form only, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>should not affect the rights of the parties. The three verdicts, although rendered separately, represent various elements of damage arising from a single chain of events \u2014 the flooding in Solomon\u2019s apartment. We believe, for reasons stated below, that all the items of damage that the jury might have included in its verdicts \u2014 including emotional injury \u2014 are recoverable under \u00a7 14. Therefore, we reject Gem\u2019s argument that the judge should have limited attorneys\u2019 fees to the value of services devoted to the count labeled \u201cquiet enjoyment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Section 14 provides that tenants may recover \u201cactual and consequential\u201d damages from landlords who have interfered with their quiet enjoyment of leased premises. We have noted that this provision was intended to expand the damages recoverable for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. </em>Auth., 378 Mass. 758, 761 n.4 (1979).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The meanings of \u201cactual damages\u201d and \u201cconsequential damages\u201d may vary with context. Compare H.L. Oleck, Damages to Persons and Property \u00a7 12 (rev. ed. 1961), with <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Foster &amp; Marshall, Inc., </em>556 F.2d 460, 464 (9th Cir. 1977). Compare G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-715 (2), with <em>Boylston Hous. Corp. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>321 Mass. 538, 563 (1947), and <em>Smethurst </em>v. <em>Independent Congregational Church, </em>148 Mass. 261, 265 (1889). Generally, \u201cactual damages\u201d are losses flowing directly from a wrongful act. See H.L. Oleck, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 12. \u201cConsequential damages\u201d cover all losses that are reasonably foreseeable to the actor, even if they do not result inevitably from the act complained of. See <em>John Hetherington &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>William Firth Co., </em>210 Mass. 8, 21 (1911); <em>Smethurst, supra </em>at 265; H.L. Oleck, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 17. For example, consequential damages in an action based on contract or warranty may include personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>injuries caused by the breach. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-715. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>363 Mass. 579, 583-589 (1973). The combination in \u00a7 14 of both actual and consequential damages, therefore, suggests that the Legislature intended to include all reasonably foreseeable losses \u2014 personal as well as economic \u2014 within the scope of statutory recovery. In the present case, not only were Solomon\u2019s injuries foreseeable, but the jury found specifically that Gem knew or should have known that if it permitted floods to occur, Solomon would suffer emotional harm. Therefore, Solomon\u2019s claim for emotional distress was within the scope of \u00a7 14, and was properly considered in the determination of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We also reject Gem\u2019s contention that the fee award was excessive and unreasonable. The judge made detailed findings as to the fee award, following the guidelines we set out in <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 388-389 (1979), and <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Silverbranch Constr. Corp., </em>376 Mass. 621, 629 (1978). He excluded duplicative and unnecessary work, and work spent on Solomon\u2019s negligence claim, on which he had directed a verdict for Gem. Judges have broad discretion in awarding fees, and we see no reason to disturb the judge\u2019s determination in this case. <em>Linthicum, supra </em>at 388. <em>Heller, supra </em>at 629-631.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In sum, we affirm the judgments for Solomon for reckless infliction of emotional distress, breach of the warranty of habitability, and attorneys\u2019 fees. We also affirm the judgment for Gem on Solomon\u2019s claim of negligence and strict liability. Finally, we vacate the $10,000 judgment for Solomon for interference with quiet enjoyment, and direct that judgment should be entered for Gem on that aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-14\"> The company was controlled by Maurice Simon, since deceased, who was the original plaintiff in this action.

In other words, it\u2019s simply being admitted to show the information that he had when he formed his opinion. I\u2019m not allowing it to be introduced to show the truth of those facts. The jury will have to make its decision with regard to what facts in the case are true.\u201d In his final instructions to the jury, the judge again emphasized that \u201c [t]he jury is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b120-6\"> Gem also objects that the witness should not have referred to flooding and other conditions in Solomon\u2019s apartment except in response to hypothetical questions referring to specific evidence admitted in court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 72-74 (1919). Gem\u2019s counsel, however, did not raise an objection to form at the time the witness was asked for his opinion on the cause of Solomon\u2019s injuries and for the basis of his opinion. Therefore, Gem cannot pursue the issue now. See <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Holyoke Mach. Co., </em>233 Mass. 573, 575 (1919); P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence, 74-75 (5th ed. 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> The judge instructed the jury that the evidence was \u201cnot being admitted for the truth of what is on those two telephone records but simply to establish that Gem Realty had notice of the complaints, and it\u2019s being of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>fered ... for whatever value it has to discredit the testimony of Mr. Patterson who testified concerning his recollection of complaints received.\u201d The slips were recorded after this suit commenced, and therefore were not admissible for their truth under the \u201cbusiness records\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> Solomon testified to other conditions, unrelated to the flooding, that might have supported a warranty claim or a quiet enjoyment claim. It is clear, however, that each of Solomon\u2019s counts was based primarily on the flooding; the other possible violations played no part in her closing argument, and the trial judge stated in his instructions that all three claims arose from Solomon\u2019s allegations of floods. In any event, as the following discussion will show, we have taken into account the evidence of secondary violations in our analysis of the damages Solomon received.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\"> Solomon\u2019s counterclaim also alleged that the floods had caused property damage \u2014 an item not covered by her recoveries for breach of warranty and infliction of emotional injury. The amount claimed, however, was far less than $10,000, and so it could not have been the basis of the verdict for interference with quiet enjoyment. As a result of our disposition of the case, Solomon\u2019s property damage may go uncompensated. Nevertheless, we do not feel that a remand for calculation of this damage is warranted; Solomon, like Gem, failed to point out the problems in the judge\u2019s instructions, and must now bear the consequences of the confusion in the damage awards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b124-5\"> Solomon\u2019s rent was paid in part by the Federal government, through a rent subsidy program. Gem asserts that the relevant figure for calculating three months\u2019 rent is not the contract rent of $313, but the amount that Solomon paid personally: $73. We disagree. The triple rent clause is not a compensatory provision; it is an alternative to actual damages, designed to deter violations and to encourage tenants to seek relief under \u00a7 14. See <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>378 Mass. 758, 762 (1979). A rule making triple rent damages dependent on the source of rental payments would unnecessarily increase discrepancies in the amounts recovered by different tenants. Low income tenants receiving rent subsidies, who are often the victims of the most flagrant violations, would recover the least damages, and so would have little incentive to sue and to force repairs. Triple rent, therefore, should be three times the contract rent, without regard to contributions from external sources.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\"> In the past, the usual measure of damages was loss of rental value, see <em>Darmetko </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., supra; Charles E. Burt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seven Grand Corp., </em>340 Mass. 124, 130 (1959), although tenants complaining of interference with quiet <em>enjoyment </em>were sometimes permitted to recover additional elements of damages resembling tort recovery.
