App. Ct. 282 (1981). The primary issue raised is whether the doctrine of double jeopardy applies to proceedings brought to adjudicate paternity under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12. Three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>other appeals involving the construction of G. L. c. 273, \u00a7\u00a7 12 &amp; 15, are also before us. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lobo, ante </em>436 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, post </em>461 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gruttner, post </em>474 (1982). We hold in this case that the doctrine of double jeopardy does not apply to actions brought under \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The facts are these. On July 21, 1978, the First Bristol Division of the District Court Department issued a criminal complaint (no. 12980) charging the defendant with begetting an illegitimate child on or about August 10, 1977. G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12. The child was born on May 9, 1978. After a trial in the District Court on February 5, 1979, the judge ruled that the defendant was the father of the child. Despite having done so, he dismissed the complaint with prejudice because he was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of begetting occurred in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Another complaint (no. 1252) was filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>with the District Court later that day, charging the defendant with failure to support the child. G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant filed a motion to dismiss this complaint on the ground of double jeopardy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 14,1979, this motion was granted prior to any trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Several months later, on August 27, 1979, an employee of the Department of Public Welfare applied for another complaint (no. 4146) under \u00a7 15. The complaint was issued, and the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, based again on the ground of double jeopardy, was denied. He was found guilty of nonsupport after a bench trial on December 14, 1979, and was placed on probation for six years. The defendant appealed the conviction for a trial de nova in the jury of six session of the District Court, and again moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground of double jeopardy. This motion was allowed on March 6, 1980, and the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The Commonwealth appealed. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E. Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (1), 378 Mass. 882 (1979). The Appeals Court reversed the order dismissing complaint no. 4146. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 282 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The Appeals Court recognized that proceedings under \u00a7 12 have as their primary purpose the adjudication of paternity of an illegitimate child, in order to secure payment of pregnancy expenses and support payments for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>child. Such actions are \u201cremedial,\u201d and are to be distinguished from those which also have a punitive purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 283. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lobo, supra; Sullivan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>383 Mass. 410, 412 (1981).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lobo, supra, </em>we hold today that an action under \u00a7 12 is a civil action, remedial in purpose, even though the proceedings are to be conducted in compliance with the standards for criminal procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 447-448. The double jeopardy clause is not applicable to the type of proceeding carried out under \u00a7 12, since the object of the proceeding is not punitive. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra. </em>See <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 398-400 (1938); <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>194 Mass. 291, 292 (1907). As the defendant was not placed in jeopardy of punishment in the first trial, under \u00a7 12 (no. 12980), we conclude that the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution did not bar a trial on a complaint under \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The Appeals Court reached this same conclusion, but on reasoning we cannot support, namely that G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 15, is also \u201cessentially remedial and not punitive in nature and that the double jeopardy clause is not applicable to cases tried under it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. at 284. We have discussed \u00a7 15 at length in another companion case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, supra. </em>For the purposes of this discussion, it is sufficient to note our holding in <em>Chase </em>that \u00a7 15 is a criminal statute. <em>Id. </em>at 463-464. Under circumstances different from those present in this case, the double jeopardy clause would be fully applicable to cases tried under it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The defendant argues before us as he did before the Appeals Court that the dismissal, with prejudice, of the begetting complaint (no. 12980) was tantamount to an \u201cacquittal\u201d and precluded further litigation of the issue of paternity under \u00a7 15. This claim must fail. The defendant was not \u201cacquitted\u201d of the charge in the begetting action so as to preclude the trial on any of the issues in the second nonsupport action (no. 4146). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mondano, </em>352 Mass. 260, 262 (1967); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Micheli, </em>258 Mass. 89, 91 (1927).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Finally, the defendant argues that the dismissal, prior to trial, of the first nonsupport complaint under \u00a7 15 (no. 1252) provides him with both double jeopardy and collateral estoppel protections from further prosecution under \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As we have noted earlier, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss as to this complaint, based on a plea of former jeopardy, was granted before jeopardy had attached.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A claim of criminal collateral estoppel based on the double jeopardy clause fails as well, since the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>was not placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scala, </em>380 Mass. 500, 504 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Similarly, a collateral estoppel claim based on the due process clause, independent of the protections of the double jeopardy clause, is not established. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scala, supra, </em>we stated that the doctrine has been held to apply \u201cwhen \u2018an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and <em>final </em>judgment\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 506, quoting from <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 443 (1970). We also noted, in <em>Scala, </em>that dictum in another case limited the conclusion \u201cthat a decision is final for this purpose [to situations where] \u2018. . . the parties were fully heard, . . . the court supported its decision with a reasoned opinion, [and] . . . the decision was subject to appeal or was in fact reviewed on appeal.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting from <em>United States ex rel. DiGiangiemo </em>v. <em>Regan, </em>528 F.2d 1262, 1265 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied sub nom. <em>DiGiangiemo </em>v. <em>Olgiatti, </em>426 U.S. 950 (1976). None of these factors is present here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The order of the District Court dismissing complaint no. 4146 is reversed. This case is to be remanded for trial de nova in the jury of six session of the District Court in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\"> This was an error of law, later acknowledged by the judge, since the place of begetting is immaterial in a proceeding to adjudicate paternity. Under former G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 11 (repealed by St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 7), the crime of begetting an illegitimate child, which was a misdemeanor, was punishable only if \u201ccommitted\u201d in Massachusetts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lanoue, </em>326 Mass. 559, 563 (1950). No such requirement applies to proceedings to adjudicate the paternity of an illegitimate child under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12, which was in effect at the time of trial. General Laws c. 273, \u00a7 12, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 848, \u00a7 5, provided: \u201cProceedings to determine the father of a child born to an unmarried woman shall be begun, if in the superior court, in the county in which is situated the place where the alleged father or the mother of the illegitimate child lives, and if begun in a district court, in the court having such place within the judicial district. If the alleged father pleads guilty or nolo contendere, or is found guilty, the court shall enter a judgment adjudging him the father of the child; but such adjudication shall not be made after a plea of not guilty, against the objection of the alleged father, until the child is born or the court finds that the mother is at least six months pregnant. At the sitting when such adjudication is made by a district court, if made after a plea of not guilty, the alleged father may appeal therefrom to the superior court as in other criminal cases. The adjudication, whether any sentence be imposed or not, shall be final and conclusive unless an appeal therefrom be taken as hereinbefore provided, or, if such adjudication be made by the superior court, unless set aside upon an appeal taken not later than three days thereafter under section twenty-eight of chapter two hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>and seventy-eight or upon exceptions. Such adjudication may be entered by the superior court notwithstanding exceptions have been alleged or an appeal has been taken. The court making the adjudication may within one year thereafter grant a new trial for any cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">The amendments to \u00a7 12 by St. 1981, c. 92, and St. 1981, c. 325, are not material to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-10\"> General Laws c. 273, \u00a7 15, makes it a misdemeanor should any parent of an illegitimate child neglect to support the child whether the child was \u201cbegotten within or without the commonwealth. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b471-11\"> The defendant alleged that he had never been adjudicated the father of the child, since the earlier complaint had been dismissed with prejudice. Since a conviction under \u00a7 15 would also require an adjudication of paternity, the defendant claimed that he would be put in jeopardy a second time on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>383 Mass. 410 (1981), dealt with G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 11, the predecessor to G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\"> For example, had complaint no. 1252, also brought under \u00a7 15, been dismissed with prejudice after the judge began hearing evidence, thus triggering jeopardy, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>370 Mass. 31, 33 (1976), the defendant would have a viable double jeopardy claim as regards complaint no. 4146. See note 8, <em>infra. </em>Compare <em>Commonwealth v. Micheli, </em>258 Mass. 89, 91 (1927) (dismissing a complaint without a trial on the merits is no bar to trial for same offense charged in complaint dismissed).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Before dismissing the begetting complaint (no. 12980), the judge expressly ruled that the defendant was the father, but such an adjudication was not final and does not preclude the defendant from denying paternity in a trial for nonsupport. In an action under G. L. c. 273, \u00a7 15, a mechanism is provided whereby paternity may be adjudicated in the course of the proceedings, if no final determination has been made previously. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>324 Mass. 123, 124 (1949). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, post </em>461 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">At the time the motion was granted (May 14, 1979), G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, did not permit a prosecutorial appeal from an order allowing a pretrial motion to dismiss in the District Court. Only after July 1,1979, did the Commonwealth have this right. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E, as amended through St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 45. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (1), 378 Mass. 882 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> Had it been granted instead after the judge began hearing evidence, the defendant\u2019s position would be vastly different. Although the order dismissing the complaint was erroneous as a matter of law, \u201cwhere a mid-trial [as distinguished from a pretrial] dismissal is granted on the ground, correct or not, that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged, <em>[United States </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>420 U.S. 358 (1975)] establishes that further prosecution is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>Lee </em>v. <em>United States, </em>432 U.S. 23, 30 (1977). See <em>Costarelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 677, 682 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> Last, we agree with the Appeals Court that \u201c [tjhere was no demonstration of any abuse of discretion in the allowance of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to remedy a clerical error (the failure to docket the Commonwealth\u2019s notice of appeal at the time it was filed). Mass. R. Crim. P. 42, 378 Mass. [919] (1979). See <em>Schulz </em>v. <em>Black, </em>369 Mass. 958 (1975).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>12 Mass.
