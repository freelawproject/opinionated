(1976, Supp. 1 1977, &amp; Supp. II 1978) (ERISA), or the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 et seq. (1976 &amp; Supp. Ill 1979) (NLRA). In addition, the defendant insurance companies raise issues concerning severability, the effect of \u00a7 47B on policies issued before its effective date in 1976, and the applicability of the contract clause of the United States Constitution, art. 1, \u00a7 10. We conclude that the provisions of \u00a7 47B pertaining to insurance are not preempted, and that they are severable from a provision pertaining to employee benefit plans, which the parties have assumed to be preempted. We also conclude that \u00a7 47B applies to certain policies issued by the defendants before 1976, and that this application of the statute does not violate the contract clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The Attorney General brought this action for declaratory and injunctive relief to enforce \u00a7 47B against insurance companies that issue group insurance policies providing medical coverage to Massachusetts employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties stipulated that nearly all of the defendants\u2019 group policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>covering Massachusetts employees insure welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA. In addition, a number of the policies insure plans mandated by collective bargaining agreements negotiated pursuant to the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">A Superior Court judge issued a preliminary order requiring the defendants to provide the mental health coverage described in \u00a7 47B. After trial, a second judge granted a permanent order to the same effect. We granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">1. <em>Severability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Although \u00a7 47B applies by its terms to \u201cemployees\u2019 health and welfare fund[s],\u201d as well as to policies of insurance, the Attorney General has not enforced it against uninsured plans subject to ERISA. The present case involves only insurers, and all parties have assumed that direct enforcement against plans is preempted by ERISA. A threshold question, therefore, is whether the provisions of \u00a7 47B requiring the inclusion of mental health care benefits in policies of insurance are severable from the provision pertaining directly to benefit plans. We believe that they are. The insurance requirements \u201chave independent force, thus justifying the inference that the enacting body would have passed one without the other.\u201d <em>DelDuca </em>v. <em>Town Adm\u2019r of Methuen, </em>368 Mass. 1, 13 (1975). The judge\u2019s findings indicate that many plans purchase insurance, and that \u00a7 47B as currently enforced (against insurers only) has brought about significant improvements in mental health care in Massachusetts. The judge also found that there was no credible evidence that partial enforcement of \u00a7 47B had caused plans to shift to self-insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">In light of our conclusion that the insurance provisions of \u00a7 47B are independently enforceable, the following discussion of preemption will be limited to the statute\u2019s application to policies of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">2. <em>Preemption </em>\u2014 <em>General Principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">By the operation of the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, art. 6, Federal law preempts conflicting State law. <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>210-211 (1824). The conflict may be direct, in the sense that State regulation contradicts Federal regulation, see <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>State, </em>228 U.S. 115, 132-134 (1913), or interferes with Federal policy, see <em>Burbank </em>v. <em>Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624, 639 (1973), or it may arise from congressional intent, express or implied, to exclude all State regulation from a particular area. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>383 Mass. 485, 489 (1981); <em>Alessi </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504, 522-525 (1981); <em>Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Co., </em>450 U.S. 311, 324-326 (1981). See generally L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 376-389 (1978). Preemption, however, is not favored, and State laws should be upheld unless a conflict with Federal law is clear. A finding of preemption must rest upon \u201cpersuasive reasons \u2014 either that the nature of the regulated subject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably so ordained.\u201d <em>Alessi </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., supra </em>at 522, quoting from <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142, amended in other respects, 373 U.S. 929 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">3. <em>Does ERISA Preempt </em>\u00a7 47B?</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Congress enacted ERISA in 1974 to protect the interests of beneficiaries of employee benefit plans. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (1976). <em>Alessi </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504, 510 (1981). <em>Nachman Corp. </em>v. <em>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., </em>446 U.S. 359, 374-375 (1980). Prior Federal law<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had preserved primary responsibility for regulation of benefit plans to the States. See <em>Malone </em>v. <em>White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 505-512 (1978). See generally Hutchinson &amp; Ifshin, Federal Preemption of State Law under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 46 U. Chi. L. Rev. 23, 25-30 (1978). In its place, ERISA outlined a detailed system for Federal regulation of benefit plan administration. <em>Alessi </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., supra </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ERISA applies to two types of benefit plan \u2014 \u201cpension plans,\u201d which provide retirement benefits or deferred income;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201cwelfare plans,\u201d which provide nonpension benefits including medical and hospital expenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>562 F.2d 70, 74 (1st Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 980 (1978). ERISA\u2019s regulatory provisions establish disclosure requirements and fiduciary standards applicable to both pension and welfare plans,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as funding and vesting requirements applicable only to pension plans.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Other sections of the act provide for enforcement and administration, and for national insurance against termination of pension plans. See generally Hutchinson &amp; Ifshin, <em>supra </em>at 30-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">ERISA also contains express provisions defining its preemptive effect on State law. Three provisions are relevant here. First, the act\u2019s general preemption clause states in sweeping terms that ERISA supersedes all State laws that \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This general clause, however, is followed by a savings clause that exempts any State law that \u201cregulates insurance\u201d from the preemptive effect of the act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The savings clause is limited in turn by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>third clause which provides that a State may not \u201cdeem\u201d that a benefit plan is an insurer subject to its insurance laws.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The Attorney General argues that \u00a7 47B is a law that \u201cregulates insurance,\u201d and is therefore exempted from preemption by ERISA\u2019s savings clause. The defendants argue that, because the purpose and effect of \u00a7 47B are to regulate benefits, it should not be saved from preemption as an insurance law.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Persuasive authority supports the Attorney General\u2019s position. Both the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and the Supreme Court of New Hampshire have rejected preemption challenges to a New Hampshire law nearly identical to \u00a7 47B.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>562 F.2d 70 (1st Cir. 1977). <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>119 N.H. 894 (1979). The defendants suggest that these decisions are not soundly reasoned, and have been undermined by a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court, <em>Alessi </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504 (1981). We disagree. In light of the <em>Alessi </em>decision, however, we will set forth our reasoning in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">We first address the language of ERISA\u2019s preemption and savings provisions, to determine whether Congress has \u201cunmistakably . . . ordained\u201d preemption of \u00a7 47B. <em>Id. </em>at 522, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>quoting <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142, amended in other respects, 373 U.S. 929 (1963). In <em>Alessi, </em>the Supreme Court adopted a broad construction of ERISA\u2019s general preemption clause, holding that the clause applied to a New Jersey workers\u2019 compensation law that prohibited set-offs of workmen\u2019s compensation payments against pension benefits. The Court reasoned that the New Jersey statute was a law \u201crelating] to\u201d pension plans because it foreclosed a method of calculating pension benefits. 451 U.S. at 524-525. The Court added that \u201c[i]t is of no moment that New Jersey intrudes indirectly, through a workers\u2019 compensation law rather than directly, through a statute called\u2018pension regulation.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525. See also 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (c) (2) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Alessi </em>suggests that \u00a7 47B is a law that \u201crelate [s] to\u201d benefit plans, within ERISA\u2019s general preemption clause. Because a plan that-purchases insurance has no choice but to provide mental health care benefits, the insurance provisions of \u00a7 47B effectively control the content of insured welfare benefit plans. Although grounds of distinction may exist between <em>Alessi </em>and the present case,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Attorney General has not pressed them, and we treat \u00a7 47B as a law that \u201crelate[s] to\u201d employee benefit plans. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>383 Mass. 488 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">This brings us to the savings clause, which exempts \u201cany law of any state which regulates insurance.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144 (b)(2)(A) (1976). The defendants insist that \u00a7 47B is not an insurance law, becuase it is designed to promote public health,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> rather than to regulate \u201ctraditional\u201d sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>jects of State insurance. The language of the savings clause, however, is not limited to \u201ctraditional\u201d insurance laws, even if such a category could be defined. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federico, </em>383 Mass. 485 (1981) (savings clause for \u201cgenerally applicable\u201d criminal laws). The only express limit on the savings clause is the third clause, sometimes called the \u201cdeemer\u201d clause, which prevents States from deeming plans to be insurers. See <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>562 F.2d 70, 77-79 (1st Cir. 1977); <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>119 N.H. 894, 902 (1979). On the other hand, we cannot agree with the Attorney General\u2019s contention that our analysis should end with the deemer clause. In the Attorney General\u2019s view, if \u00a7 47B applies to insurance, and does not treat plans as insurers, it is not preempted. See <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Whaland, supra </em>at 77-78; <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whaland, supra </em>at 902. We are wary of such a literal reading, which might permit the State, through its insurance laws, to reach far into areas governed by ERISA, and thereby negate the unmistakable intent of Congress to work a broad preemption. The deemer clause is one indication of the intended breadth of the savings clause, but we do not accept it as determinative. We conclude only that the language of the savings clause is broad enough to permit a construction that would exempt \u00a7 47B from preemption. Beyond this, the term \u201cinsurance law,\u201d and the wording of the deemer clause are of little help.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We prefer to resolve the tension between the general preemption clause and the savings clause by reference to the policies and operation of ERISA, and the general principle that preemption should not be implied unless there is a clear conflict between State and Federal law. <em>Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Co., </em>450 U.S. 311, 317-318 (1981). <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Rath Packing Co., </em>430 U.S. 519, 525-526 (1977). Congress, when it enacted ERISA, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>concerned with widespread abuses in plan administration, often resulting in employees\u2019 losses of anticipated benefits. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (a) (1976). <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Whaland, supra </em>at 73-74. See <em>Alessi </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504, 510 (1981). In response, Congress enacted rules governing disclosure and fiduciary conduct by administrators of welfare benefit plans.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 (b), 1021-1031, 1101-1114 (1976). Section 47B has no bearing on the problem of administrative abuse, and does not overlap or interfere with the means chosen by Congress to deal with such abuse. Section 47B affects only the substantive content of plans \u2014 a subject completely untouched by ERISA\u2019s regulatory provisions. See <em>Gast </em>v. <em>State, </em>36 Or. App. 441, 452-458 (1978). Therefore, nothing in the practical relationship between the two statutes calls for an implied limitation on the phrase \u201cregulates insurance\u201d that would exclude \u00a7 47B from the protection of the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The defendants discern an additional \u201cpolicy\u201d in ERISA\u2019s preemption provisions. They suggest that Congress intended to designate an area of private self-determination with respect to choice of benefits, and to protect it from all State regulation. But the defendants have not identified persuasive evidence in the legislative history of an affirmative policy to curtail State police power in favor of private decision-making. See <em>Gast </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>at 457-458. To the contrary, comments during floor debates indicate that broad preemption language was favored in order to provide a clear line of demarcation and to deter States from enacting inconsistent laws on the periphery of ERISA\u2019s subject matter.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Nor does the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Alessi, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>support the defendants\u2019 view that Congress intended to establish strict protection of self-determination in an area outside the scope of ERISA\u2019s regulatory provisions. In fact, the Court emphasized in its discussion of preemption that the New Jersey law at issue affected a subject covered by ERISA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The defendants also contend that ERISA established a policy in favor of uniformity with respect to benefit plans, which would be undermined if States were permitted to impose varying requirements on the substantive content of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>plans. The defendants point out that businesses that employ workers in a number of different States would be unable to adopt standardized plans covering all of their employees. We are not persuaded by this argument. Congress undoubtedly contemplated a system of uniform, national regulation in the areas governed by ERISA. On the other hand, it specifically approved State regulation in the fields of insurance, banking and securities, and so could not have intended to mandate complete uniformity for the convenience of multi-State employers. Moreover, the judge below stated in his findings that the defendants had presented \u201cno credible evidence that [diverse State mandatory benefit laws] would be any more complex or burdensome to interstate commerce than various other . . . multi-state regulatory schemes such as workmen\u2019s compensation laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In sum, there is no conflict between \u00a7 47B and the policies or operation of ERISA that calls for a narrow interpretation of the phrase \u201cregulates insurance\u201d in the savings clause of ERISA\u2019s preemption provisions. Therefore, we conclude that ERISA does not preempt \u00a7 47R.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">4. <em>Does the NLRA Preempt </em>\u00a7 <em>47BP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Congress enacted the NLRA in 1935 to combat industrial strife by encouraging collective bargaining on terms and conditions of employment. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (1976). The act protects employees\u2019 rights to organize and to engage in concerted activity, and defines unfair labor practices by employers and unions. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157-160 (1976). Certain of the insurance policies issued by the defendants insure plans agreed to through collective bargaining,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the defendants contend that the NLRA preempts application of \u00a7 47R to these policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The issue of preemption takes a different form under the NLRA from that under ERISA. The NLRA does not pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>vide expressly for preemption of State law, as does ERISA. Thus, the NLRA\u2019s preemptive effect must be discerned entirely by implication from the policies of the act. On the other hand, Congress clearly did intend, in enacting the NLRA, to mark off an area for autonomous private ordering by labor and management, free from most forms of regulation by either the National Labor Relations Board or the States. <em>Lodge 76, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>427 U.S. 132, 140 (1976) (hereinafter <em>Machinists). Local 24, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>358 U.S. 283, 295-296 (1959) (hereinafter <em>Oliver). NLRB </em>v. <em>American Nat'l Ins. Co., </em>343 U.S. 395, 404 (1952). Apart from the limits set by Congress, both the economic tactics used during negotiations and the substantive terms of the resulting agreement are \u201cleft \u2018to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.\u2019\u201d <em>Machinists, supra </em>at 140, quoting from <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Nash-Finch Co., </em>404 U.S. 138, 144 (1971). Therefore, when labor and management agree upon subjects of mandatory bargaining, the terms of their agreement \u201cthemselves become expressions of federal law, requiring preemption of intrusive state law.\u201d <em>Alessi </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504, 526 (1981).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Despite the breadth of its statements concerning the preemptive effect of collective bargaining agreements, the Supreme Court has recognized that Congress could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>intended to preempt \u201call local regulation that touches or concerns in any way the complex interrelationships between employees, employers and unions; obviously, much of this is left to the States.\u201d <em>Malone </em>v. <em>White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497, 504 (1978), quoting from <em>Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of St., Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees </em>v. <em>Lockridge, </em>403 U.S. 274, 289 (1971). See <em>Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Boston, </em>384 Mass. 446, 472-473 (1981), cert. granted sub nom. <em>White </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 919 (1982). Accordingly, the Court has acknowledged a number of exceptions to NLRA preemption, each based upon the probability that Congress did not intend to displace a particular type of State regulation. Preemption will not be implied when Congress has indicated in other Federal legislation that State law should govern a certain area,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or when \u201cthe activity regulated [is] a merely peripheral concern of the [NLRA].\u201d <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 243 (1959).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Court has also upheld State laws when \u201cthe regulated conduct touched interests . . . deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility,\u201d <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>244,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and has suggested an exception for \u201clocal health or safety regulation[s],\u201d <em>Oliver, supra </em>at 297.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Section 47B affects health benefits, a subject of mandatory collective bargaining. See <em>Allied Chem. &amp; Alkali Workers Local No. 1 </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., Chem. Div., </em>404 U.S. 157, 159 (1971). It does not, however, regulate labor-management relations as such; its purpose is to protect public health,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and its method is regulation of insurers and insurance policies. Ordinarily, preemption depends upon the <em>effect </em>of State law upon NLRA policy, and the fact that a State law is enacted for neutral purposes and applies outside the employment relationship cannot save it from preemption. <em>San Deigo Bldg. Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 244 (1959). <em>Oliver, supra </em>at 297. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>See <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>349 Mass. 390, 400 (1965). See also <em>New York Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>New York State Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>440 U.S. 519, 550-551 (1979) (Blackmun, J., concurring, joined by Marshall, J.), 557-558 (Powell, J., dissenting, joined by Burger, C.J., and Stewart, J.). Nevertheless, the various exceptions described above suggest that the character and purpose of the State law may bear upon congressional intent to subordinate it to the NLRA\u2019s policy of free collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">At least two of the exceptions recognized by the Court are relevant to the validity of \u00a7 47B. The first of these is the exception for public health laws, suggested by the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Oliver </em>that, \u201cWe have not here a case of a collective bargaining agreement in conflict with a local health or safety regulation; the conflict here is between the federally sanctioned agreement and state policy which seeks specifically to adjust relationships in the world of commerce.\u201d 358 U.S. at 297. (See note 23, <em>supra.) </em>Section 47B appears to us to be the type of permissible health regulation envisioned by the Oliver court. Section 47B is designed to solve a serious health problem, rather than to alter the bargaining positions of unions and employers. It is unlikely that Congress intended, by enacting the NLRA, to bind the hands of State Legislatures with respect to problems such as mental health. And because \u00a7 47B is addressed to a Statewide health problem not peculiar to employment relationships, its exemption will not open a door to State interference with the \u201cfree play of economic forces\u201d between labor and management. See Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337, 1352 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">A second indication that Congress did not intend the NLRA to preempt laws such as \u00a7 47B can be found in another Federal statute, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1011-1015 (1976). <em>Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>562 F.2d 70, 79 n.44 (1st Cir. 1977). <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Whaland, </em>119 N.H. 894, 905-906 (1979). See <em>Malone </em>v. <em>White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497 (1978). See also note 20, <em>supra. </em>The McCarran-Ferguson Act establishes a congres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sional policy in favor of State regulation of insurance, and provides that \u201cNo Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1012 (b) (1976). Although the purposes and effect of \u00a7 47B extend beyond regulation of insurance as such, the statute operates upon insurance and insurance policies. The McCarran-Ferguson Act does not contain a limiting definition of the term \u201cbusiness of insurance,\u201d see <em>SEC </em>v. <em>National Sec., Inc., </em>393 U.S. 453, 460 (1969), and we do not believe that conflict between \u00a7 47B and the NLRA is serious enough to call for a narrow reading that would exclude \u00a7 47B from the act\u2019s protection.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Finally, \u00a7 47B is not an absolute limit on the parties\u2019 freedom to negotiate the terms of employee health plans. The provisions of \u00a7 47B now before us apply to insurers. They do not mandate the inclusion of mental health benefits in employee plans unless the parties decide to purchase insurance. In view of the need to accommodate the \u201cseparate spheres of governmental authority preserved in our federalist system,\u201d <em>Alessi </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504, 522 (1981), we hesitate to extend the implied preemptive reach of the NLRA to such a law.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In sum, \u00a7 47B imposes some limits on the freedom of labor and management to bargain for health benefit terms, but does so only as an incident of the parties\u2019 decision to purchase insurance. At least two of the factors that the Supreme Court has identified as indicia of congressional intent to tolerate particular State legislation despite its effect on collective bargaining pertain to \u00a7 47B. Applying the principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>that an \u201cexercise of federal supremacy is not lightly to be presumed,\u201d <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>344 U.S. 199, 203 (1952), we conclude that the NLRA does not preempt \u00a747B.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">5. <em>Application of </em>\u00a7 <em>47B to Policies Issued Before 1976.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The defendants\u2019 final contention is that \u00a7 47B does not and cannot apply to certain policies issued before its effective date (January 1, 1976), under which termination or renewal is at the option of the policyholder. These policies either do not permit the defendants to refuse to continue coverage, or permit refusal in limited circumstances only. All of the policies, however, authorize the defendants to raise premium rates. The judge found that since January, 1976, the defendants have raised premium rates for almost all policies, and that in many instances the parties have altered benefit coverage as well. The judge ordered the defendants to provide the benefits required by \u00a7 47B under policies that were \u201cissued prior to January 1, 1976, but. . . have been <em>altered or renewed through any change in premium or benefits\u201d </em>(emphasis added). We interpret this order to require the defendants to provide benefits from the date of alteration under policies altered since January 1, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Section 47B applies by its terms to policies \u201cissued or subsequently <em>renewed by agreement between the insurer and the policyholder\u201d </em>after its effective date (emphasis added). We agree with the judge that \u201crenew[al] by agreement\u201d includes changes in benefits or premiums. A change in benefit coverage is in effect an agreement to a new policy, whatever the label applied by the parties. An insurer\u2019s decision to raise premiums presents a closer question; the insurer has not actually assented to continued coverage. Nevertheless, we believe that an insurer\u2019s adjustment of its compensation, coupled with the insured\u2019s acceptance of the new rates, amounts to renewal for purposes of \u00a7 47B. Section 47B is designed to enable as many Massachusetts residents as possible to receive mental health coverage. The provision limiting its application to policies newly issued or renewed is best read as a measure to ensure that insurance companies can adjust their rates to reflect the new risks imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>This application of \u00a7 47B does not conflict with the contract clause of the United States Constitution, art. 1, \u00a7 10. Although the Supreme Court has confirmed in recent decisions that the contract clause imposes substantial limits on the power of States to alter contractual obligations, it remains clear that the prohibition against impairment of contract is not absolute. See <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus, </em>438 U.S. 234 (1978); <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>431 U.S. 1 (1977). Private contract rights are subject to reasonable and necessary legislation in furtherance of important public interests, and legislative judgments concerning reasonableness and necessity are entitled to deference. <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus, supra </em>at 244. <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra </em>at 22-23. The Supreme Court has approached issues arising under the contract clause by assessing the relative weight of the impairment and the State\u2019s interest in enacting the impairing legislation. <em>See Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus, supra </em>at 244-250.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The impairment wrought by \u00a7 47B is minimal. The defendants must provide insurance against a risk they did not assume in the original policies. The risk imposed by \u00a7 47B, however, does not affect the defendants retroactively; benefits are due only from the date on which the policies were issued or amended, and in no case before the effective date of the statute. Contrast <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>374 Mass. 181 (1978) (mandatory premium rebates); <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus, supra </em>(increased pension liability). Moreover, the defendants\u2019 policies permit them to counteract the new risk by raising premium rates. Contrast <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus, supra </em>at 246-247. Thus, the defendants \u2014 participants in a heavily regulated industry \u2014<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> cannot complain of a serious interference with their reasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The State interest supporting \u00a7 47B \u2014 protection of the public health \u2014 is an important one, and the means selected to further it are reasonable. Section 47B applies generally to all insurers that issue policies to Massachusetts residents. Contrast <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Spannaus, supra </em>at 250. Its application to policies altered after January 1, 1976, is reasonable and necessary to accomplish its objective of ensuring broad mental health coverage. Exclusion of such policies would permit insurance companies to avoid much of the effect of future insurance laws at no cost, by entering contracts characterized as perpetual, while retaining the right to raise premium rates. Without determining the full extent to which the State\u2019s interest in a broad application of mandatory benefit laws would justify impairment of private contracts, we believe that it overrides the minimal private interests here at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We conclude that the application of \u00a7 47B at issue is severable from the application of \u00a7 47B that the parties have assumed to be invalid, and is not preempted by ERISA or the NLRA. With respect to policies issued since January 1, 1976, the judge correctly ordered the defendants to comply with \u00a7 47B from the date of issuance. With respect to policies issued before January 1, 1976, and altered or renewed through any change in premium or benefits after January 1, 1976, the judge correctly ordered the defendants to comply from the date of alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-10\"> General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 47B, inserted by St. 1973, c. 1174, \u00a7 2, provides that: \u201cAny blanket or general policy of insurance described in subdivision (A), (C), or (D) of section one hundred and ten which provides hospital expense and surgical expense insurance and which is issued or subsequently renewed by agreement between the insurer and the policyholder, within or without the commonwealth, during the period this provision is effective, or any policy of accident and sickness insurance as described in section one hundred and eight which provides hospital expense and surgical expense insurance and which is delivered or issued for delivery or subsequently renewed by agreement between the insurer and the policyholder in this commonwealth during the period that this provision is effective, or any employees\u2019 health and welfare fund which provides hospital expense and surgical expense benefits and which is promulgated or renewed to any person or group of persons in this commonwealth while this provision is effective shall provide benefits for expense of residents of the commonwealth covered under any such policy or plan, arising from mental or nervous conditions as described in the standard nomenclature of the American Psychiatric Association which are at least equal to the following minimum requirements:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">\u201c <em>(a) </em>In the case of benefits based upon confinement as an inpatient in a mental hospital under the direction and supervision of the department of mental health, or in a private mental hospital licensed by the department of mental health, the period of confinement for which benefits shall be payable shall be at least sixty days in any calendar year.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">\u201c <em>(b) </em>In the case of benefits based upon confinement as an inpatient in a licensed or accredited general hospital, such benefits shall be no different than for any other illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">\u201c (c) In the case of outpatient benefits, these shall cover, to the extent of five hundred dollars over a twelve-month period, services furnished (1) by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>a comprehensive health service organization, (2) by a licensed or accredited hospital (3) or subject to the approval of the department of mental health services furnished by a community mental health center or other mental health clinic or (4) consultations or diagnostic or treatment sessions, provided that such services under this clause are rendered by a psychotherapist or by a psychologist licensed under the provisions of chapter one hundred and twelve.

The parties stipulated that the defendants have included the required benefits in policies issued or renewed in Massachusetts after January 1, 1976, but the defendants reserved the right to challenge \u00a7 47B as applied to these policies. Thus the defendants are asserting the invalidity of the statute with respect to all policies of insurance, whether issued before or after January 1,1976, inside or outside the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act of 1958, Pub.

First, the Court has sometimes invalidated State action because it encroached upon the \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d of the National Labor Relations Board over matters covered by the act. See, e.g., <em>San Diego Bldg. Trades Council </em>v. <em>Garmon, </em>359 U.S. 236, 244-245 (1959) (State injunction of picketing as an unfair labor practice). A second line of decisions, including those discussed in the text above, is based on implied Congressional intent to reserve to private resolution certain matters not covered by the regulatory provisions of the act.

In this second group of decisions, the Court has determined that the NLRA protects both choice of economic tactics, see, e.g., <em>Machinists, supra, </em>and choice of substantive terms, see, e.g., <em>Oliver, supra, </em>from State regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In <em>Malone </em>v. <em>White Motor Corp., </em>435 U.S. 497 (1978), the Court held that the NLRA did not preempt a State law governing pension funding, on the ground that a Federal statute, the predecessor of ERISA, demonstrated congressional intent to permit State regulation of the field. In <em>New York Tel.

The defendants point to the committee\u2019s statement that \u201cthe organized worker had a higher rate of mental illness than the rich,\u201d and suggest that the committee was specifically concerned with labor relations. This statement, however (which was simply a description of the results of a Yale study), as well as other references to \u201cworkers,\u201d simply indicates the Legislature\u2019s recognition of the impact of mental illness on members of the working classes.
