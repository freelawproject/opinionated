L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. After hearing, the Housing Appeals Committee in the Department of Community Affairs (HAC) ordered the zoning board of appeals of the town of Wellesley (board) to grant a comprehensive permit for the construction of low or moderate income housing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See G.L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23. The board sought judicial review of HAC\u2019s determination that a comprehensive permit should issue. On cross motions for summary judgment (see Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 [a], [b], 365 Mass. 824 [1974]), a judge of the Superior Court declared that \u201cthe Legislature never intended that a proposed development be exclusively reserved for low and moderate income families to qualify as low and moderate income housing.\u201d He therefore determined that \u201cthis proposed development meets the requirements set forth in G. L. c. 40B, s. 20 and c. 708 of the Acts of 1966.\u201d He entered two judgments in favor of the defendants. We affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The facts are as follows. On July 11, 1977, pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, Cedar Street Associates (Cedar Street), a limited dividend organization, applied for a comprehensive permit to build forty-eight units of low or moderate income housing. After a public hearing, the board, on November 10, 1977, granted Cedar Street a comprehensive permit to build thirty-six units, on condition that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>least eighty per cent of the units be occupied by the elderly. In addition, the board required evidence, within twelve months, that Cedar Street had received the necessary financing. Later, the board granted Cedar Street\u2019s request for a four-month extension of this deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Cedar Street obtained a loan from MHFA. The loan was made subject to several conditions. The development would have to provide only ten rent subsidized units for the elderly. In addition, the developer would have to include eight rent-subsidized units for families, and eighteen units for rental at market rates. Notified of these conditions, the board required Cedar Street to file a new application for a comprehensive permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On June 29, 1979, Cedar Street filed a second application. The board denied this application. The board found that the area of the proposed site was not equipped to provide the facilities necessary for a high density population; that the project was detrimental to the health and safety of the anticipated occupants and their neighbors; and that the planning objections incidental to the development outweighed the need for low or moderate income housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22, Cedar Street appealed the board\u2019s decision to HAC. Cedar Street claimed that the board\u2019s decision was not reasonable and consistent with local needs, and asked HAC to direct the board to issue a comprehensive permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The board moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that HAC lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter. The board argued that the development includes eighteen units to be rented at fair market value, and therefore is not low or moderate income housing within the meaning of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. HAC denied the board\u2019s motion and ruled that since MHFA financed the project, the development is low or moderate income housing within the meaning of \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Reaching the merits, HAC held that the board\u2019s decision was not reasonable and consistent with local needs and directed the board to issue a comprehensive permit. HAC noted that basically the same planning objections had exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ed when the board granted Cedar Street\u2019s first application for a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">1. <em>Low or moderate income housing. </em>General Laws c. 40B, \u00a7 20, inserted by St. 1969, c. 774, \u00a7 1, defines low or moderate income housing as \u201chousing subsidized by the federal or state government under any program to assist the construction of low or moderate income housing as defined in the applicable federal or state statute.\u201d Thus, low or moderate income housing must be subsidized under a program whose purpose is to aid the construction of low or moderate income housing as defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">In <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339 (1973), we recognized that the details of G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, would have to be spelled out \u201cin the first instance, by an agency charged with administration of the statute.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover, supra </em>at 368 n.20, quoting <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 344 (1964). Subsequently, the Department of Community Affairs promulgated regulations under the statute. These regulations provide that \u201c[l]ow or moderate income housing shall include without limitation units of housing constructed under . . . MHFA Mortgage Loans . . . .\u201d 760 Code Mass. Regs. 30.02 (i) (2) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Although administrative regulations are not binding on this court, we give great weight to a \u201creasonable construction of a regulatory statute adopted by the agency charged with [its] enforcement.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>362 Mass. 417, 441 n.22 (1972), quoting <em>Investment Co. Inst. </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 626-627 (1971). See <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 515-516 (1975); <em>Amherst-Pelham Regional School Comm. </em>v. <em>Department of Educ., </em>376 Mass. 480, 491-492 (1978). \u201c[W]e must apply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action and not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate. <em>Colella </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n </em>[360 Mass. 152, 156-157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>(1971)]. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Westwood, </em>226 Mass. 268 (1917).\u201d <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The Legislature established MHFA to provide mortgages to projects which \u201chave promise of supplying well planned, well designed apartment units . . . for low income persons or families.\u201d St. 1966, c. 708, \u00a7 5 (a). The intention of the Act \u201cis to make available mortgage financing at favorable interest rates to housing projects in which [at least] one quarter of the tenants will be in the low income\u2019 category and the other tenants will be of moderate income. . . . The saving in interest is to be applied in part... to making possible lower rentals to low income\u2019 tenants, who may also receive the benefit of rent subsidies . . . .\u201d <em>Massachusetts Hous. Fin. Agency </em>v. <em>New England Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>356 Mass. 202, 209 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The legislative history of St. 1966, c. 708, supports the view that MHFA was created to promote the construction of low or moderate income housing projects which also include units rented at fair market value. The Final Report of the Special Commission on Low-Income Housing, 1965 House Doc. No. 4040, recommended the creation of MHFA. The commission specifically suggested that MHFA require developers to reserve only a portion of their units for low income families. \u201cBy doing this, low-income families will be allowed to live in decent apartments, without identification, in close proximity to families of differing economic and social levels.\u201d 1965 House Doc. No. 4040, at 39. Thus, MHFA is a program whose purpose is to aid the construction of low or moderate income housing, although such projects may include units rented at fair market rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Further, subsidy is \u201c[h]elp, aid, [or] assistance.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary (vol. 10, 1933). See Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary 2513 (2d ed. 1959). See also <em>Charlesbank Apartments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Rent Control Administration, </em>379 Mass. 635, 637 n.4 (1980). In <em>Charlesbank Apartments, Inc., supra, </em>we held that a Federal program that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>merely provided mortgage insurance was a subsidy under Boston\u2019s rent control ordinance. Similarly, we believe that a low interest mortgage from MHFA is a subsidy under G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. Housing financed by MHFA is subsidized under a State program whose purpose is to aid the construction of low or moderate income housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Consequently, we hold that the regulation promulgated by the Department of Community Affairs which includes MHFA financed projects within the definition of low or moderate income housing in G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20, is reasonable and consistent with the statute. Thus HAG correctly determined that the Cedar Street development was within its jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">2. <em>Substantial evidence. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23, a qualified builder<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> wishing to build low or moderate income housing may file with a local board of appeals an application for a comprehensive permit instead of filing separate applications with each local agency having jurisdiction over the project. Rodgers, Snob Zoning in Massachusetts, 1970 Ann. Survey Mass. Law 487, 489. In deciding whether to issue a comprehensive permit, the local board must determine whether the project is \u201cconsistent with local needs.\u201d <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 364 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">If the board denies an application for a comprehensive permit, the developer may appeal to HAG. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22. Subsequent to the appeal, HAG will conduct a de nova review, to determine whether the board\u2019s decision is \u201creasonable and consistent with local needs.\u201d G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover, supra </em>at 369. To make this determination, HAG must decide whether the need for low or moderate income housing outweighs the valid planning objections to the proposal such as health, site, design, and space. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7\u00a7 20-23. <em>See Board </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>of Appeals of Hanover, supra </em>at 363-368. If, after applying this standard, HAG finds that the decision of the board is not \u201creasonable and consistent with local needs,\u201d it may direct the board to issue a comprehensive permit. G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 23. <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover, supra </em>at 372-375. However, if a locality has met its minimum housing obligation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> HAG may not order the board to issue a permit. <em>Id. </em>at 367. See Comment, Exclusionary Zoning: A Legislative Approach, 22 Syracuse L. Rev. 583, 592-594 (1971). The board claims that HAC\u2019s decision ordering the issuance of a comprehensive permit in this case is unsupported by substantial evidence as that term is used in G. L. c. 30A. The scope of judicial review is determined by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The decision of HAG must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence is such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). \u201cThis does not permit a court to treat the proceeding as a trial de nova on the record which was before the administrative board. A court may not displace an administrative board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de nova. <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>340 U.S. 474, 488 [1951].\u201d <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 521 (1971). See <em>Southern Worcester County Regional Vocational School Dist. </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>377 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>897, 903 (1979); <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, 376 </em>Mass. 112, 120 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The board concedes that Wellesley has not met its minimum housing obligation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that there is an absolute need for more apartments that persons of low or moderate income can afford. Nevertheless, the board claims, contrary to the HAC decision, that its denial of the comprehensive permit was both reasonable and consistent with local needs. The board argues that because one half of the units in the development will be rented at market rates, the project\u2019s contribution to low and moderate income housing does not outweigh the planning objections incidental to the development. The board asserts that this project will result in a concentration of low or moderate income housing projects in one part of town. In addition, the board claims that the project will exacerbate traffic problems in the area being developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">There is ample evidence to support HAC\u2019s conclusion that the board\u2019s action was not reasonable and consistent with local needs. Although similar planning objections had been raised, the board granted Cedar Street\u2019s first application for a comprehensive permit to build thirty-six units of subsidized housing, on the condition that at least eighty percent of the units be occupied by the elderly. Since the project at issue in this case includes rent-subsidized units and units rented at fair market rates, it does not greatly promote the concentration of low or moderate income families in one area. Moreover, HAC inspected the site, as did MHFA. We conclude that HAC\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and therefore the judgments of the Superior Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Further, HAC applied the correct standard when it balanced the need for low or moderate income housing against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the planning board\u2019s objections to the proposal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although this development contains units rented at fair market rates, the entire project is low or moderate income housing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In reviewing a denial of a comprehensive permit to build low or moderate income housing, HAC must determine whether the board\u2019s decision was \u201cconsistent with local needs.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whenever HAC reviews the denial of a comprehensive permit, it must apply this statutory standard even if the project includes units rented at fair market rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\"> \u201cLow or moderate income housing\u201d is \u201cany housing subsidized by the federal or state government under any program to assist the construction of low or moderate income housing as defined in the applicable federal or state statute, whether built or operated by any public agency or any nonprofit or limited dividend organization.\u201d G.

L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. See <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>363 Mass. 339, 366 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\"> At the hearing before HAC, the chairman of the Wellesley planning board testified that Wellesley had approximately 397 units of low or moderate income housing. According to him, Wellesley needs 800 units to fulfil its minimum housing obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b673-6\"> The board articulated objections concerning increased sewerage, drainage and traffic problems. There was ample oral evidence to support HAC\u2019s determination that the project would cause no serious health hazards. In addition, as to traffic, HAC noted the \u201csilence of the Board\u2019s previous decision\u201d on traffic congestion and concluded that the board\u2019s objection on this ground was specious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b673-7\"> The statute treats all low or moderate income housing projects in the same manner whether or not they include units to be rented at fair market rates. See G. L. c. 40B, \u00a7 20. All the units in a low or moderate income housing development, whether or not they receive rent subsidies, count toward a municipality\u2019s minimum housing obligation. Thus, Wellesley will receive full credit for all thirty-six units in this development, including the eighteen units that will be rented at market value. HAC has held invalid its own regulation which provided that only rent-subsidized units should be counted for purposes of determining whether a locality has fulfilled its housing obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\"> \u201c [Requirements and regulations shall be considered consistent with local needs if they are reasonable in view of the regional need for low and moderate income housing considered with the number of low income persons in the city or town affected and the need to protect the health or safety of the occupants of the proposed housing or of the residents of the city or town, to promote better site and building design in relation to the surroundings, or to preserve open spaces, and if such requirements and regulations are applied as equally as possible to both subsidized and unsubsidized housing.
