Appellant believes that, during imposition of sentence on February 17, 2011, the district court made an oral pronouncement that Appellant would receive federal sentencing credit for the time he spent in federal custody prior to his federal sentencing. Appellant now asks for the district court\u2019s written judgment to be modified to reflect the oral pronouncement. On appeal, the parties dispute which standard of review we should apply to the district court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s motion, and whether these proceedings should more properly have been brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-24\">We need not resolve these issues, however, in the present appeal. The Attorney General, through the Bureau of Prisons, is responsible for computing sentencing credit under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 334-35, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). The district court has no authority to make these computations during the oral pronouncement of sentence. A prisoner may only \u201cseek judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>cial review of these computations after exhausting [his or her] administrative remedies,\u201d which cannot occur until \u201c[a]fter a district court sentences a federal offender.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, Appellant has now exhausted his administrative remedies, but obviously could not have done so when the district court imposed sentence on February 17, 2011. At that time, the Attorney General\u2019s computation of credit had not yet been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The district court therefore had no authority to make any binding decision regarding sentencing credit during the oral pronouncement of Appellant\u2019s sentence. In the present appeal, moreover, Appellant has never argued that the Attorney General\u2019s computation of his sentencing credit was wrong on any basis other than its deviation from the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement. The Attorney General was not bound, however, by a pronouncement that the district court had no authority to make. The denial of Appellant\u2019s motion, therefore, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
