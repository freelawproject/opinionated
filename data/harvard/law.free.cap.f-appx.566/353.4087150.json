Appellees are police officers in the City of Olive Branch, Mississippi, who arrested Appellant while he was staying at a hotel. It is uncontested in this case that Appellees were responding to a 911 emergency call regarding Appellant\u2019s behavior. As the transcript of the call shows, the 911 caller stated that Appellant was \u201cstaggering around\u201d the hotel with \u201ca gun on the side of his hip\u201d and \u201cthreatening people\u201d while \u201ceither wasted, drunk or on some kind of drugs.\u201d According to Appellee\u2019s unrebutted affidavit, once they arrived at the hotel, appellees observed \u201cat least twenty angry and upset hotel guests\u201d who reported that they \u201cwitnessed the man with the gun and his strange conduct.\u201d Appellees then arrested Appellant, searched Appellant\u2019s hotel room, and seized Appellant\u2019s two guns from a nightstand. It is uncontested that the search and seizure \u201coccurred contemporaneously\u201d with the arrest and that Appellant told Appellees where to find the two guns just prior to being handcuffed. Appellant was then charged under Mississippi Code \u00a7 97-35-5, which prohibits interference with business customers. The charges were later dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">Claiming that Appellees had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by acting without a warrant, Appellant brought suit against Appellees in both their individual capacities and official capacities. Appellant also claimed that Ap-pellees had violated state law. At this stage, however, Appellant has dropped his claims under state law and his federal claims against Appellees in their official capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">In Appellant\u2019s words, therefore, \u201cthe sole remaining contested issue\u201d is whether the district court was correct to grant summary judgment on the basis of Appel-lees\u2019 qualified immunity from suit in their individual capacities. According to Appellant, there was no probable cause that would have justified his arrest. According to Appellant, there also was no exigent circumstance that would justify the search of his hotel room. Therefore, Appellant argues, Appellees are not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">We disagree. \u201c[T]he usual summary judgment burden of proof is altered in the case of a qualified immunity defense.... An officer need only plead his good faith, which then shifts the burden to the plaintiff, who must rebut the defense by establishing that the officer\u2019s allegedly wrongful conduct violated clearly established law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, therefore, Appellant \u201cbears the burden of negating the defense and cannot rest on conclusory allegations and assertions but must demonstrate genuine issues of material fact regarding the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 385, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986), the doctrine of qualified immunity \u201cprovides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">Accordingly, where a warrantless arrest without probable cause is alleged, \u201claw enforcement officials who \u2018reasonably but mistakenly conclude that probable cause is present\u2019 \u201d are entitled to qualified immuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>ty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c[I]f officers of reasonable competence could disagree on this issue, immunity should be recognized.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we held in <em>Crostley v. Lamar County, Texas, </em>717 F.Sd 410, 422-23 (5th Cir.2013), we determine \u201cwhether an officer was objectively unreasonable after taking into account the totality of the circumstances at the time the arrests were made.\u201d Here, based on the report made by the 911 caller that Appellant was \u201cstaggering around\u201d the hotel with \u201ca gun on the side of his hip\u201d and \u201cthreatening people\u201d while \u201ceither wasted, drunk or on some kind of drugs,\u201d \u2014 combined with Appellees\u2019 observations once they arrived on the scene \u2014 the Appellees reasonably concluded that they had probable cause to believe that Appellant had interfered with the hotel\u2019s business customers in violation of Mississippi Code \u00a7 97-35-5. Because there is no genuine dispute regarding what was said during the 911 call or Appellees\u2019 observations on the scene, the district court correctly concluded that Appellees were entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Similarly, there is no genuine dispute regarding any material fact with respect to the reasonableness of the warrantless search. In a hotel room,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> just as in a person\u2019s residence, an officer may perform a warrantless search if the officer has probable cause to believe \u201cthat contraband is inside or that an illegal act is taking place\u201d and if the officer is presented with \u201cexigent circumstances,\u201d which may include the officer\u2019s reasonable fear for his or her own safety.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, based on the report made by the 911 caller that Appellant was \u201cstaggering around\u201d and was potentially \u201con some kind of drugs,\u201d Appel-lees reasonably concluded that they had probable cause to believe that there might be contraband in Appellant\u2019s hotel room. Moreover, a \u201cgun on the side of [Appellant\u2019s] hip\u201d had been described earlier that evening by the 911 caller, but this gun was not immediately visible to Appellees when the hotel room\u2019s door was opened. It was therefore reasonable for Appellees to conclude that this hidden weapon might pose a threat to their safety, which therefore created an exigent circumstance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since Appellant himself told Appellees to check the nightstand for his guns and the search occurred contemporaneously with the arrest, it was also reasonable for Appellees to conclude that such a search would be \u201cno broader than necessary to deal with the exigency.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Based on the record before us, therefore, Appellant has failed to identify any issue of material fact that would justify denying Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Because Appellees acted reasonably in performing the warrantless arrest, search, and seizure, Appellees are entitled to qualified immunity. Accordingly, the district court must be AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
