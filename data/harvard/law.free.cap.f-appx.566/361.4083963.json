Oviedo conceded the facts and allegations in the NTA and sought cancellation of removal, or in the alternative, voluntary departure. The immigration judge (IJ) denied both. Ovie-do appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which dismissed the appeal. Oviedo petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissing his appeal from the denial of cancellation of removal. (He does not challenge the denial of voluntary departure.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-22\">The BIA determined Oviedo did not meet his burden of establishing ten years\u2019 continuous physical presence in the United States because of his 2008 deportation or voluntary departure to Mexico. Oviedo asserts the evidence does not establish he was aware of his 2008 conviction for illegal entry or knew that, prior to June 2010, he was placed in removal proceedings, ordered removed, or granted voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-23\">Oviedo bears the burden of proving eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d) (burdens of proof in removal proceedings). To be eligible, an alien must satisfy four statutory requirements. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l) (cancellation of removal; adjustment of status). Continuous physical presence in the United States for the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of the application for cancellation of removal is required (presence requirement). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(A). An alien\u2019s deportation or voluntary departure under threat of immigration proceedings stops the continuous-presence accrual. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(5) (detention and removal of aliens ordered removed); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.64 (eligibility for cancellation of removal); <em>see also Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 214, 217-19 (5th Cir.2003); <em>In re Romalez-Alcaide, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 423, 426-28 (BIA 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-24\">We review the decision of the BIA, \u201cunless the IJ\u2019s decision has some impact on\u201d it. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Factual findings, on whether Oviedo established the presence require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ment, are reviewed for substantial evidence. Gar<em>cia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cThis Court will not reverse the decision ... unless the petitioner provides evidence so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude against it\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Oviedo testified that, in 2008, while attempting to reenter the United States from a brief stay in Mexico, he was apprehended by border authorities, detained for four days, transported to a court, ordered to return to Mexico, and returned to Mexico. This testimony is consistent with the information reported by the immigration agent in Form 1-213 Record of Deporta-ble/Inadmissible Alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Because Oviedo was convicted of illegal entry, the BIA, in agreement with the IJ, determined his return to Mexico in 2008 was either a deportation or a grant of voluntary departure. Oviedo\u2019s assertion that he was unaware of his conviction, deportation, or voluntary departure is not \u201cso compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude\u201d the continuous-presence accrual was not interrupted. <em>Id. </em>Thus, substantial evidence supported finding Oviedo lacked the requisite continuous presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
