The Government contends that we need not reach this issue because any error is harmless. <em>See United States v. Valdez, </em>726 F.3d 684, 697 (5th Cir.2013)(evaluating harmlessness by looking at whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence for the same reasons); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>676 F.3d 491, 511-12 (5th Cir.2012). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-22\">The district court engaged in a lengthy colloquy with counsel regarding Ramirez\u2019s extensive prior (mostly uncounted) criminal convictions and his history of prior deportations followed by unlawful reentry. It was aware of the two potential guidelines ranges (with or without the enhancement). It considered Ramirez\u2019s particular characteristics in light of his allocution, the parties\u2019 arguments, and the information presented before engaging in a lengthy analysis of the reasons that the particular sentence was appropriate \u201cwith or without the guidelines,\u201d including: \u201cyou\u2019ve had a lot of chances\u201d (several deportations without convictions); and, despite the fact that most of his convictions came when Ramirez was \u201ca younger man,\u201d \u201cyou still have those criminal convictions and a lot of them didn\u2019t count.\u201d It noted that \u201cyou\u2019re not willing to abide by [the law regarding illegal reentry].\u201d It then reiterated: \u201cthat\u2019s why I think a sentence within this range is appropriate, with or without the guidelines.\u201d Considering the totality of the record, we conclude that the same sentence would have been imposed even \u2022without the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
