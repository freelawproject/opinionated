He was sentenced to 188 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. He contends that the district court erroneously calculated the guidelines range. The Government responds that his claims of error are barred by his appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-22\">Edgardo-Guillen does not acknowledge the existence of the appeal waiver much less challenge its validity on appeal. A review of the record indicates that he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence, <em>see United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292 (5th Cir.1994), and that his claims of error regarding the calculation of the guidelines range are barred by the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-23\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. Counsel is WARNED that the filing of an appeal contrary to an appeal waiver is a needless waste of resources and could result in sanctions. <em>See United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 224 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
