We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\">A. <em>Underlying Criminal Proceedings and Motion to Vacate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-19\">In 2006, Herrera-Contreras was indicted for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(\u00fc), and 846 (Count 1); and conspiracy to launder money, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)\u00ae, (a)(1)(B)\u00ae, and (h) (Count 2). The indictment contained a forfeiture provision seeking \u201c[a] sum of money representing the amount of proceeds obtained as a result of the controlled substance offense\u201d and \u201c[o]ne sum of $803,543 in United States currency.\u201d Rl-40 at 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-20\">Before trial, Herrera-Contreras filed several motions seeking to suppress evidence of drug trafficking and money laundering seized, when agents executed a search warrant at a home in Lawrenee-ville, Georgia, in April 2006. Herrera-Contreras argued the warrant had not authorized the agents to use a key, seized during his arrest, to open a locked closet in the master bedroom. The district judge denied the motions to suppress, and the case proceeded to trial. After Herrera-Contreras was convicted, the district judge ordered Herrera-Contreras to forfeit to the government $803,543, which agents had seized from the Lawrenceville home. We affirmed Herrera-Contreras\u2019s convictions on direct appeal and rejected his argument that agents violated his Fourth Amendment rights by testing his key to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>see if it fit the lock of the closet. <em>United States v. Herrera-Contreras, </em>269 Fed.Appx. 875, 876-77 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Herrera-Contreras later filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence and again challenged the search of the Lawrenceville home, where he \u201cpackaged about 4 million dollars per month of gross drug proceeds.\u201d R2-149 at 3-4. In support of his \u00a7 2255 motion, Herrera-Contreras submitted a declaration in which he asserted the money he counted in the Lawrenceville home did not constitute \u201cdrug trafficking profits,\u201d but \u201cdrug trafficking proceeds,\u201d which he had counted, packaged, and forwarded to Mexico on behalf of a cartel. R2-152-1 at 6-7. The district judge denied Herrera-Contreras\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, as well as his subsequent Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion to alter judgment, and we denied a certificate of appealability. <em>Herrera-Contreras v. United States, </em>No. 12-13511 (11th Cir. Apr. 22, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">B. <em>Motion for Return of Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">In April 2012, Herrera-Contreras filed a pro se motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), seeking the return of $2.1 million, which he alleged agents illegally seized during the search of his locked bedroom closet. He asserted agents found $2,940,340 in his bedroom closet, but reported and forfeited only $803,543. The government filed a response supported by an excerpt from Herrera-Contreras\u2019s trial transcript, in which a government witness testified agents found $803,543 in the closet. R2-167-1 at 2-9. The district judge denied Herrera-Contreras\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion, because (1) he had not shown the government seized the $2.1 million at issue, and (2) regardless, Herrera-Contreras did not have \u201cclean hands,\u201d because any amounts at issue were the proceeds of drugs sales. On appeal, Herrera-Contreras argues the district judge erred by denying his Rule 41(g) motion without holding an evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">On appeal from the denial of a Rule 41(g) motion, we review questions of law de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Howell, </em>425 F.3d 971, 973 (11th Cir.2005). We review \u201cthe equitable equation\u201d of the district judge\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 41(g) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Machado, </em>465 F.3d 1301, 1307 (11th Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds as recognized in United States v. Lopez, </em>562 F.3d 1309, 1312-13 (11th Cir.2009). Pursuant to Rule 41(g), a person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of property may move for its return. Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">Where a party invokes Rule 41(g) after the close of all criminal proceedings, the motion for return of property is treated as a civil action in equity. <em>Machado, </em>465 F.3d at 1307. Equitable jurisdiction must be exercised \u201cwith caution and restraint\u201d and is appropriate only when necessary to \u201cprevent manifest injustice,\u201d in light of the movant\u2019s conduct and the merits of his request. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>241 F.3d 1329, 1331 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (addressing Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(e), the predecessor to Rule 41(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">To merit relief under Rule 41(g), the movant must have an ownership right in the property sought and must come into the transaction with \u201cclean hands.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 973-75. \u201cThe court must receive evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion.\u201d \u2022 Fed. R.Crim.P. 41(g); <em>see also United States v. Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Cir.2001) (concluding the district judge incorrectly denied a criminal defendant\u2019s Rule 41(e) motion based on the government\u2019s unsupported allegation that the property at issue had been destroyed).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Herrera-Contreras has cited no binding precedent in support of his argument the district judge was required to hold a hearing, where the judge received evidence showing the government did not possess the $2.1 million at issue. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 41(g); <em>Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d at 1314 (recognizing the government must submit some evidence of property destruction, but it is within the district judge\u2019s discretion to determine how evidence should be presented). The district judge received a declaration submitted by Herrera-Contreras in support of his Rule 41(g) motion and an excerpt from Herrera-Contreras\u2019s trial transcript, which was already part of the record. Therefore, the judge properly denied Herrera-Contreras\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The district judge also properly concluded Herrera-Contreras\u2019s \u201cunclean hands\u201d status barred the relief he sought. <em>See Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 977. In a declaration filed with his \u00a7 2255 motion, Herrera-Contreras stated the money he had counted and packaged in the Lawrenceville home constituted \u201cdrug trafficking proceeds.\u201d R2-152-1 at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Furthermore, under the law-of-the-case doctrine, findings of fact and conclusions of law by an appellate court generally are binding in all later proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on appeal. <em>Mega Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Pieniozek, </em>585 F.3d 1399, 1405 (11th Cir.2009); see <em>also AIG Baker Sterling Heights, LLC v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., </em>579 F.3d 1268, 1270-71 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining the law-of-the-case doctrine bars relitigation of issues decided, either explicitly or by necessary implication, in an earlier appeal of the same case). The law-of-the-case doctrine, however, does not bar reconsideration of an issue if (1) a later trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice. <em>Mega Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., </em>585 F.3d at 1405.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">We previously rejected Herrera-Contreras\u2019s challenge to the lawfulness of the search of his closet, and he has advanced no factual allegations or legal arguments suggesting any of the exceptions to the law-of-the-case doctrine apply. <em>Herrera-Contreras, </em>269 Fed.Appx. at 876-77. The law of the case bars his argument that the unclean-hands doctrine does not apply because the seizure was unlawful. <em>See Mega Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., </em>585 F.3d at 1405; <em>AIG Baker Sterling Heights, LLC, </em>579 F.3d at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">In view of his conduct and the lack of merit in his arguments, Herrera-Contreras has failed to show the equitable relief he requested in his Rule 41(g) motion was necessary to prevent manifest injustice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Martinez, </em>241 F.3d at 1331 n. 2. We affirm the district judge\u2019s denial of Herrera-Contreras\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-7\">. We decline to address Herrera-Contreras's argument, raised for the first time in his reply brief, that the unclean-hands doctrine may bar relief only if the government was injured by his conduct. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>684 F.3d 1045, 1064 n. 23 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining an appellant abandons an issue if he fails to develop any argument in support of it in his opening brief); <em>United States v. Evans, </em>473 F.3d 1115, 1120 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining we will not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
