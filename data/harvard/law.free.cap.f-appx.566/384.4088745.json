In October 2013, at a time when Bouldin had no actions pending, he filed a pro se motion requesting grand jury documents and a pro se motion titled \u201cOrder to Show Cause,\u201d requesting that the district court order the United States Attorney to show cause why the documents requested by Bouldin should not be provided. Bouldin appeals the district court\u2019s denial of those motions and the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration of the denial of those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-19\">It is questionable whether Bouldin\u2019s motions had a valid jurisdictional basis in the district court. <em>See United States v. Carvajal, </em>989 F.2d 170, 170 (5th Cir.1993). However, even if the district court correctly exercised jurisdiction, the district court properly denied the motions because Boul-din failed to show a particularized need for the grand jury materials. <em>See United States v. Miramontez, </em>995 F.2d 56, 57-58 (5th Cir.1993). Further, by pleading guilty, he waived all nonjurisdictional defects occurring during the grand jury proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 60. Accordingly, the denial of Bouldin\u2019s postconviction motions is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
