The district court dismissed all Helton\u2019s claims as barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Helton argues on appeal that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>\u00a7 1983 action is not barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because he is challenging Florida state officials\u2019 refusal to release evidence for post-conviction DNA testing, not the state courts\u2019 denial of the same relief under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.853. He asserts that the district court should have reached the merits of his claim and held that the officials violated his First Amendment right to petition, Sixth Amendment Confrontation and Compulsory Process Clause rights, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, and his Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process guarantee. He also argues that the court abused its discretion by denying his Rule 59(e) motion, because the underlying judgment was based on manifest errors of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">For ease of reference, we address each of Helton\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">We review questions of jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ehlen Floor Covering, Inc. v. Lamb, </em>660 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cWe may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that appears in the record, whether or not that ground was relied upon or even considered by the court below.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, when a state court judgment was issued prior to the commencement of a federal action, the district court lacks jurisdiction to review complaints seeking district court review and reversal of the state court judgment. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>applies because, among the federal courts, Congress authorized only the Supreme Court to reverse or modify a state court decision. <em>Id. </em>at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1522.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">We determined the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine\u2019s applicability to the field of post-conviction DNA testing in <em>Alvarez v. Attorney General for Florida. </em>679 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir.2012). In that case, we held that a plaintiff proceeding under \u00a7 1983, who has unsuccessfully sought DNA testing in state court, is barred from lodging a claim that state officials violated his right to procedural due process by denying testing. <em>Id. </em>at 1260, 1262. Such a claim is an as-applied challenge inviting federal court review and reversal of a state court judgment, and is therefore prohibited by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 1263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">We then decided Alvarez\u2019s remaining \u00a7 1983 claims on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 1265-67. Specifically, he argued that the state\u2019s denial of DNA testing violated the Sixth and Eighth Amendments, and his right to access the courts under the Fourteenth Amendment. We exercised subject matter jurisdiction over these claims, but concluded that all three should be dismissed because the arguments were foreclosed by precedent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-13\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars Helton\u2019s procedural due process claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1263-64. Helton alleged that the Florida officials erred in denying DNA testing under the standard set forth in Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.853. By framing his claim as an as-applied challenge to the application of the state\u2019s post-conviction DNA testing procedure to the facts of his case, he invited federal court review and reversal of a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>court decision. Because this is the same argument presented in <em>Alvarez, </em>we apply its holding and conclude that the district court properly dismissed Helton\u2019s procedural due process claim under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The district court did not err in dismissing Helton\u2019s remaining claims, either; however, we affirm their dismissal on alternate grounds. <em>Thomas, </em>506 F.3d at 1364. Helton\u2019s Sixth and Eighth Amendment claims and access-to-the-courts argument are nearly identical to those we addressed on the merits in <em>Alvarez. Id. </em>at 1265-67. Accordingly, while Helton\u2019s claims were therefore not barred by <em>Rook-er-Feldman, </em>they were foreclosed by our precedent and could not afford relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">We review the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1137 &amp; n. 69 (11th Cir.2000). A Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion should be granted only when there is newly discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact in the initial ruling. <em>Jacobs v. Tempur-Pedic Int'l, Inc., </em>626 F.3d 1327, 1344 (11th Cir.2010). Asking the district court to reexamine an unfavorable ruling is not the purpose of Rule 59(e). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Helton\u2019s motion because he failed to show any manifest errors or newly discovered evidence. <em>Id. </em>In his motion, Helton argued that his \u00a7 1983 action was dismissed in error, but <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>precluded his procedural due process claim, and our precedent foreclosed his remaining arguments. <em>Alvarez, </em>679 F.3d at 1263-67. Furthermore, because Helton\u2019s assertions in support of his motion were nearly identical to those he made against the magistrate\u2019s report, which the court adopted, he was asking the court to re-examine its initial ruling, which it will not do pursuant to a Rule 59(e) motion. <em>Jacobs, </em>626 F.3d at 1344.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Helton\u2019s motion and its dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-15\">.
