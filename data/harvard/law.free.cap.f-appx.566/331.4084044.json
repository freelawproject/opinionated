In April 2009, Jack pleaded guilty to a related charge in state court, and the state court sentenced Jack to nine years of imprisonment, ordering his state sentence to run concurrently with any other sentences. When Jack commenced serving his federal sentence, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) refused to give him credit toward his federal sentence for time he had spent in state custody that had been credited toward his state sentence. The BOP also declined to make a nunc pro tunc designation of the state prison as the place where Jack commenced serving his federal sentence. As a result, Jack is serving his federal sentence consecutively to his state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-22\">Jack unsuccessfully challenged the BOP\u2019s computation of his sentence in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Jack v. Carlson, </em>No. 1:12-CV-3027 (W-D.La. June 11, 2013). Upon the denial of his \u00a7 2241 petition, Jack returned to this criminal proceeding and filed a motion seeking to have the district court correct or amend the judgment of conviction to reduce his sentence and give effect to the state court\u2019s order for concurrent sentences. The district court denied Jack\u2019s motion, and it denied his subsequent motion for reconsideration. It is the denial of Jack\u2019s motions in this criminal proceeding that are before us now for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">The district court had the discretion, when sentencing Jack, to order Jack\u2019s fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>eral sentence to run consecutively to his then-anticipated state sentence; we presume from the district court\u2019s failure to specifically order a concurrent sentence that it intended to impose a consecutive sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); <em>Setser v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 182 S.Ct. 1468, 1466-73, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012). The method for computing a federal prisoner\u2019s sentence is found at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585. Section \u00a7 3585(b) provides that a defendant is entitled to credit for time spent in official detention prior to being received in federal custody if that prior time has not been credited toward another sentence. \u00a7 3585(b). However, only the Attorney General through the BOP, and not the sentencing court, is authorized to calculate credit for time spent in official detention under \u00a7 3585. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 335, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Jack\u2019s motion to amend or correct was styled as a motion filed pursuant to Rule 36 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The district court correctly determined that a request for sentencing credit is not cognizable in a Rule 36 proceeding. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>868 F.2d 151, 151-52 (5th Cir.1989). Jack argues here, as he did in his motion for reconsideration, that his request for relief was an omnibus motion inviting the district court to correct the judgment of conviction under any authority it might have. In addition to \u00a7 3585 and Rule 36, Jack lists U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) and BOP Program Statement (BOPPS) 5160.05 as possible alternative sources of authority allowing the district court to adjust his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The Sentencing Guidelines are to be considered by a district court in fashioning a sentence upon conviction. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Nothing in \u00a7 5G1.3 purports to allow a district court to revisit a sentence that has already been imposed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5G1.3. Under the BOP\u2019s nunc pro tunc designation procedure set forth in BOPPS 5160.05, \u201c[wjhere a federal sentence was imposed before a state sentence, the BOP may indirectly award credit for time served in state prison by designating nunc pro tunc the state prison as the place in which the prisoner serves a portion of his federal sentence.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Holder, </em>614 F.3d 158, 160 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see Hunter v. Tamez, </em>622 F.3d 427, 429 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.2010). The district court has no authority under BOPPS 5160.05 to make a nunc pro tunc designation, but it may review a challenge to the BOP\u2019s refusal to make such a designation in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Pierce, </em>614 F.3d at 160. Thus, none of the sources urged by Jack authorized the district court to grant the relief he sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">A claim that a federal sentence is constitutionally invalid should be brought in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a); <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Jack\u2019s contention is not that his federal sentence, as imposed, is unconstitutional. Instead, Jack maintains that the execution of his federal sentence consecutively to his service of his state sentence undermines the voluntariness of his guilty plea to the state court charge since that plea was predicated upon his understanding, as well of that of the attorneys involved and the state court judge, that Jack\u2019s state and federal sentences would run concurrently. Claims regarding the execution of a sentence are properly brought in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). With respect to the execution of Jack\u2019s federal sentence, he has already unsuccessfully raised his claims for sentence credit in his prior \u00a7 2241 petition. On the record before us, it is impossible to determine whether the voluntariness of Jack\u2019s state plea would be the proper sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ject of a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Hunter, </em>622 F.3d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
