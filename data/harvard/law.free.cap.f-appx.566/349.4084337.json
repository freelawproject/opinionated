California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). Ford has responded to counsel\u2019s motion and asserts that his appeal raises three nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">First, Ford contends that the district court erred in denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. This court \u201cwill affirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is without foundation, a standard of review more deferential than the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although a defendant who pleads guilty prior to trial and truthfully admits relevant conduct may qualify for the reduction, \u201cthis evidence may be outweighed by conduct of the defendant that is inconsistent with such acceptance of responsibility.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 3. The district court denied a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and applied an enhancement for obstruction of justice on the ground that, after being released on bond, Ford violated his conditions of supervised released and failed to appear in court for three years. Conduct resulting in an obstruction-of-justice enhancement ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 4. Ford has not set forth any circumstance showing that his case is one of the extraordinary ones in which both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 may apply. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">Second, Ford contends that the district court erred in failing to explain its reason for an upward variance. When imposing a variance, the court must \u201cadequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fairness in sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Contrary to Ford\u2019s assertion, the district court explained the basis for the upward variance both at sentencing and in the Statement of Reasons. The record reflects that the court considered a number of factors in imposing the variance, including Ford\u2019s failure to appear for three years and Ford\u2019s possession of an assault rifle that had been converted to a fully automatic machine gun, along with magazines capable of holding 40 to 43 rounds of ammunition, in a house where small children lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">Finally, Ford contends that there was no evidence that the firearm in his possession was stolen, so as support the district court\u2019s enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A). Because Ford did not object to the enhancement in the district court, this court\u2019s review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714 (5th Cir.2007). The Presen-tence Report (PSR) indicated that the Harris County Sheriffs Office had run the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>firearm found in Ford\u2019s room through a computer database and the firearm was reported stolen out of the Houston Police Department on October 17, 1999. The PSR further stated that the status of the firearm as stolen was \u201cverified by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\u201d \u201cGenerally, a PSR bears sufficient indicia of reliability to permit the sentencing court to rely on it at sentencing. The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the PSR is inaccurate; in the absence of rebuttal evidence, the sentencing court may properly rely on the PSR and adopt it.\u201d <em>United States v. Ollison, </em>555 F.3d 152, 164 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Ford did not object to the above factual information in the PSR or present rebuttal evidence. Accordingly, Ford has not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">After reviewing counsel\u2019s brief, Ford\u2019s response, and the relevant portions of the record, we concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Ford\u2019s motions for the appointment of new counsel are DENIED. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
