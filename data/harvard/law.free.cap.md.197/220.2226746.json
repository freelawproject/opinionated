Dorsey, purchased, with his own funds and subject to mortgages subsequently paid by him or out of his estate, four farms in St. Mary\u2019s County, which were placed in the name of his brother, Philip H. Dorsey (defendants\u2019 testator), \u201cfor the express and sole purpose of creating a trust estate for the benefit of * * * plaintiffs, commencing at * * * Walter\u2019s * * * death, subject to any indebtedness; * * * Walter * * * having the utmost confidence and faith in his brother.\u201d These properties were caused by Walter to be placed in Philip\u2019s name \u201cas security for certain advancements made to * * * Walter.\u201d They were conveyed to Philip in 1916 and 1918, each subject to a purchase money mortgage from Philip to the respective grantor; these mortgages were released in 1925, 1924, 1924 and 1919 respectively. Walter before his death was in ill health; he was indebted to Philip as an accommodation endorser on notes made by Walter; desiring to protect Philip from any loss he might suffer as endorser, Walter permitted the properties to remain in Philip\u2019s name \u201cwith the understanding between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>two brothers that any notes * * * Philip * * * might be called upon to pay as * * * endorser should be a charge upon said farms and the balance, if any, should be turned over to * * * plaintiffs.\u201d In order to protect Walter, Philip signed a blank promissory note to Walter with permission to fill in such amount as would be necessary to cover the value of the farms should Philip \u201cfail to carry out or evade the terms of the trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Walter died December 11, 1923; Philip and plaintiff Philip, Jr., were his executors. All of the notes on which Philip was endorser \u201cwere paid from the proceeds of\u201d Walter's estate, as shown by the executors\u2019 account, and Philip was held harmless from any loss by reason of his endorsement. At the time of Walter\u2019s death the crops on the farms were marketed and the proceeds, approximately $3,200, \u201cwere retained by * * * Philip * * *, as part of said trust.\u201d On November 23, 1925 Philip sold the first of the farms for $6,250; after deducting the mortgage, $1,500, the balance of $4,750 Philip \u201chad full use of since November 23, 1925.\u201d In 1937 Philip sold a second farm for $4,500; the balance of $3,000 (over and above a $1,500 mortgage) Philip \u201chad full use of since April 2, 1937.\u201d Since Walter\u2019s death Philip (and later his executors) \u201ccontinued to operate\u201d the other two farms and \u201cto retain the proceeds, rents and profits therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Walter prior to his death had full control of the four farms, exercised all the rights of ownership, collecting \u25a0 all rents and revenues, paying all costs of operation, including interest on the mortgages. Plaintiffs and Philip \u201cunderstood between them that the four farms were owned by [Walter], subject to indebtedness thereon, * * * plaintiffs having confidence and faith in their uncle to handle the trust and not expecting or anticipating his death\u201d. Philip died on February 6, 1945. The bill was filed in 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The bill prays (1) \u201cthat an implied, constructive trust be imposed upon\u201d the two unsold farms, \u201cin favor of plaintiffs\u201d, (4) an accounting \u201cfor the proceeds of sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>of the two farms * * * and [for] the rents and profits of all the farms\u201d from the date of Walter\u2019s death, and (6) general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">We need not attempt to reconcile the contradictory allegations as to the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the \u201ctrust\u201d and the conveyances and as to ownership of the properties. If the case could not be disposed of on the ground of laches, we should be confronted with the question how a constructive trust could be established from any allegations showing, <em>(a) </em>an original intention not to perform the trust or other fraud on Philip\u2019s part in procuring the transfers to him or (b) any preexisting confidential relation. Tro<em>ssbach v. Trossbach, </em>185 Md. 47, 51-52, 42 A. 2d 905. We shall assume that, aside from the question of laches, the bill does (in some way not clear to us) state a case of constructive trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">As it appears from the bill that from Walter\u2019s death in 1923 till his own in 1945 Philip exercised absolute ownership over the alleged trust property and did nothing to acknowledge the alleged trust, it might well be asked whether plaintiffs are not barred by the Statute of Limitations. <em>Ridgely v. Pfingstag, </em>188 Md. 209, 234-236, 50 A. 2d 587. However, it is unnecessary to decide more than the question of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u201cOrdinarily the defense of laches involves not mere lapse of time (short of the period of limitations) but also some prejudice to the defendant and must be made by answer showing such facts. If, however, the bill on its face shows both lapse of time and prejudice or such lapse of time and circumstances as suggest prejudice or acquiescence and call for explanation * * * the bill is demurrable. <em>Salisbury v. Camden Sewer Co., </em>135 Md. 563, 571, 109 A. 333; <em>Plitt v. Kaufman, </em>188 Md. 606, 53 A. 2d 673, 677.\u201d <em>Clarke v. Brunk, </em>189 Md. 353, 362, 55 A. 2d 919, 923. See also <em>Kaufman v. Plitt, </em>191 Md. 24, 28-29, 59 A. 2d 634; <em>Kenny v. Peregoy, </em>196 Md. 630, 78 A. 2d 173. The application of this principle and the cases cited in the instant case is too obvious for elaboration. Plaintiffs waited until after Philip\u2019s death twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>one years after Walter\u2019s death. It was suggested at the argument (not in the bill) that delay was excusable because of desire not to disturb pleasant relations with their bachelor uncle. On the facts shown in the bill, plaintiffs had to choose between hope of bounty and claim of right. After having kept silent when they ought to have spoken, they should not now be permitted to speak when they ought to keep silent. <em>Niven v. Belknap, 2 </em>Johns., N. Y., 573, 589. As Chief Justice Fuller said, \u201cThe hour glass must supply the ravages of the scythe, and those who have slept upon their rights must be remitted to the repose from which they should not have been aroused.\u201d <em>Hammond v. Hopkins, </em>143 U. S. 244, 274, 12 S. Ct. 418, 435, 36 L. Ed. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
