Franklin Street, Baltimore City. Captain Alexander L. Emerson, of the Baltimore City Police Department, received a complaint that soldiers were going to this place with lewd women. There also appears to have been a complaint by the Health Department. Around four o\u2019clock on the morning of September 10, 1950, the Captain paid a call at this place. He rapped on the door and was admitted by the traverser to what we suppose is the office. There was a man with her. The Captain was authorized, under section 120 Article 16 of the Code of Baltimore City (1927) to visit such places as this and to inspect the register. \u201cI told her that I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>was Captain Emerson. She said; \u2018Yes, I know you.\u2019 I said: \u2018We have a complaint from the United States Army about venereal disease here with the soldiers.\u2019 She said: \u2018Yes, I didn\u2019t get word from the Army, but 1 did get notice from the Health Department that that had happened.\u2019 I said: \u2018Do you have any soldiers in here now?\u2019 She said: \u2018Not as I know of.\u2019 I asked her to let me look at the book. I looked at the book, or at the cards there (indicating).\u201d It appeared from these cards, which represented the register that the Captain inspected, that on the night of September 9-10 three couples had been registered at different times in one room, and also on that night two couples had been registered at different times in each of four other rooms. It was apparent that the section of the code referred to had been violated. The Captain\u2019s suspicions were aroused. He testified: \u201cI asked her to come on. She said to the man visiting with her to go with me. He went with me. Q. Didn\u2019t you brush by her and say I am going into these rooms? A. No, I said I wanted to see the rooms. She said to the man, you go with him. * * * I wanted to see if there was any soldiers there and to see if there was any wrong doings there. I saw the cards. After I saw several cards for one room and no departure, yes, then I wanted to see. I went to every room \u2014 \u201d He denied that he was rough or rude or in any way coerced the traverser to permit him to visit the rooms, and his testimony is not contradicted. His tour of this rooming house disclosed a man and a woman in each of about twenty rooms. None were husband and wife and each couple had registered in a fictitious name and given a fictitious address.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">It was due to the admission in evidence of the disclosure by Captain Emerson\u2019s testimony that the traverser contends she was unlawfully convicted and sentenced. She contends he should have first procured a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">We do not agree with the State that Emerson\u2019s testimony was admissible under the theory that he witnessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the commission of a misdemeanor, but we do agree with the State that the traverser waived her right to object to a search of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We said, in the case of <em>Hubbard v. State, </em>195 Md. 103, 107, 72 A. 2d 733, 735: \u201cIf the court is of the opinion that the accused freely and voluntarily consented to the search, and there was no coercion or fear brought to bear upon the traverser by the police, the matter should be submitted to the jury, and it is then for the jury to say, on all the facts, whether the traverser waived her right she might have to object to the search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In that case, as in this case, there is no evidence to show that the traverser objected to the search, or that any coercion or fear was exercised upon her by Emerson. She waived her right to object to a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
