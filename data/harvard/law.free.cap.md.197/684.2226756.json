He alleges that his constitutional rights were violated by failure of the court to appoint counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>for him at his trial. He not only could have made, but did make, this contention on appeal to this court through counsel appointed by the court for the purpose of appeal. The judgment was affirmed. <em>Smith v. State, </em>180 Md. 529, 25 A. 2d 681. If any other contentions now made, <em>e. g., </em>failure of the court to advise him <em>(a) </em>\u201cthat he could conduct his own case in his own defense\u201d or <em>(b) </em>of \u201chis right to appeal\u201d, were not made on appeal, they could have been made then and cannot be heard on <em>habeas corpus. Loughran v. Warden, </em>192 Md. 719, 64 A. 2d 712. Indeed, these contentions seem self-contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
