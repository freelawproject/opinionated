He was indicted for robbery with a deadly weapon and for murder. He was tried under both indictments at the same time, before the court without a jury, and was found not guilty of robbery, but guilty of larceny, and not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. He was represented by counsel at the trial. There is no allegation of facts indicating violation of any fundamental rights. He alleges that <em>(a) </em>the two indictments were improperly tried together, <em>(b) </em>he was improperly convicted of larceny under a robbery indictment and of manslaughter under a murder indictment, (c) he was subjected to double jeopardy and double punishment by conviction of both larceny for stealing from the man killed and manslaughter for killing him, and <em>(d) </em>in some way, the consecutive sentences were unlawful or the docket entries are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Petitioner has applied to a number of judges, state or federal, for a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>Several judges granted the writ and after hearing remanded petitioner. Judge Chesnut denied the writ. Appeal dismissed, <em>Carroll v. Swenson, </em>4 Cir., 180 F. 2d 579; <em>certiorari </em>denied, 839 U. S. 971, 70 S. Ct. 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">As neither of petitioner\u2019s sentences has expired, any question as to their consecutive operation is premature. <em>Hirons v. Warden, </em>196 Md. 679, 76 A. 2d 162; <em>Czaplinski v. Warden, </em>196 Md. 654, 75 A. 2d 766. If we assume that a sentence of \u201cfour years, ten months and six days\u201d would be better form than \u201cfive years from March 17, 1949\u201d, the legal effect is precisely the same, and a sentence in the latter form is not unlawful or void.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The short answer to all petitioner\u2019s other contentions is that all could have been raised by appeal, and cannot be raised by <em>habeas corpus. Loughran v. Warden, </em>192 Md. 719, 64 A. 2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
