The allocation to appellant of the rate of the tax levy within the 10 mill limitation was made at a rate of 0.4 of a mill under the minimum guarantee as fixed by law, Section 5705.31, Revised Code, there being 0.6 of a mill of \u201cfree millage\u201d available within the 10 mill limitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-14\">\u201c \u20182.

This was received by them on December 20, 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\">\u201c \u2018The notice of appeal in this case was filed January 18, 1966.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-17\">\u201c \u2018It has also been agreed that the only adjustment that ean be made uniformly throughout the Cambridge City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>School District to correct this situation is a reduction of the inside millage of the County of Guernsey, and the relative cost of these adjustments, if the county inside millage is lowered by <em>A </em>of a mill, it will cost the county $34,000. If the city\u2019s allocation is lowered \u2014 city school district allocation is lowered, it will cost the city $22,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u201c \u2018That is our stipulation of facts.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\u201cSection 5705.31, Revised Code, provides, in poi\u2019tinent part, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201c \u2018* * *. The commission shall ascertain that the following levies are properly authorized and if so authorized, shall approve the following levies without modification :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\"><em>tt </em>\u00cd# # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">\u201c \u2018(D) A minimum levy within the ten mill limitation for the current expense and debt service of <em>each subdivision or taxing unit, </em>which shall equal two-thirds of the average levy for current expenses and debt service allotted within the fifteen mill limitation to <em>such sub-division or taxing unit </em>during the last five years said fifteen mill limitation was in effect, unless <em>such sub-division or taxing unit </em>requests an amount requiring a lower rate. * * *\u2019 (Emphasis by BTA.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">\u201cIt is apparent that for a proper determination of the precise meaning of the provisions of Section 5705.31, Revised Code, it is necessary to first determine the correct interpretation of the words \u2018each subdivision or taxing unit\u2019 as set forth in said statute. It appears clear that these terms refer to a subdivision or taxing unit as it existed and as it was bounded and constituted during the years 1929 through 1933. To interpret this language to mean any subdivision or taxing unit as it now exists, and regardless of any annexations or detachments of territory that may have occurred since 1934, would render the statute without meaning. It is possible for an entirely new subdivision or taxing unit to have been created subsequent to 1934 by virtue of the incorporation of a new municipality or the creation of a new township or school district. In such cases there would be no average levies for the five-year period set out in Section 5705.31, Revised Code, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>in order to arrive at a minimum levy for the newly created district, said minimum levy must, of necessity, be the lowest of the minimum levies of the \u2018inside millage\u2019 of the previously existing subdivisions or taxing units out of which the new municipality, township or school district was created.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">\u201cThe appellant takes the position that regardless of whatever territorial changes in a subdivision may have taken place during the years subsequent to 1933, and whether or not such territorial changes resulted from the <em>voluntary </em>action of such subdivision or taxing unit, that nevertheless the minimum levy of \u2018inside millage\u2019 of such subdivision or taxing unit remains the same based upon the levies for the years 1929 through 1933, regardless of the effects of such minimum levies upon other subdivisions or taxing units.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\u201cThe appellees take the position that the language, \u2018 subdivision or taxing unit \u2019 as to which the minimum levy of \u2018inside millage\u2019 is mandatory upon a county budget commission is confined to such a subdivision or taxing unit as it actually existed in 1934, so long as such subdivision or taxing unit does not add territory from another subdivision or taxing unit having a lower minimum levy of \u2018inside millage. \u2019 The appellees further maintain that in the event such addition of territory enlarges the geographical boundaries of such subdivision or taxing unit, then it has forfeited or waived its statutory and absolute right to demand the minimum levy of \u2018inside millage\u2019 based upon the years 1929 through 1933, which absolute right it had previously enjoyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201cAnother contention of the appellant is that the County Budget Commission is empowered with the duty to adjust minimum levies when territorial changes occur and that discretion is given to the commission as to the manner to effectuate such adjustments in order to realize the most revenue within the ten-mill limitation to the best interest of all political sub-divisions affected. However, in the appeal now before us, there is neither an allegation of abuse of discretion on the part of the Budget Commission nor has any evidence been produced to show any abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>discretion. The only budget we have before us is the budget prepared by the appellant and we must assume that the Budget Commission, in passing upon the budget presented to it by the appellee, County of Guernsey, and by the City of Cambridge and by the Township of Cambridge, acted in good faith in the exercise of its discretion and assigned the disputed and so-called \u2018free millage\u2019 to the county, rather than to the appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">\u201cIt appears to the Board of Tax Appeals that the Guernsey County Budget Commission was exercising its discretion when it took this action and in the absence of an allegation of or proof of fraud, bad faith or abuse of discretion, the Board of Tax Appeals, from the information now before us, would not be justified in making any change in the tax rates as set by the Guernsey County Budget Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u2018 \u2018 For a general discussion as to the discretion given to a budget commission in exercising its directory powers and duties, see <em>State, ex rel. City of Dayton </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1915), 93 Ohio St. 25 and <em>State, ex rel. Board of Education of East Liverpool City School District </em>v. <em>Columbiana County Budget Commission </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 65.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">\u201cIt is the opinion of the Board of Tax Appeals that when one school district is <em>voluntarily </em>received and transferred to another school district pursuant to Section 3311.-231, Revised Code, the inside mandated tax levies of the district being received would apply to the entire newly consolidated district unless the application of such rate would force an infringement of the ten-mill limitation of Article XII, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution when, if such were the result, the inside tax levy for the newly consolidated school district would be the maximum tax levy which would allow for inside levies of no more than ten mills throughout the entire consolidated school district. See Opinion of the Ohio Attorney General No. 1373, dated May 24,1960.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201cIn conclusion, and taking into consideration the observations and opinions above noted, and acting pursuant to the provisions of Section 5705.37, Revised Code, the Board of Tax Appeals herewith determines that the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ing millage within the ten-mill constitutional limitation be levied for the tax year 1965 for the several political subdivisions and taxing units having property within the geographical limits of the Cambridge City School District as it now exists following its receipt of territory formerly belonging to Liberty-Wheeling Local School District:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">Political Subdivision</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">or Taxing Unit Mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">Guernsey County 3.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">Cambridge Township .10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">Cambridge City School Dist. 4.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">City of Cambridge 2.90</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-H\">io.oo\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Under date of July 21,1967, this decision of the Board of Tax Appeals was reversed by a 2 to 1 decision of the Guernsey County Court of Appeals, wherein the contention of the appellant was upheld. This decision of the Court of Appeals is reported in 11 Ohio App. 2d 77. From a reading of this decision it appears to the Board of Tax Appeals that the provisions of Section 5705.31 (D), Revised Code, which provides for mandated levies within the 10 mill limitation for those subdivisions or taxing units which were in existence during the years 1929 through 1933, are now meaningless. Obviously the Cambridge City School District as it now exists, following its voluntary acceptance of territory of the Liberty-Wheeling Local School District, is not the same subdivision or taxing unit as it was in the years 1929 through 1933 and which must have been the one referred to in Section 5705.31 (D), Revised Code. We therefore do not agree with the Guernsey County Court of Appals but we recognize that we have no choice but to follow the decision of said court above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">The parties in interest have waived oral hearing in this matter and have filed the following stipulation of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-13\">\u201cThe following facts are hereby agreed and stipulated by and between counsel as the relevant and material facts in the ahoy e-cap tioned matter, and are hereby submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>to the Board of Tax Appeals to be made a part of the record, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">\u201cAt the General Election held in November of 1964, a question was submitted to the electors of Liberty-Wheeling Local School District, Guernsey County, Ohio, pursuant to Section 3311.321, Revised Code, proposing the attachment of the southern portion of said school district to Cambridge City School District. Following a majority affirmative vote on said issue, the Guernsey County Board of Education, according to law, on June 6,1965, formally proposed the attachment of the territory to the City School District, effective July 1, 1965. On or about June 29, 1965, the City School District, by resolution, formally accepted the proposed attachment of territory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">\u201cThe minimum guaranteed tax levies within the ten-mill limitation resulting from the application of the formula set forth in Section 5705.31, Revised Code, for the subdivisions involved in this appeal are as follows, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACm\">Cambridge City School District 4.40 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">County of Guernsey 2.50 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">City of Cambridge 2.80 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Township of Cambridge 0.10 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">Liberty-Wheeling Local School District 4.00 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYz\">\u201cFor many years prior to the tax year 1966, the above mentioned subdivisions had been allocated the rates of tax with the ten mill limitation, to-wit: following</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">Cambridge City School District 4.40 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">County of Guernsey 3.00 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">City of Cambridge 2.50 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">Township of Cambrdige 0.10 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-14\">Liberty-Wheeling Local School Dist. 4.00 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A01\">\u201cFollowing the attachment of the territory to the City School District as above-mentioned, on or about December 11,1965, the Guernsey County Budget Commission certified the following rates for said sub-divisions within the ten mill limitation for the tax year 1966, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-15\">Cambridge City School District 4.00 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-16\">County of Guernsey 3.00 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-17\">City of Cambridge 2.90 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-18\">Township of Cambridge 0.10 mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201cFrom the above-mentioned action of the budget commission setting rates for the tax year 1966, the Cambridge City School District perfected an appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals (Case No. 60397), and following a hearing this board, on April 12,1966, affirmed and approved the action of the Guernsey County Budget Commission in setting the rates as above-mentioned. From the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals, the Cambrdige City School District perfected an appeal to the Court of Appeals, Fifth District, Guernsey County, Ohio (Case No. 406), and that court, on July 21, 1967, in a decision reported in 11 Ohio App. 2d 77, reversed the decision of this board as being contrary to law and entered judgment that the City School District, under the circumstances of the case, must be allocated millage inside the ten mill limitation at the rate of 4.40, being former guaranteed rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">\u2018 \u2018 On September 30, 1966, the Guernsey County Budget Commission certified tax rates within the ten mill limitation for the tax year 1967, identical to the rates certified for the tax year 1966, as above set forth. On November 7, 1966, the City School District perfected this appeal to the Board of Tax Appeals. It is the action of the budget commission setting rates for the tax year 1967 which is presently before this board for review, however, the questions and issues presented are identical to those presented in Case Number 60397 before this board as above-mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u201cTaxes for the tax year 1966, and up to the present time in the current tax year (1967) have been collected and disbursed to the sub-divisions at the rates certified by the Guernsey County Budget Commission, as set forth above.

If the rate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>County of Guernsey is lowered by 0.40 mills the county will receive revenues of approximately $34,000.00 less per year than before such rate reduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">\u201cThis concludes the stipulation of fact in this case, by and between the undersigned counsel of record for certain of the parties herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Giving effect to the opinion of the Guernsey County Court of Appeals, as reported in 11 Ohio App. 2d 77, the Board of Tax Appeals, acting under the pertinent provisions of Section 5705.37, Revised Code, herewith determines that the following millage within the ten-mill constitutional limitation be levied for the tax year 1966 for the several political subdivisions and taxing units having property within the geographical limits of the Cambridge City School District, as it now exists, following its receipt of territory formerly belonging to Liberty-Wheeling Local School District:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">Political Subdivision</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">or Taxing Unit Mills</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">Guernsey County 2.60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">Cambridge Township .10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">Cambridge City Sch.
