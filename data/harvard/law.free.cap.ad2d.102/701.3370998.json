H We affirm the order dismissing the complaint for the reasons stated by Special Term. We also note that the recorded telephone conversation of January 13,1983 is not a note or memorandum in writing subscribed by the defendant in compliance with subdivision a of section 5-701 of the General Obligations Law.

J., Carro, Milonas and Alexander, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b733-6\">Kupferman, J., dissents in part in a memorandum as follows:</author>\n<p id=\"AxRn\">I dissent in part and would modify the judgment of Special Term to the extent of reinstating plaintiff-appellant Senders\u2019 third cause of action seeking specific performance of a contract to purchase an automobile for her, and otherwise affirm. 11 The purpose of section 5-701 of the General Obligations Law, the Statute of Frauds provision, is \u201cto prevent the perpetration of fraud by assertion of claims not evidenced by a written agreement or by a note or memorandum containing essential terms of the contract between the parties\u201d. <em>(DFI Communications v Greenberg, </em>51 AD2d 403, 405, citing <em>Cohon &amp; Co. v Russell, </em>23 NY2d 569, 574.) Here, the record indicates that Bonders tape-recorded a telephone conversation she had with defendant-respondent Roosevelt on January 13, 1983. During the conversation, Roosevelt made the following statement: \u201cDo you want me to buy you a car? All right I\u2019ll buy you a car.\u201d Although this promise was never embodied in a written contract, a tape recording is of such a permanent nature that it can serve the same purpose and, in so doing, satisfy the Statute of Frauds. Analogously, at least one other jurisdiction has held that a radio broadcast of a taped sermon containing defamatory remarks satisfied the writing requirement for stating a cause of action in libel, rather than slander. (See <em>First Ind. Baptist Church v Southerland, </em>373 So 2d 647 [Ala]; see, also, <em>Parkman v Hastings, </em>259 Ark 59; <em>Shor v Billingsley, 4 </em>Misc 2d 857, affd 4 AD2d 1017; Restatement, Torts 2d, \u00a7 568, Comment <em>d.) </em>Moreover, even if a tape recording does not satisfy the writing requirement of the Statute of Frauds, Roosevelt\u2019s promise to buy Bonders an automobile is a contract which could be performed within one year from its making and thus is not subject to a Statute of Frauds defense. (General Obligations Law, \u00a7 5-701, subd a, par 1; <em>see Polykoff Adv. v Houbigant, Inc., </em>43 NY2d 921.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
