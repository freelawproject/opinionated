We hold the Government\u2019s filing was timely and thus affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-4\">For certain drug offenders with two pri- or felony drug offenses, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) prescribes a mandatory minimum life sentence. To trigger application of that mandatory minimum, the Government must file \u201cbefore trial, or before entry of a plea of guilty ... an information ... stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such filing serves \u201cto allow the defendant to contest the accuracy of the information\u201d and \u201cto allow [the] defendant to have ample time to determine whether to enter a plea or go to trial and plan his trial strategy with full knowledge of the consequences of a potential guilty verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>59 F.3d 1180, 1185 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">In this case, the Government filed the statutorily required information during the plea hearing on March 16,1998. Duffy argues the Government\u2019s March 16 filing was not \u201cbefore entry of a plea of guilty,\u201d as required by \u00a7 851, because Duffy had already filed a \u201cNotice of Entry of Plea of Guilty\u201d on March 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">We hold that the Government\u2019s filing the information during the plea hearing, prior to the district court\u2019s acceptance of Duffy\u2019s guilty plea, complied with \u00a7 851\u2019s requirement that the information be filed \u201cbefore entry of a plea of guilty.\u201d On March 13, Duffy filed a unilateral, non-negotiated \u201cNotice of Entry of Plea of Guilty.\u201d' However, Duffy\u2019s \u201centry of a plea of guilty\u201d occurred not on March 13 when he filed this unilateral notice but on March 16 at the plea hearing, after the Court\u2019s Rule 11 colloquy advising him of his rights. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(g) (referring to the plea hearing as \u201cthe proceedings at which the defendant enters a plea\u201d). The Government complied with the notice provision by filing its information before that entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-9\">Our definition of \u201centry of a plea of guilty\u201d comports with the statute\u2019s purpose that the Government provide information in time to inform the defendant\u2019s ultimate plea decision. During a plea hearing, the defendant is advised of many factors that may impact his plea. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c). Through the course of such hearing, the defendant enjoys a continuing unfettered right to plead not guilty. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(3) (mandating that the court inform the defendant \u201cthat the defendant has the right to plead not guilty\u201d). <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e) (setting forth the limited circumstances in which a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea after the court accepts the plea). At Duffy\u2019s plea hearing, for instance, the court explained that the Government\u2019s \u00a7 851 information, if accepted, would result in a mandatory minimum life sentence. Duffy affirmed that he understood. The court also specifically informed Duffy of his right to plead not guilty and go to trial. It was only after a lengthy colloquy and full disclosure of the impact of the Government\u2019s \u00a7 851 information that the court accepted Duffy\u2019s guilty plea. Thus, the Government\u2019s filing the information during the plea hearing, while Duffy still could plead not guilty, assured that Duffy was sufficiently informed before he had to make the final decision about his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-10\">Duffy urges us to treat his unilateral, non-negotiated \u201cNotice of Entry of Plea of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>Guilty,\u201d filed March 13, as an \u201centry of a plea of guilty\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 851. For Duffy\u2019s notice to be an \u201centry,\u201d the \u201centry\u201d described in \u00a7 851 would have to be something capable of occurring outside the plea hearing. The best support for that understanding of \u201centry,\u201d (although not espoused by Duffy), derives from the second sentence of the controlling notice provision, which re-uses the phrase \u201centry of a plea of guilty\u201d and treats \u201centry\u201d as distinct from \u201cthe taking of the plea of guilty\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-4\">Upon a showing by the United States attorney that facts regarding prior convictions could not with due diligence be obtained prior to trial or before <em>entry of a plea of guilty, </em>the court may postpone the trial or the <em>taking of the plea of guilty </em>for a reasonable period for the purpose of obtaining such facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1) (emphasis added). Congress\u2019s use of two different terms\u2014 \u201centry\u201d and \u201ctaking\u201d of a plea \u2014 raises the issue of whether the two terms carry two different meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">However, even assuming arguendo \u201centry\u201d and \u201ctaking\u201d are distinct actions, they are not necessarily distinct events. The defendant enters a plea, while the court takes a plea. The \u201centry\u201d and \u201ctaking\u201d in this case, even if distinct actions, both occurred at the plea hearing after the required Rule 11 colloquy. The second sentence of the controlling notice provision speaks of the court postponing \u201cthe taking of the plea of guilty\u201d merely because the taking is the court\u2019s part in the bilateral entry/taking event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">Additionally, we observe that the second sentence allows postponement of the taking of the plea but does not set a new deadline for the Government\u2019s filing in cases of such postponement. Indeed, the statute does not say that when the court postpones the taking of the plea, the Government must file its information before the taking of the plea. Instead, even in cases of postponement, the Government must file its information before the entry of a plea. That is possible only because postponing the taking of the plea also necessarily postpones the entry of that plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-9\">Based on this understanding of \u201centry\u201d and \u201ctaking,\u201d Duffy\u2019s unilateral, non-negotiated \u201cNotice of Entry of Plea of Guilty,\u201d does not constitute \u201centry of a plea of guilty\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 851. Instead, both the \u201centry\u201d and the \u201ctaking\u201d of Duffy\u2019s plea occurred at the plea hearing after the required Rule 11 colloquy. The Government complied with the notice provision by filing its information before Duffy entered his plea at the plea hearing, and Duffy\u2019s March 13 statement purporting to plead guilty does not affect the timeliness of the Government\u2019s information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">As noted above, \u00a7 851 does provide defendants with an opportunity to challenge. the Government\u2019s filing. A defendant may deny or challenge the validity of a prior conviction and file a written response to the Government\u2019s information, at which point \u201cthe court shall hold a hearing.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(c). However, the defendant\u2019s response and any appropriate hearing need not occur before the trial or guilty plea; instead, \u00a7 851(a) sets that deadline only for the Government\u2019s informing the defendant of the previous convictions. For that reason, in <em>United States v. Rice, </em>43 F.3d 601 (11th Cir.1995), we held the Government\u2019s information was timely even though it was filed the day trial began, preventing the defendant from filing a response prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-11\">Because the Government\u2019s information was timely filed before entry of Duffy\u2019s guilty plea, the resultant increased sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1342-16\">. Duffy also argues that (1) the district court erred in finding it lacked authority to depart downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance to federal authorities; (2) the government acted in bad faith in not filing a motion for downward departure based on substantial assistance; and (3) the district court erred in holding that it lacked authority to depart downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 because of Duffy's substantial assistance to non-federal authorities. As to these issues, we find no reversible error and affirm without opinion. <em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 36-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">. The relevant subsection provides as follows: (1) No person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions, unless before trial, or before entry of a plea of guilty, the United States attorney files an information with the court (and serves a copy of such information on the person or counsel for the person) stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon. Upon a showing by the United States attorney that facts regarding prior convictions could not with due diligence be obtained prior to trial or before entry of a plea of guilty, the court may postpone the-trial or the taking of the plea of guilty for a reasonable period for the purpose of obtaining such facts. Clerical mistakes in the. information may be amended at any time prior to the pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AV0\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
