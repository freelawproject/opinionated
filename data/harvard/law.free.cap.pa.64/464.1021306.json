The defendant objected to its admission on the ground that it had been altered since its execution. The evidence was admitted and a bill of exceptions sealed.

Boardman, Esq., Dear Sir: \u2014 I have been expecting to hear from you in relation to delivery of deed and other papers left with you as between John McGraw and myself, in connection with lands in Tioga county, Pa., to perfect title against F. Barcalow\u2019s fraudulent mortgage, as per agreement. Having paid the note at your bank, and all now due, except the joint mortgage, which is abundant security for all unpaid, I can see no good reason for holding said deed and papers longer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-10\">The plaintiff testified, under objection and exception, that at the execution of the contract of January 23d 1864: \u201c The word \u2018 original\u2019 in the contract was interlined by Judge Williams, at my request. Mr. Sherwood, Mr. Williams, Mr. Foster and myself were present. Was inserted before the contract was executed. There was a discussion in regard to what indebtedness would be intended, if the contract were executed as first drawn by Mr. Williams ; that it might be construed as the amount inserted in the contract, if the payments were not made as specified; and the word \u2018 original\u2019 was interlined, so that there would be no inference that the payments made should apply on the amount included in the contract, if not made according to the contract, but upon the $13,000 and over, the whole indebtedness. The stipulations were not made according to the contract of 23d January 1864.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-11\">He further testified, under objection and exception: \u201cThe agreement between Mr. Foster and myself was, that the younger claims were to be paid first; the $3000 note and mortgage given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>by Barcalow on his undivided half of the property. * * * The agreement that the payments made were to apply on the younger \u25a0 claims, existed before and after .the contract of 23d January 1864.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">The defendant gave evidence contradictory of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to the occurrences at the execution of the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s 2d point was:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-8\">\u201c That if neither the debtor nor the creditor made application of the payments, then the law applies them upon that debt which is most beneficial to the creditor and the least secured; and that if the jury believe the evidence, the note and the younger mortgage of this property against A. H. Foster were least secured, and therefore the payments should apply on them, and not upon the joint mortgage in controversy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-9\">To which the court replied: \u201c If neither Foster nor McGraw applied them, then the law applies them on those debts which are least secure; and if the jury believe the evidence, then the note and latest mortgage were least secure, and the payments are applied, under the legal rule, on them, and not on the joint mortgage in suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-10\">The defendant\u2019s points with their answers were as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-11\">1. \u201c The contract of 1864 being clear and explicit in its terms, must be construed by the court, and cannot be altered or its construction affected by extrinsic evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-12\">Answer: \u201c The contract of January 23d 1864, may not be regarded as very ambiguous, but it is not so clear and explicit in all its points as not to be susceptible of explanation by the parties to it; and although they differ in their construction of the clause in it which I regard as somewhat ambiguous, their evidence confirms me in the construction I have given it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-13\">3. <em>\u201c </em>The term \u2018 original indebtedness, \u2019 employed in the contract of 1864, must be held to refer to the instruments, which were the original subject of negotiations in the contract of 1861, and the original charges upon defendants\u2019 lands, namely, this mortgage and the mortgage of August 1st 1857.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-14\">Answer: \u201c The expression <em>\u2018 </em>original indebtedness,\u2019 employed in said contract, refers to the whole indebtedness of Foster to Mc-Graw existing at the date of said contract, which, as shown by the evidence, was upwards of $13,000, and was compromised at $11,000, payable in the manner specified in the contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-15\">4. <em>\u201c </em>All payments made upon the contract of 1864, are now to be applied upon said instrument of \u2018 original indebtedness\u2019; and as the mortgage upon which this suit is brought is the oldest mortgage, the payments are to be. applied upon it till it is paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-16\">Answer: \u201c All the payments made by him to McGraw since its execution, including the cash in hand $2000 payment, are to be applied on the whole indebtedness of Foster to McGraw existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>at the time; and neither debtor nor creditor having made a special application of them, the law applies them on debts which are least secure, and not on the mortgage-debt in suit, which is most secure.\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AUZ\">March 21st 1870,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-6\">6. \u201c The letter of Poster, bearing date March 14th 1865, to Boardman, cannot be so construed as to change the application of the money previously paid, contrary to the agreement of 1864, nor different from its application as expressed in the receipts given at the time the money was paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-7\">Answer: \u201c The letter of Poster, dated March 14th 1865, was not designed to change the application of the payments as made previously, but concludes him from denying that they were applicable in the manner alleged by the plaintiff, and not on the joint mortgage, and shows that he assented to such application.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-8\">The verdict was for the plaintiff for $6336.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-9\">The defendant took out a writ of error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-10\">The 1st, 2d and 3d assignments of error were to the admission of the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-11\">The 4th, the answer to the plaintiff s point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-12\">The 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th, the answers to the defendant\u2019s points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-13\"><em>M.

The deed or a copy might show conclusively or apparently tiiat the matter alleged was written in the deed before execution. The court must judge of the due proof of the execution of a deed, but when duly executed, the question of alteration or addition afterwards is generally a question for the jury: Heffelfinger <em>v. </em>Shutz, 16 S. &amp; R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>44; Simpson <em>v. </em>Stackhouse, 9 Barr 186. There was no error in the admission of the evidence contained in the 2d assignment of error. The evidence proposed was of what occurred at the execution of the paper, for the purpose of enabling the court to read the paper in the light of the circumstances, and not to prove that the word \u201c original,\u201d inserted at the instance of McGraw, had a different meaning from its ordinary signification. The evidence of the circumstances attending the execution of a paper, and what the parties said while engaged in the act of execution, are often very material in enabling the court to understand the contract, and to give a proper interpretation to it. This is received on the principle of explanation merely, not to alter or vary the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Nor was there error in receiving the evidence set forth in the Sd assignment of error. An agreement before or at the time of the written agreement of 23d January 1864, to apply the payments of Foster to the younger claims of the plaintiff, was not inconsistent with the terms of the written agreement. The purpose of that agreement was to settle and fix a specific sum which McGraw agreed to accept in full satisfaction of his claims on the real estate in Middlebury, provided this sum was paid according to the terms of the agreement. The order in which the instalments should be applied to these claims was not provided for in the agreement. It was therefore competent for the parties to be guided in the application of the payment by another agreement. The only language in the written agreement affecting this question is that part which provides that if the money to be paid under the contract should not be paid within the time specified, the money paid in hand shall \u201c apply on the <em>original indebtedness </em>of said Foster to said McGraw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">If the words <em>\u201c </em>original indebtedness\u201d mean <em>oldest </em>indebtedness, as contended for by the defendant below, it would change the case, but we think that the learned judge below gave these words their true interpretation, and this leads us to dispose of the remaining assignment of error. The purpose of the agreement being to accept a less sum than Foster actually owed McGraw, provided the money should be paid promptly, according to the terms of the writing, the next thing to be provided for was the failure of Foster to pay according to these terms after he had made the first payment in hand, and this provision evidently was that the payment so made should then apply on the indebtedness of Foster, as it stood originally, before the reduction made upon it by the writing. It was simply to say, on part of McGraw to Foster, if you fail to comply with the terms of prompt payment, as required by our agreement, then we shall stand as we stood before, and what you pay will apply to my claims as they existed before we entered into this bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"AGma\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>This being the true meaning of the terms original indebtedness, and the agreement not having provided for the order of application, the case then stood on the question of actual application. The defendant proved no application by himself to either mortgage, so that the application was to be made to the junior mortgage, if the evidence of the plaintiff were believed, and even this became immaterial, for if no actual application had been agreed upon, as contended by the plaintiff, to the junior mortgage, still the application would be made to it by the law, on the ground that it was the least secure, both in point of time and quantity of property: Johnson\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 268; Pierce <em>v. </em>Sweet, 9 Casey 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Upon the whole, we discover no error, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
