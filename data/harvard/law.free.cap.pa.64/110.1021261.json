R. Raiguel, against Mary A. McGrath, defendant, and Charles Magee, C. 0. Swope, J. R. Hicks and Isaiah Hicks, trading as Magee, Hicks &amp; Co., and Charles Magee, garnishees. The attachment was issued September 26th 1868; it was not served on Magee, but was served on the other garnishees. The attachment was designed to charge the garnishees with certain goods of the defendant, McGrath, that had in August 1865, come to their storehouse. At the time the goods came to the store of the garnishees, the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff and to several other persons. She afterward confessed to the plaintiffs the judgment on which the attachment was issued. There was evidence that the defendant had a dry good store, that in the summer of 1865 it was closed, that the goods in it were removed in a manner calculated to arouse suspicion, that some of them went to the store of the garnishees and others elsewhere; that Magee was at the store very frequently shortly before closing it and after-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>wards, in consultation apparently with the defendant, and that he attended to the removal of the goods. There was evidence also that Swope, another of the garnishees, was there occasionally at the same time, gave directions with regard to some of the goods and packed some of them in boxes. The garnishees gave evidence that the defendant was very largely indebted to Magee, that the goods were delivered to him in payment of the indebtedness, that many other persons, had obtained judgments and laid attachments on property in the hands of the garnishees before the attachment in this case; that they were taken to the store-house of the garnishees by order of defendant\u2019s father, and that Magee objected to their coming in. The evidence on each side was quite voluminous and was of the same general character as that given above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">During the trial the garnishees offered to prove by W. Gaw \u201c that the defendant, Mary A. McGrath, before the issuing of the plaintiff\u2019s attachment in this case, admitted to him that the said goods had been sent to Charles Magee, and not to Magee, Hicks &amp; Co., and that Magee, Hicks &amp; Co. had no money or goods of hers in their hands, possession, or control.\u201d The offer was rejected by the court and a bill of exceptions was sealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-7\">The garnishees\u2019 7th point was: \u201c The plaintiffs must prove property of Mary McGrath in the hands of Magee, Hicks &amp; Co., over and above all previous attachments and just' debts due by her to them at the time of the service of the writ in this case, to wit, September 26th 1868; and should they'find less property in their hands than the amount of her debt to Charles Magee, or if more than her debt then less than her debt together with previous attachments, then the verdict must be for the defendants.\u201d The point was affirmed with this qualification; \u201c that if the jury should find that Magee\u2019s conduct was calculated to put creditors off their guard as to the defendant\u2019s goods, that he was guilty of a fraud, the garnishees would not be entitled to credit for the goods alleged to have been received from her on account of his debt, even if said goods were received by him in payment thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-8\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs against the garnishees for $1261.09. On the removal of the case to the Supreme Court, the garnishees assigned for error the rejection of their offer of evidence and the answer to their 7th point.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-9\"><em>T.

This is the general rule, and if they are to be excluded in certain excepted cases, then the offer of the evidence must appear affirmatively to be brought within them. The offer in the case before us was to prove a declaration of the defendant before the issuing of the plaintiff\u2019s attachment, and to reject it was error, although upon examination of the witness it might have turned out to be inadmissible from circumstances not stated in the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">In French <em>v. </em>Breidelman, 2 Grant\u2019s Cases 319, Judge Lowrie, delivering the opinion of the court, said \u201c The Execution Act of 1836, sec. 35, allows an execution attachment to issue to reach debts due to the defendant, or deposits of money made, or goods pawned pledged, or demised by him; and the main question of the present cause is, is this an appropriate writ under the Act to the case of a sale of a store of goods, in fraud of creditors, where the fraudulent vendee has sold part, and has the rest on hand. We think it is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">In Tams <em>v. </em>Richards, 2 Casey 97, the same learned judge said: \u201cIt is certainly very plain that the service of the execution attachment on William Tams rendered him liable to account to that execution creditor for all the property of John Tams, which he had then obtained in fraud of creditors, up to the amount of that creditor\u2019s claim. It would be no defence to William Tams that he had lost a part of the property or intrusted it to the care of others or sold it, and had not yet received payment. That he had received it in fraud of creditors was a sufficient basis for the demand, that he should deliver it up or account to them for the value of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">This is sound doctrine, and we do not intend to disturb it, but we do not think the observation of the learned judge, in his answer to the defendant\u2019s seventh point, comes within the rule of these cases. It assumes that there was a debt due from the defendant to Magee, and that the goods attached were received by him in payment thereof, but that if Magee\u2019s conduct was calculated to put creditors off their guard as to the defendant\u2019s goods, he was guilty of fraud, and the garnishees should not be entitled to credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>for these goods. This cannot be the law, and we are inclined to think there was some misapprehension in the hurry of the trial, or that the meaning of the learned judge has not been very clearly expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
