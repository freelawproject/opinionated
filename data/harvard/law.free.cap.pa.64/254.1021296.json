McCalla, administrator, &amp;c., of W. L. Stickney, deceased, with notice to the terretenants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-8\">The mortgage and the bond accompanying it were dated in February 1839 ; the bond was conditioned for the payment of \u201c $5000 lawful silver money of the United States, on February 26th 1840, together with lawful interest for the same, to be paid half-yearly.\u201d McCalla himself became the owner of the land covered by the mortgage in January 1869. On the 17th of September 1869, McCalla, as terre-tenant, filed an afSdavit of defence, \u201c that he purchased said property at sheriff\u2019s sale in January last, subject to a mortgage of $5000. That the interest on said mortgage had been paid and received in legal tender notes of the United States for several years before his said purchase, and that shortly after his purchase he received a note from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, that payment must be made of the principal. That on the 25th day of January last, he paid to plaintiff\u2019s attorney the six months\u2019 interest which fell due on January 1st 1869, by a cheek upon the Western National Bank, which was paid in legal tender notes, and obtained his receipt for said six months\u2019 interest. That he asked for delay in the payment of the principal, which was granted till May; and it was understood and agreed that the principal should then be paid in legal tender notes, and that no demand for silver or specie was then made or any intimation that it would be required.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-9\">A rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence was made absolute, and the debt was assessed, September 21st 1869, at $5216.66 \u201clawful silver money of the United States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-10\">On a writ of error by the terre-tenant, the error assigned was that the judgment was entered \u201cin silver money,\u201d &amp;c., and not generally.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-11\"><em>W.

One executory agreement cannot be substituted for another, unless the security be of a higher degree. Mere readiness to perform, or even tender of performance, is insufficient: Diller <em>v. </em>Brubaker, 2 P. F.

If he had there might be something in the argument, that the terms of the original mortgage were changed by an agreement on sufficient consideration. Even then it may well be doubted whether an attorney at law could bind his client by such an engagement. All that' is said is \u201c that he asked for delay, which was granted till May, and that it was understood and agreed that the principal should then be paid in legal tender notes.\u201d The subject was the mortgage which was payable in silver, and upon the true construction of the affidavit, the agreement was that the mortgage should be payable in legal tender notes, not that the terre-tenant would personally pay it. This was clearly without any consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">According to the principle of Bronson <em>v. </em>Rodes, 7 Wallace 229, the judgment of the court for the principal in lawful silver money of the United States in the terms of the mortgage was right. And that the interest must be in the same kind of money as the principal is very plain. Lawful interest is six per centum of the principal in whatever money the principal is payable, for it follows the principal as the shadow does the substance.. Instead of the rule being that the interest must he made payable <em>\u201c </em>in like lawful money,\u201d though those words are sometimes introduced <em>ex majori cautela, </em>it is evident that unless the contrary is expressed it is a mere proportion of the principal debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
