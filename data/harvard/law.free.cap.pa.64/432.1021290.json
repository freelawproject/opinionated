The premises claimed in the writ were an undivided sixteenth part of a piece of land in the city of Scranton, containing 40 acres. The premises had originally been the property of Thomas Griffin, who, by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>will, dated March 27th 1852, and proved April 3d 1854, devised them to his daughter Letta, adding to the devising clause, \u201c The said daughter Letta is to have the said lands, &amp;c., in fee simple for ever, without any entailment whatever.\u201d Letta Griffin, the devisee, by her will, dated September 22d 1862, and provedApril 24th 1867, gave legacies to the children of her sister Charlotte, amongst whom was Mrs. Ruland, the plaintiff, to whom she gave $100. She disposed of the residue of her estate as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\"><em>\u201c </em>It is my will and wish that Charlotte Church, the youngest daughter of my said sister Charlotte, should have the residue of all my property, real, personal and mixed; and I do give and bequeath the same to her, subject to the payment of the foregoing bequests and debts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-7\">The residuary devisee was the defendant in this case. The sister Charlotte\u2019s married name was Stevens. The plaintiffs alleged that Thomas Griffin had devised the 40 acres to his daughter Letta, at her solicitation and on her pledge; that after her death the one-half should go to the children of her sister Charlotte.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-8\">The cause was tried, November 15th 1869, before Conyngham,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-9\">Thomas Griffin, a brother of Letta Griffin, the last devisor, testified that in 1853, Letta and her father being together, the father <em>\u201c </em>said Letta had prevailed on him, that he did not put it into the will, and said that he wanted to make another will. Then Letta said, Father, I will do just as I have agreed with you. Then father replied, I am afraid you won\u2019t do it. Then Letta says, Father, I will do just as you have said about the. property. Then father said, Now we 'wfilll call you for a witness. Now the one-half of this tract of land you can have in trust for your lifetime, and at your death, you see, it is equally divided among Charlotte\u2019s children. Yes, Letta says, I will do so. Then father says, Now, Tom, I want you to remember this. That was all that was said. They were talking about the land he had willed to Letta; was the same land. He called me as a witness for the will to remain as it was, and the Stevens heirs to have one-half of the land at her death. He said Letta had persuaded him not to put this in the will for the Stevens children, and she would do it.\u201d The witness further testified that the father said frequently after this, in the presence of Letta, that Charlotte\u2019s children were to have one-half of the land, and that since his death Letta had often told him that she held one-half the land in trust for her sister- Charlotte\u2019s children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-10\">Henry Griffin, a nephew of old Mr. Griffin, testified \u201c that he went to see him about 1852 or 1853; the old gentleman went out of the house. Letta then says, We have been having a pretty hot time here for a while. Says I, What is up ? She says, I have got father to change his will; that she told him she would not keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>house for him; she would not stand it unless he had his will changed ; she had got-it now changed about as she wanted it; she had got her brother Ren out of the will as one of the executors, and Randall in his place. Then she went on to say that she had prevailed on her father to will Lotty\u2019s right to her for her use during her life, and her father was very much dissatisfied about it, and he would be in pretty soon, and something would be said about it. About that time it appeared he had been at the door and overheard some of it; he came in and was pretty angry. Walked the floor, stamped his cane, and said he wouldn\u2019t stand it; said it was not his will; it is Letta\u2019s will. Then Letta said, I\u2019ll leave it to Henry, and let me tell my story. She then went on and told what trouble she had had in bringing up that child Lotty Church. Spoke of restless nights and trouble, and she thought she ought for this to have her sister\u2019s share during her life. * * Uncle Tom said he wanted them to have it after his death; they never had anything, and he wanted them to have it. He says, I am afraid, Henry, she won\u2019t do it. I says, Yes, Uncle Tom, she will; she has told me so to-day that. she would do it. Then, says he, Henry, I want you to see that it is done. I said I didn\u2019t know but that I should be dead. Said he didn\u2019t like it the way it was; said he didn\u2019t want it that way, as it would give the chance for a lawsuit; that he would not then disturb the will; would leave it alone for awhile and think of it. That was about all. Some months after that I stopped to see her again, and he began to talk about it in Letta\u2019s presence. She says, Now, father, Henry knows all about it; you must be crazy; he says, I know that. She says, Didn\u2019t you talk it over with Thomas and Ferdinand Yan Storch, a few days ago, and call them up as witnesses to the agreement we had made concerning the will of this property ? He said, That is just what I am coming at. Now, says he, Letta is to have the use of this property; one-half of it don\u2019t belong to her; one-half is hers to have the use of it during her life, and then the one-half is to go to the Stevens heirs. She said she was going to give it all to them. He says, Maybe not in the way I want to give it; maybe you may give it all to one or two of them, as you may like. She said she would give it to all of them. He said he wanted it understood that one-half she had nothing to do with; it must be equally awarded among them; that with the other part she might do what she pleased. She might give it in the family or out of the family; didn\u2019t care what she did with it. She said she would do as she had agreed, and Thomas and Ferdinand Yan Storch called as witnesses.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">Sarah A.

She said that she and her father had an understanding that the portion belong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ing to the heirs of Charlotte should remain in Letta\u2019s hands until Letta\u2019s death, and then go to Charlotte\u2019s children. Charlotte Church and Letta, talking about the heirs and the will in my presence, said that the Stevens^ heirs were dissatisfied; that she had beard that they threatened to break the will of her father Thomas. She said that they must wait; that they would have their mother\u2019s portion when she was done with it. She had promised her father that at her death she would secure to the heirs of Charlotte Stevens the portion that belonged to their mother. The same conversation was frequently talked over in the presence of Charlotte Church and Letta Griffin. Some of these conversations took place after Charlotte married Church, in the presence of Charlotte Church,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">McKiel Stevens testified:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">\u201c Old Thomas Griffin was my grandfather. My mother\u2019s name was Charlotte;\u2019she has been dead about 28 years, perhaps <em>SO </em>years. I have a suit for my portion of this land. I had conversations with my aunt Letta; the first conversation soon after grandfather\u2019s death; was in the same spring. She said, that grandfather had left one portion to her for her lifetime, and then was to be given up to us. On another occasion she told me she had been offered $300 or $350 per acre for it, and wanted to know if I thought she had better sell it for that. * * * On the next occasion she told me she had sold it for $500 per acre to Edmund Griffin, The next conversation I remember, I received a letter from her, and went to see her. Edmund Griffin had failed to make payments, and he had threatened to keep her out of her property during her lifetime, and wanted I should take hold of it and try to get the property back into her hands. She said she had given up the bond to him, and only held the mortgage, and wanted me to come to Wilkesbarre, and see Lawyer Dana, her counsel, as to what could be done. She said, Do not leave a stone unturned; the property belongs to you children; it was left to me by your grandfather for you children. I came to Wilkesbarre and saw Lawyer Dana. Some time elapsed and she sent for me again, and wanted me to come to Wilkesbarre. Said she wanted me to work as if working for myself, for the property belongs to you heirs. She said if she got the property back into her hands she would sell it again, if I thought best, for $500 per acre. She would have the payments so made that out of the first payment she would try to have it so she could let the heirs have $500 each, and that as the payments fell due she would divide it among them with the exception of what she wanted for her own use. She never said to me that she had used any influence with her father to make the will.

Was present at conversation between father and sister Letta about this property in the latter part of August 1853. Ferdinand Yan Storch was called as a witness between my father and sister Letta. My father appeared agitated. He spoke to Ferdinand, and said, I am glad you are come; I am going to make another will. This brought my sister Letta to the door. Then she spoke and said, father thinks all the time I would not give Lotty\u2019s children their mother\u2019s property. Then she called Ferdinand Yan Storch for a witness. Then father spoke: Letta is to have one-half of this property, or her children and I want you to remember this ; the children are to have it at Letta\u2019s death.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-6\">Charlotte West testified:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-7\">\u201c I am no relative to these parties. Letta came into my house, shortly after her father\u2019s death, and said her father had willed her 40 acres of land, and the house. She said, The half of it belongs to my sister; she mentioned her portion. I promised father, when he made his will, that the half of his property should be divided amongst my sister\u2019s children, as she never had anything, and she said, I can do with my half as I please.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-8\">The other children of Charlotte Stevens testified that Letta had declared to them that under the arrangement with her father, they, the children of Charlotte were to have one-half the property on Letta\u2019s death. There was other testimony also of the same character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-9\">The defendants gave in evidence, a deed dated August 19th 1856, from Letta Griffin to Edmund Griffin for 19 acres, part of the 40 acres; judgment in her favor against Edmund and sale to her by the sheriff of the same land. They gave evidence of the instructions given by Thomas Griffin as to drawing his will, in which nothing was said about Letta\u2019s agreement, and in which he told his counsel specifically to insert the clause which declared she should have the land \u201cwithout any entailment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-10\">There was much other evidence on the part of the defendants for the purpose of showing that there was no arrangement such as would affect Letta vyith a trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-11\">A number of points were submitted by each of the parties:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-12\">By plaintiffs, amongst others :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-13\">5. If Letta Griffin, at the time she made a conveyance of a part of the land in dispute to Edmund Griffin, held the undivided one-half part of that land in trust for the heirs of Charlotte Stevens, deceased, coupled with a power to sell the same, and on such sale received from Edmund Griffin part of the purchase-money, and had the balance of the purchase-money secured by bond and mortgage on the land; and afterwards Edmund Griffin failed to pay the balance of the purchase-money so secured, and she obtained judgment against him on said bond, and upon said judgment sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the land at sheriff\u2019s sale, and at such sale bid the same in for a sum less than the debt upon which' it was sold, and had the deed made in her own name, she cannot hold the undivided one-half part of the land that she held in trust for the heirs of Charlotte Stevens, deceased, against their will; but a resulting trust is raised in favor of the said heirs, and Letta Griffin thereupon held the undivided one-half part of said land in trust for the heirs of the said Charlotte Stevens, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-6\">6. If Letta Griffin was a trustee before her sale to Edmund Griffin, and she made the sale to him, taking a bond and mortgage for part of the purchase-money, upon which by suit and judicial sale the land came back to her, she still remained a trustee, and the right of the Stevens heirs would not be divested by reason of such sale; <em>a fortiori </em>is this the case if she consulted with the Stevens heirs in relation to such sale, promising to divide the proceeds when received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-7\">The defendants\u2019 5th and 6th points were:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-8\">5.

That the will of Thomas Griffin, having been duly admitted to probate, and more than two years having elapsed since the 1st day of October 1856, without the plaintiffs having brought their action, and duly pursued it to recover the land in controversy, it is conclusive as to such realty, and the plaintiffs cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-10\">The other points related to the question of the creation of the trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-11\">The court affirmed the plaintiffs\u2019 5th and 6th points, and refused the defendants\u2019 5th and 6th points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-12\">After referring to the evidence and stating the principles of law applicable to the question of parol trusts, Judge Conyngham said:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-13\"><em>\u201c </em>Where an estate is invested in another by will, as in this case, and at the time of the creation of the estate the devise is agreed to be received, and is accepted for the use of another person, either immediately or to commence at a future time, by the agreement and understanding of the parties, the person from whom the estate is to pass, and the one in whom it is to vest, as here Thomas Griffin the elder and his daughter Letta, a valid trust for such other person will be supported and recognised in law, even though it is all dependent upon parol or verbal testimony.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-14\">He further referred to the evidence in connection with the law, and concluded :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-15\"><em>\u201c </em>In all cases of claimed parol trusts, the whole evidence must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>be carefully examined and fully weighed and considered, and the alleged facts must be satisfactorily established in the judgment of the jury, before they can be allowed. It does not depend upon what a jury may think ought to have been done by the grandfather, under the circumstances mentioned, for the benefit of his grandchildren, but what did he do, or what did he leave undone, that he desired to do ? By the will in writing, in plain and clear language, he gave the entire fee simple of tbe property to his daughter Letta, and she and those claiming under her, have the right to ask the court and jury so to hold and decide, unless under the principles already stated, the jury find such a state of the facts fully and clearly proved, as to establish a trust for the one moiety of the trust for the Stevens heirs, as heretofore explained to you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The case, under these rulings, presents a question of fact for you-; you are to judge of the credibility of witnesses, whether they are to be believed or not, whether mistaken or not, and what was the true understanding, in fact agreement, if any, between Letta Griffin and her father as to this property.

But by various Acts of Assembly since 1836, full chancery powers have been conferred on our courts and suitable forms of procedure prescribed. By Act of March 21st 1806, Purd. 41, where 'a remedy is provided or duty enjoined, &amp;c., by an Act of Assembly, the act must be strictly pursued.

Further, Letta\u2019s title is confirmed by the acts of ownership exercised by her, for many years in sight of the cestuis que trust, who, if they could not have taken possession during her life, could have had relief in equity : Hill on Trustees 168 ; Smith <em>v. </em>Clay, Bro.

The trust must under the act be manifested in writing. The proof of what took place at the time the will was made is contrary to the trust, instead of for it. If an agreement was made afterwards, it is <em>nudum pactum </em>\u2014 it is opposed to the policy and letter of the statutes, and is not within any of the modes in which a resulting trust can arise, viz., a purchase is in the name of another; where there is a voluntary conveyance with no trust declared, and where the conveyance is on trusts which are not declared; or are only partially declared or fail. The testator must sufficiently express his intention that the donee should take only in trust for others : Meredith <em>v. </em>Heneage, 1 Sim. 555; Wood <em>v. </em>Cox, 2 M. &amp; Cr. 692.

Before the Statute of Wills, 1 Vict. c. 26, \u00a7 9, chancellors treated resulting trusts upon the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. 2, holding that a statute to <em>prevent </em>frauds must not become an instrument of fraud, they admitted par,ol evidence freely to discover the real intention of the testator, and thus to give his will the very effect he intended it should have.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">2. But since the Statute of Wills, both in England and this country, the field of parol evidence has been greatly narrowed, and is continually narrowing. A testamentary trust, to be made out by parol, must have its root in the will. The instrument, construed by its four corners, must betray the intention of the testator that his donee was to take a qualified interest \u2014 something less than an absolute estate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"Asc\">by Sharswood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKH\">\u2014 It cannot be maintained, at this late day, that the effect of investing the courts with separate equity powers, to be exercised according to the mode of proceeding in use in the English Court of Chancery, was to divest them of any part of the jurisdiction before possessed by them to afford the same relief through common-law .forms. Equity is still as much a part of the law of Pennsylvania as it was in 1787, when Chief Justice McKean so declared it to be in Pollard <em>v. </em>Shaafer, 1 Dall. 210; Lehr <em>v. </em>Beaver, 8 W. &amp; S. 106. The action of ejectment may still be employed as a remedy to compel the specific performance of a contract for the sale of land, or to enforce a trust in regard to it. Every volume of reports since 1836 abounds with the evidence of this in the determination of numerous cases in which it has been silently assumed. Besides, it was expressly so decided in Aycinena <em>v. </em>Peries, 6 W. &amp; S. 257, Biddle <em>v. </em>Moore, 3 Barr 161, and Corson <em>v. </em>Mulvany, 13 Wright 88, so that if any point is ever to be considered completely at rest, it is this. Nor is such an administration of equity justly open to the reproaches cast upon it in the oral argument of this case. It is not the substitution of twelve unlearned chancellors for a lawyer prepared for his office by the lucubrations of twenty year's. The judge in reality is the chancellor with the assistance of a jury. It is not like other ordinary trials at law, where any evidence reasonably tending to prove a fact, must be submitted to be passed upon by that tribunal. The conscience of the judge as chancellor must be satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>fied, and what goes to the jury is to determine the credibility of the witnesses, and to weigh and decide upon the force and effect of conflicting testimony. What is this but the trial of a feigned issue out of chancery ? If the evidence is too vague, uncertain or doubtful to establish the equity set up, even if believed, it is the duty of the judge to withdraw it from the. jury either by a nonsuit or a binding direction in his charge, as the case may require : McBarron <em>v. </em>Glass, 6 Casey 133; Todd <em>v. </em>Campbell, 8 Id. 252; Bennett <em>v. </em>Fulmer, 13 Wright 162; Miller <em>v. </em>Hartle, 3 P. F. Smith 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The assignments of error, fifteen in number, need not be separately considered. The statement of a few well settled principles and rules of decision disposes of them all.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">That a trust <em>ex maleficio </em>is not within the prohibition contained in the 7th section of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries, 29 Car. 2, c. 3, which was .adopted and enacted in this state by the 4th section of the Act of April 22d 1856, Pamph. L. 533, has been the uniform doctrine of the English courts: Hill on Trustees 59, and the cases there cited, to which may be added Plumer <em>v. </em>Reed, 2 Wright 46; Beegle <em>v. </em>Wentz, 5 P. F. Smith 369, decided by this court since the passage- of the Act. Indeed it is not easy to see how such a trust ever could be made out except by parol evidence, and if this is not competent a statute made to prevent frauds would become a most potent instrument whereby to give them success. That this doctrine is applied to cases arising under wills where a person procures a devise to be made in his favor on the distinct declaration or promise that he will hold the land in trust either in whole or in part for another may be seen in the cases referred to in 1 Jarman 356; 1 Story\u2019s Equity, \u00a7 256. It is not | affected by the statutory provisions on the subject of wills. The proof offered is not of any alteration, revocation or cancellation, which must be evidenced in a particular manner. It gives full effect to the will and every word of it, and to the conclusiveness of the probate, where it is conclusive. It fastens upon the conscience of the party, having thus procured a will, and then fraudulently refusing or neglecting to fulfil the promise on the faith of which it was executed, a trust or confidence, which a court of equity will enforce by compelling a conveyance when the proper time for it has arrived; and with us in Pennsylvania such a conveyance will be considered as having actually been made, whenever it ought to have been made. The cestui que trust will be entitled to recover in ejectment against the trustee, and all in privity with him. This was decided in Hoge v. Hoge, 1 Watts 163, a ease fully and ably argued and considered, both by the counsel engaged in the cause and by the court, as appears in the elaborate opinion by Chief Justice Gibson. It was there held' that if a testator be induced to make a devise, by the promise of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>visee that it should be applied to the benefit of another, a trust is thereby created which may be established by parol evidence; and, that this is not contrary to the Statute of Wills. \u201cIt is contended,\u2019 said Gibson, C. J., \u201c that parol evidence of a trust is contrary to our Statute of Wills, which corresponds as far as regards the point in dispute, with the British Statute of Frauds. Undoubtedly every part of a will must be in writing; and a naked parol declaration of trust in respect of land devised, is void. The trust insisted on here, however, owes its validity, not to the will or the declaration of the testator, but to the fraud of the devisee. It belongs to a class in which the trust arises <em>ex </em>maleficio, and in which equity turns the fraudulent procurer of the legal title into a trustee to get at him; and there is nothing in reason or authority to forbid the raising of such a trust, from the surreptitious procurement of a devise.\u201d To the same effect is Jones <em>v. </em>McKee, 3 Barr 496, s. c. 6 Barr 425, a case the same in principle and very similar in its facts to that presented upon this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Was there then given on the trial in the court below such evidence of the procurement of the devise of the land in question upon a promise to hold in part for the benefit of the plaintiffs as ought to induce a chancellor to decree tha enforcement of a trust ? If there was, the case was properly submitted to the jury. Three witnesses, entirely disinterested and occupying the same relation to both parties, testified to conversations between the testator, Thomas Griffin, and his daughter Letta, the devisee named in the will, very soon after its execution. Thomas Griffin asserted and his daughter did not deny but admitted that he had made the devise of the whole tract to her alone in fee, by her persuasion, and under her solemn promise that on her death one-half of it should go to the children of her sister Charlotte Stevens. He required her to reiterate this promise in the presence of witnesses. Another disinterested witness testified that on one occasion she heard him, in Letta\u2019s presence, state that it had been agreed between them that the heirs of her sister Charlotte should have their mother\u2019s portion after her death. This is something very different from the mere parol declarations by a testator of what he intended. It was as strong as if witnesses had been produced present at the agreement before the execution of the will. Several other witnesses testified to Letta\u2019s admissions at different times that one-half of the land at her death was to belong to her' sister\u2019s children. Her acts and declarations when she made a contract of sale of the land were strongly corroborative of the same thing. She consulted her nephews, and according to the testimony of one of them, McKiel Stevens, told him she would have the payments so arranged that out of the first instalment she could let the heirs have $500 each, and that as the payments fell due she would divide it among them, with the exception of what she wanted for her own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>use. That Thomas Griffin at other times stated that he wanted Letta to remember Charlotte\u2019s children, when she was done with the property, or that she should remember the Stevens\u2019 children if she had anything left, did not materially weaken the force of the direct evidence before adduced. Nor did the fact that he did not communicate the agreement to his counsel when he drew the will, though it was certainly a circumstance to be weighed by the jury, necessarily contradict or impeach the testimony of the witnesses as to the agreement admitted by Letta to have been made before the will was drawn. Indeed even regarding the evidence to be inconclusive of the existence of such prior agreement, the testimony of Durlin Griffin, if believed, would establish the trust; for he stated that Thomas Griffin said to Van Storch, who was called in as a witness that he was going to make another will, but that Letta by her promise made at that time prevented him from doing so. There was then sufficient evidence, if believed, to establish the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">It is supposed, however, and one of the assignments of error rests on that basis, that Letta, the devisee, could claim as a bond fide purchaser under her vendor, Edmund Griffin, who does not appear to have had notice of the trust. Undoubtedly if a person, though with notice, purchases from one without notice, he is entitled to stand in his shoes, and take shelter under his bona fides. If it were not so the bond fide purchaser without notice might be unable to dispose of the property, and thus its value in his hands be materially deteriorated. But if the second purchaser in such case be the original trustee, who reacquires the estate, he will be fixed with the trust: Hill on Trustees 165. If an express authority for so plain a position be needed it will be found in Kennedy <em>v. </em>Daly, 1 Schoale &amp; Lefroy 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Nor is the plea of the limitation contained in the 6th section of the Act of April 22d 1856? Pamph. L. 533, of any avail. That section provides \u201c that no right of entry shall accrue or action be maintained * * * * to enforce any implied or resulting trust as to realty, but within five years after * * * * such equity or trust accrued, with the right of entry.\u201d During the life of Letta, the devisee, the trust did not accrue. The fraud from which it arose was not consummate until her death without having made a will in favor of the children of Charlotte Stevens. Until then no action could have been maintained: Price\u2019s Appeal, 4 P. F. Smith 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
