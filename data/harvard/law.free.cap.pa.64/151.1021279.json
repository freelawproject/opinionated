The plaintiff was a huckster who had a stall in the vicinity (less than three miles) of the camp meeting, for the sale of various articles of food and refreshment. The evidence was conflicting as to whether the plaintiff had spirituous or fermented liquors. He was warned by a justice of the peace and constable and also by two freeholders of the county to desist and remove his stall and goods. He refused. Under the direction of the justice, constable and two freeholders, the constable seized the goods and sold them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-14\">This proceeding was under the 1st and 2d sections of the Act of April 2d 1822: 7 Sm.

To our mind, it is a very narrow construction to put on this Act of Assembly, but as we said above, this act has received a construction by the court of last resort in our state, and we feel bound by their construction, and we submit our judgment to theirs, and instruct you that the law is to be construed as that court has done in the case of Eetter <em>v. </em>Wilt, 10 Wright 459.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">\u201c This then being the law, we instruct you in the language of Justice Thompson.

L. 286, as provides for the seizure, forfeiture and sale, of all the articles of traffic, &amp;c., together with the booth, stall, tent, carriage, boat or vessel of any person offending against that act, is in plain violation of the declaration of rights : Const. of Penna., Art. IX., \u00a7 6, 8, 9, and therefore unconstitutional and void. It is not necessary however in this case any more than it was in that to decide that question. It was there held, and upon the soundest reason, that the prohibition of the act was not intended to be against all articles of traffic, but of traffic in <em>\u201c </em>spirituous liquors, wine, porter, beer, cider or any other fermented, mixed or strong drink.\u201d It would not be proper to impute to the legislature the absurdity of this special enumeration, if the first words were meant to include all articles of traffic. It is much more reasonable to consider that the words \u201c articles of traffic\u201d were intended to be followed by a <em>videlicet </em>or \u201cthat is-to say.\u201d The whole spirit of the law confirms this construction. As the jury found that the defendant had'not violated the law according to this interpretation of it, there is no error in this record. It was not in very good taste in the court below to read to the jury the case of Fetter <em>v. </em>Wilt (if indeed they did, which does not certainly appear), especially accompanied with remarks disapproving of it, but in that there is nothing of which the plaintiffs in error have any right to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
