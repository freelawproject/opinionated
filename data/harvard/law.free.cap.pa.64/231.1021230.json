Crippen and John B. Maddock, trading as William L. Maddock &amp; Co., against Henry Winsor and William D. Winsor, owners of the steamship \u201c Saxon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-12\">The ship was one of a line between Philadelphia and Boston, which carried passengers as well as freight. The claim was for groceries, such as would be suitable for passengers. It was alleged by the defendants that the goods were furnished on the individual credit of Captain Matthews, the master of the ship, and not on the credit either of the ship or her owners; and that the captain only, and not the ship or its owners, was only liable. The Saxon belongs to the Boston Steamship Line, of which the defendants are agents and part owners. The landing-place of the steamers is Pine street wharf, and the office of the line is on Delaware Avenue, at the corner of Pine street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-13\">The plaintiffs gave in evidence the account in their books, in which the heading was, \u201c Steamship Saxon and Owners.\u201d Also a pass-book, endorsed on both covers, \u201c St. Ship Saxon and owners in account with William L. Maddock &amp; Co.with a similar entry on the head of the first page. The book contained a running account of articles furnished from May 1863 to May 1866 ; also credits of cash and merchandise, showing the balance due May 16th 1866, to be $473.52. The book was brought from time to time to the plaintiffs\u2019 store, by the steward of the ship, the items were entered in the pass-book, which was delivered to the ship with the goods; the go-ods were taken to the ship in the plaintiffs\u2019 wagon, which had their names on it in large letters. The plaintiffs gave other evidence to maintain their case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-14\">The defendants called Captain Matthews, who testified: He told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>one of the plaintiffs when he made arrangements for dealing with them, that he got so much per month for victualling the ship, and he was to get the things where he could do best; the plaintiffs made out the pass-book themselves and gave it to the steward; the goods were furnished on witness\u2019s account, and <em>he </em>wras indebted to the plaintiffs for the balance; he informed the plaintiffs when his arrangement with the defendants ceased, and that thereafter their bills must be sent to Henry Winsor &amp; Co. Witness was owner of a sixteenth of the. ship in 1862, when the contract was opened; he transferred his interest in the same year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\">\u2022The steward testified that he informed the plaintiffs that the captain was victualling the vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-7\">Henry Winsor, one of the defendants, testified, that their contract with the captain was to pay him $600 per month for victual-ling the ship and $5 on each passenger; the captain bought the supplies on his own credit where he chose, and all that was due to him had been paid. The plaintiffs never made any demand on the defendants for payment until August 1867 ; they had never seen the plaintiffs or their clerk, or known anything of the bill until that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-8\">The witness further said: <em>\u201c </em>Our captains sometimes purchased some things for the vessel. We generally consulted the captain about the purchases for the vessel of things in which he was most competent as captain to advise, such as rigging, boats, &amp;c. When he bought such things the bills were sent to the office. The bills were generally made out so, \u2018 Steamship Saxon and Owners,\u2019 to distinguish them from purchases made for the other vessels on the line. The general accounts of the line are kept at Boston. After January 1866, we found out that Captain Matthews was doing badly, not paying his bills; we required him to pay them monthly. They were paid at the office by the book-keeper, and charged to him. They continued to be so until he left us.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\">The plaintiffs, in rebuttal, gave evidence for the purpose of showing that they had sold the goods on the credit of the ship \u2022and the owners, and had never given credit to Captain Matthews individually; and also to show that the captain\u2019s and steward\u2019s statements on this point were inaccurate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-10\">The defendants submitted these points:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-11\">1. The captain of a steamship engaged in a regular established coastwise transportation line between this port and Boston, has no authority presumable solely from his position as captain, to bind the owners of such steamer for supplies purchased by him for the passengers and crew of such steamer, in her home port, where her owners and regularly constituted and advertised agents are resident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-12\">2. If the plaintiffs had knowledge that the defendants were the agents of the steamship Saxon in Philadelphia, her home port, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>and managed the affairs of such vessel, then the presumption of the captain\u2019s authority as agent of the owners is rebutted, and the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover without proof of express authority of the captain to pledge the credit of the owners for the supplies in question in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">3. Proof that the defendants had been well known to the public in this city for a long period as the agents of the Boston Steamship Line, which line the steamer Saxon performed regular trips since the year 1861, and were regularly advertised in the newspapers as such agents, is evidence of the knowledge of such fact by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-7\">4. If the jury believe that after the plaintiffs furnished the supplies sued for upon the order of the captain, the plaintiffs permitted a long time to elapse without demanding payment of the defendants, or notifying them of the delinquency of the captain in failing to pay, and thus allowed the defendants to settle with the captain, as if the bills had been duly paid by the captain, such delay upon the part of the plaintiffs is evidence that they gave exclusive credit to the captain, and will operate to discharge the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-8\">5. If the jury believe that the plaintiffs had knowledge of the agreement between the captain and owners concerning the victualling of the steamer, that the captain should purchase such supplies upon his own account and credit in the best market, receiving therefor a certain stipulated sum, then the plaintiffs could not charge the said supplies to the defendants, and cannot recover in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-9\">6. If the jury believe, from the whole of the evidence in the cause, that these supplies were furnished upon the credit of the captain, the defendants are not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-10\">The court, Stroud, J., did not answer the points specifically, but charged:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-11\">* * * \u201c It is in evidence that besides being captain of the vessel, Matthews was also a part owner. The articles furnished are not what are called <em>sea stores, </em>for a particular voyage, but consist of numerous small articles chiefly furnished for victualling, even to a few pounds, and I believe to a single pound.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-12\">[\u201c Supposing that the captain was also a joint owner with the defendants, who are sued as <em>owners, </em>and that no special information had been given to the plaintiffs as to any particular arrangement between the captain and the defendants, as to whom the obligation of payment existed, I think the law would make the defendants, as owners, liable jointly with the captain for the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-13\">\u201cBut if the plaintiffs had been informed at the commencement of the dealing for supplies, that there was an arrangement between the captain and the defendants, by which the captain was to pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>chase supplies on his own responsibility only, the defendants would not be liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">\u201cIt is important, therefore, that the jury should look carefully into the evidence on this topic. Captain Matthews says he made the communication as to his individual responsibility, and did it at the outset of the dealing for supplies.\u201d * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">The verdict was for the plaintiffs for $556.93.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">The defendants took a writ of error, and assigned for error in their first six specifications the neglect of the court to answer their points, and the part of the charge enclosed in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-9\"><em>J.

We had occasion to reconsider and reaffirm these principles in Patterson <em>v. </em>Kountz, 13 P. F. Smith 246, to the opinion in which we refer for a more full discussion and citation of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">It must now be considered as settled in this state by the case of Glading <em>v. </em>George, 3 Grant\u2019s Cases 290, that the owners of a ship, though in a home port where they or their agents reside, are responsible for necessary supplies furnished on the order of the captain, unless it should appear that they were so furnished exclusively on his credit. There was no error then in the refusal or neglect of the learned judge below to answer the points presented by the defendants which form the subjects of the first three assignments of error. The only proper answer would have been a negative one to each of them, and that would have been of no advantage to the plaintiffs in error. As to the fourth error assigned, which appears to be the principal ground of complaint, the want of any answer either specifically or in the charge to the defendants\u2019 fourth point, the same remark is applicable. For certainly the neglect of the plaintiffs below to demand payment of the defendants, unless the fact was that they knew of an arrangement under which the captain was paid a certain sum to procure supplies \u2014 a fact not hypothetically stated in the point \u2014 would be no evidence from which the jury could have legitimately inferred that exclusive credit was given to him. The fifth and sixth points were distinctly answered in the charge w7hen the jury were instructed that \u201cif the plaintiffs had been informed at the commencement of the dealing for supplies, that there was an arrangement between the captain and the defendants by which the captain was to purchase supplies on his own responsibility only, the defendants would not be liable.\u201d That portion of the charge complained of in the seventh assignment of error is but a reiteration in substance of the same instruction. Indeed when we advert to the evidence of Henry Winsor, one of the defendants, the case was submitted to the jury as favorably for them as they could ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>or expect: for he testified that \u201c when he (the captain) bought such things the bills were sent to the office. The bills were generally made out so, \u201cSteamship Saxon and Owners,\u201d to distinguish them from purchases made for the other vessels on the line.\u201d With full knowledge then that the plaintiffs were charging the supplies furnished by them in this manner, without any objection on their part, there was not only no evidence that they were sold to the captain exclusively on .his credit, but direct evidence brought home to the knowledge of the defendants at the time, that they were sold on the credit of the ship and her owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
