On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the charge of sexual assault in the first degree when the evidence was insufficient to establish that the victim was under thirteen years of age at the time of the alleged offense, (2) permitted the defendant\u2019s conviction of sexual assault in the first and second degrees to stand when the evidence was insufficient to establish the element of penetration, (3) charged the jury by failing to specify that penetration is required to complete fellatio in both first and second degree sexual assault, (4) charged the jury by reading the statutory definition of sexual intercourse, and (5) instructed the jury as to the charge of risk of injury to a child. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. Over a period of three years, the defendant repeatedly had sexual contact with the younger sister of his girlfriend D. During the period of repeated sexual contact, the defendant was between twenty-two and twenty-six years of age and the victim, who was bom on December 3, 1978, was between ten and fourteen years of age. The sexual contact began in the spring of 1989 when the defendant rubbed the victim\u2019s chest under her clothing while the victim was spending the night at the Bridgeport condominium that belonged to D and the defendant, who was D\u2019s boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">During the spring of 1990, the defendant and D were living together at the victim\u2019s parents\u2019 home in Fairfield. In the spring of 1990, when the defendant and the victim were alone in the house, the defendant compelled the victim to perform fellatio on him. The defendant put his penis into the victim\u2019s mouth, pushed her head back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>and forth with his hand, and ejaculated in her mouth. The victim went into the bathroom and vomited.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In late November or December, 1992, the victim, her friend, S, the defendant and D were watching videos at the victim\u2019s parents\u2019 home. The defendant and the victim left in the defendant\u2019s car to return the videos and to retrieve some of D\u2019s clothing from the condominium that she shared with the defendant. After returning the videos, the defendant proceeded to his condominium at 103 Huntington Turnpike. The defendant and the victim entered the condominium. Once inside, the defendant called the victim into the bedroom and compelled her to perform fellatio on him. The defendant ejaculated in the victim\u2019s mouth, again causing the victim to vomit. The defendant then expressed his desire to have vaginal intercourse with the victim. When the victim refused, the defendant inserted his finger into her vagina and then proceeded to make an unsuccessful attempt to penetrate her vagina with his penis. The defendant then drove the victim back to her parents\u2019 home. Upon her return home, the victim was shaking and expressed a desire to go to bed. S asked the victim what was wrong, and the victim told S that the defendant had \u201cdone stuff\u2019 to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In May, 1993, D, the defendant, and the victim\u2019s friend, C, were at the victim\u2019s parents\u2019 home. The defendant offered to drive C home. The defendant, C and the victim left in the defendant\u2019s car and dropped C off at her house. The defendant then proceeded to a parking lot between Pequot and Center Streets in Fairfield. While sitting in the car, the defendant compelled the victim to performing fellatio on him. The victim put her mouth on the defendant\u2019s penis while the defendant pushed her head up and down.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">About one month after the May, 1993 parking lot incident, during a seventh grade gym class, the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>confided to her friend C that the defendant had been having sexual contact with her and that it made her uncomfortable. C told her mother who informed the victim\u2019s mother. After a discussion among the victim, her sister D and their mother, the police were informed. The victim subsequently gave a written statement about the sexual assaults to Detective William Young of the Fairfield police department, and also discussed the assaults with her school guidance counselor, William Bosch.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">On April 21, 1994, the defendant was found guilty as previously set forth and sentenced on May 8, 1994, in accordance with his conviction. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The defendant first claims that because the victim gave conflicting testimony regarding when the sexual assault in the first degree occurred, the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was under thirteen years of age at the time of the offense, a necessary element of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree. The defendant further claims that the trial court violated his due process rights under the United States and Connecticut constitutions to be acquitted unless proven guilty of all essential elements of the crime charged. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">\u201cWhen called on to review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we undertake a two part analysis. . . . First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>39 Conn. App. 110, 118, 665 A.2d 95 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Having carefully reviewed the evidence, we conclude that it was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s determination that the victim was under the age of thirteen at the time of the sexual assault in the first degree. At trial, the evidence disclosed that the victim was born on December 3, 1978. The evidence further disclosed that the victim performed fellatio on the defendant at her home in Fairfield. At the outset of her testimony, the victim expressed uncertainty as to the exact date of this incident. She testified, however, that she thought it took place a short time after the defendant had rubbed her chest in the spring of 1989 when the victim was ten years old. She thought she was in \u201cabout fifth or sixth\u201d grade at the time but she was \u201cnot quite sure.\u201d When asked directly whether she remembered the year during which this act occurred, she indicated that it was in the spring of 1990 while she was in the fourth grade and eleven years old.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The jury \u201cdetermines with finality the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded their testimony. . . . Any part of a witness\u2019 testimony may be believed or disbelieved by [the jury].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>23 Conn. App. 426, 429, 580 A.2d 1004 (1990). \u201c[I]n viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the jury is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence. The rule is that the jury\u2019s function is to draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. . . . We do not sit as a [seventh] juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record. We have not had the jury\u2019s opportunity to observe the conduct, demeanor, and atti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>tude of the witnesses and to gauge their credibility.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">\u201cIn considering the evidence introduced in a case, [j]uries are not required to leave common sense at the courtroom door . . . nor are they expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observations and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201c[W]e rely on the good sense and judgment of American juries to weigh evidence with some element of untrustworthiness since such evidence is customary grist for the jury mill.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>32 Conn. App. 193, 203, 628 A.2d 996, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 920, 632 A.2d 698 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">From the evidence, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the victim was under the age of thirteen at the time of the sexual assault in the first degree. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty of sexual assault in the first degree is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">The defendant next asserts that there was insufficient evidence for the jury reasonably to find that the state had established beyond a reasonable doubt the element of penetration, an element necessary to prove the commission of sexual assault in the first and second degrees. The defendant further asserts that his convictions of sexual assault in both the first and second degrees deprived him of his due process rights under the United States and Connecticut constitutions to be acquitted unless proven guilty of each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>The defendant concedes that this claim was not properly preserved at trial, and thus seeks review of this claim under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review this unpreserved claim because this court has previously held that \u201c[u]npreserved sufficiency claims are reviewable on appeal because such claims implicate a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right not to be convicted of a crime upon insufficient proof.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Laws, </em>37 Conn. App. 276, 281, 655 A.2d 1131, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 907, 659 A.2d 1210 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">We will not repeat the standard of review applied to a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, as that standard was fully set out in our analysis of the defendant\u2019s first; claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The defendant claims that because the victim did not use the term \u201cfellatio\u201d while testifying in court, and never asserted that the defendant\u2019s penis entered her mouth or that the defendant\u2019s penis was in her mouth at the times of the ejaculations, the element of penetration was not established. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">With regard to each count of sexual assault, the victim testified that she had oral sex with the defendant,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>fying that she \u201cput [her] mouth on his penis\u201d and he pushed her head \u201cup and down\u201d or \u201cback and forth.\u201d Moreover, the prosecutor directly asked the victim, \u201cNow you indicated that he put his penis in your mouth?\u201d and the victim responded \u201cYes.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2) provides: \u201cPenetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete . . . fellatio and does not require the emission of semen. . . Nonetheless, regarding the spring, 1990 and November or December 1992 counts of sexual assault, there was evidence that the defendant ejaculated into the victim\u2019s mouth, causing her to \u201cthrow up.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The jury could have reasonably concluded from the evidence that the penetration element of the crime of sexual assault had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to find him guilty of sexual assault is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court improperly charged the jury on the counts charging sexual assault in the first and second degrees by failing to inform the jury that penetration is necessary to complete fellatio. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The defendant raises this issue for the first time on appeal. At trial, the defendant failed to request a charge on this issue or to take exception to the court\u2019s instructions. The defendant concedes that this claim was not properly preserved and thus seeks review of this claim under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">When the defendant claims that the court\u2019s instructions failed to inform the jury adequately of all the essential elements of the crime charged, a limited review is warranted, as it raises the possibility of a due process violation affecting the fairness of the trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>39 Conn. App. 478, 484, 664 A.2d 1202, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 931, 667 A.2d 1269 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Certain additional facts are necessary for a resolution of this claim. During the course of its charge, the trial court instructed the jury that sexual intercourse must be established beyond a reasonable doubt to justify a verdict of guilty on the charge of sexual assault in the second degree. \u201cInsofar as it is relevant to this case, the term \u2018sexual intercourse\u2019 means vaginal intercourse or fellatio between persons. The word \u2018fellatio\u2019 comes from the Latin. It means oral stimulation of the penis. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete sexual intercourse and does not require emission of semen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>The trial court further instructed the jury that sexual intercourse with another person must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in order to justify a verdict of guilty on the charge of sexual assault in the first degree. \u201cAs it\u2019s relevant here, sexual intercourse means fellatio between persons, certainly includes\u2014perhaps is a better word\u2014fellatio. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete sexual intercourse and does not require emission of semen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">\u201c[T]he standard of review to be applied to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. ... In determining whether it was indeed reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The defendant is correct that the trial court did not specifically utter the words \u201cpenetration is necessary to complete fellatio.\u201d The trial court did, however, repeatedly instruct the jury that (1) sexual intercourse is an essential element of sexual assault, (2) sexual intercourse means fellatio, and (3) penetration, however slight, is necessary to complete sexual intercourse. Our review of the charge as a whole leads us to conclude that the trial court adequately informed the jury that penetration was required to complete fellatio and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>presented the case to the jury so that no injustice resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The defendant next claims that, in light of evidence proffered at trial that the defendant inserted his finger into the victim\u2019s vagina, and the fact that no claim of digital vaginal penetration was alleged in the final long form information used in the prosecution of the defendant, the trial court improperly charged the jury by reading the statutory definition of sexual intercourse,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> including the last sentence of the definition, which provides that \u201cpenetration may be committed by an object manipulated . . . into the genital . . . opening of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2). The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s reading of the last sentence of the statute constituted prejudicial surprise in that it \u201cplaced a new assault \u2018in play\u2019 for the first time,\u201d thereby expanding \u201cthe information to allege a new, separate and distinct crime.\u201d The defendant further argues that the trial court\u2019s reading of the last sentence of the statutory definition of sexual intercourse violated his state and federal due process rights to be informed of the charges against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">The defendant concedes that this issue was not properly preserved at trial. The defendant again claims entitlement to review of this unpreserved claim pursuant to the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We also note that the evidence regarding the digi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>tal vaginal penetration was not objected to at trial, nor was it the subject of a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The amended long form information charges the defendant with sexual assault in the first and second degrees and attempted sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 53-70 (a) (2)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 53a-49 (a) (2).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThe fact that the information was in long form and cited . . . provision[s] in the General Statutes pertaining generically to . . . sexual intercourse afforded the defendant constitutionally adequate notice of the possibility that the trial court could ultimately incorporate the . . . statutory definition of sexual intercourse in its charge to the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>224 Conn. 397, 414-15, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993). The defendant \u201cwas clearly afforded notice of the offense with which he was charged and his defense suffered no prejudice because of the trial court\u2019s reading of the [statutory] definition of sexual intercourse. Where the defendant can demonstrate neither unfair surprise nor prejudice, he cannot claim an infringement of his constitutional right to fair notice of the crimes with which he is charged . . . .\u201d Id., 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructing the jury on the statutory definition of sexual intercourse did not, in the circumstances of this case, violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be informed of the charges against him, and thus the defendant has failed to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Finally, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the charge of risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>injury to a child by stating that \u201c[t]he deliberate touching of the private parts of a child under the age of sixteen in a sexual and indecent manner is violative of [\u00a7 53-21],\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant claims that this erroneous jury instruction deprived him of his due process rights by lessening the state\u2019s burden to prove each and every element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Although the state\u2019s request to charge contained similar language, the defendant failed to file a request of his own nor did he except to the charge as given. Thus, the defendant seeks review of this unpreserved claim under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>207 Conn. 456, 542 A.2d 686 (1988), our Supreme Court examined the constitutionality of \u00a7 53-21. The Supreme Court held that, on its face, \u00a7 53-21 fails to articulate a definite standard for determining whether the conduct of a defendant is likely to impair the morals of a minor. Id., 461. The extensive judicial gloss on the language of the statute in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 428 A.2d 322 (1980), however, made it clear \u201c \u2018that the deliberate touching of the private parts of a child under the age of sixteen in a sexual and indecent manner is violative of [\u00a7 53-21].\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>supra, 463. Our Supreme Court further concluded that <em>Pickering </em>defines the confines of \u00a7 53-21 and \u201cfurnishes the standard by which to test whether the defendant has violated \u00a7 53-21 . . . .\u201d Id., 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Here, the trial court instructed the jury on the charge of risk of injury to a child by quoting the actual language of \u00a7 53-21 in conjunction with the authoritative judicial gloss of <em>Pickering. </em>See id. As our Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>held that <em>Pickering </em>both establishes the boundaries of \u00a7 53-21 and furnishes the standard by which to test whether the defendant has violated \u00a7 53-21, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process, and thus the defendant has failed to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\"> General Statutes 8 53a-71 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and: (1) Such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cAny person who wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that its life or limb is endangered, or its health is likely to be injured or its morals are likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than ten years or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b813-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he ...
