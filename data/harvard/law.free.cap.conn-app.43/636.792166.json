The trial court sustained the plaintiffs appeal. On appeal to this court, the commissioner claims that the trial court improperly sustained the plaintiffs appeal because there is substantial evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s decision to suspend the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>operator\u2019s license. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The record discloses the following facts relevant to this appeal. At about 12:45 a.m. on February 18, 1994, Officers Jeffrey Bender and Gary Krassner of the Anso-nia police department were stopped in the middle of Crescent Street with their vehicles facing in opposite directions. While they were stopped, a pickup truck drove up and stopped behind Krassner\u2019s vehicle. Kras-sner drove away and the truck followed. As the truck passed his vehicle, Bender recognized the driver as the plaintiff. Bender also noticed that the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>alone. Bender turned his vehicle around to follow the plaintiff because, as Bender testified, \u201cI know [the plaintiff] had recently gone through another [driving while under the influence (DWI)] proceeding and I wanted to see if his license was under suspension or not. . . .\u201d When the plaintiff reached the intersection of Crescent Street and Howard Avenue, he made a right turn onto Howard Avenue without signaling in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-242.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bender continued to follow the plaintiff and activated the overhead lights of his police vehicle. The plaintiff continued driving until he reached his home on Howard Avenue, pulled into his driveway and turned off the lights and engine. Bender and Kras-sner drove their vehicles into the driveway behind the plaintiffs truck, walked up to the driver\u2019s side door and knocked on the window. The plaintiff opened the door and Bender asked for the plaintiffs operator\u2019s license, registration and insurance identification card. The plaintiff replied, in a slurred, mumbled voice, \u201cI don\u2019t have a license.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, the plaintiff exited his vehicle and, in response to Bender\u2019s inquiry, admitted to Bender that he had been drinking. In addition, the plaintiff denied that he had been driving the vehicle, even though he was the sole occupant and Bender had observed him driving. As he spoke with the plaintiff, Bender detected that the plaintiff had a strong odor of alcohol, that he spoke with slurred speech, that he had a \u201cdroopy expression,\u201d and that he walked with a severe stagger, running his hand along his truck to balance himself. The plaintiff refused to take any field sobriety tests and was placed under arrest for driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs and making a turn at an intersection without giving an appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>signal in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 14-227b and 14-242, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">At the police station, the plaintiff refused to submit to a test of his blood alcohol level. On the basis of Bender\u2019s report and the plaintiffs refusal to submit to a test, the commissioner sent a notice of the proposed suspension of the plaintiffs operator\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (c) and (d). The plaintiff requested and was subsequently given an administrative hearing on the proposed two year license suspension pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On March 30, 1994, a hearing was held before Jeffrey Donahue, a department of motor vehicles hearing officer. Bender\u2019s testimony, the \u201cOfficer\u2019s DWI Arrest and Alcohol Test Refusal or Failure Report\u201d and an attached narrative report were admitted into evidence without objection. Donahue issued his decision on March 31, 1994, finding that (1) the police officer had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for violating \u00a7 14-227b, (2) the plaintiff was placed under arrest, (3) the plaintiff refused to submit to a test to determine his blood alcohol level, and (4) the plaintiff was operating the motor vehicle. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (f). On the basis of these findings, the commissioner suspended the plaintiffs driver\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (h) (3), which provides that an operator\u2019s license is to be suspended for two years where such a driver has previously had his license suspended under \u00a7 14-227b on at least two other occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The plaintiff appealed the suspension to the Superior Court, claiming that (1) Bender did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion justifying a stop of the plaintiffs vehicle, and (2) Bender did not have probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. The trial court determined that, while the police officer\u2019s investigatory stop was justified because of the plaintiffs violation of \u00a7 14-242, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the record did not provide substantial evidence to support the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the police had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. The court concluded, therefore, that the commissioner had acted unreasonably, arbitrarily and in abuse of his discretion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">\u201cIn cases involving administrative appeals it is not the function of this court, nor was it the function of the trial court, to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>33 Conn. App. 501, 506, 636 A.2d 409, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 909, 642 A.2d 1205 (1994). A reviewing court \u201cshall affirm the decision of the agency unless the court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions ... (5) clearly erroneous in view of the rehable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (6) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j). \u201cIf the [commissioner\u2019s] determination to suspend the plaintiffs license pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b is supported by substantial evidence in the record, that determination must be sustained.\u201d <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 507. It is, however, \u201cthe function of the courts to expound and apply governing principles of law. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 Conn. 508, 521, 560 A.2d 403 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The commissioner asserts that the trial court improperly concluded that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the hearing officer\u2019s decision that the police had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (f) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\u201cIn Connecticut, probable cause is required before an arrest may be made for operating under the influence of alcohol.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>26 Conn. App. 805, 810, 603 A.2d 1203, aff'd, 224 Conn. 730, 620 A.2d 789 (1992). Section 14-227b (c) requires a police officer to include in the incident report \u201cthe grounds for the officer\u2019s belief that there was probable cause to arrest . . . for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . .\u201d Probable cause exists if there are \u201cfacts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has trustworthy information sufficient to justify the belief of a reasonable person that an offense has been or is being committed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>[20 Conn. App. 183, 187, 565 A.2d 11 (1989)], quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>[205 Conn. 201, 213, 530 A.2d 603 (1987)] . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>supra, 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On the basis of the objective facts and circumstances as they were available to Bender that night, the trial court improperly found that the police did not have probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to stop after Bender had activated the overhead lights oil the police vehicle. Bender reported that the plaintiffs speech was slurred, and that he smelled of alcohol, staggered severely when he walked, and had a droopy expression. In addition, the plaintiff admitted that he had been drinking and denied driving the vehicle despite being its only occupant. These facts, in light of the plaintiffs refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test, are more than sufficient to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">We conclude that the record contains substantial evidence supporting the commissioner\u2019s finding that the police officer had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff for operation of a motor vehicle while under the influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ence of intoxicating liquor. Thus, the trial court improperly held that the commissioner acted unreasonably, arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The plaintiff argues, however, that even if we conclude, as we have, that the commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, we can, nevertheless, affirm the trial court\u2019s decision on an alternate ground. See Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the trial court concluded that the officer\u2019s investigative stop was justified, the plaintiff asserts that the police did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify stopping the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">A brief investigatory detention by a police officer is proper, \u201c \u2018even in the absence of probable cause, if the police have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that aperson has committed or is about to commit a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>30 Conn. App. 108, 111, 618 A.2d 1381 (1993), aff'd, 228 Conn. 758, 638 A.2d 601 (1994), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990). An investigative stop can be appropriate even where the police have not observed a violation because \u201ca reasonable and articulable suspicion can arise from conduct that alone is not criminal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>supra, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Here, Bender observed the plaintiff make a right turn at an intersection without signaling in violation of \u00a7 14-242. This fact is sufficient, on its own, to justify an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>investigative stop. <em>Ivimey </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>30 Conn. App. 742, 750, 622 A.2d 603, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 902, 625 A.2d 1375 (1993). We conclude that the substantial rights of the plaintiff have not been prejudiced because the police officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that justified making an investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle in this state shall be deemed to have given his consent to a chemical analysis of his blood, breath or urine and, if said person is a minor, his parent or parents or guardian shall also be deemed to have given his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">\u201c(b) If any such person, having been placed under arrest for ... operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor, and thereafter, after being apprised of his constitutional rights, having been requested to submit to a blood, breath or urine test at the option of the police officer, having been afforded a reasonable opportunity to telephone an attorney prior to the performance of such test and having been informed that his license or nonresident operating privilege will be suspended in accordance with the provisions of this section if he refuses to submit to such test or if he submits to such test and the results of such test indicate that the ratio of alcohol in his blood was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>and that evidence of any such refusal shall be admissible in accordance with subsection (f) of section 14-227a and may be used against him in any criminal prosecution, refuses to submit to the designated test, the test shall not be given; provided, if the person refuses or is unable to submit to a blood test, the police officer shall designate the breath or urine test as the test to be taken.
