We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. At approximately 9:50 a.m. on March 22, 1994, a man wearing a green hooded sweatshirt, a purple ski mask and a glove on his left hand, entered a branch of the Bank of New Haven at 395 Whalley Avenue in New Haven. The man was holding a black gun in his right hand and a heavy plastic bag with drawstrings in his left hand. During the robbery, the robber\u2019s mask covered most of his face, and the witnesses were later able to describe him only as a tall, slim black male. Five employees were present: the branch manager was at a teller station; a customer service representative, Elizabeth Rios, was at her desk near the entrance; and three tellers, Tim Holland, Elizabeth Alsever and Angela Vigli-otto, were at their respective teller windows. Several customers were also present. The robber faced the first teller station, pointed the gun at Holland and said, \u201cThis is a hold-up.\u201d He went to Holland\u2019s window, put the plastic bag over the counter and demanded money. Holland placed money from his cash drawer into the bag, including \u201cbait money\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and money containing a \u201cdye pack.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The robber then sequentially approached each of the other two tellers\u2019 windows and demanded money. Each of the other tellers put money, including bait money, into the bag, and one of them placed money containing another dye pack into the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The robber walked to the front doors near Rios\u2019 desk, pushed them slightly ajar, turned back and swept the gun across the room at the tellers, and eventually pointed it directly at Rios. Then he fled across Whalley Avenue carrying the bag of money. As he did so, Rios saw the dye packets explode, spewing red and pink smoke from the bag. The robber then ran behind a brick building on the opposite side of Whalley Avenue. In searching the area after the robbery, the police found fresh footprints in a muddy area behind the brick building. The footprints led east onto Winthrop Avenue, about one block from the bank. The bank\u2019s video cameras captured most of the robbery on tape. Enlarged photographs of the robber were made from the bank\u2019s security videotape. The videotape itself was admitted at trial and was viewed by the jury. The robber was in the bank for approximately thirty seconds. None of the eyewitnesses was able to identify the defendant as the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In March, 1994, the defendant, who is a slim black male, six feet one inch in height, resided in a second floor apartment at 681 Elm Street, New Haven, with Jolynn Wilson, their infant son, and Wilson\u2019s two other young children. Winthrop Avenue intersects Elm Street within one block of the defendant\u2019s apartment. On March 22, 1994, shortly before 9 a.m., Wilson asked the defendant to care for their son while she went to purchase a used car. The defendant refused, claiming that he had an appointment elsewhere that morning. Wilson left the apartment at about 9 a.m., taking their infant son with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">When Wilson arrived home about one and one-half hours later, the defendant was in the bathroom with wet, red-stained United States currency spread out in the sink and bathtub. He was attempting to bleach the stains off the money. When Wilson asked where the money had come from, the defendant claimed that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>had found it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wilson ordered the defendant to get the money out of the apartment. The defendant left the apartment with the money in a black fanny bag and, without Wilson\u2019s knowledge, placed it in a hall closet outside the apartment entrance. He then left the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">A few days later, the New Haven police, on the basis of information from a confidential source that the defendant was the perpetrator of the bank robbery, secured a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s apartment at 681 Elm Street, which was located one and one-half blocks from the bank. They executed the warrant on March 29, 1994, at 6 a.m. The defendant was not home at the time of the search, but Wilson and the children were. The police seized a number of pieces of evidence from various locations in the apartment: a red-stained clorox bleach bottle and various items of red-stained men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing from a washroom area; a magazine for a semiautomatic pistol containing two live rounds of ammunition and a puiple ski mask<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from a nightstand drawer and bureau, respectively, in Wilson\u2019s bedroom, which she shared with the defendant; a plastic toy gun from a milk crate filled with other children\u2019s toys; numerous scraps of tom, charred, red and pink stained United States currency from a plastic waste can located in the rear area of the apartment; a black fanny bag filled with damp, stained currency from the exterior hallway closet; and a green hooded shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">During the police search, the defendant entered the building but fled immediately upon seeing a plainclothes detective standing at the top of the stairs outside the second floor apartment. The police chased the defendant and found him hiding in the basement of 278 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Sherman Avenue, a few blocks away. The defendant testified that he ran away when he saw the police because he had sixteen bags of cocaine on his person.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He was taken into custody, and the police found sixteen packets of cocaine on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">The serial number on a $50 bill seized in the defendant\u2019s apartment was the same as one recorded on the bank\u2019s bait money log sheet. A bank security officer testified that when a dye pack explodes, the currency closest to the gas cartridge burns, while the remaining currency becomes stained with red dye. A police inspector with extensive experience investigating bank robberies testified that he inspected the currency and fragments seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment and concluded that their condition was consistent with having been exposed to a dye pack explosion. A New Haven police detective who participated in the search testified that he had investigated several prior bank robberies and that he was familiar with the results of a dye pack explosion. He testified that in his opinion the clothing taken from the defendant\u2019s apartment had been stained through contact with a person or item that had been exposed to an exploding dye pack. The stains on the clorox bottle and clothing indicated that those items had made contact with someone or something which had been exposed to an exploding dye pack. The ski mask seized in the search was of the same style, shape and color as that worn by the bank robber. The toy gun seized was similar to that displayed by the robber in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The defendant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he was the perpetrator of the robbery at the Bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>of New Haven on March 24, 1994. To have arrived at its verdict, he argues, the jury had to resort to speculation and conjecture and to draw unwarranted inferences from the facts presented. He contends that there was nothing distinctive or unique about the perpetrator\u2019s racial or physical characteristics, that the items seized from the washing machine and laundry area on March 29,1994, \u201care of little probative value,\u201d that none of the stains or discolorations on the clorox bleach bottle or clothing were ever forensically tested so as to show that they were caused by dye from a dye pack, that neither the magazine or toy gun were material factors in circumstantially proving identity and that the green hooded shirt was \u201canother red herring\u201d in that its only use as evidence \u201cwas its tendency to confuse or mislead the jury.\u201d While conceding that \u201cunquestionably\u201d the seized red-stained currency was \u201cinculpa-tory,\u201d he argues that the fact that \u201cthe state\u2019s proof on the element of identity was almost entirely dependent on circumstantial evidence,\u201d and given the \u201crelative absence of other inculpatory factors,\u201d the possession of the currency alone was not sufficient to prove that he was the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In denying that he was the perpetrator, the defendant, who testified in his own behalf, said that he came into possession of the dye-stained and bait money as the result of a drug transaction that took place on March 22,1994, in his apartment at 681 Elm Street while Wilson was out. The defendant said that one of his drug customers came to buy drugs and he sold the customer $500 worth of crack cocaine in return for which the defendant received $625 in red-stained money. The defendant said he charged the premium because he was not sure that he could spend the stained money. When Wilson returned to the apartment and saw him in the bathroom as he was washing and trying to bleach out the red stain from the currency, she yelled at him to get it out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>of the house. He did gather it up and left the apartment with the currency in a fanny bag. Without telling Wilson, he put the fanny bag in a hall closet just outside the apartment. In his testimony, the defendant said that he ran from 681 Elm Street on March 29, 1994, when he saw the police because he had sixteen bags of cocaine on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Our Supreme Court has stated: \u201cIn reviewing [a] sufficiency [of evidence] claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 126, 646 A.2d 169 (1994), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 76, 634 A.2d 879 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 609, 595 A.2d 306 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>218 Conn. 766, 770-71, 591 A.2d 1225 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 253, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">\u201cThe evidence must be construed in a light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>[196 Conn. 36, 44, 490 A.2d 1000 (1985)]. It is within the province of the jury to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts proven. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 336, 363 A.2d 72 (1975). The jury may draw reasonable inferences based on other inferences drawn from the evidence presented. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 355, 521 A.2d 150 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, 44-45; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 425, 473 A.2d 300 (1984) .... Our review is a fact based inquiry limited to determining whether the inferences drawn by the jury are \u2018so unreasonable as to be unjustifiable.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 692, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>646 A.2d 147 (1994). \u201cWe note that the probative force of the evidence is not diminished because it consists, in whole or in part, of circumstantial evidence rather than direct evidence. <em>State </em>v. Robinson, 213 Conn. 243, 254, 567 A.2d 1173 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lago, </em>28 Conn. App. 9, 30, 611 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 919, 614 A.2d 828 (1992). It has been \u201crepeatedly stated that there is no legal distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence so far as probative force is concerned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Haddad, </em>189 Conn. 383, 390, 456 A.2d 316 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>183 Conn. 225, 227, 439 A.2d 305 (1981). It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 227 .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>[196 Conn. 685, 691, 495 A.2d 273 (1985)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>216 Conn. 585, 602, 583 A.2d 896 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cimino, </em>194 Conn. 210, 211, 478 A.2d 1005 (1984). \u201c[T]he inquiry into whether the record evidence would support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not require a court to ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence . . . established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boykin, </em>27 Conn. App. 558, 563-64, 609 A.2d 242, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 905, 619 A.2d 179 (1992). In doing so, we keep in mind that \u201c[w]e have not had the jury\u2019s opportunity to observe the conduct, demeanor, and attitude of the witnesses and to gauge their credibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>200 Conn. 685, 693, 513 A.2d 71 (1986). The state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s identity as the robber; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shanks, </em>34 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>103, 120, 640 A.2d 155, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 921, 642 A.2d 1216 (1994); and the issue of the identity of the defendant as the robber was one of fact for the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>227 Conn. 751, 758, 631 A.2d 309 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>138 Conn. 196, 201, 82 A.2d 816 (1951); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>38 Conn. App. 481, 488, 662 A.2d 799 (1995), cert. denied, 237 Conn. 902, 674 A.2d 1333 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>32 Conn. App. 193, 201-202, 628 A.2d 996, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 920, 632 A.2d 698 (1993). To convict the defendant of robbery in the second degree, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that this defendant committed robbery as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Shanks, </em>supra, 120; and (2) that, in the course of the commission of the crimes or of immediate flight therefrom, he displayed or threatened the use of what he represented by his words or conduct to be a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-135.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Applying the foregoing principles to the facts that the juiy reasonably could have found from the evidence, we are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. In assessing the credibility of the witnesses, the jury had sufficient evidence, albeit circumstantial, to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>elude that this defendant was the person who committed the robbery charged. The evidence included not only that from witnesses, but also exhibits, including the videotape of the robbery itself. The robber was described by bank employees as a tall slim black male who wore a purple ski mask. The jury viewed the robbery on the videotape and also observed him in court during the trial, including while he testified. As to his height, he himself testified that he was \u201csix one something.\u201d He admitted that he owned the purple ski mask seized by the police from his apartment. There was testimony from bank employees that this mask was consistent in shape and color with the mask worn by the robber. The jury had the opportunity to view enlarged photographs of the robber holding the \u201cgun\u201d he brandished during the robbery to compare it with the photographs of the plastic toy gun (shaped like an automatic pistol) that was seized by the police from his apartment. There was also in evidence a photograph of a $50 bill seized by the police the serial number of which matched the serial number of a $50 bill shown in the bank\u2019s bait money log. The jurors also heard Rios testifying that the dye pack exploded as the robber ran across Whalley Avenue. The jury heard Wilson testify that, on the morning of the robbery, she observed the defendant in the apartment bathroom washing currency with bleach, trying to remove the red stains from the currency he had spread out there. There was also in evidence the red-stained clorox bottle and stained clothing seized by the police. Among the exhibits were numerous scraps of tom, charred, red and pink stained currency seized from a plastic waste can located in the rear of the defendant\u2019s apartment. When Wilson ordered the defendant, after she saw him with the money in the bathroom, to get it out of the apartment, he put it in a black fanny bag in the hallway closet outside the apartment. The defendant did not tell Wilson that he had done this. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>police conducted their search on March 29, 1994, they found a black fanny bag filled with damp, stained currency in that closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The jury heard the defendant testify as to how he came to have the money and relate the surrounding circumstances, including the alleged drug transaction. The defendant did not recall the name of the drug buyer, and he said that he had not seen him since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Although the defendant concedes that the possession of the seized stained currency is inculpatory, he argues that, given the \u201crelative absence of other inculpatory factors,\u201d the possession of the currency alone was not sufficient to prove that he was the robber. That is hardly the end of the matter. Rather, the cumulative effect of all the evidence must be considered in the light of all the principles we have set out above. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 538-40, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996). This, of course, includes the evidence of the three tellers, the customer service representative, the bank security officer and police officers, as well as that of the defendant and Wilson. Moreover, \u201c[i]n considering the evidence introduced in a case, [j]uries are not required to leave common sense at the courtroom door . . . nor are they expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observations and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>39 Conn. App. 502, 517, 664 A.2d 1185 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Riccio, </em>41 Conn. App. 847, 852, 678 A.2d 981 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>35 Conn. App. 405, 414, 646 A.2d 258, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 930, 649 A.2d 254 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that the cumulative effect of the evidence, construed in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>was sufficient to support the verdict of guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant\u2019s identification was established through circumstantial evidence sufficient to allow the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Next, the defendant claims that his conviction and punishment on three counts of robbery in the second degree violated his federal and state constitutional rights against double jeopardy. In doing so, he first refers to the statutes that he maintains are involved, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (robbery in first degree with which he was charged), 53a-135 (a) (2) (robbery in second degree), 53a-133 (from which definition of robbery is incorporated in first two statutes), 53a-119<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (which defines \u201clarceny\u201d) and 53a-118 (a) (5) (which defines \u201cowner\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the express language of these statutes does not clearly indicate whether the legislature intended to authorize multiple punishments, under the same robbery statute, for the hold-up of two or more tellers during a single criminal episode. Further, the defendant contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>this case does not present the typical Blockburger<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> question of whether a person can be convicted of two distinct statutory offenses for the same conduct or transaction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, he claims, it involves alleged multiple violations of the same statutory provisions. The defendant claims that the issue presented is \u201cwhether the legislature, in enacting part IX<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the penal code, intended multiple robbery convictions where the property of a single business establishment is forcibly taken from two or more employees.\u201d He indicates that, contrary to the state\u2019s claim, this case is not controlled by <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>206 Conn. 657, 539 A.2d 133 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The defendant maintains that the \u201crobbery and related statutes\u201d are \u201cambiguous\u201d on the question of whether the legislature intended multiple robbery convictions where the property of a single business establishment is forcibly taken from two or more employees, and not whether the legislature intended multiple robbery convictions where the robbery is perpetrated against more than one victim. The defendant contends that this ambiguity exists because robbery is both a crime against property and a crime against the person, and has characteristics of both larceny and assault. This claimed ambiguity, he argues, is magnified by the Penal Code commission comment to \u00a7 53a-133, which \u201cdoes not indicate a preference for applying the principles of larceny or assault [robbery]. \u201d See Commission to Revise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Connecticut General Statutes (1969).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The definition of \u201cowner\u201d in \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (5), he contends, also adds to the ambiguity. Because of the claimed ambiguity, the defendant urges the application of lenity to his three robbery convictions, claiming that his double jeopardy rights were violated by his conviction of three counts of robbery in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The state concedes that the robbery charges arose out of the same criminal transaction and, consequently, it argues that the issue is whether these crimes represent the same offense. It maintains that where a defendant is convicted of multiple violations of the same statutory provision in a single trial, the proper double jeopardy inquiry is whether the legislature intended to punish the individual acts separately or to punish only the course of action that they constitute. The state claims that <em>Lytell </em>forecloses the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim, maintaining, inter alia, that <em>Lytell </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s ambiguity argument. Moreover, the state contends, on the basis of the definition of \u201cowner\u201d in the larceny statute (\u00a7 53a-118 [a] [5]), that the bank tellers were clearly \u201cowners,\u201d because their right as tellers to possession of the currency was greater than that of the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">\u201cThe double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides that no person shall \u2018be subject for the same offense to be twice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u2019 The double jeopardy clause protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and multiple punishments [in the same trial] for the <em>same </em>offense. . . .

In <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>supra, 566, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cWhere crimes against persons are involved, a separate interest of society has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>invaded for each violation. Therefore when two or more persons are the victims of a single episode there are as many offenses as there are victims.\u201d \u201cThe intent of the legislature is to be found in the meaning of the words of the statute; that is, in what the legislature actually <em>did </em>say; not in what it <em>meant </em>to say. \u2019 \u2019 (Emphasis in original.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 186, 438 A.2d 859 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>176 Conn. 17, 20, 404 A.2d 873 (1979).

See also General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118. When a violation of \u00a7 53a-119 is committed under the aggravating circumstances set out in \u00a7 53a-135 (incorporating \u00a7 53a-133), \u00a7 53a-135 clearly evinces a legislative intent that robbery is a person and victim oriented crime and, thus, is of a higher order than a crime against property in this statutory scheme. We recognize that it has aspects of a crime against property, but it is clear that its basic thrust is to protect the integrity of the individual. The very language of \u00a7 53a-133 underscores this where it provides that robbery takes place, \u201cwhen, in the course of committing a larceny, [the perpetrator] uses or threatens <em>the immediate use of physical force </em>upon <em>another </em>person for the purpose of . . . <em>[p]reventing or overcoming resistance </em>to the taking of the property or to the <em>retention </em>thereof . . . [or] <em>compelling </em>the owner ... or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>another person <em>to deliver up </em>the property or <em>to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.'\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) This choice of language by the legislature demonstrates its intent that robbery is to be considered basically a crime against the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Furthermore, \u00a7 53a-135 incorporates the definition of \u201crobbery\u201d from \u00a7 53a-133, which in turn provides that \u201c[a] person commits robbery when, <em>in the course of committing a larceny </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The phrase \u201cin the course of\u2019 was new to our statutory robbery scheme with the enactment of the penal code. This legislative language focuses not on the offense against property but, rather, clearly on the intrusion by the perpetrator on the physical and mental integrity of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Giving the language its plain and commonly approved usage not only advances the purpose of the statute, especially the evil to be suppressed, but yields a construction that is consonant with accepted statutory construction. See <em>Singh </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>213 Conn. 637, 647, 569 A.2d 1112 (1990); <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 505-506, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S.

Jur. 2d, Statutes \u00a7 162, p. 365 (1974). Our Supreme Court has said that \u201c \u2018[r]obbery is an offense against the person, the distinguishing characteristic of which is the intimidation of the victim.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>196 Conn. 395, 400, 493 A.2d 209 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>175 Conn. 569, 573, 402 A.2d 759 (1978); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Childree, </em>189 Conn. 114, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>123, 454 A.2d 1274 (1992). We have said the same. <em>State </em>v. <em>Channer, </em>28 Conn. App. 161, 165, 612 A.2d 95, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 921, 614 A.2d 826 (1992). Robbery in the second degree is a crime against the person; it is a crime of violence, and the taking that accompanies this crime is aggravated by the display or threatened use by the perpetrator of what he represents to be a deadly weapon or a dangerous weapon. The penal code commission comment to the legislative definition of \u201crobbery\u201d in \u00a7 53a-133 contains the following statement: \u201cThe basic rationale is protection against the <em>terror </em>of the forcible taking.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Connecticut General Statutes (1969), p. 64. Such a comment hardly palliates the violent nature of this crime and its focus on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">We turn to statements of our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 497-98, 594 A.2d 906 (1991): \u201c[D]istinct repetitions of a prohibited act, however closely they may follow each other . . . may be punished as separate crimes without offending the double jeopardy clause. . . . The same transaction, in other words, may constitute separate and distinct crimes where it is susceptible of separation into parts, each of which in itself constitutes a completed offense. . . . [T]he test is not whether the criminal intent is one and the same and inspiring the whole transaction, but whether separate acts have been committed with the requisite criminal intent and are such as are made punishable by the [statute].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) As concerns \u00a7 53a-133, the singular1 term \u201canother person\u201d has been construed \u201cto evince the legislative purpose that a spatially indistinct robbery of two individuals be punishable as two separate offenses of robbery. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>[supra, 206 Conn. 666-67].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>supra, 498. \u201cThe plain terms of \u00a7 53a-133,\u201d which provide that a person \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>mits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, [he] engages in forcible conduct with a proscribed purpose,\u201d demonstrates that the legislature has \u201cexpressly designated the course of committing a larceny, rather than the course of forcible conduct, as the time frame for completion of the offense of robbery.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 498-99. Our Supreme Court expressed the view that \u201c[a] fundamental purpose of the criminal law is to protect individual citizens from the criminal conduct of another. People are neither fungible nor amorphous. Where crimes against persons are involved, a separate interest of society has been invaded for each violation. Therefore when two or more persons are the victims of a single episode there are as many offenses as there are victims.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Lytell, supra, 666 (robbery). A person who intentionally embarks upon and pursues a course of conduct that includes the use or threat of immediate use of physical force upon three persons for the purposes plainly provided for in our robbery statutes is certainly more culpable than one who threatens only one other person. There is, justifiably, a natural inclination to attribute greater gravity to threatening or endangering several persons rather than one.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Further, in pressing his claim of statutory ambiguity, the defendant argues that the statutory definition of \u201cowner\u201d in \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (5) \u201cis at the heart of the problem.\u201d This is so, he argues, because the number of owners involved depends upon one\u2019s \u201clevel of view.\u201d At one level, all of the property belongs to the bank thus resulting in one \u201cowner\u201d while, at the other level, each teller has a right to possession superior to that of the robber, with the result that there are three \u201cowners.\u201d We see no ambiguity. Section 53a-118 (a) (5) defines \u201cowner\u201d as meaning \u201cany person who has a right to possession superior to that of a taker, obtainer or with-holder.\u201d There is no question that each of the three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>tellers had such a right, as to the currency taken that was superior to that of the defendant. \u201c \u2018As Justice Holmes put it in <em>Roschen </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>279 U.S. 337, 339, 49 S. Ct. 336, 73 L. Ed. 722 (1929): \u201c[T]here is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 153, 460 A.2d 26 (1983).\u201d <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>202 Conn. 158, 168, 520 A.2d 190 (1987). \u201cCommon sense should be applied to the language of a penal statute, particularly if otherwise absurdity or frustration of the evident design of the legislature results.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morelli, </em>25 Conn. App. 605, 609, 595 A.2d 932 (1991). We conclude that the legislature clearly intended to punish individual acts of robbery separately as to each victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">We now turn to <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 657, which the state argues is controlling on the double jeopardy claim. The defendant claims <em>Lytell </em>is not controlling because in <em>Lytell, </em>the court addressed a different question than is presented in this case. The defendant argues that the question here is \u201cwhether the legislature, in enacting part IX of the penal code, intended multiple robbery convictions where the property of a single business establishment is forcibly taken from two or more employees.\u201d Nothing in the relevant statutes or legislative history, he continues, \u201cunambiguously suggests such an intention.\u201d <em>Lytell, </em>however, he maintains, presented a distinctly different question, and that was \u201cwhether the legislature intended multiple robbery convictions where the property of a single business establishment is forcibly taken from the owner and another person.\u201d He claims that, \u201c[u]like <em>Lytell, </em>the plain language of \u00a7 53a-133 does not unambiguously suggest that the legislature intended multiple robbery convictions where the <em>victims </em>are two or more employees.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>There can be no doubt that in <em>Lytell </em>the court held that \u201cwhen two or more persons are the victims of a single episode there are as many offenses as there are victims.\u201d Id., 666. It is true that in <em>Lytell </em>the court was not presented with the issue of the robbery of two \u201cemployees\u201d of a single business establishment. It was, however, addressing the robbery of two persons in a single business establishment. Nevertheless, <em>Lytell </em>is factually distinguishable, given the issue as framed by the defendant to meet the state\u2019s claim under that case. We cannot say, therefore, that <em>Lytell, </em>as the state claims, is controlling on the double jeopardy claim of the defendant, but it is certainly instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The question to be resolved is whether the legislature intended that where several \u201cemployees\u201d of a single business establishment were the victims of robbery, as here, their status as \u201cemployees\u201d excluded them from or placed them beyond the intended reach of the term \u201cperson\u201d under our robbery statutes. We think not. Sutherland states that \u201c [t]he way to judge the probative force of any textual consideration is by reference to common language usage.\u201d 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Singer 1992) \u00a7 47.01, p. 137. \u201c \u2018The words used [in a statute] are to be construed according to their commonly approved usage. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cataudella, </em>159 Conn. 544, 553, 271 A.2d 99 (1970), quoting <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 280, 240 A.2d 886 (1968). There is no authoritative basis given us by the defendant, nor do we find any, for concluding that the term \u201cperson\u201d as used in the robbery statutory scheme is to be given anything but its common meaning, and that would include a \u201cperson\u201d who was an \u201cemployee.\u201d The legislature even chose to include its own definition section for part IX of the penal code, in which it defined words for purposes of that part that otherwise might be considered words of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>common meaning.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These definitions did not include \u201cperson.\u201d Even applying the view that a penal statute should be strictly construed, \u201cthe words of a statute are to be construed with common sense and according to the commonly approved usage of the language.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Millstein, </em>8 Conn. App. 581, 598, 513 A.2d 1253, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 814, 518 A.2d 72 (1986). \u201c[A penal] statute should not be read so as to add to, or to subtract from that which is readily found therein.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>232 Kan. 760, 762, 658 P.2d 1021 (1983); 3 J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 59.06, pp. 129-30. It is our duty to \u201cinterpret statutes as they are written.\u201d <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980). \u201c \u2018Courts cannot, by construction, read into statutes provisions which are not clearly stated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glastonbury </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>209 Conn. 175, 179, 550 A.2d 8 (1988), quoting <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Guman, </em>163 Conn. 439, 444, 311 A.2d 57 (1972). The legislature is quite aware of how to use language when it wants to express its intent to qualify or limit the operation of a statute. There is nothing to demonstrate, as is incumbent upon the defendant, that the legislature intended to exclude any \u201cperson,\u201d including an employee, or to exclude any locus or venue, including a business establishment, from the reach of the robbery statute as being the scene of a robbery. No such intent is at all evident from the clear text of the robbery statutory scheme in part IX of the penal code, and there is no need here to resort to any other aids of interpretation. See <em>Mad River Co. </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>137 Conn. 680, 687-88, 81 A.2d 119 (1951). Moreover, when the legislature enacts a statute in general terms, it is assumed the statute will apply prospectively to persons and subjects falling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>within its terms. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>858 F. Sup. 434, 443 (D.N.J. 1994). The United States Supreme Court has said that where \u201cCongress has made a choice of language which fairly brings a given situation within a statute, it is unimportant that the particular situation may not have been contemplated by the legislators.\u201d <em>Barr </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 U.S. 83, 90, 65 S. Ct. 522, 89 L. Ed. 765 (1945). \u201c[I]t is not the province of the court to do what the legislature chose not to do.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>231 Conn. 545, 559, 651 A.2d 1264 (1995), citing <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>179 Conn. 102, 106, 425 A.2d 588 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In sum, we conclude that there was no violation of the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights under either the United States or the Connecticut constitutions because of his conviction and punishment on the three counts of robbery in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-134 in the trial court. Implicit in this conclusion is the determination that the defendant\u2019s claims of ambiguity lack merit.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that his rights under the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and under Connecticut law were violated by his conviction and cumulative punishment on the offenses of robbery in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (2) and the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>sion of a class C felony with a firearm in violation of \u00a7 53-202k. Although this issue was not raised in the trial court, it does involve a fundamental constitutional right and we will review the claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We, however, \u201cwill apply only the traditional federal constitutional analysis\u201d to this claim because \u201c[t]he defendant has not provided a separate analysis under state constitutional law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 571, 638 A.2d 578 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>supra, 25 Conn. App. 249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The defendant argues that his right against double jeopardy was violated because he was convicted and punished in a single trial for charges arising out of the same act or transaction,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which charges were, in reality, for the same offense. Drawing upon <em>Blockburger </em>and its progeny, he contends that the statutory elements of both offenses charged are \u201cvirtually identical\u201d and that it is difficult to perceive how a defendant could violate \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (2) as charged without also violating \u00a7 53-202k. He urges that even if the offenses do not stand in the relationship of \u201cgreater\u201d and \u201clesser\u201d offense and do not satisfy the <em>Blockburger </em>test, we should nevertheless find that the offenses as charged were \u201cmerely nominally distinct from\u201d each other. The double jeopardy clause prohibits cumulative punishment for nominally distinct offenses if the two offenses are substantially the same. <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 91, 444 A.2d 896 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Goldson, </em>178 Conn. 422, 425, 423 A.2d 114 (1979). We cannot agree with the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Conn. 18, 26, 557 A.2d 917 (1989), our Supreme Court, quoting from <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 366, 103 S.

Ed. 2d 535 (1983), stated: \u201cWith respect to cumulative sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the . . . court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 706, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991). Our Supreme Court has also stated: \u201cThe application of the <em>Blockburger </em>test, however, does not end our analysis of the double jeopardy issue. \u2018[T]he <em>Blockburger </em>rule is not controlling when the legislative intent is clear from the face of the statute or the legislative history.\u2019 <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[471 U.S. 773, 779, 105 S. Ct. 2407, 85 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1985)]; <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>supra, 368; <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, [450 U.S.] 340; <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 691-92, 100 S.

Double jeopardy protection against cumulative punishments is only \u2018designed to ensure that the sentencing discretion of the courts is confined to the limits established by the legislature.\u2019 <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 493, 499, 104 S. Ct. 2536, 81 L. Ed. 2d 425, reh. denied, 468 U.S. 1224, 105 S. Ct. 20, 82 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1984).\u2018Where . . . a legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those two statutes proscribe the \u201csame\u201d conduct under <em>Blockburger, </em>a court\u2019s task of statutory construction is at an end and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial.\u2019 <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>supra, 368-69. \u2018The <em>Blockburger </em>test is a \u201crule of statutory construction,\u201d and because it serves as a means of discerning congressional purpose the rule should not be controlling where, for example, there is a clear indication of contrary legislative intent.\u2019 <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 340; <em>Beam </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number><em>Foltz, </em>832 F.2d 1401, 1411 (6th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 980, 108 S. Ct. 1278, 99 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1988). The language, structure and legislative history of a statute can provide evidence of this intent. <em>Garrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 779.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>216 Conn. 282, 292-93, 579 A.2d 84 (1990). \u201cWhatever views may be entertained regarding severity of punishment, whether one believes in its efficacy or its futility . . . these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy. <em>Gore v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S. Ct. 1280, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1405 [1958], <em>State </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>171 Conn. 677, 679, 372 A.2d 99 (1976).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 419, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">An examination of the express language of the statute in \u00a7 53-202k clearly shows that the legislature intended to punish felonious activity under two separate statutes. This is particularly so because it expressly provides for the imposition of a nonsuspendable five year term that is to be \u201cin addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for conviction of such felony\u201d albeit A, B or C (felony committed under circumstances as earlier provided in statute). The legislative intent to enhance the punishment under \u00a7 53-202k is apparent. As a further indication that \u00a7 53-202k states a separate offense for which punishment may be imposed, its non-suspendable consecutive term of five years provision is unique in that it \u201cstands alone and is not based on a multiplier of the penalty for [any of] the predicate offense [that triggers its operation].\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 294-95. It also bears noting that \u00a7 53-202k was enacted with other legislation in 1993 to address separate evils presented by the illegal use of various types of firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The two statutes, i.e., \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (5) and \u00a7 53-202k, are not \u201cmerely nominally distinct\u201d from each other; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 162, 471 A.2d 632 (1984); nor are they \u201csubstantially the same.\u201d See <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>v. <em>Goldson, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 425. In short, they are separate offenses. The defendant has failed to show that the <em>Blockburger </em>test has resulted in a conclusive presumption requiring a finding of the claimed double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-135 provides: \u201cRobbery in the second degree: Class C felony, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in 1he second degree when he commits robbery as defined in section 53a-133 and (1) he is aided by another person actually present; or (2) in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom he or another participant in the crime displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">\u201c(b) Robbery in the second degree is a class C felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k provides: \u201cCommission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm: Five-year nonsuspendable sentence.
