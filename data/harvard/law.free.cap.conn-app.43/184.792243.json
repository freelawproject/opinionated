The plaintiff brought a six count complaint to recover an attorney\u2019s fee from the defendant on the basis of an alleged fee protection agreement. He claims that the trial court improperly concluded that he was not entitled to recover as to (1) the first count sounding in breach of contract, (2) the second count in quantum meruit for services performed, (3) the third count on a theory of unjust enrichment, (4) the fourth count on a theory of tortious breach of contract, (5) the fifth count on a theory of misrepresentation, and (6) the sixth count on a Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claim. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The following facts are undisputed. In June, 1988, Allen Chatt and Gail Chatt retained the plaintiff to represent them concerning their claims for damages arising out of an automobile accident. The Chatts did not enter into a written fee agreement with the plaintiff. Although the plaintiff and the Chatts both claimed that an oral agreement existed, they differed as to its terms. The plaintiff worked on the Chatts\u2019 file for approximately thirteen months. In July, 1989, the Chatts discharged the plaintiff and retained the defendant and his law firm to represent them.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The defendant and the Chatts entered into a written retainer agreement on July 10, 1989. When the defendant requested the Chatts\u2019 file,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff agreed to surrender it as soon as the defendant complied with Formal Opinion 31 of the Connecticut Bar Association.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the defendant responded by letter stating that \u201c[u]pon the conclusion <em>of </em>the Chatt matter, <em>I will hold in my client's funds account the amount required under your contingency arrangement </em>until its disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tion has been determined by agreement or by litigation,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the plaintiff turned over the Chatts\u2019 file. The defendant did not request a copy of a written fee agreement at that time. At the time of the file transfer, the plaintiff had not drafted pleadings or filed a complaint, and had conducted minimal research on the case. The defendant reimbursed the plaintiff at that time for his out-of-pocket costs, $29.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In December, 1990, the defendant settled the Chatt case after nine days of trial, resulting in attorney\u2019s fees of $680,000. The formal settlement agreement was executed on January 8, 1991. On January 2, 1991, the plaintiff, who had learned about the settlement from a source other than the defendant, contacted the defendant to inquire about the fee. The defendant requested evidence of the contingency fee agreement between the plaintiff and the Chatts. When no evidence of a written agreement was produced, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff any portion of the fee and refused to escrow any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The plaintiff then brought the present action seeking to recover a portion of the attorney\u2019s fee under theories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>of breach of contract, quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, tortious breach of contract, misrepresentation, and a violation of CUTPA. The defendant moved for summary judgment on all counts, and the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on the first three counts. The trial court granted summary judgment on all counts in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment, we must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Practice Book \u00a7 384 .... <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>221 Conn. 149, 155, 602 A.2d 988 (1992).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>CTB Realty Ventures XXII, Inc. </em>v. <em>Markoski, </em>33 Conn. App. 388, 391, 636 A.2d 379, cert. granted, 228 Conn. 929, 640 A.2d 115 (1994) (appeal withdrawn July 18, 1994). Because the plaintiff conceded at oral argument that no genuine issues of material fact exist in this case, \u201c[w]e . . . need to determine only whether, on the basis of the uncontroverted facts, the [defendant was] entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Id., 392; see <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 640, 643 n.2, 638 A.2d 1 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly held that he was not entitled to recover on his breach of contract claim. The trial court concluded that \u201c[t]he defendants\u2019 promise to hold in the client\u2019s fund an amount required by the plaintiffs contingency arrangement was subject to the condition precedent of delivery of that agreement to the defendants.\u201d The court further concluded that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs failure to provide the Chatts with a written contingency agreement, a violation of the provisions of [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-251c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>(a), cannot give rise to a right to performance from the defendants.\u201d Because we agree with the trial court that the plaintiffs violation of \u00a7 52-251c (a) precludes his recovery from the defendant, we find no merit in his claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">There is no dispute that the plaintiff had an oral, rather than written, contingency agreement with the Chatts. The plaintiff challenges the trial court\u2019s determination that this bars his recovery from the defendant. The plaintiff argues that an oral contingency agreement between an attorney and a client is not invalid. The language of \u00a7 52-251c (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> clearly requires that all contingency fee agreements be reduced to writing. <em>Beizer </em>v. <em>Goepfert, </em>28 Conn. App. 693, 705, 613 A.2d 1336, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 901, 615 A.2d 1044, cert. denied, 507 U.S. 973, 113 S. Ct. 1416, 122 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1993). The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in the statute connotes that the performance of the requirement is mandatory rather than permissive. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 240, 558 A.2d 986 (1989); <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 717, 513 A.2d 43 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">It is well established that contracts that violate public policy are unenforceable. <em>Konover Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Zeller, </em>228 Conn. 206, 231, 635 A.2d 798 (1994), citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Crockett Co., </em>85 Conn. 282, 287, 82 A. 569 (1912); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>137 Conn. 410, 412, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>78 A.2d 240 (1951). Section 52-251c \u201cwas intended to regulate the attorney-client relationship in order to protect plaintiffs from excessive legal fees.\u201d <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 830 n.22, 614 A.2d 414 (1992). Where a law is passed for the protection of the public, we will not undermine the remedial purposes of the statute by enforcing an oral contract in contravention of the law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 720 (refusing to enforce oral contract by home improvement contractor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 20-429); <em>DiBiase </em>v. <em>Garnsey, </em>103 Conn. 21, 28, 130 A. 81 (1925) (refusing to enforce oral contract for auto repairs in excess of $50 in violation of \u00a7 63 of chapter 400 of the Public Acts of 1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The plaintiff argues, as an alternative, that the requirement that a contingency agreement be in writing serves only to protect a client and that the agreement that he seeks to enforce is independent of the oral contingency agreement he had with the Chatts. In other words, the plaintiff asserts that \u00a7 52-25lc (a) does not protect the defendant from liability on their separate agreement. The defendant promised the plaintiff that: \u201cUpon the conclusion of the Chatt matter, I will hold in my client\u2019s funds account the amount required under your contingency arrangement . . . .\u201d We agree that the plaintiffs agreement with the defendant is a separate transaction from the plaintiffs agreement with the Chatts. The unenforceability of the oral contingency agreement, however, requires the conclusion that the defendant was not obligated to hold any funds for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The agreement provides that the defendant was required to hold in his clients\u2019 funds account only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>amount that the Chatts were legally obligated to pay the plaintiff pursuant to the oral contingency agreement. Because the defendant was required to hold only those amounts that the Chatts were obligated to pay the plaintiff, and the Chatts were under no legal obligation to pay the plaintiff, the defendant was never contractually bound to hold or pay any amount to the plaintiff. See <em>West Haven </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co., </em>supra, 221 Conn. 164 (because insured was under no legal obligation to pay punitive damages award, insurer never contractually bound to pay that sum on behalf of insured).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly determined that he did not have a right to recover from the defendant in quantum meruit and under the doctrine of unjust enrichment. He argues that it is well established that an attorney may recover the value of his legal services even absent an express agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree that the plaintiff may recover under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u201c[A] quasi . . . contract is not a contract, but an obligation which the law creates out of the circumstances present, even though a party did not assume the obligation, and may not have intended but in fact actually dissented from it. . . . <em>It is based on equitable </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>principles </em>to operate whenever justice requires compensation to be made. . . . With no other test than what, under a given set of circumstances, is just or unjust, equitable or inequitable, conscionable or unconscionable, it becomes necessary in any case where the benefit of the doctrine is claimed to examine the circumstances and the conduct of the parties and apply this standard.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bershtein, Bershtein &amp; Bershtein </em>v. <em>Nemeth, </em>221 Conn. 236, 242, 603 A.2d 389 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The trial court determined that the plaintiffs equitable claims \u201chave as its foundation the plaintiffs own violation of the code of ethics. Under such circumstances, enforcement of the plaintiffs claims would appear to undermine judicial integrity. . . . The agreement between the parties, evidenced by their written exchange, failed because of the plaintiffs failure to provide the necessary contingency agreement. That failure belies the claims of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit.\u201d We conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment on counts two and three of the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">As we said earlier, \u00a7 52-251c protects injured persons from excessive legal fees. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 830 n.22. The plaintiff, nevertheless, continues to argue that the public does not require protection when the file has been transferred to another attorney and the plaintiff seeks only to recover from the successor attorney. We disagree. It would be unjust to permit an attorney to avoid this public policy by splitting a fee with a successor attorney. Moreover, by enacting \u00a7 52-251c without qualification, the legislature has imposed its view that it is more urgent to protect clients from attorneys than to protect attorneys from successor attorneys. See <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>215 Conn. 316, 326-27, 576 A.2d 455 (1990) (holding that \u00a7 20-429 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>protects consumers from unscrupulous contractors). Because the plaintiff in this case has violated \u00a7 52-251c, thereby leaving his clients exposed to the possibility of excessive legal fees, the plaintiff may not recover from the successor counsel under equitable principles. See <em>Bershtein, Bershtein &amp; Bershtein </em>v. <em>Nemeth, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 243 (plaintiff attorney did not deliver requested accounting or case file to successor attorney); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>137 Conn. 410, 412, 414, 78 A.2d 240 (1951) (plaintiff attorney denied recovery on quantum meruit where he had agreed to accept one third of award of alimony as compensation).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The plaintiff claims finally that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on counts four, five and six of his complaint. In those counts, the plaintiff alleged tortious breach of contract, misrepresentation and a violation of CUTPA, respectively. We conclude that the trial court properly granted summary judgment because each of these claims relies on the plaintiffs oral contingency agreement with the Chatts, which we have concluded is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">First, our earlier conclusion that the defendant did not breach his agreement with the plaintiff, but rather that the defendant had no legal obligation because of the unenforceability of the oral contingency agreement, disposes of count four. Second, a claim of misrepresentation requires proof that the plaintiff relied on a false representation that the defendant made as a statement of fact and thereby suffered injury. <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>232 Conn. 666, 683, 657 A.2d 1087 (1995); <em>Meyers </em>v. <em>Cornwell Quality Tools, Inc., </em>41 Conn. App. 19, 27 n.15, 674 A.2d 444 (1996). \u201c \u2018[A] plaintiff who has not suffered damage or injury cannot pursue an action at law or in equity for . . . damages resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>fraudulent actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>supra, 683, quoting <em>Kilduff </em>v. <em>Adams, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 314, 329, 593 A.2d 478 (1991). Finally, a claim for recovery of damages under CUTPA requires proof of an ascertainable loss. <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>191 Conn. 484, 493, 464 A.2d 847 (1983).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Once again, the plaintiffs own failure to obtain a written contingency agreement with his clients produces the result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In this opinion LANDAU, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-20\"> Alan E.

The commission explained that it was issuing the revised opinion because of new developments in the law and the adoption of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct in 1983. One important change in the revised opinion is the omission of language from the prior opinion that required successor counsel, when representing the same client on the same matter, to reach an agreement with prior counsel concerning fee reimbursement before accepting the case. The revised opinion is cast, instead, in terms of the discharged lawyer\u2019s duties with respect to the former client\u2019s file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">Revised Formal Opinion No. 31 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWe hold that a discharged lawyer on a contingency fee violates Rule 1.16 (d) when he retains the file after demand for its surrender if (a) there is an agreement with the client or successor counsel concerning payment of fees and expenses or (b) successor counsel provides the discharged lawyer with a letter that he will hold in his clients\u2019 funds sufficient proceeds from the settlement to pay the discharged lawyer what he would have been entitled to under his contingency fee agreement . . . until the fee dispute is resolved by a court or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Rule 1.16 (d) of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Conduct (1983) provides in pertinent part: \u201cUpon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client\u2019s interests, such as . . . surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled ....

The court did not comment on that conclusion. The court also recognized that \u00a7 52-251c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>did not apply in that case because the defendant\u2019s injury predated the effective date of the statute.

Not only does that case involve a factual situation to which \u00a7 52-251c would not apply, but it also clearly predated the effective date of the statute. See footnote 9.

I respectfully dissent from part II of the majority opinion. It is undisputed that a trial court may grant a summary judgment where, under applicable principles of substantive law, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Suarez </em>v. <em>Dickmont Plastics Corp., </em>229 Conn. 99, 105, 639 A.2d 507 (1994). The majority, however, cites no substantive applicable law, statutory or common, that compels the conclusion that a violation of \u00a7 52-251c is an outright bar to an attorney\u2019s action in quantum meruit against a successor attorney. The majority states that, under equitable quasi-contract principles, it would be \u201cunjust to permit an attorney to avoid th[e] public policy by splitting a fee with a successor attorney.\u201d Such a construction suggests that the majority has adopted a per se rule, foreclosing recovery from a successor attorney under any set of circumstances, as long as the attorney failed to have the client sign a written contract. I believe that the equitable contract principles on which we should focus are those that have traditionally been the basis for an award under the restitutionary theories of quantum meruit and unjust enrichment: only those circumstances that existed between the two pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>parties,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> here the plaintiff and the defendant. If the trial court limited its review of this matter to the transaction between the parties, then it would have had to determine whether the defendant benefited from the plaintiffs work product. Such a determination is a question of fact and thus inappropriate for summary judgment. It may be that the trial court, after applying traditional quasi-contract principles, would have concluded that the plaintiff should receive only a minimal amount for his work product, but because the value of an attorney\u2019s services are recoverable under quantum meruit,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he should at least be afforded the opportunity to present whatever evidence he has, if any, regarding the value of the services he had conferred upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The majority also states that it is more urgent to protect the public from attorneys than to protect attorneys from successor attorneys. For this proposition, it <em>cites Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>215 Conn. 316, 326-27, 576 A.2d 455 (1990). <em>Barrett Builders </em>considered whether a contractor can recover in quantum meruit from a homeowner where the contractor failed to comply with the written contract requirement in General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 of the Home Improvement Act. Id., 320. In concluding that the contractor could not recover, the Supreme Court stated that it is more important to protect consumers from unscrupulous contractors than to protect contractors from manipulative consumers. <em>Barrett Builders, </em>therefore, presented a situation where the interests of the plaintiff contractor and the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>sumer were in direct conflict. That is clearly not the case here. The ability of an attorney to recover from a successor attorney in no way endangers the important public policy of protecting the public from excessive legal fees. The majority fails to explain precisely how its denial of the plaintiffs cause of action is inextricably linked to a furtherance of the public policy, particularly in light of its statement that \u201cthe plaintiffs agreement \u25a0with the defendant is a separate transaction from the plaintiffs agreement with the Chatts.\u201d Because the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant was separate from the transaction between the plaintiff and the Chatts, it should be treated as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">I would reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\"> \u201cThe theory of restitution as a basis for recovery encompasses both unjust enrichment and quantum meruit as the terms have been used in Connecticut cases. Broadly speaking, the availability of restitution is dependent upon unjust enrichment, that is, upon a perceived injustice because <em>one party has benefited at the expense of another. . . . </em>\u2018The question is: Did he [the party liable], to the detriment of someone else, obtain something of value to which he was not entitled?\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Koellmer, </em>11 Conn.
