We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The record discloses the following factual and procedural history. The defendant was arrested on drug charges early in 1992 and thereafter was recruited as a confidential informant by the Norwalk police department. He informed the police that Tim Lee was involved in marijuana trafficking. During the ensuing investigation of Lee, the defendant arranged to purchase marijuana from Lee. That transaction was observed by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>officer of the Norwalk police department, but without the knowledge of the police, the defendant had also arranged to sell cocaine to Lee. Some time after that transaction, the defendant killed Lee during an argument over the cocaine sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The following facts relating to the defendant\u2019s statements were set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Piorkowski, </em>236 Conn. 388, 672 A.2d 921 (1996). \u201cOn approximately October 10, 1992, Lee\u2019s body was discovered in New Jersey. In the early morning of October 20, 1992, Norwalk Detective Robert DeLallo learned that Christine Thompson, a friend of Lee, had given New Jersey police a statement implicating the defendant in Lee\u2019s murder. At approximately 7:30 a.m. on October 20, DeLallo and other officers located the defendant in Norwalk and, during a frisk of the defendant for weapons, found drugs and drug paraphernalia on his person. The police arrested the defendant on drug charges, orally advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and brought him to the Norwalk police station at approximately 8 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u201cThe defendant was not presented in court on the drug charges on October 20, but was held in the police department lockup while the police continued to investigate Lee\u2019s murder. At approximately 11 p.m., on October 20, the police secured an arrest warrant charging the defendant with Lee\u2019s murder. At approximately midnight on October 21, [Detective James] Saraceni and Detective Nelson Alicia awakened the defendant in his lockup cell. The defendant indicated that he wanted to talk with Saraceni, after which the detectives took the defendant to an interview room, where Saraceni informed him that the police had an arrest warrant for the defendant on a murder charge. Saraceni told the defendant that he would talk to him only after giving him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and having him fill out a waiver of rights form. Saraceni read the waiver of rights form to the defendant, who did not sign the form. Sara-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ceni then interrogated the defendant in Alicia\u2019s presence. During the interrogation, the defendant spoke freely, giving a detailed statement implicating himself in Lee\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u201cThe detectives concluded their interrogation of the defendant at approximately 2 a.m. on October 21, 1992. Later that day, approximately twenty-six hours after his arrest on the drug charges, the defendant was arraigned in geographical area number twenty of the Superior Court on both the drug and murder charges; that court had been in session on October 20. A public defender was appointed to represent the defendant on both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u201cAt approximately 10:30 p.m. on October 21, DeLallo and Detective Charles Chrzanowski went to the home of Denise Van Valen, with whom the defendant lived, to ascertain whether she had any information regarding the murder of Lee. While they were in Van Valen\u2019s home, the defendant called her from the Bridgeport correctional center. Van Valen told the defendant that the detectives were there, and asked him if he wanted to talk to DeLallo. The defendant indicated that he did, and she handed the telephone to DeLallo. When the defendant asked DeLallo to come to the jail to speak to him, DeLallo told the defendant that he would try to see him at the jail the next day. When Van Valen visited the defendant at the jail on October 22, she learned that DeLallo had not yet visited the defendant. Later that day Van Valen called DeLallo and asked him why he had not yet visited the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u201cAlthough DeLallo was aware that the defendant was represented by an attorney on the murder charge, no call was placed to the public defender assigned to the defendant\u2019s case. After Van Valen\u2019s call to him on October 22, DeLallo spoke to assistant state\u2019s attorney James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Bemardi and state\u2019s attorney\u2019s inspector PM O\u2019Grady, in order to determine whether he could appropriately interview the defendant at the jail. Bemardi and O\u2019Grady advised DeLallo that, if the defendant had initiated the contact with him and had requested to speak with him, it was permissible to interview him regarding the murder charge. Having obtained approval from the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, DeLallo and Alicia visited the defendant at the jail on the evening of October 22. Neither the detectives nor the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office informed the defendant\u2019s counsel of the detectives\u2019 intention to interview the defendant. The detectives read him a <em>Miranda </em>rights and waiver form, which he initialed and signed. They then interviewed him about the Lee murder, and he gave another oral statement.\u201d Id., 393-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The defendant moved to suppress the October 21 statement on the grounds that (1) he had not waived his Miranda<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> rights and (2) the statement was the product of a violation of his right to a prompt arraignment, as provided under \u00a7 54-lc. In the same motion, the defendant moved to suppress the October 22 statement on the grounds that (1) the statement was the fruit of the illegal October 21 interrogation, and (2) the statement was taken in violation of his right to counsel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The trial court denied the motion to suppress, concluding that (1) the defendant had knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to making the October 21 statement, (2) the defendant\u2019s arraignment was timely because \u00a7 54-lg requires arraignment no later than the next court day following an arrest, (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the October 22 statement was not invalid because the defendant had validly waived his rights on October 21, and (4) the defendant\u2019s right to counsel pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution was not violated because that section does not require that counsel be present for a valid postarraignment waiver of the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The defendant entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere to the charge of murder with the agreement of the state and the approval of the court. The defendant expressly conditioned his plea on the right to vacate it if his appeal of the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was successful with respect to either or both of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The trial court correctly noted that the defendant\u2019s prompt presentment claim made pursuant to \u00a7 54-lg is controlled by three cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vollhardt, </em>157 Conn. 25, 39, 244 A.2d 601 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Darwin, </em>155 Conn. 124, 133-34, 230 A.2d 573 (1967), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 391 U.S. 346, 88 S. Ct. 1488, 20 L. Ed. 2d 630 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>11 Conn. App. 238, 239, 526 A.2d 562 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In <em>Darwin, </em>the defendant was arrested at about 9:40 a.m. on Friday, December 6,1963. General Statutes \u00a7 54-lb provided at that time that any person arrested be \u201cpresented before the circuit court session next held in the circuit where the offense is alleged to have been committed.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-lc provided at that time that \u201c[a]ny admission, confession or statement, written or oral, obtained from an accused person who has not been so presented to the first session of the [circuit] court . . . shall be inadmissible.\u201d The Circuit Court convened at 10 a.m. on December 6, 1963, but was not in session on Saturday, December 7 or Sunday, December 8. Darwin was presented at the court session on Monday, December 9, 1963. Darwin claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>because he was arrested at 9:40 a.m. on December 6, the next session of the Circuit Court was convened at 10 a.m. that day. He claimed that because he was not presented on December 6, his statement made between his arrest and his arraignment on December 9 should be suppressed. The Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that the \u201cnext session\u201d of the Circuit Court meant the regular session next to be held, excluding any session held on the day of the arrest. <em>State </em>v. <em>Darwin, </em>supra, 155 Conn. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In <em>Vollhardt, </em>the defendant did not claim that there was a delay in his presentment to the Circuit Court, but rather that his statements made after his arrest and before arraignment should be suppressed because \u00a7\u00a7 54-1b and 54-1c, as then constituted, rendered inadmissible any confession obtained before an accused had been warned of his constitutional rights in court. In rejecting this claim, our Supreme Court stated: \u201cWe cannot agree with this construction. The language of the statutes is clear and unambiguous, and, accordingly, their intent is to be determined from the language used. . . . The purpose of the statutes is to ensure that an accused is presented before the session of the Circuit Court next held, <em>which in this case would be the day following his arrest, </em>at which time he must be advised of his rights before he is put to plea.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vollhardt, </em>supra, 157 Conn. 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In <em>Hardy, </em>this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress a statement taken after a defendant\u2019s arrest at 7:11 a.m. on September 19, 1985, and prior to the defendant\u2019s arraignment on the next regularly scheduled court date, September 20, 1985. We stated that \u201cour Supreme Court [in <em>Darwin] </em>rejected a claim of untimely arraignment under circumstances nearly identical to those in this case. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Vollhardt, </em>[supra, 157 Conn. 39]. The trial court, in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>suppress the defendant\u2019s statements, properly applied the holding <em>in Darwin.\u201d State </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>supra, 11 Conn. App. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The defendant, while acknowledging these three cases, argues that the change in \u00a7 54-lg from a requirement that an arrested person be \u201cpresented before the circuit court session next held\u201d to the present language that an arrested person \u201cshall be <em>promptly </em>presented before the superior court sitting next regularly\u201d vitiates the holdings of <em>Darwin </em>and <em>Vollhardt. </em>(Emphasis added.) He further claims that <em>Hardy </em>should not be deemed authoritative because, although the defendant\u2019s claim was made under the current version of the statute, counsel failed to bring to the court\u2019s attention the change in the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe defendant loads the term \u2018promptly\u2019 with too much freight.\u201d Unlike the decisions in <em>Darwin </em>and <em>Vollhardt, </em>our decision in <em>Hardy </em>came after the legislature added the word \u201cpromptly\u201d to the statutoiy provisions in effect at the time of arraignment. In that case, we cited <em>Darwin </em>and <em>Vollhardt </em>and concluded that the addition of the word \u201cpromptly\u201d did not diminish or overrule those two decisions. Moreover, although the legislature inserted the word \u201cpromptly\u201d in the statute, \u00a7 54-lg still requires presentment \u201cbefore the superior court <em>sitting next regularly </em>for the geographical area where the offense is alleged to have been committed. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the word \u201cpromptly,\u201d therefore, does not change the statute\u2019s essential meaning, specifically, that the defendant must be brought before the next session of the court, excluding any session held on the day of his arrest. Accordingly, we conclude that <em>Domain, Vollhardt </em>and <em>Hardy </em>mandate that we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The defendant claims that article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution precludes the admission of his October 22 statement given in the absence of counsel during a police interview that he initiated. He asserts that because he had previously been arraigned on the murder charge and was represented by counsel on that charge, he could not validly waive his right to counsel without the presence of counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">We begin our analysis by noting that the defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s findings that he initiated the police interview or that he validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. We also note that the trial court found that the defendant had six prior convictions, was an informant and, consequently, was familiar with his rights as a result of these prior involvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The defendant claims that the state constitutional right to counsel has significance independent of its sixth amendment federal counterpart.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), the defendant asserts his state constitutional claim using the following tools of analysis: (1) historical background, (2) holdings and dicta of the Supreme and Appellate Courts of Connecticut, (3) decisions of other states, (4) policy and sociological data, and (5) federal precedent. The defendant contends that a proper consideration of the <em>Geisler </em>factors should lead us to adopt, as a matter of state constitutional law, the prophylactic rule set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Settles, </em>46 N.Y.2d 154, 385 N.E.2d 612, 412 N.Y.S.2d 874 (1978). In <em>Settles, </em>the New York Court of Appeals decided that under the state constitution, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>proper postindictment waiver of counsel may occur only in the presence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">We agree with the defendant that Connecticut has a long tradition of supporting the right to counsel in criminal matters. Nevertheless, we conclude that <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 638, 534 A.2d 1199 (1987), precludes us from adopting the per se rule that the defendant advances. Our view of <em>Jones </em>also dispenses with the need to analyze the <em>Geisler </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In <em>Jones, </em>the defendant asked a police detective to come to his cell and talk to him, even though the defendant had been arraigned and had a right to counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After a valid waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant gave an incriminating statement to the detective. The trial court admitted the statement into evidence at trial. On appeal, the defendant claimed that his federal and state constitutional rights to counsel were violated by the admission of the statement. Our Supreme Court concluded that the defendant\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights to counsel and to remain silent were not violated when, \u201cafter the initiation of adversarial judicial criminal proceedings, a police officer, with the permission of the prosecuting attorney, met with him and interrogated him.\u201d Id., 641-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In <em>Jones, </em>the court addressed the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim. \u201cThe defendant also asserts the denial of his state constitutional right to counsel and denies having waived that right. . . . We make only two observations about the defendant\u2019s discussion of the state constitutional issue in his reply brief. First, he seems to claim that we ought to require a higher standard of waiver for <em>Miranda </em>rights than heretofore. Yet, he elucidates no analysis in that regard except to say that \u2018[ijdeally,\u2019 waiver should be in the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>a neutral magistrate or the defendant\u2019s lawyer and that \u2018[m]inimally,\u2019 it should be executed unambiguously and preserved on tape, videotape or in writing. We decline to take that step in this case. Second, the circumstances of this case, including the conduct of the defendant and the police, are such that the rights claimed to have been violated were \u2018scrupulously honored\u2019 under even a more liberal standard than that required by the United States constitution.\u201d Id., 641-42 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In deciding <em>People </em>v. <em>Settles, </em>supra, 46 N.Y.2d 164, the New York Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[t]he fact that [the] defendant did not have an attorney appointed at the time the police sought their waiver is a distinction without a difference as far as the right to counsel is concerned. The right to counsel is not dependent upon the speed with which an attorney can be retained nor does it pivot on the length of police delay in arraigning an indigent defendant so that counsel maybe appointed. To ground an indicted defendant\u2019s right to counsel upon such fortuitous criteria is to debase that right into nothing more than a race for the wary. ... Of course, a postindictment defendant may knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel at any stage of the judicial proceedings .... But no knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel may be said to have occurred without the essential presence of counsel.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The defendant asks us to incorporate into our interpretation of article first, \u00a7 8, the <em>Settles </em>per se rule that one may not waive counsel without counsel\u2019s presence after the initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings. We conclude that to do so would conflict with the approach of our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 638. In <em>Jones, </em>our Supreme Court did not adopt a bright line rule that once the right to counsel attaches, there can be no valid waiver of that right without the presence of counsel. In rejecting the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ant\u2019s claim, the court considered all of the circumstances and concluded that where the defendant, after being arraigned and in the absence of counsel, initiated the police interview, waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and gave a statement to a police officer, there was no violation of his state constitutional right to counsel.

The defendant elucidated no state constitutional analysis except to say that \u201c \u2018[ijdeally,\u2019 waiver should be in the presence of a neutral magistrate or the defendant\u2019s lawyer and that \u2018[m]in-imally,\u2019 it should be executed unambiguously and preserved on tape, videotape or in writing.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 641-42 n.3.

Our courts have made it abundantly clear that we will decline to review state constitutional claims that are not adequately briefed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>237 Conn. 454, 465 n.10, 678 A.2d 910 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Der Werff, </em>8 Conn.

Stoddard, 206 Conn. 157, 164-66, 537 A.2d 446 (1988), a case involving police interference with counsel\u2019s access to a custodial suspect, our Supreme Court discussed the historical significance of the right to counsel, even before that right attained federal constitutional importance. \u201cWhen the customary right to counsel was formally incorporated into the Connecticut constitution in 1818, \u2018the advice and services of counsel were regarded as crucial to a criminal defendant at any time, especially given the inability of a defendant to testify in Connecticut in 1818.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Davis, [199 Conn. 88, 99-100, 506 A.2d 86 (1986)]. More contemporary developments suggest that this state\u2019s commitment to securing the right to counsel has not diminished since 1818. Not only was Connecticut \u2018the first state to adopt the public defender system\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>154 Conn. 631, 635, 228 A.2d 132 (1967); but the right to counsel \u2018was secured to criminal defendants in this state long before the mandate of <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 [(1962) (holding that the fourteenth amendment incorporated the sixth amendment right to counsel)] . . . .\u2019 <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>168 Conn. 563, 566-67 n.2, 362 A.2d 871 (1975). The United States Supreme Court has turned to the historical experience of Connecticut in expanding the right to counsel under the federal constitution. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 827, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>[287 U.S. 45, 62-63, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>supra, 165. \u201cIt is clear, from this rich history, that the fundamental right to counsel is elevated to the highest order.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>228 Conn. 234, 260, 636 A.2d 760 (1994) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>In <em>Stoddard, </em>the Supreme Court specifically held that a custodial suspect must be informed promptly of timely efforts by counsel to render pertinent legal assistance. \u201cArmed with that information, the suspect must be permitted to choose whether he wishes to speak with counsel, in which event interrogation must cease, or whether he will forego assistance of counsel, in which event counsel need not be afforded access to the suspect.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 166-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Once the suspect is charged with a crime, however, the character of the police function shifts from investigatory to accusatory. \u201cFor this reason, the warnings which are sufficient to comply with the strictures against testimonial compulsion do not satisfy the higher standard with respect to a waiver of the right of counsel. Prior to [the information], there may be valid reasons why an uncounseled suspect might wish to deal with the police. He may nourish the hope, however vain, that he can avoid any legal entanglement by simply clearing up a few loose ends. Alternatively, he may feel that by getting into the good graces of the police as an informer he might be able to avoid [being charged] and trial . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Settles, </em>supra, 46 N.Y.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">I would conclude that the historical significance of counsel in Connecticut mandates an independent state constitutional doctrine providing that a criminal defendant who has been charged, is in custody, has been arraigned and has been appointed counsel may not waive his right to counsel for purposes of police interrogation unless he does so in the presence of counsel. Although a defendant may knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel at any stage of the judicial proceedings, no knowing and intelligent waiver of appointed counsel may be said to have occurred without the essential presence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
