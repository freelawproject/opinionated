He argues that the granting of a motion to cite in a party in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>to pursue an interpleader claim is not an immediately appealable order. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The following facts are necessary to the disposition of the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant and PRE Builders, Inc. (PRE), entered into an agreement for the performance of construction work on the defendant\u2019s house. The plaintiff then entered into a contract with PRE to furnish materials for PRE\u2019s use in completing the work on the defendant\u2019s house. The plaintiff furnished the materials, but PRE failed to pay the plaintiff. As a result, the plaintiff placed a mechanic\u2019s lien on the defendant\u2019s property and brought this foreclosure action.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The defendant does not contest that he owes $2250 for the work completed on his house pursuant to his contract with PRE. He alleges, however, that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notified him of its levy on any moneys owed to PRE and its hen against PRE for failure to pay taxes. Therefore, he argues that if he paid the plaintiff, he could still be liable to the IRS. The defendant therefore filed a motion to cite in the United States as a party, and a motion for permission to file an interpleader claim against the plaintiff and the United States pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-484.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted both motions and ordered the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to serve the United States and the plaintiff with an interpleader complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u201cThe general rule, which is embodied in the Connecticut interpleader statute, is that a party who is confronted with conflicting claims from various alleged creditors to a fund in his possession and who does not claim any interest in the fund . . . may in good faith interplead the various claimants . . . .\u201d <em>Franklin Construction Co. </em>v. <em>F &amp; M Concrete Construction Co., </em>35 Conn. Sup. 79, 81, 396 A.2d 510 (1978). An interpleader claim is most commonly raised in an independent action. It can be raised, however, as in this case, by counterclaim or cross claim. See <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Groton Savings Bank, </em>96 Conn. 325, 114 A. 88 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u201cA complaint in an interpleader action should allege only such facts as show that there are adverse claims to the fund or property and need not, in fact, should not, allege the basis upon which any claimant relies to justify his claim; the latter allegations are to be made in the statement of claim following the interlocutory judgment of interpleader.\u201d <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Advance Realty </em>Co., 9 Conn. Sup. 367, 368 (1941); Practice Book \u00a7 538.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The interlocutory judgment of interpleader determines the propriety of the interpleader procedure. 45 Am. Jur. 2d 179, Interpleader \u00a7 38 (Sup. 1996). Until the interlocutory judgment of interpleader has been rendered, there can be no trial on the merits of the interpleader proceeding. Practice Book \u00a7 539.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>interpleader proceeding, therefore, \u201cthere are, in effect, two separate and distinct suits, the first suit . . . [determining] whether there shall be a decree of inter-pleader, and the second . . . [determining] who shall get the fund or thing in dispute.\u201d 45 Am. Jur. 2d 459, Interpleader \u00a7 35 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In <em>Kerite Co. </em>v. <em>Alpha Employment Agency, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 432, 437-38, 352 A.2d 288 (1974), our Supreme Court held that the interlocutory judgment of inter-pleader is immediately appealable. The proceeding before us, however, has not yet reached the point of an interlocutory judgment of interpleader. At the time the plaintiff appealed, the only developments as to the interpleader matter were the granting of the defendant\u2019s motion to cite in the United States and the granting of his motion for permission to file an interpleader claim against the United States and the plaintiff. The defendant had not yet served the.parties nor filed the return with the court. A judgment, even an interlocutory judgment, cannot be rendered in an action that has not yet been brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The appeal is jurisdictionally defective because it was not taken from an immediately appealable interlocutory judgment. The appeal therefore must be dismissed. <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>L &amp; R Realty, </em>40 Conn. App. 492, 494, 671 A.2d 1315 (1996), citing <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>197 Conn. 82, 86, 495 A.2d 1063 (1985), and <em>Essex Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Frimberger, </em>26 Conn. App. 80, 81, 597 A.2d 1289 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-484 provides: \u201cWhenever any person has, or is alleged to have, any money or other property in his possession which is claimed by two or more persons, either he, or any of the persons claiming the same, may bring a complaint in equity, in the nature of a bill of interpleader, to any court which by law has equitable jurisdiction of the parties and amount in controversy, making all persons parties who claim to be entitled to or interested in such money or other property. Such court shall hear and determine all questions which may arise in the case, may tax costs at its discretion and, under the rules applicable to an action of interpleader, may allow to one or more of the parties a reasonable sum or sums for counsel fees and disbursements, payable out of such fund or property; but no such allowance shall be made unless it has been claimed by the party in his complaint or answer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 538 provides: \u201cThe complaint in an interpleader action shall allege only such facts as show that there are adverse claims to the fund or property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-10\"> Practice Book \u00a7 539 provides: \u201cNo trial on the merits of an interpleader action shall be had until (1) an interlocutory judgment of interpleader shall have been entered; and (2) all defendants shall have filed statements of claim, been defaulted or filed waivers. Issues shall be closed on the claims as in other cases. The complaint and the answer or disclaimer shell follow the applicable Practice Book forms as nearly as possible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
