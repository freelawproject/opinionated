The action was brought by Marcella D. Borkowski as administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband Anthony Borkowski (decedent) against the defendant, Chandra K. Sacheti, a cardiologist. The amended complaint is in three counts with both the first and second counts alleging in part that this is a \u201cnegligence action and statutory action [brought] pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 <em>52-555.\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The third count was brought by the plaintiff individually and sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>damages for loss of consortium.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first count alleges that the decedent\u2019s wrongful death was caused by the malpractice of the defendant, his agents or employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second count alleges that the negligence of the defendant, his agents or employees caused the decedent to suffer \u201ca lost or decreased chance of survival.\u201d We hereafter refer to the second count as the plaintiffs \u201closs of chance\u201d claim. The trial court submitted the first and third counts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the jury, which returned a verdict for the defendant on each of those counts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It declined to submit the second count to the jury, opining that there is no cognizable cause of action in Connecticut for recovery on the \u201closs of chance\u201d theory alleged in that second count. Later, the trial court denied the plaintiffs motions to set aside the verdict and for a new trial. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) refused to charge the jury on the second count, which sought compensation for a \u201clost or decreased chance\u201d of survival, (2) permitted the defendant to introduce evidence of contributory negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>when contributory negligence had not been pleaded and (3) refused to charge the juiy that the decedent had exercised reasonable care in attending to his health care needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In order to put what follows into context, we set out certain facts that the jury could reasonably have found. The decedent died on October 24, 1987, after suffering a myocardial infarction and being admitted to Rockville General Hospital. The decedent was forty-seven years of age at that time and had a history of heart problems. On August 6, 1985, he had sustained a myocardial infarction and the subsequent diagnosis was that of chronic stable angina pectoris. He was under the care of the defendant from 1985 until some time in 1987. During that period, he was treated with medication. The decedent was employed as the business manager at Manchester Community College. He was married and had one son about twelve years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The last time prior to the decedent\u2019s going to Rock-ville General Hospital on October 22, 1987, that the defendant had seen or spoken to him was on April 30, 1987. On that occasion, the defendant had examined him during a scheduled office visit. The decedent had also undergone a stress test in that office on that date. At that time, the defendant told him that this stress test was \u201cmore significant\u201d than his September, 1985 stress test, commenting that this latest stress test was \u201cabnormal.\u201d The defendant discussed the matter with him on April 30, 1987, and told the decedent that it was his feeling that the decedent should have an angiogram and that when he came in for his next scheduled visit \u201cwe will schedule the angiogram.\u201d The defendant told the decedent: \u201c[Y]ou really need a cardiac [catheterization], think it over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The decedent\u2019s next scheduled visit was set for June 24, 1987. He did not appear at the defendant\u2019s office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>on June 24,1987, nor did he contact that office concerning that appointment. In keeping with established office policy regarding a \u201cno show\u201d appointment, an attempt to contact the no show by telephone was presumably made and was followed two weeks later by an appointment card. On Sunday, October 18, 1987, the decedent told the plaintiff that, while taking his usual walk that day, he felt some shortness of breath and was not feeling well. He did not call the defendant\u2019s office that day. The decedent did not come to the office nor did he contact the defendant\u2019s office until October 19, 1987. The decedent was on vacation during the week of October 19, 1987. The plaintiff was at home recuperating from gall bladder surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">At this point, we refer to certain circumstances claimed by the plaintiff as surrounding the telephone calls the decedent allegedly made to the defendant\u2019s office starting on October 19, 1987, all of which the defendant vigorously denied ever took place. Those circumstances include the following claims of the plaintiff. On Monday, October 19,1987, the decedent dressed, ate and drove his son to school. The plaintiff claimed that on that day the decedent called the defendant\u2019s office,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> spoke to one of the defendant\u2019s employees and complained of his shortness of breath during his walk on October 18 and that an appointment was then made for Monday, October 26,1987. On Tuesday, October 20, 1987, he got up, prepared and ate his breakfast and drove his son to school. He did not complain to anyone that day that he was having any problems. On Wednesday, October 21, 1987, the decedent got up, drove his son to school and then drove the plaintiff to her medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>appointment. He told the plaintiff that he \u201cwas feeling anxious\u201d and she suggested that he try to have his October 26 appointment moved up. The plaintiff claimed that the decedent called the defendant\u2019s office and asked that his appointment be moved up. In doing so, he did not ask to speak to the defendant. On October 21, his appointment of October 26 was moved up to Friday, October 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Chronologically, we now come to further events disclosed by the evidence. On Thursday, October 22,1987, the decedent got up and drove his son to school. He was home until leaving sometime between 4 and 5 p.m. to do some errands for the plaintiff and to buy some batteries for his son. While he was out he encountered a friend and made tentative arrangements for that evening to go to that friend\u2019s house, some thirty minutes from his home, to watch a World Series game. Upon arriving home at about 7 p.m., he complained of a bad headache and, between 7:30 and 8 p.m., he called the defendant\u2019s office. The defendant\u2019s answering service answered the call. Shortly thereafter, the physician who was covering for the defendant at that time telephoned the decedent. The decedent told the physician that he had chest pain radiating into his left arm. The physician advised him to go to the emergency room at Rockville General Hospital. After taking a shower, the decedent went by ambulance to a hospital where he was admitted at 8:58 p.m. An electrocardiogram taken at that time showed that he had not had a heart attack, and he was started on thrombolytic treatment. At 10:40 p.m., however, about one and one-half hours after his admission, the decedent suffered cardiac arrest. He was successfully revived and remained in the hospital. On Saturday, October 24,1987, the decedent again suffered cardiac arrest and died.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We first address the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly refused to charge the jury on the sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ond count of her amended complaint, which sought compensation for a lost or decreased chance of the survival of the decedent. In doing so, she points out that the trial court refused to give her requested charge on the lost chance doctrine, maintaining that the trial court said that the doctrine was not a recognized cause of action in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The plaintiff argues that the lost chance doctrine is recognized in Connecticut and she points to <em>LaBieniec </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>11 Conn. App. 199, 526 A.2d 1341 (1987), which she claims this court recognized such a cause of action. The defendant, while acknowledging in his brief that <em>LaBieniec </em>\u201cdid not relax the established standards for proximate cause,\u201d nevertheless, argued before us that the attorneys who briefed <em>LaBieniec </em>in this court had not addressed Professor Joseph H. King\u2019s widely cited Yale Law Journal article. J. King, \u201cCausation, Valuation, and Chance in Personal Injury Torts Involving Preexisting Conditions and Future Consequences,\u201d 90 Yale L.J. 1353 (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Had that been done, he argues, the \u201cfundamental understanding\u201d of what this cause of action entails would have demonstrated that \u201cfundamentally in order to recognize this cause of action [one] would have to get into an alternative to the traditional rule of proximate cause.\u201d We note that, while instructive, Professor King\u2019s article does advocate an approach that was not adopted by the <em>LaBieniec </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In recent years, a growing line of cases, generally termed \u201closs of a chance\u201d cases, has put a strain on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>traditional causation analysis in medical malpractice cases. See comment, \u201cProving Causation in \u2018Loss of a Chance\u2019 Cases; A Proportional Approach,\u201d 34 Cath. U.L. Rev. 747 (1985). \u201cIn a loss of chance case, a tortfeasor, through his negligence, causes an individual to lose a chance to avoid some form of physical harm.\u201d Id., 749; <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>University Hospital Building, Inc., </em>445 So. 2d 1015 (Fla. 1984) (loss of chance to survive ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm); see, e.g., <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Inc., </em>27 Ohio St. 2d 242, 272 N.E.2d 97 (1971) (loss of chance to live). The traditional standard of the sufficiency of the evidence for submitting a medical malpractice case to the jury has required a plaintiff to adduce evidence of a reasonable medical probability that his injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of one or more of the defendants. This meant demonstrating that it is more likely than not that the injury, harm or condition claimed to have resulted from that negligence, was a substantial factor in causing the injury, harm or condition and without which that injury, harm or condition would not have occurred. See <em>Connellan </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>122 Conn. 136, 187 A.2d 901 (1936); <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>University Hospital Building, Inc., </em>supra, 1015; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Inc., </em>supra, 242. Where a preexisting condition is involved, a loss of chance plaintiff, in order to meet the traditional standard of causation, must prove that the victim of the alleged negligence probably would have survived had he been treated properly. If, however, the victim probably would not have survived, the cause of his death, if he died, would not have been the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, but the preexisting condition. So, to satisfy this traditional standard, the plaintiff must prove that prior to the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence, the victim had a chance of survival of at least 51 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In recent years, a number of states have sought to mitigate this result of the traditional causation standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>by adopting some version of the loss of chance doctrine. This doctrine has been the subject of much debate among courts and commentators. Generally speaking, courts have adopted three approaches<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in addressing this doctrine: (1) the relaxed causation approach, (2) the proportional approach, and (3) the traditional approach. As will be seen, the true loss of chance theory is essentially one of adopting a standard of causation that departs from the traditional standard applied in negligence cases. <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Cade, </em>255 Kan. 199, 204, 873 P.2d 175 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The relaxed causation approach, commonly referred to as the substantial chance approach, has been explained by one court that adopted it as follows: \u201c[T]he loss of chance theory is, essentially, one that allows an injured plaintiff to recover damages based upon a reduced standard of causation rather than the traditional one which requires the plaintiff to prove that it is more probable than not that the damage suffered was caused by the negligence of the defendant. . . . [The relaxed causation approach] requires plaintiff to present evidence that a substantial or significant chance of survival or better recovery was lost. If plaintiff meets this initial threshold, the causation issue is submitted to the jury, using the traditional proximate cause standard to ascertain whether, in fact, the alleged malpractice resulted in the loss of a substantial or significant chance. Thus, the jury must find by a preponderance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>of the evidence that the alleged negligence was the proximate cause of the lost chance, but the lost chance itself need only be a substantial or significant chance, for a better result, absent any malpractice, rather than a greater than 50 percent chance of a better result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 211-12. In effect, the relaxed causation approach loosens the traditional standard of evidentiary sufficiency, permitting the causation to be resolved by the fact finders and it requires submission of such a case to the fact finder even though there is no evidence of reasonable probability that the defendant\u2019s negligence caused the plaintiffs injury, harm or condition. See also <em>Herkovits </em>v. <em>Group Health Co-Op, </em>99 Wash. 2d 609, 614, 664 P.2d 474 (1983); see note, \u201cRecovery for Loss of Chance in a Wrongful Death <em>Action\u2014Herkovits v. Group Health, </em>99 Wash. 2d 609, 664 P.2d 474 (1983),\u201d 59 Wash. L. Rev. 981 (1984). This relaxed causation approach has even been used to allow a death case to go to a jury where the court said that \u201cif a defendant physician, by action or inaction, has destroyed any substantial possibility of the patient\u2019s survival, such conduct becomes a proximate cause of the patient\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Koulizakis, </em>229 Va. 524, 532, 331 S.E.2d 440 (1985); see <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 F.2d 626, 632 (4th Cir. 1966); <em>McKellips </em>v. <em>Saint Francis Hospital, Inc., </em>741 P.2d 467, 472 (Okla. 1987). A number of other courts have essentially adopted the relaxed causation approach.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The second or \u201cproportional\u201d approach encompasses a somewhat different focus on the issue of compensat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ing loss of chance. One commentator has explicated its rationale as follows: \u201cThe current causation approach requires the finder of fact to determine whether the decedent\u2019s chances to live or to achieve a more favorable result were more probable than not. Once the evidence shows that a probability did or did not exist, the inquiry ends. As a result, chances of less than fifty-one percent are treated as if they were nonexistent. A more sensible approach would be to redefine the victim\u2019s injury as the loss of a chance. Instead of attempting to determine whether the physical harm was caused by negligence, a court could examine the extent of the victim\u2019s lost chances for cure or improvement and grant a recovery that mirrors the extent of those chances. When viewing the question in the negligence setting, the harm suffered would be the loss of the chance. The relevant inquiry would be whether the defendant \u2018probably\u2019 caused a reduction in the victim\u2019s chances. If causation were found, the court would provide compensation for the lost chance in direct proportion to the extent of the lost chance.\u201d Comment, supra, 34 Cath. U.L. Rev. 766-67. The background of this approach is in Professor King\u2019s influential article in the Yale Law Journal. This approach conceptualizes the loss of chance of survival or improved health as a separate cause of action meriting recovery by way of compensation. In advancing his theory, Professor King not only maintains that the \u201cfailure [of courts] to distinguish between the functions of causation and valuation, or to identify and value rationally the true interests lost, has created a serious gap in the remedial structure\u201d but also that \u201cthe loss of a chance of achieving a favorable outcome or of avoiding an adverse consequence should be compensable and should be valued appropriately, rather than treated as an all-or-nothing proposition.\u201d J. King, supra, 90 Yale L.J. 1354. In advocating that loss of chance has value entitling a plaintiff to compensation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Professor King offers an illustration: \u201c[C]onsider a patient who suffers a heart attack and dies as a result. Assume that the defendant-physician negligently misdiagnosed the patient\u2019s condition, but that the patient would have had only a 40 [percent] chance of survival even with a timely diagnosis and proper care. Regardless of whether it could be said that the defendant caused the decedent\u2019s death, he caused the loss of a chance, and that chance-interest [would] be completely redressed in its own right.\u201d J. King, supra, 90 Yale L.J. 1382. Professor King stresses the need to appreciate the difference between causation and valuation involving preexisting conditions. In the tort context he argues that \u201c[c]ausation questions relate to the fact of a loss or of its source\u201d and that \u201c[valuation is the process of identifying and measuring the loss that was caused by the tortious conduct.\u201d Id., 1353-54. He maintains that \u201c[t]he response of the courts to questions of causation and valuation involving preexisting conditions and claims for future consequences has been largely unsatisfactory.\u201d Id., 1354. He opines that the interest embodied in \u201ca chance of avoiding some adverse result or of achieving some favorable result is a compensable interest in its own right.\u201d Id. The loss of such a chance in a personal injury case involving a preexisting condition merits compensation because, but for the negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff would have attained a better result or avoided an adverse consequence. He argues that, as to causation, courts apply the traditional reasonable medical probability test, but that, in recognizing a chance as compensable in its own right, unless the preexisting conditions of the plaintiff \u201chave not absolutely preordained an adverse outcome, [then] the chance of avoiding it should be appropriately compensated even if that chance is not better than even.\u201d Id. He notes that \u201c[u]nder the traditional standard of proof, there is no recovery for loss of a not-better-than even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>chance of avoiding some partial loss.\u201d Id., 1374.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He also points out, however, that \u201c[u]nder the prevailing all-or-nothing rule, most courts probably would value the better-than-even chance as though it had materialized or were certain to do so. They would not, in other words, treat such a chance as a chance at all, but as a certainty.\u201d Id., 1387.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">A number of courts and commentators have subscribed to Professor King\u2019s approach.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Professor King\u2019s analysis has received both support and criticism from commentators. See, e.g., comment, supra, 34 Cath. U.L. Rev. 747; comment, \u201cIncreased Risk of Harm: A New Standard for Sufficiency of Evidence of Causation in Medical Malpractice Cases,\u201d 65 B.U.L. Rev. 275,304-305 (1985); note, \u201cLoss of Chance As Technique: Toeing the Line at Fifty Percent,\u201d 72 Tex. L. Rev. 369 (1993); note, supra, 59 Wash. L. Rev. 981; M. McMahon, annot., 81 A.L.R.4th485 (1990), \u201cMedical Malpractice: Measure and Elements of Damages in Actions Based on Loss of Chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">There is a third or \u201ctraditional approach\u201d to the doctrine of lost chance. Those courts, that apply this approach maintain that the better rule is to require that the plaintiff in a medical malpractice action comport with the standard of proof of proximate cause and prove that the defendant\u2019s negligence, in probability, proximately caused the injury or death. What one court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>said is \u201c[p]erhaps the most rigid position\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> on this approach is expressed by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Cooper v. Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Inc., </em>supra, 27 Ohio St. 2d 242. In <em>Cooper, </em>the plaintiffs minor son was in a bicycle-truck collision. Improper emergency room procedures failed to disclose a major head injury of the boy, and he was released and died the next morning. Id. One medical expert testified that although there was \u201cnear certainty of death\u201d when an injury such as that sustained by this child went untreated, he refused to speculate on the degree of chance of survival with proper treatment. Id. Another medical expert placed the boy\u2019s chance of survival at \u201cmaybe . . . around [50 percent].\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id., 247. In affirming the trial court\u2019s directed verdict for the defendants, the Ohio Supreme Court stated: \u201cA rule, which would permit a plaintiff to establish a jury question on the issue of proximate cause upon a showing of a \u2018substantial possibility\u2019 of survival, in our judgment, suffers the same infirmity as a rule which would permit proof of a \u2018chance of recovery\u2019 to be sufficient. While the substantial possibility concept appears to connote a weightier burden than the chance of recovery idea, both derogate well-established and valuable proximate cause considerations. Traditional proximate cause standards require that the trier of the facts, ataminimum, must be provided with evidence that a result was more likely than not to have been caused by an act, in the absence of any intervening cause.\u201d Id., 251; see also <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>University Hospital Building, Inc., </em>supra, 445 So. 2d 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Underscoring this position, the <em>Cooper </em>court then stated: \u201cIn an action for wrongful death, where medical malpractice is alleged as the proximate cause of death, and plaintiffs evidence indicates that a failure to diagnose the injury prevented the patient from an opportunity to be operated on, which failure eliminated any chance of the patient\u2019s survival, the issue of proximate cause can be submitted to a jury only if there is sufficient evidence showing that with proper diagnosis, treatment and surgery the patient probably would have survived.\u201d <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Inc., </em>supra, 27 Ohio St. 2d 253-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In following <em>Cooper\u2019s </em>refusal to \u201cderogate well-established and valuable proximate cause considerations\u201d; id., 251; <em>Gooding </em>also concluded: \u201cRelaxing the causation requirement might correct a perceived unfairness to some plaintiffs who could prove the possibility that the medical malpractice caused an injury but could not prove the probability of causation, but at the same time could create an injustice. Health care providers could find themselves defending cases simply because a patient fails to improve or where serious disease processes are not arrested because another course of action could possibly bring a better result. No other professional malpractice defendant carries this burden of liability without the requirement that plaintiffs prove the alleged negligence probably rather than possibly caused the injury. See e.g. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>318 So. 2d 540 [Fla. App. 1975] (plaintiff in legal malpractice action must show that, but for the attorney\u2019s negligence, the plaintiff had a good cause of action in the underlying suit).\u201d <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>University Hospital Building, Inc., </em>supra, 445 So. 2d 1019-20.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Against this backdrop of case law on the lost chance doctrine, we now discuss <em>LaBieniec </em>to take up the question of whether that case recognized the existence of the loss of chance doctrine in Connecticut. It did. That action was not instituted in the context of our wrongful death statute in General Statutes \u00a7 52-555. That action was started by Leonard LaBieniec individually while he was alive,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> alleging<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that the two defendant physicians were guilty of medical malpractice, both of whom he alleged had failed to detect lung cancer in X-rays taken of him during the course of a physical examination. This failure, he alleged, allowed the cancer to spread and metastasize to his brain. He also claimed that the \u201cdelay caused him emotional distress and a decreased chance of survival.\u201d <em>LaBieniec </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra, 11 Conn. App. 201. \u201cAt the close of the plaintiffs case, the trial court directed a verdict for each of the defendants because there was insufficient evidence to establish that the oversight of the defendants was the proximate cause of any injury to the plaintiff.\u201d Id. We affirmed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">In <em>LaBieniec, </em>the plaintiff claimed \u201cthat the delay in diagnosis prevented the early removal of his lung or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>earlier treatment <em>which decreased his chance for successful </em>treatment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 207. Immediately thereafter, we stated: \u201cTo prevail on this claim, a plaintiff must show (1) that he has in fact been deprived of a chance for successful treatment and (2) that the decreased chance for successful treatment <em>more likely than not </em>resulted from the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Gooding v. University Hospital Building, Inc., </em>[supra, 445 So. 2d 1020]. \u2018In other words, the plaintiff must show that what was done or failed to be done probably would have affected the outcome.\u2019 Id.\u201d <em>LaBieniec </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra, 11 Conn. App. 207. The <em>LaBieniec </em>court specifically stated: \u201cWe find that the plaintiff failed to adduce evidence that he in fact suffered a decreased chance for successful treatment. . . . The plaintiff in this case failed to show that the delay in diagnosis caused him any injury.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In addition to its earlier citation of <em>Gooding, </em>the <em>LaBieniec </em>court, further evincing its adoption of the traditional approach of reasonable medical probability, stated: \u201c \u2018The loss of a speculative chance of recovery alone is not an injury from which damages flow. We are convinced that the better rule to follow is the one which requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendants\u2019 negligence in all probability, proximately caused the injury. Only by such proof will the plaintiff have proven proximate cause.\u2019 <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Inc., </em>[supra, 27 Ohio St. 252]; <em>Kirby v. Spivey, </em>[167 Ga. App. 751, 756, 307 S.E.2d 538 (1983)]; <em>Mortensen </em>v. <em>Memorial Hospital, </em>105 App. Div. 2d 151, 157, 483 N.Y.S.2d 264 (1984); <em>Hanselman </em>v. <em>McCardle, </em>27 S.C. 46, 48-49, 267 S.E.2d 531 (1980).\u201d <em>LaBieniec </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra, 207-208. After again stressing that the chain of causation, in establishing liability, is concerned only \u201cwith reasonable probabilities and not possibilities\u201d; id., 208; the <em>LaBieniec </em>court opined that \u201c[i]n this case, the evidence failed to remove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>decreased chance of successful treatment theory from the realm of speculation.\u201d Id., 210. <em>LaBieniec </em>then clearly stated that \u201c[s]ince there was no evidence which could have led the jury to a reasonable inference that the defendants\u2019 acts of malpractice were the direct and proximate cause of a decrease in the chance of successful treatment, it was proper for the trial court to direct a verdict on this issue.\u201d Id., 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><em>LaBieniec </em>recognized the existence of a cause of action for loss of chance<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in medical malpractice cases and, in doing so, required that, in order to recover, a plaintiff was required to prove his entitlement to recover by the traditional approach to that doctrine. Id., 207-10. It recognized that causation is a matter of probability, not possibility. See, e.g., W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 41, p. 269. Our explication of <em>LaBieniec </em>discloses that its declaration on what a plaintiff must prove to recover when he makes a claim invoking that doctrine complies with our Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201ca cause of action.\u201d For example, in <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 546-47, 590 A.2d 914 (1991), our Supreme Court held: \u201c \u2018 \u201cA cause of action is that single group of facts which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>claimed to have brought about an unlawful injury to the plaintiff .... \u2018A right of action at law arises from the existence of a primary right in the plaintiff, and an invasion of that right by some delict on the part of the defendant. The facts which establish the existence of that right and that delict constitute the cause of action.\u2019 <em>Pavelka </em>v. <em>St. Albert </em>Society, 82 Conn. 146, 147, 72 A. 725 [1909].\u201d \u2019 \u201d See <em>Wade\u2019s Dairy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>181 Conn. 556, 560, 436 A.2d 24 (1980); <em>Veits </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>134 Conn. 428, 434, 58 A.2d 389 (1948). Moreover, our analysis explicating <em>LaBieniec </em>shows that that court recognized that \u201cactionable harm\u201d required a breach of duty by the defendant and a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s breach and the resulting harm to the plaintiff. See <em>Catz </em>v. <em>Rubenstein, </em>201 Conn. 39, 44, 513 A.2d 98 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The recognition of the existence of this cause of action by <em>LaBieniec </em>is confirmed by its determination that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff was insufficient to prove entitlement to relief under that doctrine. In the case presently before us, the trial court\u2019s action in refusing to charge the jury on the second count on the ground there was no such cause of action in Connecticut was harmful error.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Significantly, the trial court never decided that its refusal to do so was because of the insufficiency of the evidence, as was the case in <em>LaBieniec.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Having determined that a cause of action for loss of chance does exist in Connecticut under <em>LaBieniec, </em>we now address the plaintiffs claim that, in effect, the trial court sua sponte \u201cdirected\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a verdict on that cause of action as set out in the second count of her amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>complaint. The plaintiff requested a charge on the doctrine<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the defendant filed his request to charge,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which set out the elements, which under <em>LaBieniec, </em>he claimed that the plaintiff had to prove in order to prevail on the loss of chance claim. The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court improperly denied her request to charge on loss of chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court correctly charged the jury in accordance with the case law of Connecticut as it applied to the evidence in this case and that it did not improperly refuse to charge in accordance with the plaintiffs request on loss of chance. In doing so, he argues that requests not applicable to the facts are properly refused and we agree with that as a general proposition. There are, however, no \u201cfacts\u201d in a jury case, short of those admitted, until the jury establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>them by their deliberations and verdict after proper instructions by the court. Until that occurs there is only \u201cevidence\u201d on the basis of which the jury makes its findings of fact. It is not our function to find facts. <em>Fukelman </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>4 Conn. App. 30, 31, 492 A.2d 214 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The trial court, in its instructions, however, did not permit the trier of fact to consider any evidence as to the loss of chance claim alleged in the second count of the amended complaint. The trial court did not reach the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence on the loss of chance claim as did the trial court in <em>LaBieniec. </em>It is apparent that the trial court was aware of the plaintiffs claims<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> because, in taking her exceptions, not only did she point out that she pleaded in a manner that set up alternative theories<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> as permitted but also that the court could have \u201ccharge [d] lost chance as apart of proximate cause instruction and not a separate count.\u201d The court indicated, \u201cI\u2019m aware of that, and I consciously eliminated that language from your request so you\u2019re fully protected on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u201cLitigants have a constitutional right to have factual issues resolved by the jury.\u201d <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>207 Conn. 125, 138, 540 A.2d 666 (1988); <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>186 Conn. 337, 350, 441 A.2d 604 (1982). \u201cThe corollary to this constitutional right is that if there is no issue of fact, there is no right to a jury trial.\u201d <em>Audubon Parking </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Barclay &amp; Stubbs, Inc., </em>225 Conn. 804, 811, 626 A.2d 729 (1993). On the record before us, the trial court never took a position on this corollary, given its view of <em>LaBieniec. </em>The jurors, as the fact finders, were not given the opportunity<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> to consider the second count under proper instructions. It was improper not to have permitted it. Where a trial court improperly fails to permit adjudication of an issue, the proper judgment ordinarily is to remand the matter so that the issue may be adjudicated. See <em>Bencivenga </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>183 Conn. 168, 176, 438 A.2d 1174 (1981); <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Group, </em>155 Conn. 585, 590-91, 236 A.2d 462 (1967); <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Seleit, </em>98 Conn. 398, 413, 119 A. 569 (1923). That should be done here. An order for a new trial on the loss of chance claim is warranted in the interests of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly permitted the defendant to introduce evidence of contributory negligence when that doctrine was not pleaded.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> She alleges that the defendant\u2019s witnesses were permitted to testify about facts that tended to prove that the decedent was \u201ca noncompliant patient,\u201d had not properly attended to his own medical needs, and had caused his own death. Such testimony, she contends, was permitted despite her motion in limine and objection. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion in limine<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> without prejudice. This evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>functionally, she continues, served to shift the responsibility for the decedent\u2019s \u201cinjuries\u201d from the defendant to the decedent himself. Even assuming that a proper purpose could have existed for such evidence, the plaintiff administratrix further claims that the improper purpose of the evidence should have been filtered from the proper purpose by an appropriate jury instruction. She then makes the claim that she was entitled to have the jury instructed, as she requested, that, as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>of law, her decedent exercised reasonable care in regard to his own treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In responding, the defendant claims that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidence of the decedent\u2019s conduct. He also maintains that the denial of the plaintiffs motion in limine, when originally made on June 28, 1994, is not claimed to be improper. In addition, the defendant claims that when the motion in limine was renewed on July 12, 1994, the court indicated that it would make rulings when questions, implicating any claimed contributory negligence, arose. It is his claim that the plaintiff, rather than following the court\u2019s suggestion that it be done on a question by question basis, did not make such objections. Moreover, he claims that the circumstance that the decedent did not respond to the symptoms from which he was allegedly suffering was not indicative of contributory negligence but, rather, was directly relevant to the manner in which the telephone calls would have been handled by the defendant, assuming the calls were even made as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">At the outset of our analysis, certain background circumstances must be pointed out. The defendant had not pleaded contributory negligence. Yet the plaintiff, as disclosed by her motion in limine, maintained that certain deposition testimony raised that issue. In initially denying the motion in limine, the court indicated, inter alia, that the motion, filed as it was prior to the presentation of evidence, did not realistically present a workable vehicle for a blanket ruling at that time. The court indicated that it believed that this motion was a poor substitute for appropriate objections to evidence offered on direct or cross-examination. When the plaintiff renewed this motion on July 12, 1994, the court indicated that the appropriate time to make an objection about a defense that is not in the case is by a request to charge and that if the state of evidence at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the charge is given was such as to justify giving that request then the request would be given.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">To the defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiff has not properly preserved the denial of her motion in limine for review, the plaintiff contends that it was not necessary for her to have continued to object at the trial to the \u201cevidence of contributory negligence.\u201d She insists that this is so because of her vigorous posture on the motion in limine itself at the trial. The plaintiff maintains that the claim was distinctly raised at trial and was, therefore, properly preserved. For that she cites <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>207 Conn. 308, 311 n.2, 541 A.2d 858 (1988). Although there appears to be some general authority for the plaintiffs position; see, e.g., id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kluttz, </em>9 Conn. App. 686, 703 n.12, 521 A.2d 178 (1987); we cannot accept her claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">This case is factually distinguishable from <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>In support of the argument, she cites Practice Book \u00a7 4185,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> which was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>involved in <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>In that case, the Supreme Court decided that because Practice Book \u00a7 4185 had been followed, the issue claimed to be reviewable under that rule was properly preserved. <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 308. That is not so here. Reviewability under \u00a7 4185 is preserved \u201cwithout a further objection or exception provided that the grounds for such objection and exception, and the ruling thereon as previously articulated, remain the same.\u201d We believe that the letter and the spirit of \u00a7 4185 were not adhered to by the plaintiff at the trial. Particularly so because the plaintiff introduced, as a full exhibit, office records of the defendant that include the notation: \u201c6/24/87 Pat[ient] did not show.\u201d June 24,1987, was the date set for the next appointment at the time of his preceding appointment of April 30,1987.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This exhibit was offered by the plaintiff without any request by her that the fact that the decedent did not keep his June 24, 1987 appointment be redacted in any fashion or that there be any limitation upon its use. This is significant because, in her motion in limine, she specifically wanted excluded evidence that \u201c[the decedent] may have missed an appointment with [the defendant] four months before his fatal heart attack . . . .\u201d The plaintiff cannot affirmatively introduce such evidence that she has earlier, in her motion in limine, characterized, and still does characterize, as \u201ccontributory negligence\u201d and then seek review of that claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Second, the plaintiff also did not object to such evidence<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> despite the fair indication of the court that she do so on a question by question basis, both at the time the motion in limine was originally decided on June 22, 1994, and when it was renewed on July 12, 1994. This circumstance itself operates to defeat the plaintiffs claim hereby rendering such cases as <em>West Haven Sound Development Corp. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 308, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Kluttz, </em>supra, 9 Conn. App. 686, inapposite. Nevertheless, in the interest of justice, and to avoid what might be suggested as plain error, i.e., admitting evidence on a crucial issue where that issue, i.e., contributory negligence, had not been raised in the pleadings or the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, we discuss the plaintiffs argument on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">It is helpful to refer to certain principles to structure our analysis of the respective positions of the parties. \u201cThe purpose of the complaint is to limit the issues to be decided at the trial of a case and is calculated to prevent surprise.\u201d <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, </em>203 Conn. 554, 557, 525 A.2d 954 (1987); <em>Lundberg </em>v. <em>Kovacs, </em>172 Conn. 229, 232, 374 A.2d 201 (1977); <em>Montano </em>v. <em>Kin-Therm, Inc., </em>4 Conn. App. 187, 190, 493 A.2d 266 (1985). The answer is the pleading that is the response by the defendant to the plaintiffs complaint, admitting, denying in whole or in part the allegations of the plaintiffs complaint and which may interpose affirmative matter. See Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed. 1969). What is in issue is determined by the pleadings and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>once they have been filed, the evidence proffered must be relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings. <em>Telesco </em>v. <em>Telesco, </em>187 Conn. 715, 720, 447 A.2d 752 (1982); <em>Arey </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>187 Conn. 324, 332, 445 A.2d 916 (1982); <em>Tehrani </em>v. <em>Century Medical Center, </em>7 Conn.

It has been said that \u201c[o]ne fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Nissley, </em>supra, 545, quoting <em>Berndston </em>v. <em>Annino, </em>supra, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The trial court has broad discretion to determine both the relevance and remoteness of evidence and its rulings there will be set aside only on a showing of a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 324, 528 A.2d 1123 <em>(1987); Hughes v.

App. 499, 508, 531 A.2d 194, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 814, 533 A.2d 568 (1987). \u201c[A]ny fact may be proved which logically tends to aid the trier in the determination of the issue.\u201d <em>Litvaitis </em>v. <em>Litvaitis, </em>162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Conn. 540, 548, 295 A.2d 519 (1972). \u201c 1 \u201cUnless excluded by some rule or principle of law, any fact may be proved which logically tends to aid the trier in the determination of the issue.\u201d <em>Plumb </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>[supra, 66 Conn. 166].\u2019 <em>Pitt </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>[supra, 149 Conn. 357].\u201d <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>172 Conn. 210, 214, 374 A.2d 193 (1977). On the other hand, a court has the discretion to exclude relevant evidence where it is more prejudicial than probative. See <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 637, 443 A.2d 471 (1982); cf., e.g., <em>Thibodeau </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>139 Conn. 9, 14, 89 A.2d 223 (1952). This court has stated that \u201c[a]ll evidence adverse to a party is, to some degree, prejudicial. To be excluded, the evidence must create prejudice that is <em>undue </em>and so great as to threaten an injustice if the evidence were to be admitted.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Chouinard </em>v. <em>Marjani, </em>21 Conn. App. 572, 576, 575 A.2d 238 (1990).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> These considerations, however, do not encompass all the principles that a trial judge confronts in passing upon claims of admissibility of evidence during a lengthy jury trial.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Once the issue is joined by the parties, the presentation of evidence involves not only that of the plaintiffs case but also that of the defendant. Both the plaintiff and the defendant fall within the well settled principle that a party cannot, however, \u201cbe deprived of the right to support his cause by the introduction of evidence tending to prove all facts upon which issue has been joined, provided it is relevant and not excluded by some rule of law. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>New York, N.

App. 575. The right of cross-examination; see <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Indusco Management Corp., </em>164 Conn. 262, 271, 320 A.2d 811 (1973); \u201cdoes not . . . permit the defendant to present evidence that is irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible.\u201d <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>26 Conn.

[but] that scope is determined by all of the evidence offered during direct examination\u201d including an exhibit offered and received as a full exhibit. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>189 Conn. 518, 525, 457 A.2d 656 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In applying these principles to the case before us, we first point out that the defendant\u2019s answer to the amended complaint put in issue not only the allegations of his negligence but also whether the various telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>calls to his office during the week of October 19, 1987, allegedly seeking his professional assistance were ever made. The answer also denied the allegation that the decedent was under the care and treatment of the defendant from August, 1985, until his death on October 24,1987. This was consistent with his claim that he had not seen or spoken to the decedent since April 30,1987, which was the date of the defendant\u2019s last examination of the decedent. This period of almost six months covered the decedent\u2019s not keeping his June 24, 1987 appointment and also the time frame of the vigorously disputed telephone calls allegedly made to the defendant\u2019s office during the week of October 19, 1987. The plaintiff strongly maintained that the decedent made those telephone calls during that week. The defendant not only denied that but also produced the testimony of employees of his office at that time to the effect that no such telephone calls had been received. Moreover, certain of his office records, i.e., \u201ccall book\u201d entries, were introduced to support his position. Keeping in mind that the defendant was alleged to have been legally responsible because \u201c[he], his agents or employees, failed to exercise reasonable care\u201d the issues joined under the pleadings fairly forecast an evidentiary presentation by both parties of many relevant considerations. These included, broadly speaking, the medical history of the decedent, his course of treatment by the defendant, the events of the week of October 19, 1987, the defendant\u2019s office practices and procedures when patients with known heart disease, such as the decedent, call his office with complaints.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Such matters, all within the issues joined by the pleadings, provided many relevant circumstances necessary to advance the inquiry of the existence of the negligence alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>It is evident that the trial court, confronted with a spirited presentation of evidence by both parties, fairly recognized the rights of each. It took the position that contributory negligence was not in the case and its rulings going to that claim demonstrate that. In doing so, it properly weighed the probative value of relevant evidence against claimed prejudice. It ruled on objections as they were made. As noted, the trial court had wide discretion in admitting relevant evidence and that involved recognizing that a party cannot be deprived of its right to support its position by introducing evidence tending to prove facts on which issue had been joined unless excluded by some rule of law. The trial court recognized that principle in its rulings as evidence was presented at the trial, as to which we find no clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">After the final arguments of counsel in which contributory negligence was not argued to the jury, the court instructed the jury. In doing so, it not only directed that it was required to follow the law as the court articulated it, but also made it abundantly clear that its deliberations on liability involved the negligence and proximate cause as to the defendant only. Moreover, the verdict forms submitted to the jury contained nothing that asked the jury to assess any fault on the part of the plaintiffs decedent. The plaintiff, however, did file a request to charge on contributory negligence, which the trial court declined to give. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The plaintiff claims that the trial judge \u201capparently agreed\u201d with her counsel early in the trial that a curative instruction would be needed on the issue of contributory negligence. This was at the time of the hearing of the plaintiffs motion in limine.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> After consulting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>transcript reference the plaintiff cites for this position, we cannot agree. Rather, the court indicated that if the state of the evidence was such as to justify granting such a request, then the court would give it. It appears that the court, after all the evidence was presented, decided that the state of the evidence was such that it need not give such a request. Factored into its decision not to do so were both that contributory negligence had not been argued by the parties and its implicit conclusion that on the evidence that matter was just not in the case. Moreover, in discussing the plaintiffs exception to its not granting the request as filed, the trial court also pointed out that the request was \u201climited to the statute [General Statutes \u00a7 52-114]. . . . It\u2019s limited to the presumption of due care.\u201d In addition, the trial court referred to a case in volume 29 of the Connecticut Appellate Reports,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> which the trial court said \u201cindicates that the statute cannot be referred to in a vacuum\u201d and that the request was rejected \u201cbecause of the case law which indicates that the statute is only applicable and doesn\u2019t furnish any guidance to the jury unless there is an affirmative defense in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>We agree that the trial court properly refused the proffered request. \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 52-114 explicitly states that there is a presumption that the plaintiff in a negligence action was exercising reasonable care at the time of injury, <em>and </em>that the defendant must specially plead contributory negligence.
