The defendant lived with the victim, her mother, and the victim\u2019s sister during the time of the assaults. The defendant was the victim\u2019s stepfather. The first incident occurred in the fall of 1991 when the victim was fifteen years old. The defendant was home alone with the victim. He told the victim that he wanted to examine her knee, which she had recently injured. During the examination, the defendant placed his hands on her leg and inserted his finger into her vagina. The second assault occurred sometime later in the fall of 1991. On this occasion, the defendant again inserted his finger into the victim\u2019s vagina. The victim told her boyfriend and her teacher about these incidents shortly after they occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">On January 5, 1992, the victim\u2019s mother saw her crying while on the telephone with her boyfriend. Her mother asked the victim why she was crying. When her daughter did not respond, the mother took the telephone from her and asked the victim\u2019s boyfriend. The boyfriend informed the victim\u2019s mother of the sexual assaults and the mother notified the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">At trial, the defendant denied that he had sexually assaulted the victim and claimed that the victim had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>fabricated the allegations. The jury returned a guilty verdict and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The defendant\u2019s first two claims are based on the trial court\u2019s rulings concerning evidence contained in the victim\u2019s psychiatric and medical records. The defendant claims that the court\u2019s rulings were improper and deprived him of his constitutional rights to confrontation and due process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The following facts are necessary for the resolution of this issue. Prior to trial, the trial court released to the defendant some of the victim\u2019s psychiatric and medical records, having found that they were probative of the witness\u2019 capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect and narrate relevant occurrences. See <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 58, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990) (outlined special procedure for trial courts before releasing confidential records). At trial, the defendant attempted to cross-examine the victim regarding several incidents documented in the records. He argued in his offers of proof that the records showed that (1) the victim had a turbulent relationship with her mother and the defendant during the spring of 1990, the period before and after the victim\u2019s suicide attempt on March 28, 1990, (2) the victim admitted that she tended to do \u201ccrazy things\u201d when angry, and (3) the victim had made prior allegations of sexual assault against male family members. The trial court excluded the evidence contained in the psychiatric and medical records as irrelevant. Furthermore, the court concluded that the evidence regarding her relationship with her mother and the defendant and her suicide attempt was too remote in time and that the rape shield law, General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 54-86f,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prevented the admissibility of the prior allegations of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">On appeal, the defendant maintains, as he did at trial, that the proffered evidence was relevant to establish the victim\u2019s bias, lack of credibility, and motive to accuse the defendant falsely. He further argues that the prior allegations of sexual assault are admissible because they fall under an exception to the rape shield law.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">\u201cIt is well established that [t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987). The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 298, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 549, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996). \u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . One fact is relevant to another if in the common course of events the existence of one, alone or with other facts, renders the existence of the other either more certain or more probable. . . . Evidence is irrelevant or too remote if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>there is such a want of open and visible connection between the evidentiary and principal facts that, all things considered, the former is not worthy or safe to be admitted in the proof of the latter. . . . Evidence is not rendered inadmissible because it is not conclusive. All that is required is that the evidence tend to support a relevant fact even to a slight degree, so long as it is not prejudicial or merely cumulative.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 305-306, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the evidence of the nature of the relationship between the victim, her mother, and the defendant was irrelevant. The defendant wanted to cross-examine the victim concerning arguments between the victim, her mother and the defendant during the spring of 1990. These incidents were documented in the victim\u2019s medical and psychiatric records during her treatment following her suicide attempt on March 28, 1990, more than fifteen months prior to the sexual assaults. Although the trial court allowed the defendant to cross-examine the victim regarding her relationship with the defendant, it limited the inquiry to the fall of 1991, when the assaults occurred. \u201cIt is a reasonable exercise of judicial discretion to exclude . . . evidence the relevancy of which appears to be so slight and inconsequential that to admit it would distract attention which should be concentrated on vital issues of the case.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 589, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that incidents that occurred more than fifteen months prior to the assaults were irrelevant in determining whether animus toward her mother and stepfather was the impetus for the victim\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">We further find that the trial court properly concluded that the evidence of prior sexual assault allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>made by the victim against other male family members was irrelevant and barred by the rape shield law. The defendant argues that the allegations were admissible under either the second or fourth exceptions to the rape shield law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant further contends that, at a minimum, he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine its admissibility. In support of this contention, the defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Manini, </em>38 Conn. App. 100, 659 A.2d 196, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 99 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In <em>Manini, </em>the defendant was charged with one count of sexual assault. At trial, the defendant moved for an evidentiary hearing to determine the admissibility of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant sought to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s prior claims of sexual assault under <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>3 Conn. App. 374, 489 A.2d 386, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 803, 492 A.2d 1239 (1985). <em>State </em>v. <em>Manini, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 115. In <em>Cassidy, </em>we determined that where a defendant wanted to admit evidence of prior claims of sexual assault, such claims, <em>if false, </em>would be admissible as to the victim\u2019s credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>supra, 382. InManini\u2019s offer of proof, he submitted that the victim\u2019s medical records showed that the victim had made two prior claims of sexual assault. Although the defendant had no basis for stating that the claims were false, the medical records indicating that the victim had \u201cdelusions and hallucinations of a highly sexualized nature\u201d supported such an inference. <em>State </em>v. <em>Manini, </em>supra, 115. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a healing on admissibility. We reversed the trial court, finding that the defendant\u2019s offer of proof was adequate to support an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>inference of the falsity of the prior allegations. We therefore found that the evidence of prior claims was relevant and that the defendant was entitled to a hearing. Id., 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">After reviewing the record, we agree with the trial court and find that the defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the victim\u2019s alleged prior allegations of sexual assault by male family members. We held in <em>Manini </em>that \u00a7 54-86f requires a defendant to make a preliminary showing that the evidence sought to be explored in the evidentiary hearing is relevant. \u201cThe showing must be sufficient to enable the trial court to make an informed ruling in connection with the exercise of its discretion on the issue.\u201d Id., 114. In the present case, the defendant\u2019s preliminary showing did not entitle him to a hearing because he failed to establish even the inference that the victim\u2019s prior allegations of sexual assault were false.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 377, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988). The trial court properly considered all offers of proof by the defendant; it rejected the evidence of prior claims of sexual assault as irrelevant because the defendant failed to establish that they were false. See <em>State </em>v. Slater, 23 Conn. App. 221, 225, 579 A.2d 591 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Unlike the defendant\u2019s offer of proof in <em>Manini, </em>the defendant\u2019s offer of proof here contained virtually no support for the contention that the victim\u2019s prior allegations were false. In <em>Manini, </em>the offer of proof at issue contained evidence of the victim\u2019s history of delusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>and hallucinations of a sexual nature. In this case, the offer of proof merely contained evidence of some inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s accounts of the prior sexual assaults. While these inconsistencies may point to the victim\u2019s flawed memory of the prior assaults, they do not supply evidence of falsity. The defendant failed to establish even an inference that the prior claims of sexual assault were false. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s rulings deprived him of his right to confrontation under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. The primary interest secured by the right to confrontation is the right to cross-examination. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S. Ct. 1074, 13 L. Ed. 2d 934 (1965). This right \u201cmay include impeaching or discrediting [state witnesses] by attempting to reveal to the jury the witnesses\u2019 biases, prejudices or ulterior motives, or facts bearing on the witnesses\u2019 reliability, credibility, or sense of perception.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 55-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\u201c \u2018In determining whether a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination has been unduly restricted, we consider the nature of the excluded inquiry, whether the field of inquiry was adequately covered by other questions that were allowed, and the overall quality of the cross-examination viewed in relation to the issues actually litigated at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 331, 618 A.2d 32 (1992), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Roma, </em>199 Conn. 110, 116, 505 A.2d 717 (1986). \u201cThis right is not absolute; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>[410 U.S. 284, 295, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>[197 Conn. 280, 284, 497 A.2d 35 (1985)]; but may bow to other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 295; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 401, 497 A.2d 956 (1985); <em>State v. Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 521, 400 A.2d 276 (1978). Such an interest is the trial court\u2019s right, indeed, duty, to exclude irrelevant evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>235 Conn. 595, 604, 669 A.2d 562 (1995), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 488, 508 A.2d 22 (1986). \u201cThe confrontation clause does not. . . suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination. . . . Only relevant evidence may be elicited through cross-examination. . . . The proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered testimony. Unless such a proper foundation is established, the evidence ... is irrelevant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>supra, 604-605.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Our review of the record in this case leads us to conclude that the trial court did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation by limiting the inquiry into the defendant\u2019s relationship with the victim to the fall of 1991 or by ruling that the evidence of the victim\u2019s prior claims of sexual assault was irrelevant and inadmissible. The defendant argues that the evidence of the relationship between the parties prior to the fall of 1991 was relevant and material to establish the victim\u2019s bias, motive, and mental state. He further argues that the evidence of the prior allegations should have been admissible because it \u201cfits within the defendant\u2019s theory of defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The constitution does not require that a defendant be permitted to present every piece of evidence he wants. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>supra, 410 U.S. 302; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>228 Conn. 456, 474, 637 A.2d 382, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 821, 115 S. Ct. 83, 130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 36 (1994). Here, the defendant was allowed to present evidence of the turbulent nature of the victim\u2019s relationship with the defendant through his own testimony, along with the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother and the defendant\u2019s brother. Also, the defendant presented evidence of the victim\u2019s mental state through his expert witness, Jeremy August, a psychiatrist. August, who had access to the victim\u2019s psychiatric and medical records, testified about the victim\u2019s attempted suicide, her subsequent hospitalization, and his conclusion that the victim has a cognitive deficit that prevents her from accurately or truthfully relating events that occurred. It is clear, therefore, that the trial court did not improperly restrict the defendant\u2019s field of inquiry regarding bias, motive, credibility and mental state. Furthermore, we have already decided that the trial court properly ruled that the evidence proffered by the defendant was irrelevant. Thus, we conclude that the trial court adequately protected the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 604-605.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In the defendant\u2019s third claim on appeal, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the substance of an alleged argument between the victim and her mother immediately prior to the disclosure of the allegations on January 5, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">We first consider the state\u2019s argument that the defendant failed to raise this claim at trial with sufficient clarity to alert the trial court to the claim now raised on appeal. \u201cThe court [on appeal] shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4061. We must examine the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to discern whether the defendant raised the issue in question at trial. <em>State </em>v. Zollo, 36 Conn. App. 718, 726, 654 A.2d 359 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">At trial, the defendant attempted to question the victim about the substance of an argument with her mother on January 5, 1992, the day that her mother found out that the victim had been sexually assaulted. The defendant argued that the substance of the argument was relevant because it caused the victim to cry to her boyfriend on the telephone and ultimately led to the disclosure of the allegations. Furthermore, the defendant asserted that the substance of the argument was material to the defendant\u2019s theory that the victim had fabricated and disclosed the allegations on that date in retaliation for \u201callegations [that] had been made against [the victim] about other misconduct she was engaging in.\u201d On the basis of this offer of proof, the trial court ruled that such evidence was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">We find that the defendant properly raised the issue at trial; we also find, however, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling the evidence irrelevant. The substance of the argument on January 5, 1992, is irrelevant to establish that it instigated the victim to fabricate the allegations. The victim had already confided in her teacher and her boyfriend shortly after the assaults occurred in the fall of 1991. Moreover, there is no evidence that the victim\u2019s crying on the telephone was related to the argument with her mother. We therefore conclude that the trial court reasonably exercised its discretion in excluding the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim involves the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions for mistrial. The defendant contends that certain judicial misconduct and bias denied him his constitutional right to a fair trial. In support of his motions, the defendant cited two incidents of judi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ciai misconduct and bias:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (1) a comment made by the trial court during a colloquy regarding an evidentiary issue where the court stated to the defense counsel to take up this issue on appeal;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (2) the trial court\u2019s finding the defendant in contempt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Accusations of judicial bias or misconduct implicate the basic concepts of a fair trial. <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 168, 444 A.2d 915 (1982). \u201cThe appearance as well as the actuality of impartiality on the part of the trier\u201d may constitute proof of bias sufficient to warrant disqualification, resulting in a mistrial. Id., 170. The general rule in this state is that a mistrial should be granted only when it is apparent to the court that the misconduct has so prejudiced a party that he can no longer receive a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 264, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boone, </em>15 Conn. App. 34, 48, 544 A.2d 217, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 811, 550 A.2d 1084 (1988). Applying this rule, we find that the trial court did not improperly deny the defendant\u2019s motions for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We note that all the incidents the defendant cites in his motions for mistrial, including the unpreserved claims, occurred outside the presence of the jury. Although the defendant claims that the alleged bias \u201ccolored the entire proceeding,\u201d he fails to demonstrate how he was prejudiced or denied a fair trial. We, therefore, must conclude that the trial court adequately protected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and ...

More specifically, the defendant requests this court to review the following sealed records: (1) the victim\u2019s school records, (2) the victim\u2019s May, 1991 admission record from her health care provider, and (3) part of the victim\u2019s file with the department of children and families (DCF). The sealed school records and the May, 1991 health care provider record were not part of the appellate file. We have reviewed the sealed portion of the DCF file and we conclude that the record was properly sealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn any prosecution for sexual assault ... no evidence of the sexual conduct of the victim may be admissible unless such evidence is . . .

App. 107-108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\"> The defendant did establish the requisite inference of falsity regarding a prior allegation of sexual assault made against an unrelated male. In the offer of proof on this prior allegation, the defendant represented that this male had received accelerated rehabilitation with regard to the victim\u2019s sexual assault claim against him and steadfastly denied the allegation. The trial court found that the offer of proof entitled the defendant to an evidentiary hearing and allowed him to question the victim about this claim. The evidence, however, was not admissible because at the hearing the defendant failed to prove the falsity of the allegation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"> We do not address the issue of whether the evidence of prior allegations of sexual assault falls under any exceptions to the rape shield law because we affirm t he trial court\u2019s ruling that the evidence failed to meet the threshold requirement of relevancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\"> We decline to review separately the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s rulings deprived him of his due process rights because we find this claim to be subsumed by the analysis of his right to confrontation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\"> On appeal, the defendant cites several other incidents in which he alleges the trial judge displayed misconduct and bias. He failed, however, to present the incidents in his motions for mistrial. \u201c \u2018It, is a well settled general rule that courts will not review a claim of judicial bias on appeal unless that claim was properly presented to the trial court via a motion for disqualification or a motion for mistrial\u2019 \u201d <em>Knock </em>v. <em>Knock, </em>224 Conn. 776, 792, 621 A.2d 267 (1993), quoting <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Gillis, </em>214 Conn. 336, 343, 572 A.2d 323 (1990). Absent plain error, a claim of judicial bias cannot be reviewed on appeal unless preserved in the trial court, <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 168, 444 A.2d 915 (1982). Plain error exists only in \u201ctruly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Small </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>42 Conn. App. 660, 663, 680 A.2d 344 (1996). We find that the defendant\u2019s claim of judicial bias does not amount to plain error, therefore, we cannot review the claim as to those incidents not included in the defendant\u2019s motions for mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\"> The comment was elicited by the following exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019ll offer these as prior inconsistent statements. It\u2019s not what she said on her statement, that\u2019s not what she related to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">\u201cThe Court: But what does the substance of the argument have to do with any issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: There were allegations made, they arose on a certain date, some of which were the fact that allegations had been made against her about other misconduct she was engaging in.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">\u201cThe Court,: And that is totally irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I don\u2019t believe it is, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">\u201cThe Court: [Defense counsel], you can take that up on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I don\u2019t believe there is going to be an appeal in this case, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">\u201cThe Court,: There may not be, and then you won\u2019t have to take it up, but that is clearly not relevant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b705-16\"> We will not review the defendant\u2019s claim that the contempt findings failed to conform to the rules of practice because the defendant did not raise this issue at trial. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061. Furthermore, the defendant has not requested that we review his claims under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Therefore, we deny review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>38 Conn. App. 777, 787, 664 A.2d 291, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 918, 665 A.2d 610 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
