The commission\u2019s initial decision was issued on September 30,1991. On October 3,1991, the plaintiff petitioned the commission for reconsideration. On November 13,1991, the commission granted the petition and scheduled a new hearing. On November 14, the plaintiff filed his appeal to the Superior Court from the September 30 decision. On February 6, 1992, the commission repeated the findings made in its earlier decision and issued another decision affirming the earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The plaintiffs appeal from the commission\u2019s September 30,1991 decision is moot because it was superseded by the commission\u2019s February 6, 1992 decision. Although the plaintiff may have had a right to appeal from the commission\u2019s February 6 decision, he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
