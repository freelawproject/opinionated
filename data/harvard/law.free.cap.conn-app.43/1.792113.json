William Koennicke, instituted this action in a complaint in four counts against the defendant, Curt A. Maiorano, seeking to quiet title to a disputed portion of land that runs along the boundary between his property and that of the defendant in the town of Hampton. Generally speaking, their properties adjoin each other. The plaintiff also seeks damages for the cutting of trees and for trespass and title by adverse possession.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The first count, which seeks to quiet title, alleges that the defendant claims an estate or interest by deed in \u201can undefined portion\u201d of the land of the plaintiff on which the defendant has knowingly entered without the plaintiffs permission, has cut down trees without permission, has caused earth moving equipment to be brought in, has caused disturbance to the earth thereon, has removed signs prohibiting trespass on the plaintiffs land and has stored cut wood on that land. The second count incorporates a number of the same allegations and further alleges that the defendant\u2019s actions constitute a cutting of trees on the land of another in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-560.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The third count incoipo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>rates the same allegations as the second count and sets out two additional allegations. They are that, on diverse dates, the plaintiff or his agents personally communicated to the defendant orders not to enter the plaintiff s property or to leave that property and that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted criminal trespass in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The case was referred to an attorney trial referee who heard the evidence<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and submitted her report comprising her findings of fact and conclusions of law. At the same time, she also filed her memorandum of decision,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which included case law citations as well as her recommendations for judgment. In it, she found the issues for the plaintiff on the first, second and third counts and recommended judgment for the plaintiff on those three counts, and she found the issues for the defendant on the fourth count and recommended judgment for the defendant on that count. The defendant objected<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the acceptance of the report of the attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>trial referee. The trial court overruled the objections of the defendant and adopted the referee\u2019s memorandum of decision except for the award of common law punitive damages in the third count. It rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the first count, establishing title to the disputed premises by deed; for the plaintiff on the second count for $12,000; and for the plaintiff on the third count, to the effect that a trespass had been committed by the defendant. This appeal followed. The plaintiff cross appealed on matters involving damages, which we consider later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">On this appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded (1) that, as a matter of law, the division line between the properties of the plaintiff and defendant was a stone wall, (2) that, as a matter of fact, a stone wall constituted the boundary line between the two properties involved when that finding was not supported by the evidence, (3) that the defendant removed stones that the plaintiff had placed to mark the boundary line between them when inconsistently finding that the stone wall was the boundary between the parties, (4) that, as a matter of law, the defendant wrongfully cut trees on the land of the plaintiff in violation of \u00a7 52-560 and (5) that the defendant committed a criminal trespass in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107. We discuss the first three claims together and the fourth and fifth together. We affirm the judgment of the trial court except as to the third count of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The plaintiff filed a cross appeal in which he claims that the trial court improperly refused to award heightened damages, refused to award attorney\u2019s fees based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>on its own knowledge of the complexity of the proceedings before it and failed to order a separate hearing regarding attorney\u2019s fees if the award of heightened damages was properly rejected. The issues of the cross appeal are interrelated, and relate closely to the resolution of the appeal itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">The report of the attorney trial referee discloses that she found, inter alia, the following facts and made certain conclusions of law'. The plaintiff and the defendant<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> own adjoining parcels of land in the town of Hampton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>formerly owned by the defendant\u2019s mother, Elizabeth Koennicke Maiorano (Elizabeth). The plaintiff is Elizabeth\u2019s brother. Elizabeth had obtained title to the entire property in 1943 by a warranty deed from Richard Koen-nicke. That warranty deed included the recital that the entire property \u201ccontains about two hundred and twenty five acres, be the same more or less. \u201d Thereafter, in 1953, because she was unable to repay Richard Koen-nicke fully for the property, Elizabeth reconveyed the south portion of it to him in satisfaction of that debt. The warranty deed reconveying this portion to her grantor, Richard Koennicke, included the recital \u201croughly estimated as containing 115 acres of land, be it the same, more or less.\u201d The attorney trial referee found that the statement of acreage in this deed was merely a matter of description and was not intended to assure a particular quantity of land. In addition, the 1953 warranty deed described the lands reconveyed to Richard Koennicke by reference to stone walls and adjoining property owners. The division line between the properties was a stone wall dividing two fields. The larger field lay to the north of the stone wall and was retained by Elizabeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The plaintiff acquired title to the land owned by Richard Koennicke by a warranty deed dated February 6, 1960. That deed repeated the description that was set out in the 1953 warranty deed from Elizabeth to Richard Koennicke.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The defendant acquired his present interest in this parcel, which was the balance of the land retained by Elizabeth, after her 1953 deed to Richard Koennicke, by virtue of a November 13, 1963 quitclaim deed from Elizabeth to herself and the defendant with rights of survivorship. The description set out in the 1963 quit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>claim deed was essentially the original description used in the 1953 warranty deed from Richard Koennicke to Elizabeth, including the \u201ccontaining 225 acres more or less\u201d language. This 1963 quitclaim deed contained the following recital: \u201cExcepting and excluding from the above a parcel conveyed by [Elizabeth] to Richard Koennicke by Warranty Deed, dated May 13, 1953 . . . and which parcel contains 115 acres, more or less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The disputed area that is the subject of this action is a strip of approximately 300 feet extending from the stone wall south and includes the smaller of the two fields. The description in the 1953 warranty deed from Elizabeth to Richard Koennicke is ambiguous because of the fact that it contains some references<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to monuments that no longer exist. The attorney trial referee found that it was the intention of Elizabeth to convey, by that 1953 deed, all the land to the south of the stone wall between the two fields to Richard Koennicke. Prior to the 1953 deed to her uncle, Richard Koennicke, Elizabeth had identified the stone wall between the fields as the boundary to Kurt A. Koennicke, her brother, and she had indicated to him that if he did not buy it, she was going to reconvey it to Richard Koennicke to satisfy her debt to him. Prior to his purchase of his parcel from Richard Koennicke, the plaintiff walked the boundary line with Richard, who indicated that he was conveying to the plaintiff the land to the south of the stone walls dividing the two fields. After the plaintiffs purchase of this land, Elizabeth, when conferring with the plaintiff to issue deer permits and again when the plaintiff allowed a neighboring farmer to plant the field, acknowledged the stone wall dividing the larger field and smaller field as the boundary line between her property and that of the plaintiff. Since acquiring title, the plaintiff has planted lye in the smaller field to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>south of the stone wall and has also cut wood to the south of the stone wall. Elizabeth did not utilize the land south of the stone wall after its purchase by the plaintiff, digging test pits only on the north portion in search of gravel to sell. There were no disputes between the plaintiff and Elizabeth or the defendant prior to Elizabeth\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The dispute concerning the location of the boundary line did not start until approximately 1985, when the defendant moved to the farm on his property. In approximately 1979, the plaintiff had loaned the defendant $7500, which was not repaid. The plaintiff, in 1986 or 1987, asked the defendant to repay that $7500 loan. The disputes over the plaintiffs ownership coincided with these requests for repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">In June, 1980, the defendant entered into a contract with the Rossi corporation to log his land, which was estimated at that time to be 100 acres. The contract called for logging only to the north of the stone wall between the fields. At the time of his contract with Rossi, the defendant placed his land in forestry classification, referencing his total acreage as 100 acres. In addition, he has paid taxes on 100 acres at least since that time. With the stone wall between the two fields as the boundary, the defendant\u2019s land is about 100 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The defendant began entering the disputed portion, that is the land south of the stone wall, to cut trees and to store junk vehicles in 1986 or 1987. Sometime within the last five years, the defendant made a road from the small field to a pond on the plaintiffs property. The defendant removed stones that the plaintiff placed to mark the boundary line. Since November 15, 1988, the defendant has cut approximately 100 trees, oak, maple and poplar. The value of these 100 trees is $4000. The defendant threatened to assault the plaintiff when encountering him in the disputed area. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>was aware that the plaintiff was claiming the disputed area as his since 1963 and took no action to dispute that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The boundary line between the property of the plaintiff and the defendant is the dashed line depicted by Stephen A. Filip<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> on his boundary survey, which is in evidence as plaintiffs exhibit G.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claims that the trial court improperly adopted the attorney trial referee\u2019s finding that the stone wall was the boundary between the two properties at issue and that its findings in doing so were inconsistent. Certain applicable principles, that will be supplemented as occasion requires, are appropriately set out at this point. All actions to determine record title of any interest in real property are governed by General Statutes \u00a7 47-31. <em>DeVita </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>13 Conn. App. 101, 104, 535 A.2d 364 (1987), cert. denied, 207 Conn. 807, 540 A.2d 375 (1988). The statute requires that the complaint in such an action describe the property in question, state the plaintiffs claim, interest or title and the manner in which the plaintiff acquired the interest, title or claim, and it must also name the person or persons who may claim the adverse interest or estate. General Statutes \u00a7 47-31. The burden of proof in this case is on the plaintiff to prove that the boundary is where he claims it to be. <em>Steinman </em>v. <em>Maier, </em>179 Conn. 574, 575, 427 A.2d 828 (1980); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Addis, </em>141 Conn. 738, 741, 110 A.2d 457 (1954). The plaintiff is required to prevail on the strength of his title and not on the weakness of his adversary\u2019s claim. <em>Velsmid </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>175 Conn. 221, 229, 397 A.2d 113 (1978); <em>Lake Garda Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Battistoni, </em>155 Conn. 287, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>293, 231 A.2d 276 (1967); <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Ruggerio, </em>24 Conn. App. 700, 704, 591 A.2d 453, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 903, 593 A.2d 967 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u201cIn determining a boundary line in a deed, the law is clear that the description in the deed, if clear and unambiguous, must be given effect. In such a case, there is no room for construction. The inquiry is not the intent of the parties but the intent which is expressed in the deed. <em>Lake Garda Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Battistoni, </em>160 Conn. 503, 511, 280 A.2d 877 <em>[1968];Faiola v. Faiola, </em>156 Conn. 12, 17, 238 A.2d 405 [1966]; <em>Katsoff v. Lucertini, </em>141 Conn. 74, 77, 103 A.2d 812 [1954]; <em>Patzloff v. Kasperovich, </em>116 Conn. 440, 441-42, 165 A. 349 [1933]; <em>Botsford v. Wallace, </em>69 Conn. 263, 271, 37 A. 902 [1899], Where the deed is ambiguous, however, the intention of the parties is a decisive question of fact. <em>Lake Garda Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Battistoni, </em>supra [511]; <em>Staff </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>135 Conn. 316, 319, 64 A.2d 176 [1949]; <em>Gioia </em>v. <em>Annunziata, </em>102 Conn. 52, 56, 127 A. 921 [1925]; <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>57 Conn. 447, 452, 18 A. 714 [1889].\u201d <em>F. &amp; AK, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sleeper, </em>161 Conn. 505, 510, 289 A.2d 905 (1971); see <em>Apostles of the Sacred Heart </em>v. <em>Curott, </em>187 Conn. 591, 595, 448 A.2d 157 <em>(1982); Faiola v. Faiola, </em>supra, 18. In ascertaining the intention of the parties, it was proper for the trial court to consider the surrounding circumstances. <em>Staff </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>supra, 319; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Fleetwood, </em>124 Conn. 386, 389, 200 A. 334 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">It is well settled as a rule of the construction of deeds that \u201c[w]here the boundaries of land are described by known and fixed monuments which are definite and certain, the monuments will prevail over courses and distances.\u201d <em>Frank Towers Corp. </em>v. <em>Laviana, </em>140 Conn. 45, 50, 97 A.2d 567 (1953); <em>Velsmid </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>175 Conn. 221, 227, 397 A.2d 113 (1978); <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Corideo, </em>102 Conn. 663, 672, 129 A. 849 (1925). The general rule is that the designated quantity of land called for, here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>acreage, is the least reliable aspect of the description in determining the intent by the parties. See <em>Texas Eastern Transmission Co. </em>v. <em>McCrate, </em>76 Ill. App. 3d 828, 395 N.E.2d 624 (1979); <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Wick, </em>22 Wash. App. 433, 591 P.2d 804 (1979); J. Backman &amp; D. Thomas, A Practical Guide to Disputes Between Adjoining Landowners\u2014Easements (1990) \u00a7 8.02; 12 Am. Jur. 2d, Boundaries \u00a7 75. The land of an adjoining owner whose boundaries can be fixed by known monuments is also considered to be a monument to establish a boundary. <em>Frank Towers Corp. </em>v. <em>Laviana, </em>supra, 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">A \u201cmonument,\u201d when used in describing land, has been defined as \u201cany physical object on the ground which helps to establish the location of the line called for and the term \u2018monument,\u2019 when used with reference to boundaries, indicates a permanent object which may be either a natural or artificial one. . . . Natural monuments include such natural objects as mountains, streams, rivers, creeks, springs, trees .... Artificial objects and monuments consist of marked lines, stakes, rocks, fences, buildings and similar matters marked or placed on the ground by the hand of man.\u201d 12 Am. Jur. 2d, Boundaries \u00a7 4, p. 549; 4 H. Tiffany, Real Property (3d Ed. 1975) \u00a7 993, p. 193; 3 American Law of Property, (Casner Ed. 1952) \u00a7 12.105; see <em>Delphey </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>227 Md. 373, 374-75, 177 A.2d 249 (1962). It has been said that \u201ca stone wall is strong evidence of a boundary line. <em>Roberti v. Atwater, </em>43 Conn. 540, 546 <em>[1876]\u201d; Pendleton </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>6 Conn. Sup. 5, 7 (1938); see <em>Wallingford Rod &amp; Gun Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nearing, </em>19 Conn. Sup. 414, 417, 116 A.2d 517 (1955). One court has said that a monument, when used in describing land, is \u201cany physical object on the ground which helps to establish the location of the line called for,\u201d whether it be natural or artificial. <em>Delphey </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>supra, 378. That court noted that, just as in contracts or wills, the intention of the parties governs the interpretation of deeds and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>that it is for that reason \u201cthat monuments named in deeds are given precedence over courses and distances, because the parties can see the tree, stone, stake, pipe or whatever it may be, which is referred to in the deed, but would require equipment and expect assistance to find a course and distance.\u201d Id. \u201c[T]he physical disappearance of a monument does not terminate its status as a boundary marker, provided that its former location can be ascertained through extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Look, </em>432 A.2d 1271, 1274 (Me. 1981); see <em>Theriault </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>588 A.2d 720, 722 (Me. 1991); <em>Seely </em>v. <em>Hand, </em>119 N.H 303, 307, 402 A.2d 162 (1979); 6 G. Thompson, Real Property (1962) \u00a7 3042.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has said: \u201cAny competent evidence may be considered in determining the true boundary line between adjoining owners.\u201d <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>269 Mass. 497, 500, 169 N.E. 509 (1930). Among the evidence that may properly be considered in the determination of boundary disputes between private owners is evidence that involves an exception to the hearsay rule. There it has been said that: \u201cA declaration as to boundaries between individual proprietors is hearsay, but it is one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule whenever the legal conditions of its admission are present.\u201d <em>Turgeon </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>83 Conn. 537, 540, 78 A. 577 (1910). \u201c\u2018The difficulty of proving private boundaries furnished the indispensable and urgent necessity for the admission of declarations of the deceased with respect to them. Many conveyances of agricultural land, and especially of woodland, do not describe the premises conveyed by courses and distances, nor even by fixed bounds. Lines cannot be run from them alone. When the private bounds are designated by landmarks, they are usually perishable in character and liable to soon disappear through decay and neglect, or in the further improve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ment and settlement of the country, so that the next generation has either forgotten, or never knew, them, or cannot find them.\u2019 Id., 541.\u201d <em>Putnam, Coffin &amp; Burr, Inc. </em>v. <em>Halpern, </em>154 Conn. 507, 513, 227 A.2d 83 (1967). Our courts have acknowledged that \u201c[t]he scope of the exception must reasonably be confined within the limits of the necessity from which it arose.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 513. Accordingly, our courts stated: \u201cDeclarations as to the location of ancient boundaries are hearsay, and are not admissible in evidence unless it appears (1) that the declarant is dead, (2) that he would be qualified as a witness to testify if present, and especially that he had peculiar means of knowing the boundary, (3) that the statement was made before the controversy in suit arose, and (4) that he had no interest to misrepresent the truth in making the declaration. <em>Mentz </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>118 Conn. 137, 144, 171 A. 10 [1934]; <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>105 Conn. 139, 149, 134 A. 803 [1926]; <em>Turgeon </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>[supra, 541], . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wildwood Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>211 Conn. 36, 44, 557 A.2d 1241 (1989), quoting <em>Putnam, Coffin &amp; Burr, Inc. </em>v. <em>Halpern, </em>supra, 513; <em>Rompe </em>v. <em>King, </em>185 Conn. 426, 428-29, 441 A.2d 114 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Each party produced an expert witness on this dispute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There was strongly conflicting evidence and it became the function of the trier of fact to determine credibility and, in doing so, it could \u201cbelieve all, some or none of the testimony\u201d of either expert. <em>Dooley </em>v. Leo, 184 Conn. 583, 586, 440 A.2d 236 (1981); <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Benning, </em>175 Conn. 308, 312-13, 398 A.2d 1158 (1978); see 12 Am. Jur. 2d, Boundaries \u00a7 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The <em>Turgeon </em>court set out the four requisites of the hearsay exception, which has enjoyed vitality to the present. Immediately before doing so, however, it took pains to state: \u201c \u2018The law does not dispense with the sanction of an oath and the test of cross-examination as a prerequisite for the admission of verbal testimony, unless it discovers in the nature of the case some other sanction or test deemed equivalent for ascertaining the truth.\u2019 Loomis, J., in <em>South-West School District </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>48 Conn. 504, 507 [1881]. Hence, in order to make such declaration equivalent in rehability and trustworthiness to the standard of ordinary testimony when subjected to cross-examination, certain conditions were attached to it as prerequisites to its admission.\u201d <em>Turgeon </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>supra, 83 Conn. 541. Evidence that is properly admitted under this exception, as it was in the trial court, is competent evidence for the trier to consider and weigh with all the other evidence in the case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Essentially, the defendant\u2019s claims here are, first, that the court\u2019s decision was incorrect, both as a matter of law and as a matter of fact, in finding that the division line between the property of the plaintiff and the defendant was a stone wall and, second, that the court improperly found that the defendant removed stones that the plaintiff had placed to mark the boundary between then-properties, while inconsistently finding that the stone wall was the boundary between them. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Both parties agree that the 1953 deed from Elizabeth to Richard Koennieke was ambiguous. That deed, stated as \u201ccontaining 115 acres, more or less,\u201d began its description of the property intended to be conveyed, as \u201c[beginning at the northwesterly comer of the within described tract at the junction of land now or formerly of Eugene A. Roure, formerly the D. M. Deming place, and the easterly side of the said Brook Road . . . .\u201d This deed then describes the property back to the point on the east side of Brook Road as running along walls.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In other words, although the deed refers to some named abutters, throughout its description it refers to running along walls from beginning to end. It is the east-west boundary between the parties that is in dispute. The plaintiff and the defendant are at counterpoint concerning the condition and nature of the stone wall that figures in the location of the east-west boundary. In his brief, the plaintiff maintains that \u201cthe parties agree that the property was not entirely surrounded by stone walls, as the literal description in the [ambiguous] deed indicated.\u201d This appears to be so. He also claims on the basis of the credible evidence and the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>law that certain barbed wire fencing described in the evidence constituted the western boundary with Roure, thus giving the attorney trial referee a \u201cclear basis\u201d to harmonize the ambiguity in the deed and to construe the calls for a stone wall as identifying the stone wall which traversed the two fields as the division line. This, he argues, is supported by the clear intention of Elizabeth as to what she intended to convey to Richard Koennicke in 1953 and what he fairly understood he was receiving. The plaintiff appears to concede that there may be a question on the initial call in the deed for a nonexistent stone wall \u201cat the junction of land of Eugene A. Roure.\u201d He, however, argues that by reconciling the first call of this deed as being marked by barbed wire<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> rather than by a stone wall, and by construing this call for the Roure boundary as a monument, all the other monuments of the deed were thus harmonized and rendered consistent the remaining calls in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The defendant argues that the determination of the boundary line was made based on \u201cfragmentary documentation\u201d when it should have been based on acreage, as was the determination of his expert Charles Norman-din. That expert relied on the acreage set out in the deed in question because, as he said, that deed did not give \u201cdetailed courses and distances.\u201d In addition, arguing that only \u201cremnants\u201d of a stone wall still exist in the disputed area, the defendant maintains that the use of them by the plaintiffs expert, Filip, to mark the plaintiffs northern boundary was improper. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>he discredits the reliance on the evidence coming in on the location of the contested boundary under an unfavored hearsay exception. After indicating that he agrees that the deed involved is ambiguous, he claims that the deed describes the boundary as beginning at the northwest corner of the property, but in actuality, he argues, the starting point is located at South Brook Road, which is on the south side of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Both parties offered expert testimony. The attorney trial referee credited the evidence of Filip over that of Normandin. The attorney trial referee found that the disputed east-west boundaiy line between the property of the parties was the \u201cdashed line\u201d depicted on the boundary survey prepared by Filip. That survey was the plaintiffs exhibit G. There was also other evidence from lay witnesses that supported that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Filip, in arriving at his determination of the location of the boundary, conducted a thorough investigation of Hampton land records as far back as the 1840s, including records of the location of various abutters particularly along Brook Road, which was the starting point for the description of the plaintiffs land in the 1953 deed to him from Elizabeth. In walking the area pointed out to him by the plaintiff as the boundary, Filip noted the presence of strands of wire, some barbed and some not. The earliest strands were without barb, which he opined were of the vintage of the 1920s and 1930s. Other wire strands were plain wire without barbs that was of an older vintage. This wire \u201cfence,\u201d which involved wire on both sides of trees, followed a course that he opined, based on all the information available to him, had been an east-west stone wall. He found remnants of that stone wall. In summary, the wire strands contained wire of at least three vintages, that of the type used for some years prior to the 1920s, some used in 1920s and 1930s and the newer thinner barbed wire, which started to be used probably twenty year\u2019s ago. He did not, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>find extensive evidence of monumentation. He was able to do so when he started on South Brook Street where he depicted the boundary between the abutter Roure and the plaintiff where \u201cthere\u2019s a partial wall\u2014three or four strands of wire there.\u201d This is part of his wire \u201cfence.\u201d This anchors, with other evidence, Roure as the abutter in that area. Adjacent land abutting may be used as a monument if the boundary of that adjacent land, as here with the abutter Roure, is fixed. <em>Staff </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>supra, 135 Conn. 319. Filip\u2019s survey was prepared in accordance with Class A-2 survey standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">On the other hand, Normandin never attempted to locate physical monuments in the field. Nevertheless, the defendant argues that because the deed involved was ambiguous, and the existing monuments \u201con the land between the parties [were] vague and unreliable,\u201d his expert \u201cturned instead to the acreage call found in the deeds from Elizabeth ... to Richard Koennicke.\u201d In his acreage call analysis, he examined three deeds conveying land to one Ebenezer Burnham during the early 1800s, enabling him to construct a 225 acre parcel from which the plaintiffs acre parcel conveyed by Elizabeth to William Koennicke (the predecessor of the defendant) was cut. In doing so, he did not integrate into his analysis whether his conclusion was at all affected by some forty-three other transfers of real estate in Hampton by Ebenezer Burnham as grantor between 1828 and 1878. Normandin\u2019s survey was prepared in accordance with Class D survey standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">There was also further evidence indicating the intention of the parties of the 1953 deed from Elizabeth to Richard Koennicke to convey the field south of the stone wall that separated the two fields. As pointed out, that deed did contain references to some stone walls that no longer exist. Filip, however, in using historical evidence, principally the barbed wire fencing, was able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to establish the boundary line that tracks the calls set out in this deed and does not ignore any of those calls. Again, it is to be remembered that that boundary concerns only the east-west line between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Prior to her 1953 conveyance to Richard Koennicke of this southern parcel, Elizabeth owned the entire property, i.e., the acreage north and south of the stone wall. Before she conveyed the southern portion (now owned by the defendant), she identified the stone wall between the two fields as the boundary line and she offered to sell it to her brother, Kurt G. Koennicke,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> telling him that if he did not buy it she was going to convey it to their uncle, Richard Koennicke, to satisfy her debt to him. Kurt himself testified that Elizabeth did offer to sell it to him and that at that time Elizabeth pointed out to him that the stone wall between the two fields was the boundary line. He also said \u201call the rest of it was what she gave back to Uncle Richard for [the] nonpayment of that $1500 . . . .\u201d After her reconveyance to Richard Koennicke,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Elizabeth acknowledged, on more than one occasion, this stone wall dividing the larger field from the smaller field as the boundary line between her property that she had retained. Before the plaintiff purchased his land from his uncle, Richard Koennicke, he walked the boundary line with his uncle, who indicated to him that he was conveying to the plaintiff the land south of the stone wall dividing the two fields. Elizabeth did not utilize the land to the south of the stone wall after the plaintiff purchased it. When Elizabeth was looking for usable gravel deposits on the land she retained, she caused test holes to be dug for that purpose, and although such test holes came very close to the stone wall boundary, they were never located south of that stone wall. Such statements and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>conduct by Elizabeth during her lifetime<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are evidence of her intention with regard to her 1953 deed to Richard Koennicke. They are of the nature of admissions. <em>Putnam, Coffin &amp; Burr, Inc. </em>v. <em>Halpern, </em>supra, 154 Conn. 513; <em>DiMaggio </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>165 Conn. 19, 22-23, 327 A.2d 561 (1973); <em>Turgeon </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>supra, 83 Conn. 543-44; <em>Apostles of the Sacred Heart </em>v. <em>Curott, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 599. The same observation applies to her grantee, Richard Koennicke, who, during his lifetime had no dispute with Elizabeth over the stone wall constituting the boundary between the land she deeded to him and the land she retained at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The plaintiff, now in his late sixties, testified that he was familiar with the property when it was entirely owned by his uncle. This familiarity started when he was under ten years of age and he began to help his father and his uncle maintain stone walls, put up new wire, build barways and the like. He was familiar with the boundary on an abutting parcel, and with the disputed east-west boundary and the wire fence in issue. He walked it with his father and uncle and later with Filip as the video was made. He agreed with the boundary line as drawn by Filip between the two fields. His credibility was for the trier to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Conduct of the defendant is also properly considered on this issue and it avails the plaintiff. In June, 1980, the defendant contracted with the Rossi Corporation to log his land and that contract called for logging only north of the stone wall between the two fields. That contract covered his parcel, which was estimated to be 100 acres. At the time of the Rossi contract, the defendant placed his land in forestry classifications setting out his total acreage as 100 acres. It is worth noting that with the stone wall between the two fields as the boundary, the defendant\u2019s land totals approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>100 acres. Moreover, at least since the time of the Rossi contract, the defendant has paid taxes on 100 acres and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">One more claim of the defendant on the boundary issue merits discussion. He claims that certain findings of the attorney trial referee are inconsistent and, therefore, clearly erroneous. See <em>Stamford </em>v. <em>Kovac, </em>36 Conn. App. 270, 274-75, 650 A.2d 626 (1994).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The claim is that a fatal inconsistency exists between the finding that the boundary line between the land of the plaintiff and that of the defendant was the stone wall as depicted on the dashed line on Filip\u2019s boundary survey while at the same time also finding that \u201cthe defendant removed stones the plaintiff placed at another location to make [the plaintiff\u2019s] boundary.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendant claims, without more, that the attorney trial referee \u201ccannot consistently make the finding that the remnants of a stone wall [between their properties] was the boundary line and at the same time conclude that the boundary was somewhere else.\u201d We do not agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The plaintiff testified that a stone wall was the division line between his land and that of the defendant. He also said that there were barways in that wall that permitted access to the fields to the north and south of that wall. He placed stones in those barways<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>attempting to block them so as to inhibit the defendant\u2019s trespasses on his land south of that wall. The defendant, however, bulldozed \u201cthe rocks way out into his own field.\u201d This happened on a number of occasions. These stones, so placed by the plaintiff in his barways, served to underscore the plaintiffs claim that, thus placed, they serve as evidence of his boundary. The defendant, by wrongfully bulldozing them elsewhere, cannot change that.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We conclude here that the trial court\u2019s adoption of the attorney trial referee\u2019s findings was not clearly erroneous. We conclude on the quiet title issue that the attorney trial referee properly determined that \u201cthe boundary of the plaintiff and the defendant is the dashed line depicted by Stephen A. Filip on his boundary survey, Exhibit G.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Next, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court could not properly find criminal trespass in this civil action because it lacked jurisdiction to do so. The trial court found that the defendant\u2019s actions constituted criminal trespass in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Section 52-560 provides that any person who cuts, destroys or carries away any trees standing on the land of another \u201cwithout the license of the owner\u201d shall pay to the injured party three times the reasonable value of such trees. Where, however, the court is satisfied that the defendant \u201cwas guilty through mistake and believed that the tree[s] . . . w[ere] growing on his own land\u201d then the court shall render judgment for no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>more than their reasonable value. In this case, it was found that although the defendant was aware that the plaintiff has claimed the disputed area as his own since 1963, he took no action. Despite this knowledge and his acquiescence, by his conduct, for many years in apparent recognition of the plaintiffs title, the defendant did later enter the plaintiffs property and, since November, 1988, has cut approximately 100 trees with a combined value of $4000.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In her memorandum of decision, the attorney trial referee stated that the \u201cplaintiff is entitled to $12,000 in damages on count two.\u201d Immediately thereafter, her memorandum of decision states: \u201cThis court would have recommended an award of attorney\u2019s fees for trespass however no evidence of an appropriate award was provided. However, in view of defendant\u2019s threats to plaintiff there is justification to award heightened damages. Accordingly, plaintiffs damages should be increased by half to $18,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Thereafter, the trial court accepted the report of the attorney trial referee. The court also ordered as adopted her memorandum of decision \u201cexcept for the award of punitive damages in count three. See <em>Chykirda </em>v. <em>Yanush, </em>131 Conn. 565, 569 [41 A. 449] (1945).\u201d The court\u2019s order went on to state: \u201cJudgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff as to count one establishing title to the disputed premises by deed; as to count two in the amount of $12,000; and, as to count three that a trespass has been committed by the defendant. Judgment is entered in favor of the defendant as to count four . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The plaintiffs complaint alleges that the \u201c[djefend-anf s actions constitute criminal trespass in violation of [\u00a7 53a-107].\u201d That section of the statutes, as the defendant properly points out, is a criminal statute which defines \u201cCriminal Trespass in the First Degree and is classified as a Class A misdemeanor.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is the most serious degree of the crime of trespass. The defendant argues that because the attorney trial referee was being asked in this case to hear and decide a civil matter, she did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear a criminal charge and that \u201cthe trial court clearly erred as a matter of law in considering the claim for criminal trespass.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We agree. The trial court and the attorney trial referee did not have jurisdiction to hear and decide that claim.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The fact remains that the trial court rendered judgment \u201cas to count three that a trespass had been com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>mitted by the defendant . . . .\u201d Its \u201cjudgment\u201d as to count three was, as the defendant claims, \u201crendered\u201d without jurisdiction. Our Supreme Court has stated: \u201cAs applied to a court, the word \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 means the power to hear and determine a cause.\u201d <em>Samson </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>138 Conn. 306, 309, 84 A.2d 273 (1951); <em>LaReau </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>158 Conn. 486, 492, 264 A.2d 576 (1969); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cato, </em>147 Conn. 418, 422, 162 A.2d 175 (1960). \u201cIt is well established that a court is without power to render a judgment if it lacks jurisdiction and that everything done under the judicial process of courts not having jurisdiction, is, ipso facto, void. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hunter\u2019s Lessee, </em>14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 364 (1816); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Conn. 199, 205, 365 A.2d 1202 (1976); <em>Clover </em>v. <em>Urban, </em>108 Conn. 13, 17, 142 A. 389 (1928).\u201d <em>Chrysler Credit Corp. </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 229, 429 A.2d 478 (1980) <em>(Loiselle, J., </em>concurring).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s judgment on the third count was void on its face. Clearly, there was no subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cA judgment void on its face and requiring only an inspection of the record to demonstrate its invalidity is a mere nullity, in legal effect no judgment at all, conferring no right and affording no justification .... It neither binds nor bars anyone. All acts performed under it and all claims flowing out of it are void. The parties attempting to enforce it may be responsible as trespassers.\u201d 1 A. Freeman, Judgments (5th Ed. 1925) \u00a7 322. A void judgment \u201cis without life and will be ignored everywhere.\u201d <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 114, 123, 328 A.2d 695 (1973); see 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments \u00a7 31 (1994). \u201cA court is without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>power to render a judgment if it lacks jurisdiction of the parties or of the subject-matter, one or both. In such cases, the judgment is void, has no authority and may be impeached.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Waterbury Title Co., </em>117 Conn. 39, 43, 166 A. 673 (1933); <em>Krueger </em>v. <em>Krueger, </em>179 Conn. 488, 493, 427 A.2d 400 (1980). It is concluded that the trial court improperly rendered judgment on the third count; that judgment of trespass was, and is, void.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Despite our conclusion that the judgment of trespass rendered on the third count is void, further discussion of it is necessary because of the effect of it claimed by the parties as to the second count. The defendant contends that because the only \u201cexplicit finding of trespass was made regarding criminal trespass\u201d and because \u201cno penalty was imposed for violation of \u00a7 53a-107, the only purpose for a finding of criminal trespass was for use in finding a violation of the tree cutting statute [\u00a7 52-560].\u201d He further argues that \u201c[therefore, the use of the wrongful determination of a criminal trespass to establish a violation of the tree cutting statute is fatal to the finding of a wrongful tree cutting.\u201d The plaintiff, in answering the defendant\u2019s claim that a finding of criminal trespass cannot be made in a civil action, says that that claim is \u201cill-founded and misconstrues both the plaintiffs complaint and the ruling\u201d by the attorney trial referee. In doing so, the plaintiff concedes that his complaint alleged a claim that the actions of the defendant were wilful and without basis \u201csince they constituted violations of the standards established by ... \u00a7 53a-107,\u201d but argues that he did not seek criminal sanctions, and the attorney trial referee did not presume to impose criminal sanctions. Moreover, he argues that the third count was proper both as to a claim for damages for trespass and to a claim for punitive damages for the wrongful cutting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>trees. The plaintiff maintains that, in claiming punitive damages, a plaintiff must clearly allege wilful and egregious conduct of the defendant in order to justify the imposition of punitive damages. Therefore, he claims that the allegation that the defendant\u2019s actions were \u201cthe equivalent of criminal trespass in the first degree is a factual pleading that the actions were willful and egregious and could therefore be the basis of the imposition of punitive damages under [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-560.\u201d While he concedes that he seeks \u201cdamages and punitive damages\u201d arising out of his claim as to the third count vis-a-vis the second count, the plaintiff nevertheless urges that he \u201csought no criminal sanction\u201d and the trial court imposed no such sanction on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">However much the plaintiff appears to distance himself from \u201cthe no criminal sanctions were sought or imposed\u201d aspect of the judgment on the third count, at the same time, he adopts the finding by the attorney trial referee and the judgment of the trial court of trespass on that count, and in doing so he disingenuously maintains that the trial court improperly rejected the attorney trial referee\u2019s recommended award of damages for trespass. This whole controversy swirls around the award by the attorney trial referee of the $6000 of \u201cheightened damages.\u201d Pointing out that the attorney trial referee concluded that \u201cin view of the defendant\u2019s threats to the plaintiff there is justification to award heightened damages.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that he is entitled to the $6000 \u201cenhanced damages\u201d award.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In granting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201cheightened\u201d damages, the plaintiff claims that the attorney trial referee was \u201cmerely making an appropriate damages award for the consequence of defendant\u2019s trespasses.\u201d The trial court refused to approve the attorney trial referee\u2019s award of \u201ccommon law punitive damages\u201d as recommended in the attorney trial referee\u2019s memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The plaintiffs drawing on \u00a7 53a-107 is somewhat disingenuous. He argues, on the one hand, that it is in the case only to permit the establishment of the elements of a criminal trespass in order to provide the basis for finding that egregious conduct that he admittedly wants to use, and the attorney trial referee did use to justify the \u201cheightened\u201d damages. Yet, selectively, he says that there has been no criminal sanction imposed under \u00a7 53a-107, nor did he ask for any. He does not offer any authority<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> to support his contention that this criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>statute, a first class misdemeanor, may properly be pleaded and employed here as he claims. Pleading it as he does, as a separate count, as a separate cause<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> of action, on which a judgment of trespass was \u201crendered\u201d by the trial court which he accepted, the plaintiff cannot now insist that he is entitled to draw on the third count to support the \u201cheightened damages\u201d award of $6000 and otherwise to disavow the overt criminal character of \u00a7 53a-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Moreover, the plaintiffs argument, that we should adopt his claim that he is entitled to \u201cenhanced civil damages\u201d because of his claim that there are many circumstances in which allegations of a statute which is \u201ccriminal in nature\u201d may be made to establish entitlement to \u201cenhanced civil damages,\u201d is wholly unpersuasive in this case. The tree cutting statute does \u201cnot give a new and independent cause of action,\u201d but prescribes \u201cthe measure of damages in cases where compensatory damages would, in the absence of the statute, be recoverable.\u201d <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Spicer, </em>90 Conn. 576, 583, 98 A. 135 (1916). In providing for damages in excess of actual damages, the amount \u201cis assessed with reference to the degree of the defendant\u2019s culpability.\u201d <em>Cristilly </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>87 Conn. 461, 469, 88 A. 711 (1913) <em>(Beach, J., </em>dissenting). Our Supreme Court has indicated its recognition that the damages provision of the tree cutting statute does contain considerations of the culpability aspect of the defendant\u2019s conduct. In <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Watrous, </em>134 Conn. 592, 600, 59 A.2d 723 (1948), our Supreme Court stated: \u201c \u2018The statute, like others in the statute book which provide damages for wrongful conduct in excess of those ordinarily recoverable, is not a penal statute ... it affords the basis of a civil action in which the damages, \u201cassessed because of and with reference to the degree of the defendant\u2019s culpability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>may be, and generally are, compensatory in their nature, although they embrace injuries or expenses not included in strict legal damages.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Rugg, </em>22 Conn. Sup. 189, 193, 164 A.2d 859 (1960) <em>(House, </em>J.). The place of culpability in the calculus of damages comes in only where the defendant has not sustained his burden of proof on the matter of the statutory provision for mitigation of mistake. See id., 192-93. It becomes evident that \u00a7 52-560 has built into its provision for treble damages, \u201cincreased\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> damages over \u201cactual damages sustained\u201d that invokes the culpability aspect of the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Having discussed certain interaction between the first and second counts from the perspective of damages, we now turn directly to the second count, which is brought under \u00a7 52-560. In addition to what we have already said about \u00a7 52-560, we point out the following considerations. Since trespass is a possessory action, it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove possession, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>actual or constructive, to prevail. <em>Wadsworth Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Sundberg, </em>165 Conn. 457, 461, 338 A.2d 470 (1973); <em>More v. Urbano, </em>151 Conn. 381, 383, 198 A.2d 211 (1964). This, the plaintiff has done. \u201cTo escape the imposition of treble damages, it was incumbent upon [the defendant] to prove not only mistake but the further . . . affirmative belief that the timber was growing on his own land.\u201d <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Rugg, </em>supra, 22 Conn. Sup. 195. This, the defendant did not do. The mistake, of course, that is necessary to resist successfully the imposition of treble damages under the statute must be an honest mistake and belief. See <em>Petroman </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>105 Conn. 366, 371, 135 A. 391 (1926); <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Rugg, </em>supra, 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">We have determined that the plaintiff cannot draw at all on the third count in any fashion to aid him in his claims, especially for damages, which he makes for enhanced or heightened damages under the second count. Nevertheless, he claims that there is authority to permit such damages, over and above the treble damages of $12,000 awarded to him under \u00a7 52-560. Arguing that such venerable cases as <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>2 Root (Conn.) 301 (1795), and <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>3 Day (Conn.) 447, 450 (1809), allowed damages for malice and insult as well as actual loss in trespass action, he maintains that the same should be done here. Those cases are easily distinguishable as neither involved tree cutting and there was such a statute in those days. Moreover, he offers no analysis as to why such damages should be allowed when \u00a7 52-560 does not provide for them although the legislature has included in the treble damages provision a culpability factor over and above actual loss.

Years ago, our Supreme Court, in synthesizing earlier decisions on this exception, said in <em>Turgeon </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>supra, 83 Conn. 540-41, that \"[i]n some instances exceptions to 1 his rule have grown up through necessity, from the knowledge that the only alternative is the practical abandonment of all attempt to prove certain kinds of facts unless the hearsay barrier is let down, and in the established and general knowledge that the great majority of human affairs are more or less affected by a reliance upon hearsay without imperilling their trustworthiness, or their efficiency and safety. Swift\u2019s Evidence, 121. <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Supreme Lodge, </em>74 Conn. 715, 718, 52 Atl. 722 [1902], furnishes an example of an exception to the hearsay rule, based upon necessity. Necessity alone could not have secured these exceptions to the hearsay rule, unless courts had been able to see that, with the adoption of certain safeguards as conditions precedent to the reception of such evidence, reliance might be placed upon it as reasonably to be trusted.

The third count, concerning which jurisdiction in this case never existed, could never be the source of granting relief. See 1 A. Freeman, Judgments (5th Ed. 1925) \u00a7 321.

The former statute does provide that the trier of fact may award double or treble damages where the defendant has operated a motor vehicle \u201cdeliberately or with reckless disregard\u201d in violation of any of nine specific statutes set out in \u00a7 14-295. The latter statute provides for the payment of treble damages against any person \u201cwho steals any property of another or knowingly receives and conceals stolen property . . . .\u201d There are other statutes that allow tire recovery of double or treble damages in addition to compensatory damages by specifically so stating that in the statute. Such statutes include General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-565, 52-566, 52-567, 52-568, 52-569, 52-560 and 47a-46.

See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-290a, 52-240b.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The plaintiff, however, has not pointed to any statutory authority for the awarding of \u201cheightened\u201d damages where the statute involved already contains, as does \u00a7 52-560, for damages over and above compensatory damages and where the trebling of his compensatory damages has already been adjudged. Simply, the plaintiffs actual loss was found to be $4000 but because of the circumstances, the attorney trial referee recommended and the trial court ordered judgment for $12,000 on the second count, thus giving him the maximum recovery which was provided for under \u00a7 52-560.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b55-5\"> See Practice Book \u00a7 138.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b56-8\"> The plaintiff makes reference to the $6000 award as \u201cenhanced\u201d damages. His analysis as to just how \u201cenhanced damages\u201d is to be defined is lacking. We do note, however, that courts, when addressing the double or treble damage statutes, have referred to such damages as involving \u201cstatutorily enhanced damages.\u201d <em>Avis Rent A Car System., Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins.

The environmental statutory scheme permits the recovery of \u201c[statutorily] enhanced damages.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-451 (a), allowing damages equal to \u201cone and a half times the costs and expenses incurred,\u201d and in certain circumstances \u201ctwo times the costs and expenses\u201d incurred by the department of environmental protection in handling certain types of environmental law violations, and <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Refuse Gardens, Inc., </em>229 Conn. 455, 457, 642 A.2d 697 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">We have already decided that the void nature of the judgment of the trial court affords him nothing that may be imported into the second count. Neither can his reference to \u201cenhanced damages\u201d or \u201cheightened damages\u201d entitle him to claim validly that he is entitled to anything more than treble damages under the second count which invokes \u00a7 52-560.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\"> The plaintiff has not demonstrated any persuasive reason for not following\u201c[t]hegeneralruleoflawknownastheAmericanrule . . . that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 590, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
