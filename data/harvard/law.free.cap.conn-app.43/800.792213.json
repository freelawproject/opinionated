The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to prove (1) misconduct by the board, (2) prejudice to the plaintiff, (3) that one of the arbitrators imperfectly exercised her powers, and (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>that the award was untimely under General Statutes \u00a7 31-98. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Our examination of the record and briefs of the parties persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. In its comprehensive memorandum of decision, the trial court analyzed the law in a manner consistent with a proper interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 and consistent with case precedent relating to the confirmation or vacating of arbitration awards. See <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3,</em>203 Conn. 133, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision; <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Local 1716, Council 4, AFSCME, </em>44 Conn.
