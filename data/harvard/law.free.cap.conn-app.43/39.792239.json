The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) considered the plaintiffs untimely motion for attorney\u2019s fees, and (2) concluded that the defendant\u2019s action lacked any substantial justification. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The following facts are necessary for the disposition of this appeal. The plaintiff requested that the defendant, through Medicaid, pay for a motorized wheelchair for his use in the skilled nursing facility in which he resided. The defendant denied this request pursuant to a department policy that concludes that motorized wheelchairs are not medically necessary to patients residing in skilled nursing facilities. The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, which reversed the defendant\u2019s decision and ordered it to pay for the wheelchair. The defendant did not appeal the merits of the trial court\u2019s decision. Four and one-half months after the judgment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court granted the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees on the ground that there was no substantial justification for the defendant\u2019s refusal to pay for the wheelchair. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant appeals from this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly considered the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees because it was not timely filed.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We have recently held that \u201cpostjudgment motions under \u00a7 4-184a must be filed within a reasonable time of the entering of the final judgment, and that the determination of whether such a motion has been filed within a reasonable time is a matter within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Oakley v. Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>38 Conn. App. 506, 517, 662 A.2d 137 (1995), aff'd, 237 Conn. 28, 675 A.2d 851 (1996). In <em>Oakley, </em>we concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by considering a motion for attorney\u2019s fees almost five months after the rendering of judgment because \u00a7 4-184a contains no express time limitations and the parties did not claim that they were prejudiced or unfairly surprised by the trial court\u2019s ruling. Id. In the present case, the defendant did not claim prejudice or surprise. <em>Oakley </em>is therefore controlling and we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ruling on the motion for attorney\u2019s fees four and one-half months after it rendered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 4-184a (b) on the basis of its conclusion that the agency acted \u201cwithout any substantial justification\u201d under \u00a7 4-184a (b). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>agree with the defendant and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that the decision to award attorney\u2019s fees and other costs rests solely with the trial court. . . . Because \u00a7 4-184a (b) provides that the court may, in its discretion, make such an award, we review the denial of an award of such fees under an abuse of discretion standard. . . . [W]hen reviewing a claim [made pursuant to \u00a7 4-184a (b)] that the trial court abused its discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness, and the ultimate issue is whether the court could have reasonably concluded as it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Labenski </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>41 Conn. App. 866, 871, 678 A.2d 496 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">After arguments were heard in this case, this court, for the first time, construed the language \u201cwithout any substantial justification\u201d contained in \u00a7 4-184a. Id. In <em>Labenski, </em>this court, guided by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of claims made pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 (Sup. 1996), and <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S. Ct. 2541, 101 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1988), concluded that the phrase \u201csubstantially justified\u201d means justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person. <em>Laben-ski </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 872. In reaching that conclusion, the <em>Labenski </em>court noted that this reasonableness definition is no different from the \u201creasonable basis both in law and fact\u201d formulation that has been adopted by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Id.; see <em>Federal Election Commission </em>v. <em>Political Contributions Data, Inc., </em>995 F.2d 383, 386 (2d Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Utilizing that construction of \u201cwithout any substantial justification\u201d in this case, we conclude that the defendant had a reasonable basis both in law and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>fact to deny the plaintiffs request for a motorized wheelchair. Thus, the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The defendant explains that it relied on 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.70 (b) (3) (c)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to determine that the plaintiff was not entitled to a motorized wheelchair. On the basis of the language of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.70 (b) (3) (c), the defendant established department policy 198E.III.a.5 (b), in which motorized wheelchairs were included in a category of medical equipment that was not authorized for patients residing in skilled nursing facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The trial court found that the defendant was not substantially justified in relying on its established policy because that policy had been declared invalid in an unreported Superior Court decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We note, however, that the same policy was upheld in another unreported Superior Court decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Trial court cases do not establish binding precedent. <em>J.M. Lynne Co. </em>v. <em>Geraghty, </em>204 Conn. 361, 369, 528 A.2d 786 (1987). The defendant was faced with conflicting opinions as to its policy. Thus, in light of the conflicting trial court decisions concerning the validity of its policy, we cannot conclude that the defendant did not have substantial justification in continuing to rely on its established policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The trial court next found that the defendant lacked substantial justification in denying the plaintiffs request for a motorized wheelchair because its policy was not included in the defendant\u2019s \u201cuniform policy manual\u201d and therefore was not a legally promulgated regulation. The defendant contends that although the policy was not included in the \u201cuniform policy manual,\u201d the policy was contained in a medical services manual in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 17b-10 (a), which provides: \u201cAll policy manuals of the department, as they exist on May 23, 1984 . . . <em>shall be construed to have been adopted as regulations </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that the defendant\u2019s medical services manual was in effect before May 23,1984. Therefore, pursuant to \u00a7 17b-10, the policy contained therein has the effect of a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The plaintiff claims that even if the medical services manual has the force of regulation under \u00a7 17b-10 (a), it was required to be updated by January 1, 1987, in accordance with \u00a7 17b-10 (c) to continue to have legal effect as a regulation. Although \u00a7 17b-10 (c) clearly requires the public assistance policy manual to be updated, this section makes no such requirement for the medical services policy manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">The plaintiff urges us to construe subsection (c) to include the medical services manual, but such a construction contradicts the legislative intent as evinced by the legislative history of the statute. In 1988, the legislature expressly incorporated the medical services manual into the group of manuals covered by subsection (a). At that time, the legislature made no such change to the manuals covered by subsection (c). We cannot, through statutory construction, replace terms that were omitted in a statute. See <em>Battersby </em>v. <em>Bat-tersby, </em>218 Conn. 467, 470-71, 590 A.2d 427 (1991). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>presume that the legislature had a purpose in amending the words and phrases in the 1988 amendment. See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>219 Conn. 703, 713, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). We therefore conclude that the defendant did not lack substantial justification in relying on its policy because the policy was a regulation pursuant to \u00a7 17b-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The defendant also maintains that its refusal to pay for the wheelchair was substantially justified because it relied on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (10) and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.230, which expressly afford states the discretion to place \u201camount, scope or duration\u201d limitations on covered services and \u201cappropriate limits on a service based on such criteria as medical necessity or on utilization control procedures\u201d in formulating its policy that motorized wheelchairs are not medically necessary to patients residing in skilled nursing facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The trial court held that medical necessity must be determined by the applicant\u2019s treating physician, and, therefore, the defendant was not substantially justified in relying on its regulation. The trial court supported that conclusion with an unreported Superior Court case<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and an Eighth Circuit federal case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because neither of these decisions was binding on the defendant, neither furnishes an adequate basis for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant acted without substantial justification by not relying on them and instead relying on its own established policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The trial court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees because it found that the defendant denied the plaintiff due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>process by keeping him in an skilled nursing facility and by merely rubber-stamping denials of requests for wheelchairs. Neither of these claims has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Neither party raised the issue of due process at the original administrative hearing or in argument before the trial court. The administrative hearing officer did not make a factual finding that the defendant played any part in the plaintiffs placement in the skilled nursing facility or that the defendant was rubber-stamping requests. Rather, these issues were raised for the first time by the trial court when considering the motion to award attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">In reviewing an administrative decision, the trial court is not to retry the case. <em>Nelseco Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>34 Conn. App. 352, 354, 641 A.2d 847 (1994). The trial court is confined to the record of the administrative hearing. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (i). Accordingly, the trial court should not have added facts to that record when making a determination on the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Similarly, the trial court should not have considered \u201cother cases\u201d in making an award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case because it is statutorily mandated to conduct its judicial review exclusively by reference to the record. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (i); <em>Neri </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>3 Conn. App. 531, 537, 490 A.2d 528, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 808, 494 A.2d 905 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">None of the reasons articulated by the trial court supports the conclusion that the defendant lacked substantial justification in denying the plaintiff a motorized wheelchair. To the contrary, the defendant has furnished numerous reasons that overwhelmingly demonstrate that its actions were substantially justified as that term has been defined in <em>Labenski </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The decision awarding attorney\u2019s fees is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">In this opinion LAVERY, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\"> The plaintiff asserts that his motion for attorney\u2019s fees was timely filed, but that the hearing was delayed due to mishandling of the motion by the clerk\u2019s office. Our disposition of the defendant\u2019s claims does not depend on the accuracy of this statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-184a (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn any appeal ... of an agency decision taken in accordance with section 4-183 . . . the court may, in its discretion, award to the prevailing party, other than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>agency, reasonable fees and expenses ... if the court determines that the action of the agency was undertaken without any substantial justification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b67-11\"> We do not address whether the legislature intended to \u201calter the legislative budgetary allotments by allowing one state agency to obtain an award of attorney\u2019s fees against another state agency,\u201d because the issue was argued in a footnote and therefore not properly briefed. <em>Mulholland </em>v. <em>Mulholland, </em>31 Conn. App. 214, 215 n.1, 624 A 2d 379 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 643, 643 A.2d 246 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-9\"> Section 440.70 (b) (3) (c) of 42 C.F.R. provides: \u201cHome health services include the following services and items . . .
