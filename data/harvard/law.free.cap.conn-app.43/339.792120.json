On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) refused to order the state to disclose the identity of certain confidential police informants and declined to conduct an in camera examination of those informants, (2) refused to deliver a cautionary instruction concerning a comment made by the state\u2019s attorney relating to the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence, a comment that the defendant claims violated her due process right to a fair trial, (3) refused to instruct the jury concerning the statutory definitions of \u201cnarcotic substance\u201d and \u201ccontrolled substance,\u201d thereby depriving the defendant of her constitutional right to have the jury determine whether the state had satisfied its burden of proof with respect to each element of the offenses charged, (4) prohibited the defendant from testifying that, prior to her arrest in this case, she had never been arrested for or convicted of a crime, and (5) excluded evidence that another individual had entered a guilty plea and was awaiting sentencing for possession with intent to sell the same cocaine that was the subject of the defendant\u2019s case. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On September 27,1994, the defendant was sharing an apartment at 37-A Lake Street in Norwich with Lisa Wosston and Wosston\u2019s two children. The defendant and Wosston had been sharing the apartment for approximately two months and were its only adult occu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>pants. During the time that Wosston and the defendant shared the apartment, people were constantly entering and shortly thereafter leaving the apartment. The Norwich police department conducted a surveillance of the apartment over a two or three day period prior to September 27, 1994, and observed the constant flow of people at the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">On September 27, 1994, the defendant and Nathaniel Charles arrived at the apartment together and went directly into the defendant\u2019s bedroom. At approximately 7:19 p.m., members of the statewide narcotics task force, with members of the Norwich police department, executed a search and seizure warrant at 37-A Lake Street. The warrant authorized the search of the premises as well as a search of the persons of the defendant and Wosston.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The police entered the apartment through an unlocked door that led into the kitchen. A closed door that led into a bedroom was forced open by Officer Mark Rankowitz of the Norwich police department. Rankowitz entered the bedroom followed by Officers John A. John and Christopher Ferace.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The defendant and Charles were lying on a mattress on the floor of the bedroom. Charles was holding a razor blade in his hand and was cutting a substance on a cutting board that was resting on a small strongbox on the floor. The defendant was holding a plastic bag containing a substance, and she dropped the bag as the police entered the bedroom. The defendant and Charles were handcuffed and placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The police confiscated the cutting board and a white rock-like substance that was on the board. The police also seized fifteen clear plastic bags containing a beige rock-like substance. The strongbox contained a clear plastic bag containing a number of rock-like pieces individually packaged in plastic wrap.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>The rock-like material confiscated at 37-A Lake Street was cocaine in freebase form, otherwise known as crack cocaine, and weighed 37.75 grams, representing approximately 180 individual dosage units. Cocaine in freebase form is not water soluble and when heated becomes a vapor smoke that is inhaled into the lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The police also confiscated empty plastic bags and packaging materials that were next to the strongbox, a loaded .40 caliber dock semiautomatic handgun from the strongbox, and a beeper. No materials indicating the use of cocaine such as pipes or other implements were found on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The quantity of drugs was consistent with an amount held for sale and inconsistent with an amount held for personal use. The presence of the beeper indicated that the drugs were being sold from the premises because drug dealers make use of beepers as a method of communication. The individually wrapped packages of cocaine and the presence of packaging material were also consistent with the preparation of drugs for sale. The lack of smoking devices on the premises indicated that the drugs were not for personal use. The manner in which the chips of crack cocaine were removed from the bulk product with a razor blade and packaged in the ends of clear plastic bags was consistent with practices of a freebase cocaine dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The defendant\u2019s apartment at 37-A Lake Street in Norwich is 1370 feet from the property line of St. Joseph\u2019s School. The distance from the most remote comer of the apartment building to the property line of the school is 1410 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">At trial, the defendant testified in her own behalf. She asserted that Wosston had invited her to be her roommate and that she moved into 37-A Lake Street toward the end of July, 1994. The defendant claimed that she met Charles in June, 1994, and that he became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>her boyfriend in August, 1994. She claimed that sometime between September 7 and September 10, 1994, Charles brought drugs into the apartment at 37-A Lake Street. The defendant asserted that she ordered Charles to remove his drugs from the apartment and that Charles became angry and left the apartment. The defendant claimed that Charles brought drugs into the apartment on a second occasion and that, when she told him to remove the drugs, he again became angry.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The defendant testified that on September 17, 1994, Charles came to the apartment with a small safe and asked if he could leave the safe, which contained \u201cwork,\u201d in the apartment. The defendant testified that the term \u201cwork\u201d means narcotics. The defendant claimed that when she told Charles that he could not store the material with her, Charles became enraged, slapped her face and left with the safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The defendant asserted that she did not speak with Charles between the day that he struck her and the day that they were arrested in the defendant\u2019s bedroom. She claimed that on September 25, 1994, she observed Charles at the corner of Lake and Boswell Streets, but did not speak with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The defendant testified that on September 27, 1994, Charles called her at home and asked if he could come over to see her. She testified that she told Charles he could visit and she then went to take a shower. The defendant claimed that when she came out of the shower and went into the bedroom, Charles was in the room sitting on the edge of the bed cutting up drugs. She testified that she told Charles to take his drugs and to leave, but, at that point, the police entered the bedroom. The defendant claimed that when the police entered her apartment, she was walking past Charles and toward the bed. The defendant asserted that when the police entered her bedroom, she jumped onto the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>bed and began jumping up and down and screaming. She claimed that when the police entered the room, she had a towel in her hand that she promptly dropped. The defendant testified that she was not lying on the mattress next to Charles when the police entered the room, was not holding a plastic bag and was not in possession of the cocaine with the intent to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly refused to order the state to disclose the identity of two confidential informants who had supplied information to the police that was used in establishing probable cause for the issuance of the search and seizure warrant. The defendant posits that the trial court\u2019s refusal was improper because the informants \u201chad placed the responsibility for dealing in cocaine upon one of the state\u2019s crucial witnesses,\u201d namely, Wosston. The defendant also asserts that the trial court improperly declined \u201cto conduct an in camera examination of those informants in order to determine the extent to which their observations were exculpatory.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The following additional information is necessary to our resolution of this claim. In their application for the search and seizure warrant, the police stated that two confidential informants, A and B, had informed the police that drug related activity was taking place at 37-A Lake Street. Informant A told the police that a crack cocaine operation was based at the apartment. Informant A also told the police that a supply of crack cocaine was being kept inside the apartment and that \u201ctwo females,\u201d including \u201cLisa,\u201d were selling the cocaine in front of the apartment. Informant A participated in a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from an unknown male who was selling the cocaine for \u201cLisa\u201d outside the apartment. Informant B also revealed that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>crack cocaine operation was based at 37-A Lake Street. Informant B participated in a controlled purchase of crack cocaine from a female named \u201cKiki,\u201d who was selling crack cocaine from and residing at the apartment. The application did not reveal that the confidential informants were involved in the drug selling operation allegedly taking place at 37-A Lake Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">When called on to determine the propriety of a trial court\u2019s ruling refusing to order the disclosure to the defendant of the identity of a confidential informant, we must decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling as it did rule. <em>State </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>176 Conn. 131, 132-33, 405 A.2d 68 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>162 Conn. 215, 229, 292 A.2d 903 (1972). We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order the disclosure of the names of the confidential informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roviaro v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S. Ct. 623, 1 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1957), provides a starting point for our analysis of how courts should balance the state\u2019s interest in protecting informants against the defendant\u2019s interest in obtaining information useful in conducting his defense. Courts have recognized an informant\u2019s privilege. \u2018What is usually referred to as the informer\u2019s privilege is in reality the Government\u2019s privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law. . . . The purpose of the privilege is the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective law enforcement. The privilege recognizes the obligation of citizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforcement officials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages them to perform that obligation. . . .\u2019 Id., 59.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>204 Conn. 654, 657-58, 529 A.2d 1236 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201cOne limitation on this privilege arises from \u2018the fundamental requirements of fairness. Where the disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity ... is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way. In these situations the trial court may require disclosure and, if the Government withholds the information, dismiss the action.\u2019 . . . <em>[Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 353 U.S. 60-61]. Thus, when disclosure is required, it is not because of any police misbehavior that must be the subject of a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cThere is \u2018no fixed rule with respect to disclosure .... The problem is one that calls for balancing the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense. Whether a proper balance renders nondisclosure erroneous must depend on the particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer\u2019s testimony, and other relevant factors.\u2019 . . . Id., 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u201c \u2018Under the <em>Roviaro </em>balancing test, case law has delineated the extent to which disclosure <em>\u201cmight </em>have been helpful to the defense.\u201d . . . Before a court will compel disclosure, the informant typically must be a participant in the alleged crime or an eyewitness thereto.\u2019 . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>30 Conn. App. 470, 479, 620 A.2d 1303 (1993), aff'd, 229 Conn. 60, 640 A.2d 533 (1994). If the informant, in addition to being a participant or an observer of the crime, claims that the defendant was not the person involved in the crime, disclosure is, of course, all the more necessary. <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 353 U.S. 64-65. \u2018By contrast, courts generally agree that if the informant provides information to law enforcement officers without any further involvement, disclosure must yield to the protection of the informant.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>supra, 479. In cases in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the defendant has distinctly invoked the defense of entrapment, or where the testimony of the informant might show entrapment, disclosure is favored. <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 64; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>supra, 480. However, \u2018[m]ere speculation that the informant\u2019s information will be helpful to the defense is not sufficient to mandate disclosure . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>[supra, 204 Conn. 663]; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>159 Conn. 521, 529, 271 A.2d 74 (1970), cert. dismissed, 400 U.S. 1019, 91 S. Ct. 578, 27 L. Ed. 2d 630 (1971). \u2018The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating the need for disclosure of an informer\u2019s identity.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>178 Conn. 444, 446, 423 A.2d 117 (1979).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>37 Conn. App. 491, 496-98, 656 A.2d 1056 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Here, there is no indication that the confidential informants were participants in the crimes with which the defendant was charged. The charges against the defendant did not include the <em>sale </em>of a narcotic or controlled substance but were limited to <em>possession with intent to sell. </em>Moreover, the defendant conceded at trial that the informants were neither witnesses to nor participants in the crimes with which the defendant was charged. Thus, the informants did nothing more than provide the police with information that was included in the application for a search and seizure warrant. It was the evidence that was discovered in the course of the search that gave rise to the defendant\u2019s convictions, not the information used to establish probable cause for the warrant. \u201cWhen the evidence discloses that the informer was merely an informer and nothing more the government is not compelled to disclose his identity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The defendant\u2019s theory of defense was that the cocaine inside the apartment belonged to Charles, and that, therefore, she could not have been in possession of the cocaine with the intent to sell it. The informants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>however, provided no information to the police that implicated Charles as the owner of the cocaine found in the apartment. The information provided by the informants indicated that the defendant was directly involved in the sale of drugs, a charge not levied against her in this case. Moreover, the fact that the informants implicated Wosston, a witness for the state, as a drug seller operating out of the apartment with the assistance of a man does not mean that the informants possessed exculpatory information as to whether Charles was the sole possessor of the cocaine at issue. Thus, we are left with \u201conly surmise and conjecture ... as to how the informer[s] could supply information which would be beneficial to the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">On the basis of the foregoing facts, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the motion for disclosure of the names of the confidential informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court acted improperly in refusing to conduct an in camera examination of the confidential informants. Whether to conduct an in camera examination is a decision that is also vested in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. Richardson, supra, 204 Conn. 662. An in camera examination is not mandated simply because a defendant makes a request for the names of the informants. Id. \u201cIn determining whether to conduct an in camera proceeding a judge must balance the \u2018public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense.\u2019 <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, [353 U.S.] 62. A defendant\u2019s interest in having a judge conduct an in camera proceeding is not of constitutional magnitude when an informant is a mere tipster who did not participate in the crime which is being charged. The state has a superior interest in protecting the identity of its informants when the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>of the testimony offered in proof of the crime itself is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u201cThere are serious potential risks involved in conducting an in camera hearing to examine an informant. One should distinguish between in camera proceedings in which a judge merely examines documents or records, and those which require the actual physical presence of an individual. . . . Requiring an informant to attend an in camera hearing involves a substantial risk that his identity will be discovered. Such a hearing would normally require an informant to come to the courthouse. The defendant or his criminal associates may through a variety of means learn when the proceeding is taking place, and observe those who enter the courthouse at that time. Those people who attend the hearing may either intentionally or unintentionally leak information about the informant\u2019s identity. Not only may an in camera hearing endanger the informant\u2019s safety, but potential informants may be discouraged from revealing information if there is a significant likelihood that they must risk attending such a hearing. Many potential informants may be willing to trust one or two police officers to protect their identity but not the criminal justice system as a whole. In exercising its discretion about the need for an in camera hearing, a trial court should consider the risks that a hearing may present for an informant.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 663-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">On the basis of our analysis as to why the defendant was not entitled to disclosure of the names of the confidential informants, we also conclude that the trial court properly refused the defendant\u2019s request for an in camera examination of the informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The defendant next asserts that the state\u2019s comment on the defendant\u2019s postarrest silence and the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>court\u2019s refusal to deliver a cautionary instruction regarding that comment violated the defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Certain additional information is necessary to our resolution of this claim. In the course of the defendant\u2019s final argument, defense counsel argued: \u201cThe police bang on the door. They shout, \u2018police with a warrant.\u2019 They wait about fifteen to twenty seconds. . . .As they advance through the kitchen, they\u2019re shouting the whole time, \u2018Police with a warrant.\u2019 There\u2019s nothing improper about shouting like this. They do it to warn the residents that they\u2019re not burglars. But what is the likelihood that [the defendant] would stand there for at least a half a minute with a bag in her hand waiting for the police to arrive, and then drop it just as they walk in the door? It\u2019s far more likely that the noise and the shouting would cause her to do exactly what she said she did, jump up on the bed and scream.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Defense counsel further argued: \u201cBefore sending this eighteen year old to prison, before branding her as a convicted felon, before locking her in a cage with people who might be animals, we demand proof beyond a reasonable doubt. She\u2019s an eighteen year old who made a bad mistake in her choice of boyfriends. But picking the wrong boyfriend or girlfriend is not a crime. Otherwise we would all be shipped off to jail at some point in our lives. There\u2019s a big difference between [the defendant] and us however. . . . When you live on welfare and you live in such neighborhoods, the mistakes that you make are amplified. You pick the wrong boyfriend, you end up in jail. She picked the wrong boyfriend. She was afraid of him. She tried to get away from him. She refused to assist him in hiding his drugs, but she was not guilty of a crime. She should not end up in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">In its rebuttal argument, the state asked the jury to use common sense in evaluating the evidence and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>claims of the defendant, and argued, \u201c[Although [the defendant] heard the police coming, she doesn\u2019t distance herself from the crack cocaine. She doesn\u2019t say to the police, thank goodness you\u2019re here. Get that no good, drug dealing, woman beating man out of here. Her testimony is that she\u2019s just jumping up and down on the bed. If she heard the police come in, wouldn\u2019t she have distanced herself from that a little bit better? Yet the police, three police officers testified as to where she was and where her position is. I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, if you use your common sense, you\u2019ll see right through all of that, right through the defendant\u2019s story. You won\u2019t\u2014you\u2019ll pay heed to the judge\u2019s [instruction] that sympathy should have . . . no role in your decision making process, something you ail indicated during the voir dire process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">At the conclusion of the arguments the defendant objected to the state\u2019s rebuttal argument, claiming that it constituted an improper comment on the defendant\u2019s postarrest silence. The defendant requested that the trial court give \u201can emphatic instruction to the jury . . . that the defendant was not required during\u2014any time during the course of this prosecution to make any statement. She has presented evidence to you. She has testified. And that certainly she was under no obligation. And I guess that\u2019s the remedy I want.\u201d The trial court did not charge on postarrest silence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We note at the outset that the defendant cites article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution and the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution in support of her due process claim. She also cites an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>abundance of state and federal case law. The defendant fails, however, to provide us with a separate analysis of her claim under the Connecticut constitution. Because the defendant has failed to provide us with a separate analysis under the Connecticut constitution, we choose not to review this claim under the Connecticut constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Scarpiello, </em>40 Conn. App. 189, 198 n.4, 670 A.2d 856, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 921, 674 A.2d 1327 (1996). We thus rely on the cases interpreting use of postarrest silence under the federal constitutional mandate only.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u201cIn <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>[426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976)], the United States Supreme Court held that the impeachment of a defendant through evidence of his silence following his arrest and receipt of Miranda<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> warnings violates due process. The court based its holding in two considerations: First, it noted that silence in the wake of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is \u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019 and consequently of little probative value. Second and more important, it observed that \u2018while it is true that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain no express assurance that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person\u2019s silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.\u2019 <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 617-19. The court recently reaffirmed <em>Doyle's </em>reasoning in <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 290, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986), in which it held that the defendant\u2019s silence following his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings could not be used at trial to rebut his defense of insanity. The court reasoned: \u2018The point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony. It is equally unfair to breach that promise by using silence to overcome a defendant\u2019s plea of insanity.\u2019 Id., 292. Consistent with this rationale, the court has concluded that use at trial of silence <em>prior </em>to the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not violate due process. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 102 S.

The record does not reflect that the police recited <em>Miranda </em>warnings at that moment. Moreover, the record is devoid as to when, if ever, the police advised the defendant of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Silence that is not the product of reliance on <em>Miranda </em>is not protected -under <em>Doyle. </em>Id.

In determining whether it was indeed reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Vessichio, </em>197 Conn. 644, 650, 500 A.2d 1311, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1122, 106 S. Ct. 1642, 90 L. Ed. 2d 187 (1986), our Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the trial court properly instructed the jury that \u201ccocaine is a narcotic substance.\u201d The court concluded as follows: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s essential complaint is that the trial court did not \u2018define the meaning of the words narcotic substance . . . .\u2019 With regard to the definition of \u2018narcotic substance,\u2019 the trial court correctly instructed the juiy that \u2018cocaine is a narcotic substance.\u2019 Under our law, the jury was not at liberty to conclude otheiwise. General Statutes \u00a7 21a-240 (30). . . . [I]t was unnecessary for the trial court to define \u2018narcotic substance\u2019 as if the jury were required to determine for itself whether cocaine fell within that definition. The charge was \u2018correct in law and adapted to the issues,\u2019 as our cases require. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 585, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vessichio, </em>supra, 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\"><em>Vessichio </em>pointedly serves to defeat the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court should not have instructed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>jury that \u201ccocaine is a narcotic substance.\u201d Moreover, the reasoning in <em>Vessichio </em>also works to defeat the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court should not have instructed the jury that \u201ccocaine is a controlled substance.\u201d \u201cUnder our law, the jury was not at liberty to conclude otherwise.\u201d Id., 650; General Statutes \u00a7 21a-240 (9); Regs., Conn.

Thus, the charge gave the defendant more than she was entitled to as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In addition to the proper instructions regarding the nature of cocaine, the trial court set forth the elements of the crimes charged and instructed the jury that, in order to find the defendant guilty of those crimes, it must find that the state has proven each element of those crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Viewing the charge as a whole, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled or that an injustice resulted by virtue of the trial court\u2019s charge. The claim of the defendant is, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused to permit her to testify that, prior to her arrest in the present case, she had never been arrested for or convicted of any crime.

Id. The defendant filed an opposition to the state\u2019s motion, claiming that \u201c[t]he defendant, by introducing evidence of her prior law-abiding nature, is <em>not seeking to establish her character. </em>Rather, she seeks to introduce evidence that disproves the state\u2019s contention that she exercised control over the substance in question. That she has never been arrested is evidence\u2014admittedly not conclusive, but no evidence ever really is\u2014that she did not have the knowledge, experience, opportunity and occasion to possess and control the substances charged here in the information.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">On appeal, the defendant maintains, as she did in the trial court, that she \u201cproffered her lack of arrests and convictions in order to demonstrate that she did not have the experience, knowledge, opportunity, and occasion to possess and control the substances charged.\u201d We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u201cIt is well established that [t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987).

A party is not required to offer such proof of a fact that it excludes all other hypotheses; it is sufficient if the evidence tends to make the existence or nonexistence of any other fact more probable or less probable than it would be without such evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>[179 Conn. 328, 333, 426 A.2d 298 (1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 912, 100 S.

We disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim that such evidence was relevant to her guilt or innocence. The defendant\u2019s testimony concerning her lack of arrests or convictions <em>prior to September 27, 1994, </em>could not have logically aided the jury in determining whether she, <em>on September27,1994, </em>possessed the cocaine that the police found in her presence in her bedroom. The state, in its information, did not allege that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ant had possessed cocaine at any time other than September 27, 1994. The only evidence relevant to the determination of whether the defendant possessed the cocaine at issue would have been evidence that tended to establish a connection, or lack thereof, between the defendant and the cocaine found in her bedroom on the day of her arrest. The defendant\u2019s prior lack of arrests and convictions would not have helped the jury to determine whether such a connection in fact existed. Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim that the proffered testimony was relevant to a determination of whether she possessed the cocaine at issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In addition to our conclusion that the defendant\u2019s testimony concerning her \u201claw-abiding nature\u201d would not have been relevant to whether she possessed the cocaine at issue, we also conclude that such testimony would have been inadmissible as evidence of her allegedly good character. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>supra, 132 Conn. 341 (\u201ctestimony of two defendants that they had never been arrested was not the proper way to prove their good character and was properly excluded\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Maisonet, </em>16 Conn.

Ed. 2d 189 (1988) (\u201c[s]howing the jury that the defendant \u2018only\u2019 had a prior misdemeanor conviction, which the defendant attempted to do, is not \u2018good character\u2019 evidence which a defendant has the right to introduce when he takes the stand\u201d). Evidence of good character \u201c \u2018must pertain to the character trait involved in the crime charged, not general good character.\u2019 [C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, supra, \u00a7 8.3.4, p. 238]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>170 Conn. 161, 163, 365 A.2d 104 (1976).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Maisonet, </em>supra, 98; see also <em>States v.

Any testimony that the defendant had never been arrested for or convicted of a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>would have been improper evidence pertaining to general good character, as opposed to proper evidence pertaining to the specific character traits involved in the crimes with which she was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Finally, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly excluded evidence that another person, namely, Charles, had entered a guilty plea and was awaiting sentencing for possession with intent to sell the same cocaine that was the subject of the defendant\u2019s prosecution. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The following information is necessary to our resolution of this claim. Charles was arrested with the defendant on the basis of the same facts and circumstances as set forth herein. He entered a plea of guilty to possession of narcotics with intent to sell. At the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, Charles had not yet been sentenced. Prior to the introduction of evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial, the state filed a motion in limine to preclude the defendant from introducing evidence of Charles\u2019 guilty plea. The defendant argued to the trial court that evidence of Charles\u2019 plea might tend to prove that the defendant did not possess the cocaine at issue. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion, thereby precluding the introduction into evidence of Charles\u2019 plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">On appeal, the defendant argues that Charles\u2019 guilty plea was relevant because it could have tended to establish that the defendant was not in exclusive possession of her apartment, that Charles had exercised dominion and control over the cocaine, and that Charles controlled the plastic bag into which the cocaine was being placed. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">We will not repeat the principles of law that govern our review of evidentiary rulings concerning relevance.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that evidence of Charles\u2019 guilty plea lacked relevance and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Our examination of the defendant\u2019s claims of admissibility leads us to conclude that the defendant offered the evidence of Charles\u2019 guilty plea for the purpose of showing that Charles was the sole person guilty of illegally possessing the cocaine in the defendant\u2019s bedroom. Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he fact that [the coparticipant] was convicted ... in connection with the crimes committed [during a particular incident] does not tend to establish anything about whether the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which he was charged, relative to the same incident. That another [person] may have been punished for the crimes sheds no light on whether the defendant participated in the commission of the crimes. Consequently, [the copartici-pant\u2019s] conviction . . . should be excluded as irrelevant if offered at . . . trial to show that another person had been convicted in connection with the incident . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 320-21, 613 A.2d 242 (1992).

(B) cocaine-type, coca leaves and any salt, compound, derivative or preparation of coca leaves, and any salt, compound, isomer, derivatives or preparation thereof which is chemically equivalent or identical with any of these substances or which are similar thereto in physiological effect and which show a like potential for abuse, but not including decocainized coca leaves or extractions of coca leaves which do not contain cocaine or ecgonine . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> In the additional instructions, the trial court charged the jury as follows: \u201cIn the first count of the information, the charge is possession of a narcotic substance with intent to sell. It is alleged here that the materials that were possessed was cocaine. It\u2019s also a fact for you to determine whether or not cocaine is a narcotic substance. As I recall, there was evidence from Dr. Pinder wherein he said cocaine was a narcotic substance, but that\u2019s a question of fact. You can either reject or believe his testimony. Similarly, in the second count where it gets to the charge, doesn\u2019t call it narcotic\u2014the statute doesn\u2019t call it a narcotic substance. It says possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell within 1500 feet of the school. The materials which are alleged to be in violation of that statute, possession et cetera, is again cocaine. You must factually determine whether or not cocaine is a controlled substance. Again, it\u2019s my recollection which doesn\u2019t control. It\u2019s your recollection that Dr. Pinder testified that cocaine was both a narcotic substance and a controlled substance. It\u2019s up to you to determine whether or not that or any other testimony on the subject establishes that fact issue. That is, whether cocaine is a controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b386-11\"> See footnote 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b391-13\"> See part IV of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
