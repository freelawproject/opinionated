On October 12, 1994, the police received a call from a citizen informant in Bridgeport. The informant stated that he observed the defendant in and around a car, that the defendant appeared to be \u201cdrunk or stoned,\u201d and that the hood of the car was up and he thought the defendant was going to \u201ctake it apart.\u201d Officer Carl O\u2019Ravitz of the Bridgeport police department responded to a call from the police dispatcher that a male was \u201cstripping\u201d a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Upon arriving at the scene, O\u2019Ravitz observed the defendant in a car on the passenger side of the front seat with the passenger side door opened. He was bending over doing something near the floor. As O\u2019Ravitz and the defendant simultaneously exited their respective cars, O\u2019Ravitz observed that the defendant was nervous, talking very fast, seemed dazed, and appeared to be under the influence of something. O\u2019Ravitz asked the defendant to put his hands on the roof of the car and, before doing so, the defendant hesitated. With his gun drawn, O\u2019Ravitz, concerned for his safety, conducted a patdown of the defendant for weapons. In the course of conducting his patdown of the defendant, O\u2019Ravitz felt a large object in the defendant\u2019s pocket, which he immediately concluded contained crack vials. O\u2019Ravitz reached into the defendant\u2019s pocket and seized 111 crack vials and, upon further investigation, discovered glassine envelopes containing narcotics. The defendant was then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The defendant moved to suppress the narcotics that had been seized from him on the ground that the narcotics had been discovered during an illegal search. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the narcotics, finding that O\u2019Ravitz did not violate any constitutional prohibitions either in the stop and seizure, the protective patdown search for weapons, or in his subsequent search of the defendant\u2019s pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On appeal, our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is \u201cclearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 645, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kyles, </em>221 Conn. 643, 660, 607 A.2d 355 (1992). The conclusions drawn by the trial court will be upheld unless they are legally and logically inconsistent with the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>supra, 645; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>220 Conn. 38, 44, 595 A.2d 1349 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Applying this standard of review, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions are legally and logically consistent with the evidence and, thus, are not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior <em>to </em>the <em>commencement </em>of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence based on an unreasonable search or seizure . . . the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal .... The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress . . . .\u201d See also Practice Book <em>\u00a7 </em>4003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 provides in pertinent part: \u201cPenalty for illegal manufacture, distribution, sale, prescription, dispensing, (a) Any person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any controlled substance which is a hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, or a narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, shall be imprisoned not more than fifteen years and may be fined not more than filly thousand dollars or be both fined and imprisoned; and for a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>offense shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than one hundred thousand dollars, and be both fined and imprisoned; and for each subsequent offense, shall be imprisoned not more than thirty years and may be fined not more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b477-10\"> In his brief, the defendant argues that the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine is unconstitutional under our state constitution and cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>37 Conn. App. 561, 657 A.2d 675 (1995). After the defendant\u2019s brief was filed, our Supreme Court reversed <em>Trine </em>and adopted the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine. <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 234, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">The defendant also claims under the federal constitution that O\u2019Ravitz exceeded the permissible bounds of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), by \u201cflexing his fingers\u201d during the patdown. We disagree. In <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 373, 113 S. Ct. 2130, 124 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1993), the United States Supreme Court adopted the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine, concluding that if during a patdown an object\u2019s identity is \u201cimmediately apparent,\u201d the search and subsequent seizure is constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>tional. In our case, O\u2019Ravitz testified that when he first felt the object in the defendant\u2019s pocket he knew it to be crack vials. Because the identity of the object was \u201cimmediately apparent,\u201d O\u2019Ravitz\u2019s search of the defendant was within the permissible bounds of <em>Terry.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
