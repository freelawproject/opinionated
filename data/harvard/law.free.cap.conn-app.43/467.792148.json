We agree with the plaintiff that the denial of an application for protection from foreclosure under General Statutes \u00a7 49-3 If is not immediately appealable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The following facts are relevant to the disposition of this motion. The defendant David Linthicum<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> executed a note and mortgage to the plaintiff. Following the defendant\u2019s default on the note, the plaintiff brought this action to foreclose its mortgage on the defendant\u2019s property located in the town of Fairfield. The pro se defendant then filed an answer to the complaint and an application for protection from foreclosure pursuant to \u00a7 49-3 If. The trial court denied his motion and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u201cIn determining whether an order is a final judgment for purposes of appellate review, we rely on the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>dard articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). That standard permits the immediate appealability of an order in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>[224 Conn. 749, 753, 620 A.2d 1276 (1993)], quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Elisabeth H., </em>40 Conn. App. 216, 218-19, 669 A.2d 1246 (1996). We conclude that neither of the two circumstances set forth in <em>Curdo </em>are present in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u201cThe first alternative, termination of a separate and distinct proceeding, requires the order being appealed to be severable from the central cause to which it is related so that the main action can proceed independent of the ancillary proceeding. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>195 Conn. 303, 307, 488 A.2d 778 (1985). ... The question to be asked is whether the main action could proceed independent of the ancillary proceeding. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>194 Conn. 650, 654, 485 A.2d 139 (1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>G. F. Construction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cherry Hill Construction, Inc., </em>42 Conn. App. 119, 121-22, 679 A.2d 32 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The puipose of an application for protection from foreclosure under \u00a7 49-31f is to grant the defendant an opportunity for the restructuring of the mortgage debt. General Statutes \u00a7 49-31g. If the application is approved, the foreclosure action is stayed for the restructuring period, pursuant to \u00a7 49-3 If (f). \u201cIf, for a period of three months following the end of the restructuring period, there are no further proceedings to continue the foreclosure proceedings based upon a default on the mortgage as restructured, the foreclosure action shall be dismissed. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 49-31f (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The main foreclosure action cannot proceed independent of the ancillary \u00a7 49-31f proceeding because, under the terms of the statute, the effect of the \u00a7 49-3 If proceeding is to stay, and possibly terminate, the foreclosure action. Because the application for protection from foreclosure is not a proceeding separate and distinct from the foreclosure action, the denial of the application does not terminate a separate and distinct proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Likewise, the denial of the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 49-3 If application does not so conclude the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect those rights. After the court renders a final judgment as to the foreclosure, the defendant may appeal and then challenge the denial of his application for protection from foreclosure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Savings Institute </em>v. <em>Wagner, </em>31 Conn. App. 939, 626 A.2d 1346 (1993). Because the defendant\u2019s right to protection from foreclosure under \u00a7 49-3 If may be vindicated on appeal from the judgment on the merits of the foreclosure action, it is not necessary for the defendant to appeal at this time to prevent the irretrievable loss of that right. <em>Ruggiero </em>v. <em>Fuessenich, </em>237 Conn. 339, 347, 676 A.2d 1367 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Because the denial <em>of the </em>defendant\u2019s application for protection from foreclosure under \u00a7 49-31f does not satisfy either standard of finality, the order is not a final judgment for the purpose of appeal. \u201c \u2018The lack of a final judgment is a jurisdictional defect that requires that [this court] dismiss the appeal.\u2019 <em>Essex Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Frimberger, </em>26 Conn. App. 80, 81, 597 A.2d 1289 (1991), citing <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>197 Conn. 82, 86, 495 A.2d 1063 (1985).\u201d <em>Connecti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>cut National Bank </em>v. <em>L &amp; R Realty, </em>40 Conn. App. 492, 495, 671 A.2d 1315 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The plaintiffs motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-31\u00cd provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), a homeowner who is underemployed or unemployed against whom a foreclosure action is brought may make application, together with a financial affidavit, to the court having jurisdiction over the foreclosure action for protection from foreclosure . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-10\"> Also named as defendants were Derby Savings Bank, Joan Burry, Berj Haroian, the United States Department of the Treasury and the town of Fairfield. The complaint alleged that the interests of the above parties in the property were subordinate to that of the plaintiff. The plaintiff later withdrew the action as to Joan Burry and Berj Haroian.
