Boyer to claim a marital status of single for 1976. He was thus found eligible to claim for that year the 50 percent maximum tax rate on earned income in IRC \u00a7 1348, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348 (1976), <em>repealed by </em>Section 101(c)(1) of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, Pub.L. No. 97-34, 95 Stat. 172 (1981). <em>See Boyer v. Commissioner, </em>79 T.C. 143 (1982), Appendix (App.) 4. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">When 1976 began William and Marjorie Boyer were husband and wife, domiciled together in Lynnfield Township, Essex County, Massachusetts. On April 13, 1976 William Boyer filed for divorce in the Probate Court of Essex County on the ground of irretrievable breakdown in the marriage. He filed under Chapter 208 of the Massachusetts laws, which governs divorce proceedings. <em>See </em>Complaint for Divorce, App. 31. On April 23, 1976 Marjorie Boyer filed in the Probate Court a complaint for separate maintenance under Chapter 209.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that the Boyers lived apart because William was guilty of cruel and inhumane treatment against Marjorie. She requested that the court prohibit William from restraining her liberty, order William to pay suitable support, and establish that she had justifiable cause for living apart from him. <em>See </em>Complaint for Separate Maintenance, App. 34. On May 3, 1976 Marjorie moved for an order for temporary support and for a temporary restraining order prohibiting William from restraining her liberty and from entering the former marital domicile. <em>See </em>Motion for Temporary Support, App. 35; Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, App. 36. On May 6,1976 the court granted the relief requested in the May 3rd motions \u201cpending a hearing on the merits or until further order of the Court * * <em>See </em>Temporary Order, App. 37 (herein referred to as \u201cMay 6th order\u201d). The court did not, however, decide whether Marjorie had justifiable cause to live apart from William. Two years later, on July 18, 1978, Marjorie, in a separate divorce action, received a decree of divorce <em>nisi. </em>By its terms this decree was to become final six months after issuance, but Marjorie later moved (for undisclosed reasons) that the decree not be made final.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Taxpayer William Boyer elected the marital status of \u201csingle\u201d when he filed his 1976 tax return. The primary tax consequence of Boyer\u2019s claimed \u201csingle\u201d status involved the applicability of the 50 percent maximum tax on earned income in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>for tax year 1976 according to the provisions of former Section 1348' of the IRC. The benefit of the 50 percent maximum rate was available to individuals who filed as single and to married persons who filed joint returns. Congress required married persons to file a joint return to prevent manipulation of the maximum tax. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 91-413, Pt. 1, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 209 (1969). Application of the 50 percent maximum tax meant a saving for William Boyer of $48,997.19 in 1976 as compared to what he would have paid if ineligible for the maximum tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The Internal Revenue Service contested Boyer\u2019s claim of eligibility for the 50 percent maximum tax on the ground that Boyer was not \u201csingle\u201d for tax purposes in 1976. Because Boyer could not file as \u201csingle\u201d and did not file a joint return with his spouse, IRS claimed, he did not qualify for the 50 percent maximum tax under Section 1348(c). Rules for determination of Boyer\u2019s marital status are set forth in Section 153 of IRC,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which in relevant part for 1976 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u00a7 153. Determination of marital status</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adq\">For purposes of this part\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">(1) The determination of whether an individual is married shall be made as of the close of his taxable year; except that if his spouse dies during his taxable year such determination shall be made as of the time of such death; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">(2) An individual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or of separate maintenance shall not be considered as married.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 (1970 ed. applicable to tax year 1976), <em>language repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 1976 by the Tax Reform Act of1976, </em>Pub.L. No. 94-455, 90 Stat. 1520. Since Boyer was not divorced as of December 31, 1976 \u2014 the close of his taxable year \u2014 his status for tax purposes would be \u201csingle\u201d only if he was \u201clegally separated from his spouse under a decree of * * * separate maintenance\u201d as of that date. IRS contended that the May 6, 1976 order of temporary support pursuant to Section 32 of Chapter 209 of the Massachusetts laws was not a decree of separate maintenance that effectuated a legal separation. IRS recomputed Boyer\u2019s tax on the basis of the filing status \u201cmarried, filing separately\u201d and assessed approximately $50,000 in additional liability for 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Boyer challenged IRS in the Tax Court and won. <em>Boyer v. Commissioner, supra, </em>79 T.C. 143, App. 4. The court held that Boyer could claim the marital status of single for 1976 because the May 6th order was a \u201cdecree * * * of separate maintenance\u201d that effected a legal separation. Drawing from prior Tax Court precedent, the court held that a court order for separate maintenance that <em>affects marital status </em>is a \u201cdecree of * * * separate maintenance\u201d for purposes of the IRC. 79 T.C. at 148-149, App. 12 <em>(citing Boettiger v. Commissioner, </em>31 T.C. 477, 484 (1958); <em>Dunn v. Commissioner, </em>70 T.C. 361, 368 (1978)). Whether an order of separate maintenance affects marital status is, according to the court, determined by reference to state law. 79 T.C. at 147, App. 10. As the court read Massachusetts law, an order of separate maintenance pursuant to Section 32 of Chapter 209 did affect marital status. To support this view the court relied on <em>DeMarzo v. Vena, </em>330 Mass. 118, 111 N.E.2d 797 (1953), which stated that an order under Section 32 \u201ccomprehend[s] a modification of the incidents of the status of marriage * * *.\u201d 111 N.E.2d at 800. Since the May 6th order of temporary support was an order under Section 32, the Tax Court held that it amounted to a \u201cdecree of * * * separate maintenance\u201d that effected a legal separation for federal tax purposes. The court thus upheld Boyer\u2019s claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201csingle\u201d status for 1976 and consequent eligibility for the 50 percent maximum tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The sole issue for us on this appeal is whether Boyer can properly claim a marital status of single for the tax year 1976. We hold that he cannot. Though the Tax Court was correct in its general approach of looking to the state law of the marital domicile to determine marital status for federal tax purposes, <em>see Boyter v. Commissioner, </em>668 F.2d 1382, 1384 (4th Cir. 1981), a misapprehension of the nature of the proper inquiry into state law and of the effect of the May 6th order under Massachusetts law led the court to an erroneous appraisal of Boyer\u2019s marital status.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In finding the May 6th order determinative of Boyer\u2019s marital status, the court held that any order of separate maintenance that had the additional consequence of affecting marital status \u2014 as determined by reference to the law of the state of marital domicile \u2014 was a decree that effected a legal separation for purposes of marital status under federal law. This rule the court drew from a statement in <em>Boettiger v. Commissioner, supra, </em>that where an order of separate maintenance \u201conly effectuated the wife\u2019s right to support, and [did] not affect their marital status in any other way, there was no legal separation * * 31 T.C. at 484 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Tax Court here reasoned that if a maintenance order that had no additional effects on marital status did not effect a legal separation under Section 153, then a maintenance order that did additionally affect marital status would effect a legal separation under Section 153. Since the <em>DeMarzo </em>court seemed to hold that an order under Section 32 affected marital status in Massachusetts, the court concluded that the May 6th order under Section 32 effected a legal separation under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Though the <em>Boettiger </em>decision is indisputably correct, the court in this case misstepped in assuming that the obverse of the <em>Boettiger </em>holding was equally valid. Such a reading is not logically compelled and is unsupported by any precedent. More importantly, the phrase that the Tax Court seized on as an interpretation of federal law was made in the context of the <em>Boettiger </em>court\u2019s discussion of whether a separate maintenance order constituted a legal separation under the state law of New Jersey, and thus carries no weight as an indicator of the meaning of the federal statutory language \u201clegally separated under a decree <em>of * * * </em>separate maintenance.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 (1970 ed.). In determining whether a party is legally separated for purposes of this section the proper inquiry is not whether a state order of separate maintenance affects marriage status under applicable state law; rather the proper inquiry is whether an order of separate maintenance affects marriage status in such a way that it is deemed a legal separation under applicable state law. <em>See Capodanno v. Commissioner, </em>602 F.2d 64, 67 (3d Cir.1979); <em>Seaman v. Commissioner, </em>479 F.2d 336, 338 (9th Cir.1973) (\u201csince a California interlocutory [divorce] decree does not dissolve the marriage, the spouses are still married for federal tax purposes\u201d). In other words, a party must be legally separated under state law in order to be eligible to file as single for federal income tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Applying these principles, there can be little question that the May 6th order did not effect a legal separation under the law of Massachusetts. The order is expressly denominated \u201cTemporary Order,\u201d <em>see </em>Temporary Order, JA 37, and was issued \u201c[p]ending a hearing on the merits or until further order of the Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The order was, moreover, made in response to motions for \u201ctemporary support\u201d and for a \u201ctemporary restraining order.\u201d Authoritative exposition of Massachusetts law by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts holds that \u201c[a] separate support proceeding [under Section 32 of Chapter 209] is designed to secure the \u2018temporary support\u2019 of a wife; the decree does not create a judicial separation, nor establish a permanent status for the future.\u201d <em>Gould v. Gould, </em>359 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Mass. 29, 32, 267 N.E.2d 652, 655 (1971); <em>accord Meyer v. Meyer, </em>335 Mass. 293, 296, 139 N.E.2d 709, 712 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Properly understood, <em>Demarzo v. Vena, supra, </em>on which the Tax Court relied, is not to the contrary. In that case the court did not evaluate the effect of a Temporary Order of support such as the May 6th order at issue here. In the practice of probate courts in Massachusetts, such Temporary Orders of support are \u2014 as in the present case \u2014 issued on Form 401, which makes clear the interlocutory nature of the order. Permanent decrees are entered on forms such as Form 402. <em>See </em>Appendix to this opinion for samples of both these forms. The court in <em>DeMarzo </em>evaluated the effect of a decree of the Massachusetts Probate Court that the husband was living apart from his wife for justifiable cause. Such an order would today appear enterable under item 2 on Form 402. It is in any case more final and more disruptive of the marriage than the Form 401 order at issue here. In our view, the latter clearly does not effect a legal separation. Moreover, any force that the <em>DeMarzo </em>dictum might have had is significantly blunted by the later statements of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Gould, supra, </em>and <em>Meyer, supra, </em>that decrees under Section 32 do not effect a legal separation. Thus the May 6th order did not amount to a legal separation under the law of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Because taxpayer Boyer\u2019s claim of \u201csingle\u201d status depends entirely on the construction given the May 6th order, we must reverse the Tax Court\u2019s determination that Boyer had properly filed as single for the tax year 1976. He was not \u201clegally separated under a decree of * * * separate maintenance\u201d on December 31st of that year for purposes of Section 153 of the IRC, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 153, because the May 6th order did not effect a legal separation under Massachusetts law. We therefore hold that he could not claim a marital status of \u201csingle\u201d for that year. Accordingly, Boyer\u2019s proper filing status for 1976 was \u201cmarried, filing separately\u201d and he was ineligible for the benefit of the 50 percent maximum tax and all other benefits appurtenant to \u201csingle\u201d status for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"Aca\">Appendix op Forms</p>\n<p id=\"AWAq\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\">.
