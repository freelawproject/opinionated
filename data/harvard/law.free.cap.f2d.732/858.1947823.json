We held that petitioner was entitled to the out-of-time appeal and, because he is indigent, to a transcript of his trial as an incident thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-22\">The concession by counsel was properly made with respect to some nine other issues that had been raised in a state coram nobis proceeding and found by the trial court to be without merit, which determination was affirmed by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. The same issues were presented to the federal district court, which also found them to be without merit, and we affirmed this decision in the present appeal. These nine issues would not be available to be relitigated in an out-of-time merits appeal that, in a reversal of the usual sequence, comes after two judicial systems have found them without merit on collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-23\">The attention of all participants in this case was focused, however, on the alleged unconstitutional communication with the jury and the nine other issues described above. We agree that petitioner should not be barred from presenting in his out-of-time merits appeal additional issues, if any, that might be revealed by an examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>of the trial transcript, which has not yet been available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">The petition for rehearing is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
