So long as the as-yet-unconstrued conservatorship statute is susceptible of a saving construction, the district court should abstain from entertaining appellants\u2019 constitutional claims. <em>See Boehning v.

The case was briefed, argued and submitted to us solely on the applicability of <em>Younger, </em>and thus the stage was set for us to settle that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">Now, after all of that single-purposed activity, my colleagues suddenly take another tack. They do not address <em>Younger </em>at all; instead, they focus exclusively upon a new and very different subject. On the premise that \u201c[tjhis case falls squarely within the scope of the ... abstention doctrine\u201d formulated in <em>Railroad Commission of Texas v.

The <em>Younger </em>issue is ripe for decision,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and its resolution conceivably could bring this litigation to an end.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> On the other hand, <em>Pullman </em>abstention, even if in any event proper,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> leaves <em>Younger </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>for possible revisitation in this case on another day.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In sum, I would face up to <em>Younger </em>now, and only if it were determined that <em>Younger </em>is inapposite would I give any consideration to <em>Pullman.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">.

Appellants\u2019 claims are better viewed against the backdrop of their tragic personal histories, as derived from the various filings. See, respecting Justice, Complaint, <em>supra </em>note 1, ff\u00ed 15-22, App. 8-10; Brief for Appellants at 5-7; Brief for Appellees at 2-3; and, respecting Smith, Complaint, <em>supra </em>note 1, fif\u00ed 23-31, App. 10-12; Brief for Appellants at 7-8; Brief for Appellees at 3-4. Justice relates that, more than twenty years ago, he was declared, on petition of his wife, incapable of properly managing his affairs. He asserts that this determination was made without a formal hearing, without evidence, and without either his presence in court or representation by counsel \u2014 allegedly a result of insufficient notice of the proceeding. Justice states that the court\u2019s conclusion was premised solely on a finding by the Veterans Administration that he could not responsibly handle his finances. Justice acknowledges that a guardian ad litem was appointed to investigate his circumstances, but insists that the investigation was limited to a verification of the Veterans Administration's finding and the filing of a one-paragraph report with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">Smith\u2019s difficulties began in 1957, when he was committed to a mental hospital under then-existing District of Columbia statutes governing mental health care. He was released seven years later and returned to his family home \u2014 of which he is now sole owner \u2014 to live with his father and brother. Another seven years passed before, in 1971, his brother successfully petitioned for his appointment as Smith's conservator on the grounds that Smith could not manage his property. Allegedly, because of inadequate notice, Smith was not present when this action occurred. Smith states that the hearing was not evidentiary in nature, that no current medical evidence was proffered, and that the guardian ad litem appointed for him filed a report based simply on interviews with his father and brother, and never conferred with him or anyone responsible for his treatment. The court\u2019s order, we are also told, specifically relied on the 1957 determination of incompetence despite the fact that it was fourteen years out of date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1057-13\">.

When Smith\u2019s brother died, a successor conservator was appointed, allegedly by the same deficient process.

After Justice had been under the conservator-ship order for twelve years, the Veterans Administration reexamined his case and found him \u201ccompetent to handle the full amount of his compensation.\u201d Complaint, <em>supra </em>note 1, jf 19, App. 9. Then, on his behalf, the Veterans Administration petitioned the court for discharge of the conservator, supporting the petition by a psychiatric report. <em>Id. </em>The court, however, in a brief order, denied the petition on the ground that the \"medical record does not state what changes have been made in Burke Justice, Jr., to now make him competent,\u201d <em>id. </em>f\u00ed 20, App. 9 (quoting order), but did not invite additional evidence, and Justice\u2019s conservator took no further action in that regard. Another eleven years later, Justice remains the subject of the conservatorship, protesting that \u201cthere is no continuing medical or other reason for his conservator-ship, and that his efforts to obtain its removal have been summarily rejected.\" Brief for Appellants at 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">. Appellants, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, initiated this litigation in the District Court against the Superior Court and two of its judges.

The complaint states that \"at present, approximately 1,500 conservatorships are in effect pursuant to that statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellants request a declaratory judgment that the statute is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied, and a mandatory injunction ordering constitutionally-adequate hearings for those subject to a conservatorship and directing the Superior Court to promulgate rules of procedure assuring the constitutionality of future conservatorship proceedings. <em>Id. </em>1f 52, App. 18.

The classic <em>Younger </em>case involves a state criminal proceeding against one who in response brings a federal-court action claiming that the state law underlying the criminal charge is unconstitutional, and seeking an injunction against further prosecution. See Bartels, <em>Avoiding a Comity of Errors: A Model for Adjudicating Federal Civil Rights Suits that \u201cInterfere\u201d with State Civil Proceedings, </em>29 Stan.L.Rev. 29, 31-34 (1976); Wells, <em>The Role of Comity in the Law of Federal Courts, </em>60 N.C.L.Rev. 59, 64 (1981). <em>Younger </em>held that the federal court must decline to hear the case; enjoining an ongoing state criminal prosecution would be too damaging to the concerns of federalism when the federal right at stake could be asserted as a defense in the state proceeding. <em>Younger v. Harris, supra </em>note 11, 401 U.S. at 41, 91 S.Ct. at 749, 27 L.Ed.2d at 674. See also Bartels, <em>supra, </em>at 31-34.</p>\n<p id=\"A4A\">Although that is the paradigm <em>Younger </em>situation, the doctrine has been expanded considerably. It now extends beyond criminal prosecutions to certain types of civil cases \u2014 of which a state-instituted protective child-custody suit would be an example \u2014 implicating an especially strong state interest. <em>Moore v. Sims, supra </em>note 12, 442 U.S. at 423, 99 S.Ct. at 2377, 60 L.Ed.2d at 1003; <em>Trainor v. Hernandez, supra </em>note 12, 431 U.S. at 444, 97 S.Ct. at 1918, 52 L.Ed.2d at 496; <em>Juidice v.

See generally Bartels, <em>supra, </em>at 44-66. While <em>Younger </em>originally spoke to a federal action initiated after the onset of the state prosecution, it now applies even though the state prosecution commenced after the federal suit, so long as there have not been substantial proceedings on the merits in the federal court. <em>Hicks v. Miranda, </em>422 U.S. 332, 349-350, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 2291-2292, 45 L.Ed.2d 223, 238-239 (1975). See generally Bartels, <em>supra, </em>at 37-42; Wells, <em>supra, </em>at 69-75. <em>Younger </em>also now requires that available state appellate remedies be pursued. <em>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., supra </em>note 12, 420 U.S. at 608-609, 95 S.Ct. at 1210-1211, 43 L.Ed.2d at 494-495. See generally Wells, <em>supra, </em>at 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"A7F\">The <em>Younger </em>doctrine, when otherwise applicable, comes into play whenever the federal plaintiff has an opportunity to raise the federal claim \u2014 defensively or otherwise \u2014 in the pending state proceeding. <em>Moore v. Sims, supra </em>note 12, 442 U.S. at 425-426 &amp; n. 9, 430 &amp; n. 12, 99 S.Ct. at 2378-2379 &amp; n. 9, 2381 &amp; n. 12, 60 L.Ed.2d at 1004-1005 &amp; n. 9, 1007 &amp; n. 12.

The Supreme Court has held, however, that a declaratory judgment is appropriate when a state prosecution is merely threatened, though not when it is pending. <em>Steffel v.
