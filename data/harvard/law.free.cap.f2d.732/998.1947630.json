That Rule, applicable to multiple claim litigation, affords the district court discretion to enter a final judgment on a discrete but entire claim while other claims remain <em>subjudice.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Rule, however, does not authorize the entry of final judgment on part of a single claim. We hold that the district court improperly invoked Rule 54(b). That court, we conclude, has not yet finally adjudicated any claim; instead, it has ruled on part of a single claim. Further, we do not consider it appropriate, in the particular circumstances this case presents, to treat the district court\u2019s disposition as an interlocutory apPea^ certification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore dismiss the appeal because it presents no final or otherwise immediately reviewable decision,</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-14\">Plaintiff-appellant Tolson alleges that, during her incarceration at a federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky, a prison guard coerced her into sexual intercourse and impregnated her. She seeks damages from the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-2680 (1976). Her complaint asserts that the United States is answerable for the guard\u2019s conduct under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>Further, the complaint states that the United States is liable for the neglect of the prison officials in failing to supervise the guard and in retaining him despite notice of his propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-15\">The United States moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. Pursuant to the federal choice-of-law rule governing FTCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>actions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court looked to Kentucky law to determine the motion. It concluded that Kentucky law would not impute the guard\u2019s conduct to the United States under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior; </em>instead, Kentucky would hold that the conduct in which the guard indulged was beyond the scope of his employment. The court also concluded, however, that Kentucky law would impute to the United States the prison officials\u2019 alleged negligence in failing to supervise the guard\u2019s conduct. It therefore granted the motion to dismiss \u201cthat portion of plaintiff\u2019s complaint which seeks to hold the United States liable ... for the alleged tortious actions of [the] guard,\u201d but denied the motion as to the negligent supervision and retention allegations. Civil Action No. 81-2626, Memorandum and Order (D.D.C. Feb. 22, 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>Record Excerpts (R.E.) 114-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">On Tolson\u2019s unopposed motion, the district court entered final judgment under Rule 54(b) on the ruling that the guard\u2019s conduct could not be imputed to the United States. That ruling, the district court believed, finally disposed of an \u201cissue ... sufficiently distinct\u201d from the remaining claims for negligent supervision and retention of the guard. Civil Action No. 81-2626, Memorandum Opinion and Order, at 3 (D.D.C. May 26, 1983), <em>reprinted in </em>R.E. 121. The complaint, as the district court ultimately viewed it, presented not one, but three, discrete claims against the United States: one for the guard\u2019s acts; another for negligent supervision; and a third for negligent retention. The claims were separate, the court reasoned, because each involved \u201c[p]roof of different facts ... even though some facts are common to each claim,\u201d and \u201cthe law applicable to each claim is distinguishable as well.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">Two procedural mechanisms for appeals while a ease remains pending in district court are sometimes confused: Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Rule 54(b), applicable to litigation involving multiple claims or multiple parties, affords the district court discretion to \u201cdirect the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Rule, in conception, is an application of, not an exception to, the statutory instruction that, in the interest of efficient review and avoidance of wasteful trial court delay, appeals generally must abide final decision. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (courts of appeals have jurisdiction of appeals from \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of district courts); <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. </em>Mackey, 351 U.S. 427, 437, 76 S.Ct. 895, 900, 100 L.Ed. 1297 (1956) (\u201cThe District Court <em>cannot, </em>in the exercise of its [Rule 54(b) ] discretion, treat as \u2018final\u2019 that which is not \u2018final\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1291.\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-9\">In contrast to Rule 54(b)\u2019s provision for final judgment on separate claims, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) provides for appeals from interlocutory decisions. Section 1292(b) explicitly conditions appellate review on the exercise of discretion at two levels: if the district court certifies that it views its decision as involving \u201ca controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal ... may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,\u201d the court of appeals may permit instant appeal of the decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-10\">In this case, the district court did not certify its <em>respondeat superior </em>ruling under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Instead, it treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>that ruling as finally dispositive of one entire claim in a multiple claim action, and accordingly invoked Rule 54(b) to justify the entry of a final judgment. We hold that, for the purpose at hand, the district court sliced the \u201cclaim\u201d concept too thinly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">If the relevant criteria for defining a \u201cseparate\u201d claim within the meaning of Rule 54(b) are, as the district court indicated, the necessity for proof of some different facts,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the application of distinguishable law,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a host of pre-trial substantive rulings would be swept within the Rule\u2019s domain. In an action for damages for injury to person or property, for example, different facts and distinguishable law would be involved if plaintiff alleged several bases for <em>relief </em>\u2014 e.g., the defendant\u2019s simple negligence, gross negligence, breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty. A pre-trial ruling rejecting simple negligence or implied warranty as a basis for relief could be split off, described as a rejection of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cseparate\u201d claim for relief on the asserted ground, and made the subject of a Rule 54(b) judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The provision for interlocutory appeals Congress ordered in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) should reduce the temptation to so formulate the definition of \u201cclaim\u201d and thereby erode the final decision rule. We recognize that Rule 54(b) precedent is untidy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that \u201ccourts have been completely unable to settle on a single test for determining when claims are \u2018separate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Local P-171, Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Thompson Farms Co., </em>642 F.2d 1065, 1070 (7th Cir.1981) (Wisdom, J.) (footnote omitted) [hereafter, <em>Local P-171]. </em>We offer no universal formulas, but the matter before us affords an opportunity to state one \u201crule of thumb\u201d for identifying a genre of \u201cclaims that clearly cannot be \u2018separate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>When alleged \u201cclaims [are] so closely related that they would fall afoul of the rule against splitting claims if brought separately,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1071 (citations omitted), they do not qualify as \u201cseparate\u201d claims within the meaning of Rule 54(b). <em>Cf. </em>Note, <em>Appealability in the Federal Courts, </em>75 Harv.L.Rev. 351, 359-61 (1961) (courts generally hold 54(b) inapplicable when \u201cfewer than all of a party\u2019s legal theories based on the same transaction\u201d have been dismissed, so that it remains possible \u201cthat the party will still be awarded relief, an event that would render unnecessary an appellate determination of the dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">This \u201crule of thumb\u201d is reflected in our circuit\u2019s leading decision on the definition of a claim within the meaning of Rule 54(b): <em>Gold Seal Co. v. Weeks, </em>209 F.2d 802, 809-10 (D.C.Cir.1954) (res judicata doctrine is appropriate guide in Rule 54(b) determinations). It is also indicated in sensible precedent elsewhere. <em>See, e.g., Local P-171, supra; Page v. Preisser, </em>585 F.2d 336, 339 (8th Cir.1978) (Rule 54(b) \u201cdid not ... purport to amend or dilute the fundamental rule against splitting a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>action and deciding appellate cases piecemeal.\u201d) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Tolson could not have maintained successive suits against the United States on the three claims the district court viewed as \u201cseparate.\u201d Had she limited her action to any one of the three, adjudication of that claim would have precluded subsequent airing of the others. <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) op Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 24, 25 (1982). We restate and adhere to the sound precedent set in <em>Gold Seal Co., supra. </em>\u201cDifferent facts\u201d and \u201cdistinguishable\u201d law do not alone qualify an alleged claim for separate judgment under Rule 54(b); that Rule may not be invoked in opposition to \u201cthe fundamental rule against splitting a [claim for relief].\u201d <em>Page v. Preisser, </em>585 F.2d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Because the Rule 54(b) judgment here was unopposed, we directed the parties, by pre-argument order,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to address the question whether the Rule was properly invoked. In a supplemental brief, appellant Tolson requested that, in the event we find the Rule 54(b) judgment improper, we treat the judgment as a certification for interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) and then exercise our discretion to permit the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-9\">In an appropriate case, the requested conversion from Rule 54(b) to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) might well be in order at the appellate court level. <em>See Bergstrom v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>599 F.2d 62, 64 (8th Cir.1979) (per curiam); <em>cf. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 745-46, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 1207, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976) (intimating that improper Rule 54(b) judgment can be treated as \u00a7 1292(b) certification if section\u2019s ten-day application deadline was met and court of appeals would have exercised its discretion to entertain the interlocutory appeal).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this case, however, we do not share appellant\u2019s confidence that the district court would have found \u201csubstantial ground for difference of opinion\u201d on the state of Kentucky law,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or that immediate appeal could \u201cmaterially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). <em>See </em>10 C. Wright, A. Miller <em>&amp; </em>M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2658.2, at 80 (2d ed. 1983) (Section 1292(b) \u201cis meant to be applied in relatively few situations and should not be read as a significant incursion on the traditional federal policy against piecemeal appeals.\u201d) (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore decline to exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>our discretion to grant or deny immediate appeal absent a 1292(b) certification by the district court accompanied by that court\u2019s reasons for believing that the statutory criteria are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\">For the reasons stated, we dismiss the appeal for want of a final judgment or otherwise immediately reviewable order and remand the case with instructions t\u00f3 vacate the judgment entered under Rule 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AVCq\">.

In the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1105-17\">.

The Court of Appeals may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order, if application is made to it within ten days after the entry of the order: <em>Provided, however, </em>That application for an appeal hereunder shall not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the Court of Appeals or a judge thereof shall so order.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">.

The \"different facts\u201d test, although stated in several decisions, <em>e.g., Purdy Mobile Homes, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs sued the general contractor's insurance company, asserting, as does Tolson here, both a theory of direct negligence liability (for inadequate performance of its duty to inspect equipment and working conditions at the construction site) and a theory of derivative liability (for the general contractor\u2019s negligence as its negligence insurance carrier). The district court dismissed only the former theory, certifying its order for immediate appeal under Rule 54(b). The Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that \"[t]rue multiplicity [of claims was] not present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 856.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1108-8\">. <em>Tolson v.

Under Rule 54(b), judgment may be entered upon a finding of \"no just reason for delay.\" Certification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) requires more \u2014 \"a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,\u201d and the prospect that immediate appeal \u201cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">.
