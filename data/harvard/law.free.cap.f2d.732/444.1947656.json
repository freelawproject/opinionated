EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b566-28\">On August 5, 1983, Mar-Len of Louisiana, Inc., filed suit against Parsons-Gil-bane, seeking reformation or voidance of modifications 022 and 039 to a contract for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the construction of fire and flush water facility at Strategic Petroleum Reserves at the West Haekberry Storage Complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On August 16, 1983, Parsons-Gilbane removed the action to the U.S. District Court, Western District of Louisiana. On August 15, 1983, Parsons-Gilbane filed a motion to compel arbitration and to stay the proceedings. On November 30, 1983, the district court denied the motion to stay and to compel arbitration and ordered the trial of the validity of modifications 022 and 039. Parsons-Gilbane has appealed this interlocutory order. The central issue in the suit is whether the written modifications to the contract relating to performance of \u201cextra\u201d work by Mar-Len should be enforced as written or whether those provisions should be reformed because of economic duress which Mar-Len argues motivated it to agree to the modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Mar-Len, relying on <em>Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., </em>293 U.S. 379, 55 S.Ct. 310, 79 L.Ed. 440 (1935) and <em>Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>317 U.S. 188, 63 S.Ct. 163, 87 L.Ed. 176 (1942), moves to dismiss the appeal on grounds that the denial of Parsons-Gilbane\u2019s motion to stay and to compel arbitration is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1) because the order complained of was a ruling on a motion asserting an equitable defense in response to a suit seeking equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\"><em>Enelow </em>and <em>Ettelson </em>establish the principle that when a party attempts to interpose an equitable defense to a legal cause of action the ruling on that defense is appealable as a grant or denial of an injunction under \u00a7 1292(a); but when an equitable defense is interposed to a traditional cause of action in equity, a ruling on the equitable defense is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Parsons-Gilbane asserts that a distinction has been established by this court in <em>La Nacional Platanera, S.C.L. v. North American Fruit &amp; Steamship Corp., </em>84 F.2d 881 (5th Cir.1936) between an order staying the lawsuit under section 3 of the Arbitration Act and order compelling arbitration under section 4 of the Arbitration Act. Parsons-Gilbane argues that section 4 orders are always appealable irrespective of whether the underlying suit is at law or equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">We disagree with this interpretation of <em>La Nacional. </em>In <em>La Nacional, </em>the action was at law and therefore the order compelling arbitration was appealable under the teaching of <em>Enelow </em>and <em>Ettelson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">The first circuit, in <em>Langley v. Colonial Leasing Co. of New England, </em>707 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1983), addressed this precise issue. In <em>Langley, </em>a motion to stay and to compel arbitration was filed in response to a suit filed on a traditional equitable ca\u00fase of action.' The district court denied the motion and an appeal followed. The court of appeals concluded that no distinction should be drawn between section 3 and section 4 orders and that the order was not appealable since the underlying cause of action was equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">Since the underlying suit in this case seeks reformation of the contract, the suit is equitable in nature. 5 Moore\u2019s Fed.Practice 38.22 (2d Cir.1967), <em>Standard Chlorine of Delaware, Inc. v. Leonard, </em>384 F.2d 304, 308 (2nd Cir.1967). Therefore, under the unambiguous teaching of <em>Enelow, </em>the district court\u2019s denial of ParsonsGilbane\u2019s motion is not appealable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal and it is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\">. We agree generally with the criticism of the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule which has been characterized as \"artificial,\" \"medieval\u201d and \"outmoded\u201d. <em>City of Naples v. Prepakt Concrete Co., </em>494 F.2d 511, 512 (5th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 843, 95 S.Ct. 76, 42 L.Ed.2d 71 (1974); <em>Wallace v. Norman Industries, Inc., </em>467 F.2d 824, 827 (5th Cir.1972); and <em>Glen Oaks Utilities, Inc. v. City of Houston, </em>280 F.2d 330, 333 (5th Cir.1960). The Supreme Court, however, cited <em>Enelow </em>and <em>Ettelson </em>with approval as recent as 1955 in <em>Baltimore Contractors, Inc. v. Bodinger, </em>348 U.S. 176, 75 S.Ct. 249, 99 L.Ed. 233, and we feel bound to follow the rule until the Supreme Court changes it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b567-14\">ALVIN B. RUBIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">I respectfully dissent. The merger of law and equity has now been so far com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>pleted that we should not cast back a half-century to determine whether a suit is inherently equitable or legal and a defense is of the same or a different genre. The doctrine of <em>Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., </em>293 U.S. 379, 55 S.Ct. 310, 79 L.Ed. 440 (1935), antedates the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Ettelson v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>317 U.S. 188, 63 S.Ct. 163, 87 L.Ed. 176 (1942), applied the same precept when the Civil Rules were in their infancy. We have many times noted the extensive criticism of this archaic distinction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> So have others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Criticism of the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule is uniformly coupled with the regretful supposition that it binds appellate courts until Congress or the Supreme Court effects a change.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Congress, however, can scarcely be faulted for overlooking \u201cso esoteric a field of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, three years after the Supreme Court last considered, and apologetically reaffirmed, the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Congress amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 to allow for interlocutory appeal of an order involving \u201ca controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,\u201d the resolution of which \u201cmay materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In enacting this rule, Congress clearly signaled its concern that questions of appealability be resolved by considerations of genuine need and merit, not by resort to archaic distinctions between law and equity. Furthermore, in providing a method of weeding out merit-less interlocutory appeals, section 1292(b) has undermined the argument that the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule is necessary to \u201climit appealability of interlocutory orders.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the light of this legislative development, the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule may and should be reconsidered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>To await reconsideration by the Supreme Court would only further extend the delay and confusion occasioned by the rule, perhaps indefinitely. As Professor Edward Cooper had observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cReliance on the Supreme Court [to change the rule] requires that the Court make room in a docket crowded with vitally important issues to resolve an issue of appellate jurisdiction that can fairly be described as picayune. Two decades of experience with the established rule in the courts of appeals should provide sufficient justification for establishing a new rule in an area that is within their own special knowledge and responsibility.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In the five decades since <em>Enelow </em>was decided, experience with the rule has served only to make its defects more obvious. Seven years ago, Judge MacKinnon of the District of Columbia Circuit expressed the hope that the <em>Enelow-Ettelson </em>rule \u201cwill not continue to cast its antiquated shadow of an equity-versus-law test upon modern interlocutory appellate practice. The demise of that rule cannot be far away.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the Supreme Court has not yet had occasion to put an end to the rule\u2019s unhappy life, we should undertake the task.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The appealability of orders should be governed by their practical effect, rather than by their form.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Applying <em>Enelow </em>to this situation contravenes the federal policy that favors arbitration as a means of dispute resolution. <em>See also Southland Corp. v. Keating, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 852, 854-55, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984). The First Circuit chose to cling to quaint doctrine in <em>Langley v. Colonial Leasing Co. of New England, </em>707 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1983). I would clean our procedural closet of those equitable cobwebs, for, in this instance, remembering history dooms us to repeat its errors.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-5\">. <em>See Oasis Oil &amp; Refining Corp. v.
