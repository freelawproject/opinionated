By will the cestui que trust devised the property in trust until the decease of the last survivor of her children, to pay the net income to her children, and after the death of the last survivor to divide the principal in a manner specified among the descendants of her children. By a codicil she excluded a son and his descendants from sharing in her estate, but directed that the son should be paid a specified annuity during his life, and also gave her husband an annuity. After the death of testatrix a petition was presented to the orphans\u2019 court for the sale of the real estate covered by (he deed of trust. The son who had been excluded by the codicil resisted the petition. <em>Held, </em>that the orphans\u2019 court had jurisdiction to order the sale for the benefit of the estate, and as the proceeds of the sale would be held in trust in the exact place of the property sold, the question of the validity of the appointments by the will of the cestui que trust was premature.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b478-9\">Argued Jan. 21, 1900.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Af9D\">Appeal, No. 327, Jan.

All of her children, six in number, were living at her death, and are still alive ; three of them were born after the execution of the aforesaid deed of trust and after the death of Sarah B. VanSyckel, and were minors at the death of Helen Goddard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">Walter H. Goddard resisted the petition for the sale of the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-9\">The matter was referred to J. Henry Williams, Esq., who reported in favor of the sale without, however, passing upon the question of the jurisdiction of the court. No exceptions were filed to the master\u2019s report, but counsel agreed to argue the question of jurisdiction upon the petition and answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-10\">After argument Penbose, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-11\">It is unnecessary to decide whether the rights of the respondent, under the deed conferring the power of appointment upon the decedent, have been divested by a valid exercise of the power; the life estates which have been created certainly do not, while all of the donee\u2019s children are living, in any way infringe the rule against perpetuities, and during their continuance the estate remains in trust, as directed by the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-12\">That the price offered by the proposed purchaser is an extremely advantageous one, and that unless now accepted the opportunity may be lost altogether, is not questioned by the respondent, and all the other parties in interest concur in asking for a sale. The Act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 368, sec. 5, Purd. 1834, pi. 14, gives jurisdiction either to the orphans\u2019 court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>to the court of common pleas, where, as here, \u201c the estate shall have been derived partly by deed and partly by descent or will; \u201d and as the rights of the respondent, if he has any, will not be prejudiced or affected by the sale, the fund produced being held, under section 6 of the act of 1853, Purd. 1833, pi. 6 for the same parties and the same uses as the land so sold, the withholding of his consent is \u201c unreasonable \u201d and this, in itself, is one of the grounds upon which, as the act provides, the sale may be decreed: Freeman\u2019s Estate, 181 Pa. 405.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-5\">The case is radically different from Johnston\u2019s Appeal, 185 Pa. 179, cited on behalf of the respondent, where the paramount object or \u201c scheme \u201d of the testator being the accomplishment of a purpose transgressive of the rule against perpetuities, subordinate interests, created in furtherance of such scheme, which, standing by themselves, might have been perfectly valid, were also held to be void, as mere incidents or agencies of a frustrated purpose. Here there was no such \u201c <em>scheme; </em>\u201d the paramount purpose of the donee of the power was to make provisions for her children, in accordance with what she regarded as her right, and there was no deliberate or manifest intention to transgress the rule in the disposition directed when the estate so created shall respectively cease. See Yan Syckel\u2019s Estate, 9 Pa. Dist. Pep. 367.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-6\">Exceptions dismissed and report of master confirmed absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">On October 27, 1900, a form of decree recommended by the master and examiner was adopted by the orphans\u2019 court, and security fixed at $190,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-9\"><em>Daniel W.

If the will be found invalid, and the deed contains a clause providing for a default of appointment, then the court cannot order a sale on account of lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Testatrix was restricted in her appointment to children, and the issue of a deceased child, living at her decease: Wickersham v.
