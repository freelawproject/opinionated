The evidence tended to show that he did not stop or look, and that as he stepped on the track he was instantly struck.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in refusing to take off nonsuit. \u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-7\"><em>A.

Co., 135 Pa. 346.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b212-8\">The rule that one cannot recover where he steps in front of a moving car is one which by its nature is applicable only to clear cases: Muscarro v.

The injuries received were the cause of his death within twenty-four hours of the occurrence. A clear case of contributory negligence was established by the evidence which plainly showed that the deceased had full opportunity to see the approaching car and to avoid contact with it. The case is fairly within Watkins v. Union Traction Co., 194 Pa. 564, Blaney v. Electric Traction Co., 184 Pa. 524, Gilmartin v. Lackawanna, etc., Ry. Co., 186 Pa. 190, and other cases of a like nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We are clearly of the opinion that the court below committed no error in entering the nonsuit and refusing to set it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
