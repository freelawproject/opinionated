Subsequently the son obtained an order from the court of common pleas directing him to convey the land to an Evangelical Lutheran Church which had been established in the borough where the land was situated. In pursuance of the order the substituted trustee conveyed the laud to the church mentioned in the order.

William A. Passavant in trust \u201c for the sole use, benefit and behoof of any Evangelical Lutheran Church and school which might be thereafter established.\u201d It was also provided therein that on the establishment of said church and school said Passavant his heirs and assigns should execute and deliver a deed of said land to the Evangelical Lutheran Church or their trustees or other legal representatives and their succes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>sors. Rev. William A. Passavant died on June 8, 1894, without having made any conveyance of said land. On January 23, 1897, his son William was appointed trustee by the court of common pleas No. 1, of Allegheny county, who on October 17, 1898, petitioned said court, inter alia, to make an order directing him to convey said land to St. Paul\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Church which is now the plaintiff in said suit. That the plaintiff was the proper party to receive the conveyance of the land from the trustee is undisputed, and that the title obtained by it was a marketable title admits of no question or doubt. We therefore dismiss the assignment of error and affirm the judgment entered by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
