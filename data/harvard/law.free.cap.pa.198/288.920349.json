There is no record of any deed or conveyance of the land from Alexander Miller and Robert McElhenny, Jr. In 1826 certain judgments were entered against Samuel K. Page, and under these judgments the land in question was sold by the sheriff to Charles Avery, to whom a sheriff\u2019s deed was made. By successive deeds, conveyances, descents and partition proceedings, the title became vested in the plaintiff. From the time of the conveyance to Avery, in 1827, he and his successors in title held the land continuously, notoriously and adversely. Neither Robert McElhenney, Jr., nor Alexander Miller, nor any person claiming by, to or under them, ever claimed any right, title or interest in the land. The court, in an opinion by Fhazer, J., found that the plaintiff had a good marketable title, and accordingly entered a decree of specific performance against the defendant who had agreed to purchase the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-6\"><em>Willis F. </em>McCook, with him <em>Charles A.
