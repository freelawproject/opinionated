Subsequently the coal company brought an action against its lessor to recover the amount of the judgment which it had paid. In its statement of claim it set up the payment of the judgment, and also the lease, which contained the following words: \u201c And all damages direct or consequential, and claims therefor resulting from the mining and removal of said coal in the doing of any and all matters and things hereinbefore described, are hereby waived and relinquished by the said party of the first part, provided that the party of the second part takes all ordinai\u2019y precautions usually taken in mining and removing coal.\u201d The defendant demurred to the statement. <em>Held </em>(1) that plaintiff was bound under the lease to afford proper support to the overlying surface ; (2) that the admission by plaintiff in its statement that there had been a recovery against it for failing to afford support, was an admission that it had not used all ordinary precautions in giving proper support to the surface; (3) that there was no error in sustaining the demurrer.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b367-8\">\n<em>Mines and mining\u2014Surface support\u2014Ordinary precautions.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b367-9\">\u201cOrdinary precautions in mining coal\u201d mean proper support to the overlying surface.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b367-10\">Argued Oct. 30, 1900.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3R\">Appeal, No. 158, Oct.

That the statement does not aver that the alleged representations of defendant to plaintiff\u2019s agent, that defendant had the right to take and remove said coal without liability to the owners of the surface for any damage that might result thereto by reason thereof, were omitted from said lease by fraud, accident or mistake. And said representations do not of themselves constitute an agreement, and, as appears by said statement, were not contemporaneous with the execution of said lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">3.

Justice Brown,</author>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In mining coal under a lease to it by the appellee, the appellant caused injury to the overlying surface of one Robertson, and in a suit brought by him against it damages were recovered. Thereupon this coal company brought the present suit to compel Hopkins, the appellee, and its lessor, to pay what it, in pursuance of the judgment against it, had paid to Robertson, together with costs and expenses. The judgment now reviewed was in favor of the defendant on his demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s statement. Turning to it, we find the following clause from the lease, upon which the right to recover depends: \u201c And together .with said coal, and as appurtenant thereto is hereby granted and conveyed the free and uninterrupted right of way over, into, under and through the said tract as above described, at, to and from such point or points, and in such manner as may be necessary, proper or convenient for the purpose of digging, mining and transporting or carrying away any and all of the said veins or strata of coal hereby demised. Together with all the mining rights, privileges and easements necessary or useful for the convenient draining, ventilating and operating openings into said veins and otherwise, some of which privileges are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>making and using of openings or airholes and drains and drifts in the surface, and in the making of surveys for the underground entries or tunnels and the like. And all damages direct or consequential and claims therefor, resulting from the mining and removal of said coal in the doing of any and all the matters and things hereinbefore described are hereby waived and relinquished by the said party of the first part, provided the party of the second part takes all ordinary precautions usually taken in mining and removing coal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The declaration, as stated by the court below, is not so full and minute as it should be in stating the character of the injury done to Robertson\u2019s property, and the facts out of which the liability to him arose; but in passing upon the question before us, we assume, what seems to be conceded by both sides, that the allegation of the plaintiff is that it had been compelled to pay Robertson for damages sustained by him in the sinking of the surface, which the jury in his suit against it found had not been properly supported by it in mining the coal. The question is, therefore, simply whether under the lease by Hopkins to the coal company he is bound to reimburse it for the damages recovered against it by Robertson, a stranger to the agreement, whose surface had subsided as a result of the removal of the coal beneath it. The contention of the plaintiff is that Hopkins must pay, because a covenant to protect it is found in the following words of the clause quoted: \u201cAnd all damages direct or consequential and claims therefor, resulting from the mining and removal of said coal, in the doing of any and all the matters and things hereinbefore described, are hereby waived and relinquished by the said party of the first part; \u201d but, even if it be true that such covenant is there found, the concluding words, \u201c provided the party of the second part takes all ordinary precautions usually taken in mining and removing coal,\u201d seem to be overlooked. \u201c Ordinary precautions \u201d mean, in mining coal, proper support to the overlying surface: Jones v. Wagner, 66 Pa. 429; Horner v. Watson, 79 Pa. 242; Coleman v. Chadwick, 80 Pa. 81; Carlin &amp; Co. v. Chappel, 101 Pa. 348; Robertson v. Youghiogheny River Coal Co., 172 Pa. 566. If such support had been given by the coal company to the surface of Robertson, there would have been no subsidence, and his suit would not have been brought, dire admission by the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>in its statement that he had recovered, is an admission, even in the face of the averment that all ordinary precautions had been taken in mining and removing coal, that the appellant had not used them in continuing or giving proper support to the surface. Such admission was fatal. The court below properly so regarded it in denying the appellant\u2019s right to recover. We need consider nothing else brought to our attention by the appellant or the appellee, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
