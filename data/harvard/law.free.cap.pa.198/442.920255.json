Appeal from Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-9\">From the record it appeared that the suit was brought on a policy of fire insurance for $2,500 issued by the defendants and a number of individuals and firms associated without incorporation, as the Philadelphia Fire Lloyds, each firm or individual acting as a separate underwriter for its or his proportion of said insurance, and not one for the other. The separate amount insured by the defendant was $119.04. It was conceded that all of the premiums had been paid, and that the plaintiff had sustained a loss by fire within the terms of the policy. The court of common pleas entered judgment for plaintiffs on a case stated. On appeal the Superior Court reversed the judgment. See 12 Pa. Superior Ct. 412.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-10\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-11\"><em>Rufus Barrett </em>Stone, with him <em>Theodore A.

Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">The facts of this case appear in its report in 12 Pa. Superior Ct. 412. The act of B\u2019ebruary 4, 1870, makes it unlawful for any person, partnership or association to issue a policy of fire insurance without authority expressly conferred by a char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ter of incorporation, and declares that <em>\u201c every </em>such policy, contract and guaranty hereafter made, executed or issued shall be void.\u201d These words, in a statute forbidding an act on the ground of public policy, should be given their literal meaning. The intention of the legislature is too clear to admit of doubt, and there is no room for construction. Both parties are bound by the legislative prohibition. Presumably they both knew the law and entered into the contract knowing they were doing a prohibited thing. The contract being unlawful and void in its inception, there is no ground of equitable estoppel because of the receipt of premiums by the insurer. The plaintiffs could not rightfully disregard the prohibition when the contract was made, and they cannot now ask to have it set aside in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
