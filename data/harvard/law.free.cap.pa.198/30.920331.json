R. Co. v. Long, 75 Pa. 257; Penna. R. Co. v. James, 81* Pa. 194; Dunseath v. Pitts., etc., Traction Co., 161 Pa. 124; Woeckner v.

The testimony was the same in both cases and we find nothing in it which would warrant the withdrawal of the case from the jury on the ground that the plaintiff was negligent in not selecting a proper caretaker for his child or that the person in whose care she was placed was under the circumstances negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
