This, however, he has refused to do, and the bill has been filed for the purpose of compelling him to transfer to the plaintiff said shares, together with any and all increments thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-6\">Without undertaking to recite all the averments of the bill upon the subject, it is sufficient to say that the plaintiff claims that these fifty shares were transferred to the defendant Stevenson after a sale by him, Stevenson, of the eleven shares of stock of the same company, which he had owned, for the purpose of giving him a status to continue an opposition to a certain policy of the company which he and the plaintiff had formerly opposed. The defendant Stevenson, however, in his answer denies that this was the purpose of the transfer of stock to him, and sets up an entirely different reason for the same. He says that the plaintiff for several years prior to 1888 had had dealings with Irvine C. Beatty &amp; Company, and had invested with said firm some $71,000: that said firm was insolvent, and largely indebted to various persons; that the plaintiff, who was tbe president of the Ninth National Bank of Philadelphia, was claimed by some of the creditors of said firm to be a partner therein, and that the plaintiff was anxious to prevent this claim from coming to the knowledge of the public and of the said bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-7\">The defendant Stevenson also alleges that James E. Mitchell was at that time vice president of said bank, and also a creditor of said firm; that the plaintiff was anxious that said Mitchell should not prosecute efforts to ascertain the facts in regard to the plaintiff being a partner in the said firm; and that to prevent him, Mitchell, from pursuing such investigation, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>tiff was willing that Mitchell\u2019s claim against said firm should be paid in full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-4\">There are many other details connected with these averments set forth in Stevenson\u2019s answer, to which I do not deem it necessary to refer. It is sufficient to say that, in consequence of such state of affairs as Stevenson alleges to have existed, he avers that said fifty shares of stock \u201c were transferred under an oral agreement that if I succeeded in arranging matters with said Mitchell, and if no claim that plaintiff was a member o\u00ed the firm of Irvine C. Beatty &amp; Company, should be established, all of said shares of stock should be retained by me as compensation for my services; but that if I did not succeed therein, and if it was established that plaintiff was in- fact a member of the firm of Irvine C. Beatty &amp; Company, and liable for its debts, I should hold them for his benefit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-5\">In a general way, the testimony of the defendant Stevenson supports his answer, but if the answer is not properly to be regarded as responsive to the plaintiff\u2019s bill, the case would stand before me with the plaintiff and the defendant testifying directly to the opposite of each other, with the evidence of the transaction in writing altogether favorable to the view that the shares of stock in question were held by the defendant Stevenson simply as agent or trustee. In that event there would be, in my opinion, no escape on the part of the defendant Stevenson from the effectiveness of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of title. I am obliged, however, to regard the answer of Stevenson as responsive to the bill. The plaintiff saw fit to set forth in his bill the circumstances under which he alleged that the fifty shares of stock were transferred to the defendant Stevenson, and it seems to me that the answer of Stevenson denying the matters alleged in the bill, and setting forth what he claims to have been the real circumstances under which the transfer was made, is directly responsive to the plaintiff\u2019s case, and cannot properly be regarded as new affirmative matter which he is bound to establish by proofs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\">I have not considered it necessary in the foregoing statement of the case to set forth in detail the reasons upon which the plaintiff claims that the transfer of stock to Stevenson was made, because of the fact that the receipt or certificate for those shares upon its face indicates that the defendant, by the trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>fer, acquired nothing but a legal title, while the equitable title remained in the plaintiff; and therefore, if I were of the opinion that the proofs in the ease do not fully sustain the plaintiff\u2019s averment on that subject, I would not consider that for that reason alone the plaintiff had failed to make out his case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-5\">The motives which induced the plaintiff to make the transfer are not so important as is the question, what was the nature of the transaction?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-6\">It will be observed from what has been stated that the defendant\u2019s claim of title rests upon the ground that he undertook to render certain services to the plaintiff which the latter deemed important in view of his relations to the firm of Irvine C. Beatty &amp; Company; that the transfer of the stock to him was made under an agreement that if these services were successful, the shares of stock in question were to be retained by him as compensation for his services. He claims that his services were successful, and that therefore the complete ownership of the stock has vested in him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-7\">It is not claimed by Stevenson that the shares were transferred to him as a gift.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-8\">It becomes necessary, therefore, for me to consider the proofs as they bear upon the question of whether or not the plaintiff\u2019s proofs overcome the case which is stated in the defendant\u2019s answer. It seems to me, after a careful consideration of those proofs, that they do. It is true that the plaintiff was never held to be a member of the firm of Irvine C. Beatty &amp; Company. It is also true that no embarrassment was caused to tbe plaintiff by anything done by the said Mitchell. It appears to me, however, from the proofs in the case, that these conditions were not owing to anything that was done by the defendant Stevenson. On the testimony of Mitchell and of Irvine C. Beatty it not only appears that prior to June 21, 1888, which was the date of the transfer of the shares of stock, had the debts of the firm of Irvine C. Beatty &amp; Company, generally been paid to the extent of about three fourths of their amount, but that Mitchell\u2019s claim against said firm had also been paid to about the same extent, without the intervention of the defendant Stevenson in any way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">No effort was made on the part of Mitchell or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>creditor, so far as I can see, to hold the plaintiff liable as a partner in said firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-4\">The plaintiff, in his testimony before me, denies the existence of any such agreement as the defendant Stevenson alleges to have been made in regard to the transfer of the stock. That Stevenson did represent the plaintiff in some way in regard to the affairs of the said firm is no doubt true. This appears from the fact that an assignment of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the said firm was executed by the plaintiff to Stevenson on February 8, 1888, and,' according to the testimony of Mr. Beatty, Stevenson subsequently endeavored to obtain a confession of judgment from Beatty for the amount that was due to the plaintiff, in which attempt he did not succeed. It is not, however, alleged by the defendant Stevenson that the shares of stock were transferred to him as compensation for efforts to obtain from the said firm the amount due to the plaintiff. In point of fact, neither the plaintiff nor Stevenson, on his behalf, ever received anything on account of such claim. In his testimony Stevenson said that the part which it was understood he was to take in the matter, and for the successful carrying out of which he was to be compensated by the shares of stock in question, was a \u201c passive \u201d one, and he claims that having remained passive, and there having been no successful effort made to hold the plaintiff liable as a partner, he is entitled to hold the said shares of stock. I cannot agree with that position. In point of fact, he did not remain passive, according to the testimony of Mr. Beatty. The effort which he made to obtain a judgment in the interest of the plaintiff was one which was calculated, if Stevenson\u2019s allegations are true, to stir up inquiry as to the plaintiff\u2019s relation to the firm, rather than to quiet it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-5\">In the face of a clear and distinct recognition by Stevenson in the certificate, which has been hereinbefore incorporated, of the real ownership of the stock in the plaintiff, it seems to me that I ought to be somewhat strict in weighing the grounds upon which the defendant Stevenson now claims to have a complete title to the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">The presumptions in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s claim arising from the fact that Stevenson certified that he held the stock \u201csubject to the order of Mr. John Dickey,\u201d appear to me to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>so strong that I ought to require that the consideration alleged to be the basis for the shifting of the ownership from Dickey to Stevenson should be real and substantia], and not such as might be found in the mere fact that no claim based upon the allegation that Dickey was a partner in the firm of Irvine C. Beatty &amp; Company was made, when it also appears that Stevenson had nothing whatever to do with bringing about such state of affairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">I am of the opinion, upon the proofs submitted, that Stevenson had nothing whatever to do, either with the exemption of the plaintiff from such claim, or with the making of a settlement with the creditors of the firm of Irvine C. Beatty &amp; Company to the advantage of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">The answer of the defendant Stevenson, though I regard it as responsive, is, in my opinion, upon all the substantial points of the controversy, met by a sufficient amount of testimony of a contrary character to overcome its effect. It is not supported by any testimony other than that of Stevenson himself. 1 am therefore obliged to come to the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s bill has been sustained by the proofs, and that he is entitled to a decree in his favor, directing that the fifty shares of stock which were transferred by him to the defendant Stevenson on June 21, 1888, shall be reassigned and transferred to him, together with all dividends and increments thereon which have accrued since the said date of transfer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">A decree was entered in accordance with the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b477-9\"><em>John Gr.
