The cause of the accident was the fact that an employee of the defendant had mistaken a by-pass of the Bridgewater Gas Company which supplied plaintiff\u2019s house, for a by-pass of his own company, and had opened the high pressure valves of the by-pass.

(1) It is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial. (2) It is incumbent upon the defendant to show what the Bridgewater Gas Company did at the particular house in question, not their custom. (3) That the defendants do not even propose to show that the gas escaped through the meter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-13\">The Court: The objection will have to be sustained. It is not proposed in this offer to show that the escape of this gas was the fault of the meter or the service pipe. They might as well try to show that the chimney was not built right, if it was not the purpose of showing that the appliance was unsafe through which the gas escaped. The objection is sustained and a bill of exceptions sealed to the defendants. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-14\">Defendant\u2019s counsel proposed to ask the witness whether he knew that the tin meter already referred to was in use at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>' McKenna house at the time of the explosion, and whether or not it was the ordinary meter in use for the delivery of gas into buildings; to be followed by evidence that the meter was too weak for the transmission of gas at low pressure; this for the purpose of showing contributory negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">Objected to on the part of the plaintiff, for the reason that there has yet been shown no connection between the tin meter and the accident of which plaintiff complains, and it is therefore incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">2. The witness has not shown himself competent to give an opinion as to a meter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">3. It is not shown that the gas escaped into the building by reason of any defect in the meter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">Mr. Rodgers: \u201c Q. Mr. Gordon, I understand you to say that you were connected with the Bridgewater Gas Company for about thirteen years ? A. Along about that; yes, sir. Q. And in what capacity? A. Setting meters, reading meters and laying lines. Q. And what other gas companies in this neighborhood are you acquainted with, \u2022 practically ? A. I knew the Citizens Gas Company; that was in Brighton. Q. And what about the company operating in East Liverpool ? A. The Ohio Valley. Q. Were you acquainted with that? A. I worked for them eighteen months. Q. Are yon acquainted with the meters in use by those three companies? A. Well, I am to a certain extent; I have not seen all the meters of the other companies. I have of the Bridgewater Gas Company; I have read them all and seen lots of the other ones, not just all of them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-9\">The last preceding offer by defendant\u2019s counsel and objections by plaintiff\u2019s counsel renewed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-10\">The Court: To admit the testimony you would have to assume that the gas escaped into the building through the tin meter, or by reason of the breaking of the tin meter. As there is no evidence of that in this case, the objection is sustained, and at request of counsel a bill of exceptions sealed to the defendant. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-11\">Defendant\u2019s counsel proposed to ask the witness where the weakest point would be on the line from the curb in; for the purpose of showing that if any of the connections broke, it would be the tin meter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel object as being immaterial, and as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>an assumption. It is objected to as further incompetent because it would be an inference and nothing better than an inference ; and there is no evidence to show that he knew anything about the other connections leading from the street into the house. It is objected to further as incompetent if shown, because the witness cannot infer from any knowledge that he may have had of the pipes and the meter that the explosion was caused by a defect in the meter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">The Court: The objection is sustained and upon request of counsel a bill of exceptions is sealed for the defendants. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-7\">Counsel for the defendant propose to show by John Long that of the two regulators belonging to the Bridgewater Gas Company named by him, one of them was out of repair, and had been for at least a year, and out of repair in this particular, that the escape valve intended for the relief of the pressure was completely closed, and made no noise and gave no warning; that this escape valve, as well as the escape valve upon the other regulator, was only an inch and a quarter in diameter and connected with a six-inch line; that thereby when the gas was at a high pressure, the escape valve would not allow the gas to escape as it should be allowed to escape ; this to be followed by evidence that the escape valves referred to were not sufficient, and were not the ordinary escape valves in use as to size, being much too small to relieve the lines at any point, and that the escape valves should have been as large as the pipe from which the gas would escape into them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\">This for'the purpose of showing that the Bridgewater Gas Company was negligent in the maintenance of its lines, and that assuming that Mr. Miller did turn on the by-pass that his employer could not be held liable for anything excepting usual and ordinary results therefrom, and would not be liable for the negligence of the Bridgewater Gas Company, or for any results that could not be reasonably foreseen as flowing from its act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-9\">Counsel for the plaintiff object, first, as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial; and, second, as being subject to precisely the same objection and ruling as the offers heretofore made by the defendants in this case ; as the defendant does not offer to show that the accident .was caused by a defective regulator, which was perhaps three eighths of a mile from the house of the plaintiff, and it is therefore incompetent and immaterial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The Court: The objection is sustained, and upon request of counsel a bill of exceptions is sealed to the defendant. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-5\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">[In considering the question of damages, if you come to such consideration, all the facts must be taken into account. There is no evidence in this case on the part of the plaintiff as to his earning power at the time of the accident, and you must take into consideration that fact, that it is upon the question of earning power that the rule is laid down, that you must base your calculation as to the damages which have been sustained by reason of inability to perform some kind of labor, labor of any kind, and if no rule is given to you, you must determine under all the facts and circumstances of the case, and the conditions that existed prior to the accident, as near as possible what that earning power was. And in determining the question of damages, you must look at that in a reasonable and common sense manner. In determining damages for personal injuries resulting from negligence, you should allow not only for the direct expenses incurred by the plaintiff by reason of the injury, but also for the privation and inconvenience the plaintiff has been subjected to, and the physical and mental pain he has already endured and which he is likely to experience, as well as for the pecuniary loss he has sustained and is likely to sustain during the remainder of his life from his disabled condition. When we speak of pecuniary loss we refer to earning power, what he was able to earn, or likely to be able to earn, and such loss as he might sustain by being unable to continue the exercises of that earning power. The court does not recollect any evidence in this case as to the earning power of the plaintiff, whether his condition in that respect was the same after the accident as it was before, except as to his physical condition before and after the explosion by which the injuries were caused. There is no evidence other than that he was employed, or kept a store prior to the time of the accident, and since that time he has been living with his brother in the city of Pittsburg.] [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $7,000.

Justice Mestrezat,</author>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">This action was brought by Patrick Henry McKenna against the Citizens Natural Gas Company to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by himself and for the loss of his wife, which the plaintiff alleges were caused by an explosion of natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>gas at his residence in New Brighton, Beaver county, on the night of December 27, 1897. At that time Mr. McKenna was supplied with natural gas for fuel and illuminating purposes by the Bridgewater Gas Company whose mains were laid in the streets of New Brighton. The Citizens Natural Gas Company also had laid its mains in the streets of New Brighton, but they were not connected with the pipes on Mr. McKenna\u2019s premises by which the gas was conveyed from the mains of the Bridge-water Gas Company to his residence. Charles T. Miller was an employee and inspector of the defendant company, but he had no connection with the Bridgewater Gas Company. On the morning of December 27, 1897, desiring to force some water out of the defendant company\u2019s low pressure line, he by mistake entered a box of the Bridgewater Gas Company and opened the valves of the by-pass contained therein connecting the high and low pressure lines of the latter company. Mr. Miller thought this was the box of the Citizens Natural Gas Company and did not discover his mistake until the following morning. That night at 11 o\u2019clock the explosion occurred at the residence of the plaintiff by which he and his wife were seriously injured and from the effects of which she died a few days afterwards. By Miller\u2019s action in opening the valves of the by-pass, the gas in the mains of the Bridgewater Gas Company was freed from the control of the regulator and passed directly from the high to the low pressure line which carried it to the plaintiff\u2019s house. This would equalize the pressure in the two lines and cause an excessive pressure on the low pressure line. Owing to a break in the line, the gas was turned off, and there was but little gas in the mains of the Bridge-water Gas Company during the day of December 27. Between 6 and 7 o\u2019clock that evening the gas was turned on again. About 9:30 o\u2019clock there was a pressure of twenty-two and one half pounds on the high pressure line. The low pressure line usually carried about ten or twelve ounces.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The plaintiff alleges that Miller\u2019s action in opening the bypass in the Bridgewater Gas Company\u2019s mains while he was in the service and under the direction of the defendant company, was negligence, and caused the explosion in the plaintiff's house which resulted in the injuries to the plaintiff and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The first and second assignments of error relate to the recep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>tion of the testimony of Samuel Henry offered for the purpose of showing the expectancy of the lives of Patrick Henry McKenna and Mary McKenna, his wife. He testified from a life table in a book entitled \u201c Handy Guide to Premium Rates, Applications and Policies and American Life Insurance Companies.\u201d The book was not offered in evidence and all we know of it is what the witness testified to. It contained two mortality tables. In testifying to the expectancy of life, he read from the one designated \u201c Combined Actuaries Experience \u201d table. On what this table is based, or from what material it was constructed, is not disclosed by the evidence. Whether it was founded on selected or insurable lives or upon general population, or upon either, is not shown by the testimony. The character of the table and its value as a basis from which to determine the expectancy of life were not shown. Tiie witness testified that the table was used for ascertaining lates, and that from this table he could calculate the expectancy of life at a given age. The competency of the witness and the weight of his testimony depended entirely upon the value of the table as evidence to establish the expectancy of life. Had the table itself been offered, under the facts disclosed at the trial, it would have been rejected. The witness, therefore, should not have been permitted to testify from it to the expectancy of life of the plaintiff and his wife. The first and second assignments of error are sustained. The admission of such testimony as complained of in these assignments, its value as well as the care with which it should be submitted to the jury, have been fully discussed and determined by our Brother Dean in the very recent case of Kerrigan v. Penna. R. Co., 194 Pa. 98, and the subject needs no further elaboration at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The third and fourth assignments are not sustained. If the testimony covered by these assignments had been admitted, it would not have convicted the plaintiff of negligence. Without some evidence tending to show that the unsafe condition of the meter and regulator contributed to or was the cause of the explosion, the condition of these appliances was immaterial and irrelevant to the issue, and the testimony offered for the purpose of showing it was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We are at a Joss to see how the fifth assignment can be sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tamed. Assuming that the Bridgewater Gas Company was negligent in the construction and maintenance of its lines, it does not exculpate the defendant company from its negligence. Where two parties are each guilty of negligence contributing to an injury, the tort of the one is no defense to an action against the other. In the case at bar, McKenna\u2019s house would not have been wrecked notwithstanding the Bridgewater Gas Company\u2019s defective appliances, had not Miller opened the valve in the bypass. Without his negligence, therefore, it is too clear for argument that the plaintiff would not have sustained the injuries for which he sues in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The seventh assignment relates to a part of the charge devoted to the question of damages. The learned judge in his charge said: \u201c In determining damages for personal injuries resulting from negligence you will allow .... for the pecuniary loss he (the plaintiff) has sustained, and is likely to sustain, during the remainder of his life, from his disabled condition. When we speak of pecuniary loss we refer to earning power, what he was able to earn, or likely to be able to earn, and such loss as he might sustain of being unable to continue the exercise of that earning power.\u201d The probable earnings of the plaintiff, therefore, was an element to be considered in determining the damages recoverable in the action. It was conceded and so stated in the charge, that there was no evidence in the case as to the earning power of the plaintiff before or after the accident. Yet the court directed the jury to take it into consideration in determining the damages. This was error. As the plaintiff asked damages by reason of his diminished earning capacity, it was his duty to introduce testimony from which the jury could ascertain such damages. Failing in this the learned judge should not have submitted to the jury as a basis for their verdict the pecuniary loss to the plaintiff occasioned by the injuries received in the explosion. \u201c But it is also true,\u201d says Justice Williams in McHugh v. Schlosser, 159 Pa. 486, \u201c that when the probable earnings of the deceased are to be taken into account in fixing the damages, it is the duty of the plaintiff to show the earning power of the deceased or give such evidence in regard to his business, business habits and past earnings as will afford some basis from which his earning capacity may be fairly estimated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The first, second and seventh assignments of error are sustained, the judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
