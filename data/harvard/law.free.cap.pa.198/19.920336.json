Driver who was the husband of plaintiff\u2019s decedent was killed by touching an electric wire while painting the roof of the house of S. Zoch in Pittsburg. The evidence showed that the wire at the point where the deceased was found clutching it was defectively insulated, but there was no evidence as to the cause of the defective insulation, or that the defendant had notice of the defect. The action was originally brought by the widow of the decedent, who died before the trial leaving minor children, and her administrator was substituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-10\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-11\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-12\"><em>Richard A. </em>Kennedy,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYo\">cited in his printed brief: Griffin v.
