J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">The attorney general, on behalf of the commonwealth, has filed a bill to restrain the defendant from using the name \u201cUniversity of Philadelphia \u201d in connection with his business of keeping a school for commercial instruction. The facts as averred in the bill, and admitted to be true by the demurrer, are that the defendant is the proprietor of a business school in this city, and formerly carried on his school under the name of \u201c Banks\u2019 Business College,\u201d but recently he has assumed the name and title of the University of Philadelphia. In a pamphlet or prospectus in which he advertises his business, the defendant states that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-9\">\u201c The aim of the University is to thoroughly equip young men and young women to fill satisfactorily to themselves and their employers, any position of a clerical nature which may be open to them, to develop every latent quality or talent they possess which could increase their efficiency and so train them by actual, practical work as to enable them to fill intelligently the higher' grades of positions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-10\">\u201cWe have no desire to make the school a machine for the transformation of students into mechanical bookkeepers and stenographers, but train our pupils to think and reason along broad lines and give them a liberal education, endeavoring to be not merely teachers of book facts, but of common sense, sound judgment and the underlying principles of business which open up wide avenues of success and usefulness in the bush ness world.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-11\">\u201cWe aim to occupy toward the business world the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>which the trade school holds to the mechanical occupations, or the college to the professional man, by training the hand and mind for a specific occupation, which will enable the pupil to immediately earn a good living and to become a useful member of society.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\">The course of instruction imparted by the defendant is commercial, such as bookkeeping and stenography. This is shown by the statement in his prospectus that \u201c Diplomas are given to those who complete the \u2018 Commercial,\u2019 \u2018 Combined \u2019 or \u2018 Stenographic \u2019 courses, and also to those who have studied with us and have subsequently filled a position, either as a bookkeeper or a stenographer for sixty days, to the satisfaction of their employer, said position having been obtained either with or without our assistance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\">That the defendant\u2019s institution is not a university is shown by his statement that \u201c There is nothing in common between our methods and those pursued by others. In one class of schools you are too much of a theorist and not enough of a practician. The other extreme is pursued by another class, too much of a virtue being made of \u2018Actual business from the start,\u2019 \u2018 Learn by doing,\u2019 \u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-7\">That his school is a purely business affair is shown by his statement that, \u201c As obtaining positions for our graduates is a vital part of our success, we have studied the situation by inquiring of many successful business men just what they needed and expected in an employee, and having verified our own views on the subject, we have formulated our course to meet the requirements of the employing public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">\u201c The community appreciates a course in the University of Philadelphia as it does a college training. A man studies for the ministry, law, or medicine, never asking himself the question, \u2018 Shall I be able to earn a livelihood ? \u2019 He knows that when the course is completed he will make his way; yet there is infinitely more prospect of immediate gain, as well as ultimate success, in the business field than in the more complicated and expensive educations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-9\">To insure the success which he promises his students as well as to increase his own business, the defendant issues a paper which he calls a \u201c Contract of Guaranty,\u201d by which \u201c The University of Philadelphia guarantees to place (the student) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>in a position within sixty days from the time of completing either onr Stenographic or Combined course, at a salary of not less than seven dollars per week, or to refund the money paid for tuition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">Two questions arise upon these facts: First, Has the defendant a right to use the word \u201c University \u201d as descriptive of the institution or business conducted, by him ? and, second, Is the method adopted in this case proper for preventing the defendant from calling his institution a university, in case he is not entitled to use that word ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">A short but comprehensive definition of the word \u201cuniversity\u201d is an aggregation or union of colleges. It is an institution in which the education imparted is universal, embracing many branches, such as the arts, sciences and all manner of learning, and possessing power to confer degrees which indicate proficiency in the branches taught. In the collegiate department, or department of arts, as it has been called, the ordinary scholastic education is imparted, upon which the degree of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts is conferred; in the medical department the degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred, and in the law department the degree of Bachelor of Laws. The medical department is also subdivided into branches or special departments, such as dental surgery and veterinary medicine, etc. The words \u201cschool,\u201d \u201cacademy\u201d and \u201c college \u201d are applied to institutions which are confined to some special course of instruction. These words, \u201cschool,\u201d \u201cacademy\u201d and \u201ccollege,\u201d have become common dictionary words which maybe appropriated by any person. Thus we see the term swimming school, skating school, bicycle school, dancing academy, business college, and the like in common use. In some of the western states, it is true, the word \u201c university \u201d is also freely adopted and used by institutions which do not include all departments of learning, but as no complaint seems to have been made against them, and no laws have been passed to prevent the use of that word in those states, we know of no instance in which an attempt has been made to prevent the use of the word \u201cuniversity\u201d as applied to an institution which is confined to a special course of instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-7\">In this state, however, by the Act of June 26,1895, P. L. 327, for the incorporation of institutions of learning, with power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>confer degrees in art, science, philosophy, literature, medicine, law and theology, and for the supervision and regulation of such institutions, there was created a board styled the College and University Council, which shall consist of twelve members, viz: the governor, attorney general and the superintendent of public instruction, who shall be members ex officio, three persons selected from the presiding officers of undenominational colleges or universities of this commonwealth, three persons selected from the presiding officers of denominational colleges or universities of this commonwealth, and three persons holding official relationship to the common schools of the state. No new institution shall be authorized to confer degrees until the college and university council shall have considered its application and approved the same. The rights of previously existing colleges to confer degrees are preserved. As a university is an institution authorized to confer degrees, and no university can be established without the approval of the college and university council, and as the defendant has no such authority conferred upon him, therefore he has no right to use the name and title of University of Philadelphia in connection with his business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">There is located in the city of Philadelphia an institution entitled the University of Pennsylvania, and it is averred in the bill that the school of the defendant has been frequently mistaken for the University of Pennsylvania, and numerous letters intended for the provost of the University of Pennsylvania, and members of its faculty, have been directed by persons residing in other states and countries to the University of Philadelphia. The similarity of name between the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Philadelphia misleads persons into making mistakes in correspondence, and those mistakes would entitle the University of Pennsylvania, and persons dealing with it, to protection under the law relating to trade-marks, against the use of a name which is similar in point of territorial designation and misleads the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-6\">One remedy to restrain the defendant from the unlawful use of the name \u201c University of Philadelphia \u201d would be by information and a writ of quo warranto, upon which judgment of ouster might be given and a fine, and even imprisonment might be inflicted if the defendant should refuse to abide the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ment of the court. The same relief may also be obtained by a proceeding in equity. Courts of equity have power to restrain the commission of acts which are contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the community, and a court may accomplish the same results by injunction as may be obtained by a quo warranto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">An injunction will be decreed as prayed for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">DECREE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">And now, to wit: July 5, 1900, this cause having come on to be heard upon the motion of the attorney general for an injunction, and having been argued by counsel, and it appearing by the record that the defendant had, by demurrer, admitted the facts duly averred in the complainant\u2019s bill, and the court being fully advised in the premises, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that Benjamin S. Banks be and he hereby is enjoined and restrained from using the name \u201c University of Philadelphia \u201d in any manner in his business or upon his letterheads, circulars, advertisements, placards or in any other way, or from holding himself out as owning or controlling an institution lawfully styled \u201c University of Philadelphia,\u201d or as authorized to confer degrees or grant diplomas; and further, that the said Benjamin S. Banks be ordered to cancel the name \u201c University of Philadelphia\u201d appearing .upon any letterheads, billheads, circulars, envelopes or other stationery which may be in his possession and which he may intend to use, and that he remove and destroy all advertisements and placards of the <em>\u201c </em>University of Philadelphia.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-9\"><em>A.
