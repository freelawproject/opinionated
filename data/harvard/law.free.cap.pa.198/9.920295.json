J., filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-8\">This case comes before the court in the form of an action to recover from Pam. Phillips by reason of a certain lease for lands signed and executed by one E. I. Agnew and William A. Seaton, dated May 7, 1877. It comes in the way of a case stated, the facts being agreed upon by the parties. The case takes the nature of a special verdict leaving the questions of laAV arising under the facts to be determined by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The first question that we meet is, what is the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant ? In order to determine this another question arises, what is the relationship between E. I. Agnew and the defendant ? This last question is the main question in our opinion and where the counsel for the parties differ. Agnew signed the lease and made the first payment and thereby undertook to carry out the covenants and become liable on said contract with William A. Seaton for any covenants mentioned and stipulated in said lease. As between Agnew and Seaton there would be no question as to Seaton\u2019s rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-5\">The plaintiff contends that by virtue of Agnew\u2019s declaration of trust dated June 27, 1877, lie became the agent of the defendant in all of these transactions, and that the defendant, by signing the indenture transferred to Osborne in 1885, thereby ratified and accepted ail the business and covenants contained in the agreement made by said Agnew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-6\">If the plaintiff is entitled to recover, he must recover by reason of Agnew being an agent of defendant and by her accepting and ratifjdng the acts and covenants of said Agnew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-7\">Before going to that question let us look at the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant was not a party to the <em>lease; </em>she did not sign it or take anything under it. In other words, there was nothing in the lease or the transaction at the time of the making that would in any way create a privity of contract. Privity of contract is the relationship that exists between two or more contracting parties. It is essential to the maintenance of an action on any contract that there should subsist a privity between the plaintiff and defendant in respect to the matter sued on. We cannot, therefore, say that any such privity existed in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-8\">Again, defendant never took possession of said lands under said lease or did any other thing with said premises that would vest in her a privity of estate. Privity of estate is that which exists between lessor and lessee, tenant for life or remainder-man or reversioner, etc., and their respective assignees, and between joint tenants and copartners. None of these conditions exist in this case, hence plaintiff cannot recover by reason of any privity of estate. Having determined that neither privity of contract nor privity of estate existed between the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>and the- defendant, then we must determine whether Agnew was an agent or a trustee. Taking the declaration as a whole, we believe that Agnew held the position of a trustee and not as an agent. That he held the position of an active trustee in whom the leasehold was vested and, therefore, was liable as a trustee for the performance of the covenants during the continuance of his active trust.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">\u201c Trustees are bound by their personal covenants : \u201d Hill on Trusts. True, had the trustee in this case been an inactive trustee, with nothing to do but hold the lease for some other person to whom it rightfully belonged, and who was in possession and .charge of said leasehold, then a different question presents itself, but such is not our case. It cannot be that both the trustee in active operation and carrying on business, making contracts and covenants, can be personally bound, and at the same time bind by his acts the beneficiary who has never taken any part, given any instructions or in any way assumed the responsibilty of said business or covenants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">Hence we conclude that under this state of facts the beneficiary cannot be held liable for the personal covenants made by the active trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">There was a great deal of stress placed by plaintiff\u2019s attorneys upon the fact that at the death of Agnew defendant made and executed an indenture to one Osborne similar to the declaration made by Agnew. . This for the purpose of showing ratification of the alleged acts of Agnew as agent. We cannot agree in this way, as we look upon the trust held by Agnew as an administrative trust, and one that in case no action had been taken as to his successor would have -passed to his legal representatives, and henee no privity of estate passed to the defendant at the death of Agnew, as claimed by plaintiff. Even if otherwise it would only have been momentarily, as this deed conveyed all the rights that were in Agnew directly to Osborne to hold in the same relation as trustee as did Agnew in his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">There is another phase of this case, that of coverture, which is raised by defendant, she being a married woman, but as in our opinion the above questions settle the rights of plaintiff and defendant, we will not discuss the question of coverture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Now, March 5, 1900, judgment is entered upon the facts stated in the above case for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-6\"><em>J. Norman </em>Martin, with him <em>William, H. </em>Dodds, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMq\">We submit, that under the agreed facts and exhibits, E. I. Agnew was agent for defendant and acted in that capacity in securing the lease and conducting the business: Smith v. Loafman, 145 Pa. 636.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-8\">A person employed to do a thing which the employer himself could do is an agent: Story on Agency, sec. 3; Bolles v. State Trust Co., 27 N. J. Eq. 308; Ghormley v. Smith, 139 Pa. 584; 1 Lewin on Trusts, chap. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-10\">The principle governing this case is clearly stated in the following authorities : Ford v. Williams, 21 How. 287; Veazie v. Williams, 49 U. S. 134; Elwell v. Chamberlin, 31 N. Y. 611; Story on Agency, sec. 420; Ilsley v. Merriam, 7 Cush. 242; Barry v. Page, 10 Gray, 398; Steinman v. Ewing, 43 Pa. 66; Steffen v. Smith, 159 Pa. 207; Swayne v. Lyon, 67 Pa. 440; Bond v. Bunting, 78 Pa. 210; Seeds v. Kahler, 76 Pa. 267 ; Sixbee v. Bowen, 91 Pa. 149; Shuster v. Kaiser, 111 Pa. 220; Bortz v. Bortz, 48 Pa. 382.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-11\"><em>8. W. Dana, </em>with him <em>D. B. Kurtz, L. T. Kurtz, 8. D. Long </em>and <em>B. F. Dana, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax6\">There can be no question that there was in this case a special trust, an active administrative trust. All the property was to be and remain in the trustee, for the purpose of the trust, the development of the land, the carrying on the business in relation to it, and the disposition thereof. The beneficiaries might terminate the trust by asking for a conveyance. But so long as it continued, the whole estate and property was in the trustee for management and disposition: Dodson v. Ball, 60 Pa. 492; 1 Lewin on Trusts, * 238; Hill on Trustees, 432; Newkumet v. Davidson, 13 W. N. C. 10; Hannen v. Ewalt, 18 Pa. 9; Wickersham v. Irwin, 14 Pa. 108 ; Berry v. McMullen, 17 S. &amp; R. 84; Elkinton v. Newman, 20 Pa. 281.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AkF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>January 27, 1901:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AG\">Mr. Justice Potter,</author>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The proper determination of this case turns upon the relation established between the defendants and E. I. Agnew who signed the lease, upon which this suit is brought. The plaintiff contends that Agnew was only an agent, while the defendants maintain that an active trust existed. The court below took the latter view in deciding upon the facts submitted by. the case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">While it may be difficult to define strictly, at all times, the line between a trustee and an agent, yet in this case, we are of the opinion that there was far more than an agency in the relationship between Agnew and the defendants. The judgment and discretion required, were such as to constitute an active, administrative trust; we can see no error in the conclusion that Agnew held the position of a trustee and not that of an agent. We think the learned judge of the court, below rightly disposed of the questions presented for consideration, arid upon his opinion the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
