The horse became frightened by the whistle of a locomotive and shied on to the east-bound track, where it ran for some distance. The wife made signals of distress in view of a motorman of a car approaching on the east-bound track. The motorman did not slacken the speed of his car which was goring at a rapid rate, although he had ample opportunity to do so, and the buggy was struck and the woman killed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">[But if the motorman saw this party coming down that track, if he saw, either that the horse was keeping to the left hand track, that is, the track towards the river, the track on' which he was, or that the horse was swaying back and forth to that track, and that he might happen to be there at the time he got up with his car, and if he saw that the horse was not in control of the driver of the buggy, then it would be evidence of negligence ; it would be negligence for him to drive his car right on and run into him, as a matter of course.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">- \u2022'[If you find that it did, then you come to the matter of damages, \u00e1nd that is simply a matter of dollars and cents. You \u00bfan only give to this man the money value of his wife\u2019s life to him. Of course, it is somewhat difficult for you to determine what that is. You have, however, the circumstances in life of these parties, you have the age of the parties\u2014perhaps not the age of the husband, but you have the husband before you\u2014you see what sort of a.man he is, you have the age of the wife. What is the money value of her life to him ? It is not a question of sentiment; it is a question of pecuniary compensation. I can give you very little aid. You must, of course, be cautious and conservative; you must not allow yourselves to be carried away by any considerations which are not proper in the case <em>\u00a1 </em>but in the exercise of a calm judgment, determine what the damages should be, if you conclude, under the instructions that I have given you, that damages should be awarded in this case.] [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-9\">Defendant presented this point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Under the pleadings and evidence in this case, the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Refused.

The substance of the matters complained of in the assignments was that the evidence did not establish negligence on the part of the defendant, and that the charge relating to the measure of damages was inadequate. Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s assignments we fail to detect any error in the refusal of the court to affirm the only point presented for its consideration, or anything in the excerpts from the charge which can be characterized as erroneous instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
