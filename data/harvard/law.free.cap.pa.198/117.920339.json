The person receiving the paper joined with him the other two defendants, and the three contracted in writing to give an option on the land to other persons at an advance in price over the agreement with plaintiff, but did not reveal to plaintiff the names of the purchasers. Shortly afterwards plaintiff notified the principal defendant that he had revoked the power to sell the property given to him in the agreement, and thereafter gave an option to another party to purchase the land. The defendants filed a bill in equity against plaintiff for specific performance, which bill was dismissed because the terms of the sale were never fully understood and agreed upon by the parties ; because the terms of the sale were not reduced to writing and signed by the party to be charged; and because the plaintiffs in the equity suit were not in court with clean hands. The evidence in the trespass suit showed that the plaintiff admitted substantially that it made no difference to him who became the purchaser so that he received the sum mentioned in the agreement. The evidence also showed that the principal defendant thought tha.t he had an option under his agreement with plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was not sufficient to establish the charge of conspiracy to defraud, and that a nonsuit was properly entered</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b141-9\">Argued Oct. 23, 1900.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AA2\">Appeal, No. 97, Oct.

Before Frazer, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-4\">At the trial the court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off, Frazer, J., filing the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">In this action in trespass the plaintiff alleges in his statement that the defendants on or about August 8, 1892, \u201c falsely and maliciously conspired, combined, confederated and agreed together to cheat and defraud the said plaintiff of his moneys, goods and chattels and other property, and to do other dishonest, malicious and unlawful acts to the prejudice of plaintiff,\u201d for which damages are asked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-6\">From the testimony it appears that the plaintiff was on August 8, 1892, and still is the owner of a farm situated in Lincoln township, now borough of Port View, containing about 134 acres; that on August 8, 1892, by an agreement in writing, the plaintiff placed the exclusive sale of the property for sixty days in the hands of S. O. Lowry, one of the defendants, who was at the time engaged in business as a real estate broker in the city of McKeesport, the price of the farm being fixed in the agreement at $13,000, payable $5,000 on delivery of deed, and balance in instalments to suit purchaser; one per cent commission to be paid to Lowry in the event of a sale. On September 29, 1892, within the sixty days, Lowry paid to Pollock $100, and received the following receipt:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-7\">\u201c McKeesport, Pa., Sept. 29,1892.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-8\">\u201c Rec\u2019d of S. O. Lowry one hundred dollars on account of first payment on within agreement, balance of first payment $4,900, four thousand nine hundred dollars, to be paid when deed is ready for delivery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-9\">\u201c W. O. Pollock.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-10\">At the time of this payment the name of the purchaser was not given to Pollock, nor did he ask for his name. The title papers were given to Lowry by plaintiff for the purpose of having a deed and mortgage drawn and the title to the farm examined. On the last day of December, 1892, at the request of John W. Stewart, one of the defendants, the plaintiff served notice to quit on the tenant occupying the farm, and on January 3, 1893, plaintiff and Stewart had a conversation at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>office occupied by the defendants, in regard to the deferred payments and the rate of interest to be paid by the purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">Previous to this time, in conversations had between the plaintiff and Lowry, the latter frequently, when asked by plaintiff in regard to the sale of the farm, replied, \u201cIf those people don\u2019t take it, we will; \u201d but at no time was the name of the supposed purchaser given by Lowry or demanded by Pollock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">Between August 8, 1892, and December 12, 1892, Lowry gave options upon the property and also agreed to sell it to different parties; a sale, however, was not consummated under any of his agreements. On December 12,1892, the defendants, Lowry, Stewart and Wylie, contracted in writing to sell and convey the farm to A. Chaudon and II. C. Crawford \u201c upon ten days\u2019 notice at any time on or before April 1, 1893,\u201d at $250 per acre if Chaudon and Crawford should on or before that time elect to \u201c take and accept said tract of land under this option.\u201d This option was extended to June 1, 1893, and on May 27, 1893, Chaudon and Crawford notified defendants of their acceptance of the property under their option, and paid to defendants $50.00 on account of the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">On January 9, 1893, Pollock notified Lowry that he had revoked the power to sell the property given to him August 8, 1892, declared off all negotiations, and tendered back to him the $100 paid September 29, 1892, as purchase money; and on April 21,1893, optioned the property to F. H. Coursin for fifteen days at the price or sum of $16,500. On May 6,1893, Coursin in writing elected to purchase the property under his option \u201c as soon as you [Pollock] are in a position to make a good and sufficient deed therefor to me in fee simple.\u201d No deed therefor was tendered to Coursin by Pollock until February, 1897, almost a year after the filing of the master\u2019s report in the equity case hereinafter referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-9\">Lowry denied Pollock\u2019s right to annul the agreement, refused to accept the $100, and on January 16, 1893, tendered to Pollock in cash the sum of $4,900; demanded a deed and offered to execute and deliver a bond and mortgage for the deferred payments in accordance with the contract of August 8, 1892; Pollock refused to accept the money and make a deed. On April 25, 1893, the defendants herein filed a bill in equity in the court of common pleas No.l, at No. 393, June term, 1893, against Pollock, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>alleging they had become the purchasers , of his farm under the agreement of August 8, 1892, and praying for specific performance. That case was referred to a master, who recommended a decree dismissing the bill, giving three reasons therefor:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-5\">\u201c (1) Because the terms of the sale were never fully understood and agreed upon by the parties; (2) because the terms of the contract of sale were not reduced to writing and signed by the party to be charged, and (3) because the plaintiffs are not in court with clean hands.\u201d The master\u2019s report was approved by the court,' and the bill dismissed at the plaintiff\u2019s costs. Thereupon Pollock brought this suit for damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-6\">At the trial, after hearing plaintiff\u2019s evidence, defendants\u2019 counsel asked for adjudgment of compulsory nonsuit for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-7\">1. As to John W. Stewart and J. R. Wylie because there is no evidence that they conspired with any one to defraud plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-8\">. 2. Also for a nonsuit as regards all of the defendants, because, whatever may be the construction placed on the agreement of August 8, 1892, it was revoked by the plaintiff on January 9, 1893. Up to that time there had been no sale of plaintiff\u2019s farm; all that existed at that time were negotiations. Lowry was not bound to inform plaintiff of these negotiations any more than he did, either before or at the time when he revoked the contract; nor did the plaintiff make any inquiry as to any of the details in relation thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-9\">3. There is no evidence as to any damage at all to the plaintiff, prior to the filing of the bill. In fact, he had contracted to sell to Coursin for $16,500, and presumably if he had, under his contract, tendered his deed within a reasonable time after the decre\u00e9, he could have collected that sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-10\">4. There can be no recovery here for any damages resulting from the filing of the bill; and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-11\">\u25a0 5. If the plaintiff had any claim against the defendants by reason of any action of theirs, he was fully advised in relation to the facts prior to or during the pendency of the bill in equity; it was then his duty to have his whole cause adjudicated in the proceedings in equity, and he cannot now be heard to raise this question, because when equity acquired jurisdiction, it acquired jurisdiction for all purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>A nonsuit was granted and the motion to take off same is now before us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim is that the agreement of August 8,1892, w'as simply a contract of agency to sell the farm, while the defendants contend that it was intended to be an option.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\">On its face the agreement is undoubtedly a contract of agency, but it seems to us that it was considered by both Pollock and Lowry as an option. The testimony of Pollock throughout shows great anxiety on his part to dispose of his farm to any person who would pay his price therefor. In 1890, a contract to sell the farm was given to Lowry in which the price was fixed at $12,000 ; some time after the expiration of that contract another was given in which the price was fixed at $12,500. No purchaser was obtained under these contracts, and a third agreement, that of August 8, 1892, was executed by Pollock and Lowry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-6\">Under the last agreement Lowry and the other defendants were exceedingly active in their endeavors to procure a purchaser ; Lowry advised Pollock from time to time that he expected to consummate the sale, and upon several occasions told him that if the prospective purchasers failed to purchase, \u201c we will take it ourselves.\u201d Sui'ely Pollock understood by that language that Lowry and some one associated with him contemplated becoming purchasers of the farm under certain contingencies at the price named in the contract of August 8. He also had conversations with Stewart about the sale and the terms of payment, and at Stewart\u2019s request notified the tenant to quit, and at the trial of this case admitted substantially that it made no difference to him who became the purchaser, so that he received $13,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-7\">While we concur in the conclusions reached in the equity case, that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain a decree for specific performance, we are unable to find from the facts adduced by the testimony and the reasonable inferences deducible therefrom anything that indicates that the defendants \u201c falsely and maliciously conspired, combined, confederated and agreed to cheat and defraud plaintiff.\u201d Lowry thought he had an option on the farm and was using his best endeavors to sell the property, of course at an advance above the price named in his option, and would probably have been successful had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>his authority to sell been revoked by Pollock. That Lowry\u2019s construction of the agreement of August 8, 1892, was erroneous is undeniable, but his error in that respect did not amount to fraud, and what his liability would have been to Pollock in the event of a sale to Chaudon and Crawford at $250 per acre does not arise in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\">After a careful examination of the testimony and the authorities submitted by counsel, we are still of the opinion that the plaintiff failed to make out a case against defendants. The motion to strike off the nonsuit is therefore overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-6\">The exhibits A, B, C, D, E and F mentioned in the opinion of the Supreme Court were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">\u201c Exhibit A.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-8\">\u201cArticles of agreement made and concluded this 8th day of August, A.

Stewart, 10 S. &amp; R. 222; Laverty v. Vanarsdale, 65 Pa. 507; Hood v. Palm, 8 Pa. 237; Haldeman v.

That was the punishment which the law imposes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>This case must stand upon the analogy of an action for malicious prosecution: Muldoon v.
