Testatrix left to survive her three sons, Porter Charles, the appellant, James W. and Harry T. Friend, three granddaughters and two sisters. A large portion of the estate was given to her sons, James W. and Harry T. The provisions of the will are stated in the opinion of the court below. The will was prepared by William Bake-well, an attorney, without any oral consultation with Mrs. Friend, but from a letter of instruction from her. Owing to Mr. Bakewell\u2019s age and illness this letter was not found or pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>duced. After the preparation of the wil], Mr. Bakewell mailed it to Mrs. Friend, and several days later she executed it at the office of the Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Company without its being read to her in the presence of the subscribing witnesses and Mr. Bakewell. After the execution of the will it was left at the trust company, and testatrix immediately drove to the office of her son, James W., and left the receipt for it with him. The will had been read by James W. Friend before its execution, and he had arranged with Dr. McClellan, his personal friend, to act as subscribing witness, and that his mother should meet Dr. McClellan at his office and take him to the trust company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">James W. Friend had the exclusive control and management of all his mother\u2019s property, receiving all income and disbursing it. Mrs. Friend lived with her son Harry T. Friend, and her son James W. Friend, lived close by. At the hearing the contestant produced evidence which to some extent tended to prove the circumstances enumerated by him as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">(a) The sole control and management by James W.

Friend, the decedent, died on March 25, 1898, leaving to survive her three children, James W., Harry T. and Porter C. Friend, and three children of a deceased daughter, Mrs. Mary Maxwell\u2014Mary P., Hannah W. and Margery Maxwell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-8\">By a testamentary paper executed on June 10, 1896, when she was about seventy years of age, and admitted to probate by the register, she disposed of an estate valued by appellant at $409,000 and by the appellees at $260,000, as follows: $70,000 to the Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Company, $87,500 thereof in trust for the Maxwell children, the income of $20,000 to Porter C. Friend for life, with remainder to J. W. and Harry T. Friend, the income of $12,500 to Agnes Friend, the wife of Porter C. Friend, for life, with remainder to James K. Friend, their son, and the residue of the estate to J. W. and II. T. Friend.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-9\">Porter C. Friend appealed from the decision of the register admitting the will to probate, alleging that James W. Friend procured it to be made by undue influence, and prays for an issue to determine the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-10\">The estate disposed of by the testatrix was given by the will of her father to trustees for her benefit during life, with power of appointment by her. James W. Friend had some years prior to her death been appointed and acted as one of the trustees. His relations with his mother were very intimate; he was c\u00f3nsul ted by her in all business affairs, and acted as her agent and confidential advisor. And it is claimed by the appellant that, under the rule laid down in Miller v. Miller, 187 Pa. 574, the burden is upon him to rebut the presumption of undue influence. One of the syllabi of that case is as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-11\">\u201c In a contest over a will in which a son is largely preferred, if it appears that the son, although not the father\u2019s attorney, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>his trusted and confidential agent, the burden of proof is on the son to rebut the presumption of undue influence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">We do not think it was the intention of the Supreme Court there to hold, as the syllabus quoted indicates, that in the absence of testimony tending to show that the mental faculties of the testator were impaired, the burden of sustaining the will would be cast upon a son standing in a confidential relation to the testator who received a large portion of the estate. If so, the rule would be more unfavorable to him than to a stranger receiving a large testamentary gift and standing in a confidential relation\u2014as it is only where a testator is shown to be of weak mind that the burden is cast upon him to sustain the will: Coleman\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 487, and cases there cited. See also Scattergood v. Kirk, 195 Pa. 195, and Logan\u2019s Estate, 195 Pa. 282.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">The rule laid down in Miller v. Miller, supra, seems to be a departure from that in Caldwell v. Anderson, 104 Pa. 199, where it is held that the presumption of undue influence which might arise against a stranger did not, under the same circumstances, arise against a near relative of the testator who wrote the will and was the principal beneficiary under it. What was said in Miller v. Miller upon this question should be construed in the light of the facts of that case, and it appears from the opinion in Miller\u2019s Estate, 179 Pa. 645, that an important factor in granting an issue in that case was the fact that there was evidence from which the jury might find that the testator\u2019s mental faculties were greatly impaired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\">If, then, in this case, there is no evidence from which a jury could find that the mental faculties of the testatrix were impaired, the burden is upon the appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-8\">The testimony adduced by him on this subject, principally from two witnesses, Anna and Mary Maxwell, is substantially that the decedent was very nervous, subject to nervous headaches, had two attacks of St. Vitus\u2019 dance; that she read juvenile papers; that she had a failure of memory (without, however, giving instances), and lost interest in things and became \u201cmore indifferent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">Doctor McClelland, who was her attending physician for fifteen years, testified that she was nervous, that he didn\u2019t treat her for that but for indigestion ; that her death was caused by a tumor of the kidneys ; that he witnessed the will; that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>understood what she was doing, and had great firmness and strength of will up to the time of her death, \u201cremarkable in that respect,\u201d and that her mind was clear. And Wm. Bake-well, Esq., who prepared this and three other testamentary papers for her, testified: \u201c I always regarded her as a woman amply competent to take care of herself, a woman of strong opinions, and always disposed to have her views carried out. That is my general idea of her characteristics.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">The evidence of appellant, standing by itself, does not appear to show any impairment of the decedent\u2019s mental faculties, and there can be no question, under all the evidence, that there was none. So that the burden of proof is upon the appellant to show undue influence. He relies first, upon the inequality and discrimination in the will in favor of James W. Friend and H. T. Friend. It appears, however, from the testimony of Porter C. Friend, the appellant, that there were reasons for the discrimination against him. He with his wife and child had lived with his mother until 1888, and for some years prior thereto had used liquor excessively. In 1888 he left his mother\u2019s house, and gave the following account of his reasons for leaving:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">\u201c There never had been a word about my drinking with my mother. About that time I realized the fact that I shouldn\u2019t drink and I determined to abstain entirely from the use of liquors. At the time I wasn\u2019t drinking any; I was making a battle to avoid that, when my mother said to me alone on the back porch, \u2018 Son, if you ever take to drinking again, you will have to leave my home. I will take charge of your wife and your boy until such time as that habit has been overcome.\u2019 That was the only statement. I left the Ixouse that day, Mr. Schoyer. I felt hurt; I suppose my pride was hurt; and I didn\u2019t go back.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">He says that he reformed subsequently, but there is no evidence that he ever visited or saw his mother after he left her home, except once when she visited him at the St. Charles, until a few days prior to her death. His wife and son remained with and were supported by her until that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">It was very natural that Mrs. Friend, by reason of Porter\u2019s conduct, should prefer her other children to him, and she evidexxced such a preference as early as October 31,1882, by a will of that date in which she made substantially the same provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>for him as in the one in dispute, but much more liberal provisions for his wife and child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">Her only daughter, on June 16, 1870, married, without her. mother\u2019s consent, Edward L. Maxwell. Subsequently she and her daughter became reconciled, and she was on friendly terms with her until the daughter\u2019s death, and with the Maxwell children until her death. There is no evidence, however, that she forgave Mr. Maxwell, and she made careful provisions in two wills made subsequently to the marriage to prevent him from receiving any part of her estate. By the will of 1882, the estate was divided into four parts, three equal\u2014the income of one equal part being given to Mrs. Maxwell under a separate use trust; by a codicil made in 1890, subsequent to Mrs. Maxwell\u2019s death, the share given her was given to James W. and Harry T. Friend in trust for her three children, with remainder to the survivors, if any died without issue before arriving at the age of twenty-five, and if all so died, with remainder to James W. and Harry T. Friend. As under the will admitted to probate the Maxwell children and Porter 0. Friend\u2019s wife and child receive much less than under the codicil of 1890, it is evident that Mrs. Friend\u2019s feelings towards them had changed, but there is no evidence that this change was produced by undue influence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">The paper in dispute contains a provision relieving James W. Friend from accounting as trustee of the decedent, and it is alleged that he had conducted the business so that he was liable for breaches of the trust, and that he exercised undue influence over his mother to procure this provision for his protection. The trust business seems to have been managed as a family affair, not complying strictly with the rules of law, but it is not clear that it was conducted so as to make J. W. Friend liable. However, in one of the transactions complained of, Mrs. Friend herself made a profit of $10,000, and she certainly would not want that questioned. There had been a proceeding in court against her brother, Theodore Wood, who was her trustee under her father\u2019s will, with the result of which she was very much dissatisfied \u2014 thinking he had been harshly treated; and it appears from her declarations to J. W. Friend that she desired to protect him from trouble of that kind and \u2022 made this provision for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>It also provides for the forfeiture of the share of any of the parties in interest who should contest her will. It appears from the testimony of II. T. Friend, that this provision was made because she anticipated that Porter C. Friend would contest it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\">Neither of these provisions, considering them from the point of view of the decedent, seems to be unreasonable; and the fact that James W. and Harry T. Friend were consulted about them would not justify the inference that they were the result of undue influence. Nor is there anything in the circumstances surrounding the preparation and execution of the will indicating it. William Bakewell, Esq., who prepared all of the testamentary papers made by decedent, testified that it was prepared from instructions received from her, his impression being that they were in a letter; that he sent the will to her, and that she subsequently brought it to the office of Mr. Jackson, president of the Fidelity Title and Trust Company; that he there wrote a short addendum to the will, and that it was signed by her and witnessed by him, Dr. McClelland and Mr. Jackson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">Although the evidence shows that James W. Friend is a forceful man, with strong will power, it also shows that his mother was no weakling, but a woman of strong mind and will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">If the burden of proof be upon the contestant, we are clearly of the opinion that, under all the evidence, a verdict against the will could not be sustained. If, however, it be upon the proponent, any presumption of undue influence as to the provision made for Porter C. Friend is rebutted by his own evidence, showing that there were reasons for the discrimination against him. And, as a will may be partially sustained (Rudy v. Ulrich, 69 Pa. 183; Griffin\u2019s Estate, 9 Pa. Dist. Rep. 248), a verdict in his favor could not stand. But as to the Maxwell children and Porter C. Friend\u2019s wife and child, the evidence does not show why the provisions in the will in dispute are less favorable to them than they were in the testamentary paper of 1890. And as to them, if the burden be upon the proponents, a verdict in their favor might perhaps be sustained. They, however, although made parties to the proceedings, have not joined in this appeal, and do not request an issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">This appeal must therefore be dismissed and the request for an issue refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>Error assigned </em>was decree, dismissing appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-5\"><em>S.

Mitchell, 101 Pa. 495, and Armor\u2019s Est., 154 Pa. 517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-6\">If the burden of proof be upon appellant to show undue influence, he has assumed that burden and produced that which would justify a jury in findMg a verdict against the will: Herster v. Herster, 116 Pa. 625; Miller\u2019s Est., 179 Pa. 645; Montgomery Web Co. v. Dienelt, 133 Pa. 585.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-7\">The court below erred in finding as a conclusion of law that in the absence of testimony tending to show that the mental faculties of the testatrix were impaired, the burden of sustaining the will would not be cast upon a son standing in a confidential relation who received a large portion of the estate, and that therefore the burden of proof in this case was on appellant : Caldwell v. Anderson, 104 Pa. 199; Scattergood v.

Miller, 187 Pa. 572; Caldwell v. Anderson, 104 Pa. 199; Yardley v. Cuthbertson, 108 Pa. 395; Jones v. Simpson, 171 Mass. 474 ; Higginbotham v. Higginbotham, 106 Ala. 314; Herster v.

It plainly appears in the evidence that the testamentary capacity of the decedent was unimpaired when she executed the will in question. That she was a person of more than ordinary firmness and will power, and that she possessed these qualities while she lived, is also apparent in the testimony. It was not a characteristic of her nature to allow her children to dominate or influence her against her best judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">On due consideration of the testimony, and of the clear and satisfactory opinion of the learned judge of the orphans\u2019 court, we affirm the decision of the register and dismiss the appeal at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
