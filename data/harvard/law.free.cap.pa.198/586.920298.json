Philadelphia and West Chester Traction Company.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"ALZ1\">Before Mitchell, Fell, Blown, Mestbezat and Potteb, JJ.</judges>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"ApUc\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-8\">Trespass for personal injuries. Before Hemphill, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-9\">At the trial it appeared that on March 22, 1899, at about 9 o\u2019clock in the evening, the plaintiff, who was a motorman in the service of the defendant, was injured in a collision between the car which he was operating and a car owned and operated by a firm of contractors who were engaged in ballasting the road. The accident was caused by the failure of the workmen of the contractors to set the danger signals after they ran into the block where the accident occurred. It appeared that the contractors were permitted by the railroad company to operate their ears at the same time that passenger cars were running. The movement of the contractors\u2019 cars was subject to the printed rules of the company and to the orders of the company\u2019s superintendent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-10\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-11\">[The defendant company is a corporation chartered under the laws of this state, giving it the right to operate a railroad for its own private advantage and profit; it is what is called a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>quasi-public corporation. It is liable, by reason of the privileges thus conferred upon it by the laws of the state, to the performance of certain duties, and among them that it must so conduct and operate the road which it has been chartered to build as to be safe and properly managed, both so far as concerns the passengers which it carries, and the employees which it employs; and it cannot absolve itself from the discharge of that duty\u2014the safe carriage, the safe conduct and safe operation of its line\u2014by allowing other parties to intervene, by leasing the rights to another party, or by employing or contracting with others to perform duties over or along its line. It has been shown here that a firm named Pepper &amp; Register entered into a contract with this defendant company for the ballasting at least of this road\u2014whether it had the complete construction of it, I do not know that it appears\u2014and they were at this time engaged in ballasting' the road. That was a perfectly lawful and legitimate contract for this company to enter into. But, as I said before, when it entered into that contract with this independent contractor for the purpose of this work, it could not by so doing absolve itself from the duties that it owed to the public and to those that use, whether as employees or passengers, the cars on their road. So that if there was negligence on the part of Pepper &amp; Register, so far as this case is concerned, I say to you that it was the negligence of the defendant company; in other words, that it was negligence which they were responsible for, and of which they could not free themselves by any contract that they might make with Pepper &amp; Register, because it was a duty that was implied in their acceptance of their charter, to be discharged for the public weal, for the public good, and in the interest of the public.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-5\">[ If on the other hand, however, you do not believe the testimony produced here to satisfy you that these rules were abrogated verbally, and that they were not being observed, then the second question will arise, has the plaintiff here satisfied you that even with these rules, this accident was brought about through the negligence of the company in not seeing that these rules were observed by their conductors, by permitting the operation of their road for which they were responsible in such a manner as to entail the injuries here complained of.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALe\">Defendant presented these points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>2. </em>The contract of the defendant with Pepper <em>&amp; </em>Register was one which the defendant had a right to make, and the defendant cannot be held responsible for the negligence of the employees of Pepper &amp; Register in carrying out such contract. <em>Answer: </em>This, as a whole, I refuse. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">3. If the accident which caused the injury to the plaintiff was occasioned by the employees of Pepper &amp; Register in carrying out said contract, Pepper &amp; Register alone are responsible for the consequences. <em>Answer: </em>This point I also must refuse. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\">4. By entering and continuing in the employ of the defendant with knowledge that the employees of Pepper &amp; Register were running their ballast cars over the same track, the plaintiff assumed the risks of all negligence on the part of said employees, and cannot recover if the accident was caused by their negligence. <em>Answer: </em>That point is also refused. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-7\">5. The plaintiff admits he knew the ballast cars of Pepper &amp; Register were running upon the railroad under the same rules and regulations as the passenger cars. That was, therefore, one of the risks he assumed by remaining in the employ of the defendant, and he cannot recover if the injuries resulted from the negligence of the employees of Pepper &amp; Register. <em>Answer: </em>That is also refused. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-8\">6. It was not negligence in the defendant to commit and entrust the management of his signals to the employees of Pepper &amp; Register while they were running and operating their stone cars. <em>Answer: </em>That point is true as it is stated, but not if the inference to be drawn from it is, that they were relieved from . responsibility or liability thereby. It was not negligence merely to entrust them, but it did not relieve them from any liability or responsibility for negligent acts of Pepper and Register\u2019s employees. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-9\">7. The failure to signal the occupancy of the block where the accident happened, being the act of the employees of Pepper &amp; Register, the defendant is not liable for the consequences of such accident. <em>Answer: </em>That point also refused. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-10\">8. Under all the evidence the plaintiff cannot recover. <em>Answer : </em>That point is also refused.

Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The plaintiff, while in the employ of the defendant as a motorman on a single track electric railway, was injured in a collision between his car and a car owned and operated by contractors who were engaged in ballasting the roadbed with broken stones. The road was operated by a block system with electric signals, which were set by the men in charge of the cars. The collision resulted from the failure of the contractor\u2019s workmen properly to adjust a signal after entering a block. The defendant operated its road before the ballasting was finished, and its passenger cars and the contractor\u2019s construction cars were in use at the same time, but the movement of all cars was expressly subject to the printed rules of the company, and to the orders of its superintendent. One of these rules allowed the running of the contractor\u2019s cars in the same block as passenger cars subject to certain restrictions as to notice, the distance cars should be kept apart, allowing passenger cars the right of way, and the operation of signals by those in charge of the forward car. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">It is conceded by the appellant that the plaintiff and those whose negligence caused the accident were not fellow workmen. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Its denial of liability is based on three grounds. (1) that it is not responsible for the negligence of independent contractors ; (2) that it was not negligent in entrusting the operation of its signals to the employees of its contractors; (8) that the plaintiff, by remaining in its service with knowledge of the manner in which the signals were operated, assumed the risk of injury from that cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">It is unnecessary to determine whether the contract was an independent one, or whether the company could absolve itself from liability in regard to so vital a matter as the operation of its signals, by delegating it to its contractors. The contract related to the construction of the roadbed, and if independent it was so only as to the doing of that work; the operation of the signals was not as an independent matter entrusted to any one, but remained in the charge of the company. The use of the tracks was under the direct control of the company\u2019s superintendent, who retained and exercised the right to direct the management of the cars and signals. In all matters incident to the use of the track, the contractors and their workmen represented the will of the company, and its responsibility remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The plaintiff could not be charged with contributory negligence in remaining in the service of the company after the contractors were allowed to use its track. The ordinary risk of his employment was slightly increased, as it would have been if more passenger cars had been used, but the additional use of the track presented no obvious danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
