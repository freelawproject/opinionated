Akron, Canton &amp; Youngstown Ry. Co. v. U. S., 261 U.S. 184, 195, 43 S.Ct. 270, 67 L.Ed. 605 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-19\">The Commission did not ignore the criteria set out in the foregoing statute, but, instead, carefully considered all of the requisite factors. It determined that the carriers were equally efficient and their respective services of equal importance to the public. It noted that neither carrier was a weak line or in financial distress. It noted that L. &amp; N. was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>originating carrier and Southern (and its subsidiaries) the delivering line. After considering all of the statutory factors and others within the catch-all provision of Section 15(6),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> except the relative costs, and concluding that they were of equal weight as among the parties with respect to the question at issue here, the Commission gave primary weight to the relative costs of the carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u201cThe weight to be given to any of the factors enumerated in the statute must necessarily depend upon the case under consideration, and the evaluation of the importance of the various factors is peculiarly within the purview of the Commission.\u201d Boston &amp; M. R. v. United States, 208 F.Supp. 661 (D.Mass.1962), aff\u2019d 371 U.S. 261, 83 S.Ct. 117, 9 L.Ed.2d 95 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Having determined comparative costs to be a factor of especial importance, the Commission then carefully considered all of the evidence relating to costs, determined the fully distributed costs of each carrier, and adjusted the division of rates accordingly. The ultimate facts found are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">To be sure, cost accounting is not an exact science. \u201cThe appraisal of cost figures is itself a task for experts * * New York v. United States, 331 U.S. 284 at 328, 67 S.Ct. 1207, at 1231, 91 L.Ed. 1492 (1947). But we do not perceive it was inexpertly done, nor have we the power to substitute our fact appraisal for that of the Commission. Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1009(e); Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1950); Carolina Scenic Coach Lines v. United States, 58 F.Supp. 801, 804 (W.D.N.C.1944), aff\u2019d 323 U.S. 678, 65 S.Ct. 277, 89 L.Ed. 550 (1944); United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, Inc., 327 U.S. 515, 536, 66 S.Ct. 687, 90 L.Ed. 821 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">With much ingenuity, counsel for Southern has attempted to find questions of law where there are none. The Commission has acted neither capriciously nor arbitrarily, nor has it misinterpreted or misapplied the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Counsel may present an appropriate judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-20\">.
