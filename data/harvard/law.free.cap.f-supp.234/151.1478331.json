Jurisdiction in this Court is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1336, 28-U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2321-2325, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284,. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 305(g) and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7, 1009(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-23\">This case arises out of the third attempt by the motor carriers to regain the-Bismarck-Mandan to the Twin Cities leg of butter traffic from North Dakota to the-east coast which they lost to a through, rail rate to the east in 1959. The motor-carriers, through their joint publishing-agent, plaintiff Middlewest Motor-Freight Bureau, filed tariffs effective October 20, 1962, setting a rate of 50 cents: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>per hundredweight on a 40,000 pound minimum load. This rate was to apply only as a proportional rate on shipments moving from the Twin Cities to the east by rail. The rate was protested by a railroad committee, and an oral hearing was held, the matter having been designated Investigation and Suspension Docket M-16602. On June 24, 1963, Division 2 of the Commission issued an Order and Report holding that the rate had not been shown to be just and reasonable and ordering it cancelled. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition for reconsideration was denied, as was a second petition for reconsideration or further hearing. Plaintiffs then filed a petition seeking a finding that an issue of general transportation importance was involved, which finding would have entitled the plaintiffs to a reconsideration by the full Commission. This was denied and plaintiffs, having exhausted their administrative remedies, brought the instant proceeding. On March 18, 1964, a temporary restraining order was issued which suspended the Commission\u2019s Order of June 24, 1963, pending a determination of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">The \u201cFinal Order\u201d of the Commission before this Court for review is the Report of Division 2 of the Commission issued June 24, 1963. The scope of review of a Commission ruling is, of course, limited.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a rate ease, matters \u2022of cost are important and they are solely for the judgment of the administrative agency. Illinois Commerce Commission v. United States, 292 U.S. 474, 481, 54 S.Ct. 783, 78 L.Ed. 1371 (1934). The plaintiffs here do not attack the Commission\u2019s conclusions as to cost evidence; rather they assert that the approach the Commission used was incorrect and that the Commission failed to take account of the National Transportation Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\"> The Interstate Commerce Act directs that charges made for motor carrier service be \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d and declares unlawful \u201cunjust and unreasonable\u201d charges. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(d). It is this standard by which proposed rates are judged and the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the proposed rate is just and reasonable. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 316(g). All parties agree that an essential element of a just and reasonable rate is that it be compensatory. This is basic to the Commission\u2019s approach to rate making. See, e. g., Gypsum Board from Kansas City to Chicago, 304 I.C.C. 125 (1958). The function of this Court in the instant proceeding is to determine whether or not the Commission\u2019s finding that the proposed rate is not compensatory should be affirmed. If so, as Judge Magruder has said, \u201cit will follow that the Commission\u2019s ultimate conclusion rejecting the [proposed rate] must also be sustained, for it seems quite clear that it lies within the discretion of the Commission to reject a rate as unlawful which does not provide a return of out-of-pocket costs to the carriers.\u201d Boston and Maine R. R. v. United States, 153 F.Supp. 952, 957 (D.Mass.1957). Plaintiffs have urged that the Commission failed to take into account the National Transportation Policy and particularly 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 15a(3). But in view of the Commission\u2019s finding that the proposed rate was not compensatory, such considerations were unnecessary. The cases cited by the plaintiffs to support their argument as to the National Transportation Policy are inappropriate because in these cases the Commission either specifically found the proposed rate compensatory, St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. v. United States, 207 F.Supp. 293 (E.D.Mo.1962); Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 203 F.Supp. 629 (E.D.Mo.1962), or at least that it \u201cwould equal or exceed by a very small margin the estimated out-of-pocket costs,\u201d Boston and Maine R. R. v. United States, 202 F.Supp. 830 (D.Mass.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">To be compensatory, a rate must equal out-of-pocket costs. I. C. C. v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 372 U.S. 744, 748, 83 S.Ct. 1038, 10 L.Ed.2d 108 (1963). Out-of-pocket costs have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>defined as the \u201cadded costs necessary to carry a particular class of traffic over a particular route,\u201d Note, 73 Harv.L.Rev. 762, 763 (1960), which summarizes the Commission\u2019s view.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">At the hearing the plaintiffs produced statements indicating \u201cthe out-of-pocket costs of transporting a 40,000 pound shipment of butter from Bismarck, N. D., to Twin Cities, Minnesota,\u201d (Exhibits 12, 13) and supporting evidence (Exhibits 11, 14 and related testimony). The Commission, analyzing the plaintiffs\u2019 cost figures, concluded that they \u201care defective in certain respects.\u201d 321 I.C.C. 386, 389. It then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">The costs developed by the proponents are so slightly below the proposed rate, that consideration of the understatements in those costs referred to above unavoidably leads to the conclusion that they are not shown to be compensatory. Ibid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Such a finding was well within the province of the Commission, and reflects a permissible application of the statutory standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the proposed rate would not be compensatory is unjustified because the plaintiffs would be \u201cbetter off\u201d from a net revenue standpoint at the new rate than they are carrying grain from North Dakota to the Twin Cities, which is the present type of eastbound traffic. They contend that the proposed rate is thus compensatory regardless of whether it equals out-of-pocket expenses (though they do not necessarily concede that the proposed rate does not equal out-of-pocket expenses) _ It is the Commission\u2019s failure to use a. net revenue test to determine compensativeness which the plaintiffs claim is the-defect in the Commission\u2019s report. The motor* carriers would be \u201cbetter off\u201d at the proposed rate than carrying grain, because grain is a commodity exempt from Interstate Commerce Commission-rate regulation under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(b) (6).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">\u201cThe exemption of motor vehicles carrying \u2018agricultural (including horticultural) commodities (not including manufactured products-thereof)\u2019 was designed to presence for the farmers the advantage of low-cost motor transportation. See especially 79 Cong.Rec. 12217. The victory in the Congress for the exemption was recognition that the price which the farmer obtains for his products is greatly affected by the cost of transporting them to the consuming market in their raw state- or after they have become marketable by incidental processing.\u201d East-Texas Motor Freight Lines v. Frozen Food Express, 351 U.S. 49, 51, 76 S.Ct. 574, 576, 100 L.Ed. 917 (1956).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">To base rates on regulated items on a net revenue comparison with items exempt from rate regulation would ignore-the standards of compensativeness of rates used by the Commission and approved by the courts,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and could lead to-destructive rate-making.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">The plaintiffs have failed to produce authorities supporting their view that a rate is compensatory though it does not cover out-of-pocket costs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Though courts should be alert to make certain that no statutory requirement is overlooked, the administrative rate-maker has broad discretion to establish standards by which the statute is applied. Certainly the cost evidence in the case presents a rational basis for the Commission\u2019s conclusion as to non-compensativeness, and \u201calthough the Commission under some circumstances may permit a carrier to establish a rate not proved to cover out-of-pocket costs, it is not required to do so.\u201d Davis <em>&amp; </em>Randall, Inc. v. United States, 219 F.Supp. 673, 677 (W.D.N.Y.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The plaintiffs raise three procedural points;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">1. The findings of the Commission are inconsistent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">2. There should have been a hearing examiner\u2019s report;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">3. The plaintiffs\u2019 petitions for reconsideration and further hearing should have been granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">1. This argument is based on the plaintiffs\u2019 view that a rate must be compensatory if the plaintiffs will be \u201cbetter off\u201d with it than without it. But in view of our holding that the Commission reached a permissible conclusion on the issue of compensativeness, plaintiffs\u2019 argument must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">2. The defendant Commission argues that this objection was not raised before the Commission and so should not be considered here. This court has previously indicated that an administrative agency should be given the initial \u25a0opportunity to correct its alleged error. Hart v. I. C. C., supra, 226 F.Supp. at p. 643. Moreover, the process of decision in the instant proceeding involved the reaching of conclusions based on documentary evidence. The facts in evidence were not disputed; the argument was over the conclusions to be drawn from them, and there was no question of the credibility of witnesses. In such a situation, Judge Devitt, speaking for this court, has said, \u201c[W]e think the failure to have the hearing examiner make a report is not error requiring a reversal or vacation of the agency\u2019s order.\u201d Canadian Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 158 F.Supp. 248, 257 (D.Minn. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">3. Plaintiffs\u2019 position on this point seems to be that the plaintiffs originally followed a Commission recommendation as to cost formula and after the Commission found the recommended method embodied understatements, the plaintiffs should have been given a further hearing to show that it also embodied overstatements which outweighed the understatements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By their own admission, plaintiffs had ample opportunity to attack the Commission\u2019s cost formula before the order, and the briefs to the Commission and portions of the record indicate that they used this opportunity. So their objection would seem to be not so much that the Commission should have granted the petition for reconsideration but that it should have, at some point, considered plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. A full scale rule-making proceeding would seem a more appropriate place for such considerations and such a proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>ing is, in fact, taking place at the present time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">We have considered the arguments and briefs of counsel and all the files and records herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We conclude that plaintiffs are not entitled to judgment setting aside the Commission Order of June 24, 1968, in Investigation and Suspension Docket M-16602 and are not entitled to judgment permanently enjoining the Commission from enforcing or attempting to enforce said Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The complaint of plaintiffs is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">. Cf. Hart v. I. C. C., 226 F.Supp. 635, 641 (D.Minn.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">. \u201c[Out-of-pocket expenses are] those expenses which are added by an increase, or reduced by a decrease in traffic, can be directly assigned to specific traffic movements, and are directly affected by the use of carrier facilities. The remaining, or constant expenses, are those incurred in connection with traffic as a whole, which over a period of time, are unaffected by any increase or decrease in traffic volume, and as they are not capable of direct assignment, must be fairly apportioned.\u201d New Automobiles in Interstate Commerce, 295 I.C.C. 475, 500 (1945).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-15\">. See, e. g., Malone Freight Lines, Inc. v. United States, 204 F.Supp. 745, 755 (N.D.Ala.1962); Boston and Maine R. R. v. United States, 153 F.Supp. 952, 954 (D. Mass.1957); Chicago &amp; E. I. R. Co. v. United States, 107 F.Supp. 118, 125, 128 (S.D.Ind.1952), aff\u2019d 344 U.S. 917, 73 S.Ct. 346, 97 L.Ed. 707 (1953) (Per Curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\">. Interwoven in this third objection is the argument that the Commission\u2019s actions constituted a change of standards with the plaintiffs following the old and judged by the new. This is apparently why E. Brooke Matlack, Inc. v. United States, 119 F.Supp. 617 (E.D.Pa.1954) is cited. Matlack was a certificate of public convenience and necessity case. The Commission had previously allowed applicants to show the broad needs for the particular service in the areas involved but denied the Matlack application partly because of a failure to adequately pinpoint needs of individual shippers. In setting aside the Commission\u2019s Order, the Court held that the carrier should have been given the opportunity to meet the revised standards. In the instant case the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed rate was based on suggestions made by a hearing examiner in a previous report hut the rejection by the Commission because of understatements does not necessarily reflect a change in standards by the Commission; rather it indicates that because of cost understatements the proposed rate did not meet out-of-pocket costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b220-26\">.
