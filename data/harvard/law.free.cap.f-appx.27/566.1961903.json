For the following reasons, the district court did not err in denying Oleson\u2019s motion to amend. Therefore, the denial of Oleson\u2019s motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b591-18\">On August 25, 1993, a jury convicted petitioner-appellant, Robert Oleson, of twenty-two counts of drug-related federal crimes. Oleson\u2019s convictions consisted of one count of conspiracy to distribute marijuana under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846; one count of aiding and abetting the possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; nineteen counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952; and one count of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. Based on these convictions, the district court sentenced Oleson to 300 months imprisonment. Oleson appealed his convictions and sentence. On appeal, we vacated the money laundering conviction, affirmed the remaining convictions, and remanded the case for resen-tencing. <em>United States v. Oleson, </em>44 F.3d 381 (6th Cir.1995), <em>overruled by United States v. Reed, </em>77 F.3d 139 (6th Cir.1996) (en banc). The vacatur of Oleson\u2019s money laundering conviction had no effect on the district court\u2019s resentencing \u2014 on June 15, 1995, final judgment was entered, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>again sentenced Oleson to 300 months imprisonment. Oleson did not directly appeal that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Oleson did challenge his convictions and sentence through alternate routes, however. On January 3, 1996, Oleson filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, citing six grounds for habe-as corpus relief. After making little progress, Oleson moved to \u201cwithdraw\u201d his ha-beas motion, and on December 11, 1996, the district court dismissed Olesoris \u00a7 2255 motion without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The voluntary dismissal did not mark the end of Olesoris challenges to his convictions and sentence. On April 18, 1997, Oleson refiled a \u00a7 2255 motion for habeas corpus relief. In that motion, he alleged several instances of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. Oleson also claimed that his property was seized in violation of the Fifth Amendment, that his baggage was unconstitutionally searched and seized, that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence, and that his money laundering conviction was retroactively misjoined with his other convictions. On September 24, 1999, a magistrate judge issued a Report and Recommendation advising the district court to deny Olesoris habeas motion. On December 3, 1999, Oleson filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s order. On Thursday, July 20, 2000, the district court approved the magistrate judge\u2019s order, over Olesoris objections, and denied Ole-soris \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Approximately a month before the denial of Olesoris habeas motion, on June 26, 2000, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">In a motion postmarked Friday, July 21, 2000, and received by the district court on Monday, July 24, 2000, Oleson sought to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion to include a challenge to his convictions based on the <em>Ap-prendi </em>decision. Because Olesoris motion to amend was postmarked a day after the denial of his habeas motion, and received four days after the habeas denial, the district court dismissed Oleson\u2019s proposed amendment. Oleson subsequently appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas motion and his motion to amend. This court granted Oleson a certificate of ap-pealability on only one issue: whether the district court erred in denying Olesoris motion to amend. This issue is now before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AAe\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">A district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a habeas corpus motion is governed by Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242 113 (explaining that an application for a writ of habeas corpus \u201cmay be amended or supplemented as provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions\u201d); <em>Hodges v. Rose, </em>570 F.2d 643, 649 (6th Cir.1978) (\u201cAmendment of a petition for habeas corpus is governed by \u2018the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242). Here, where Oleson seeks to amend his habeas motion to challenge his convictions based on the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>decision \u2014 and not to have his pleading conform to evidence presented at trial \u2014 Rule 15(a) applies. <em>Compare </em>FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a) <em>with </em>FED. R. CIV. P. 15(b). Rule 15(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-13\">A party may amend the party\u2019s pleadings once as a matter of course at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial calendar, the party may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served. Otherwise a party may amend the party\u2019s pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and <em>leave of court shall be freely given when justice so requires</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">As its text makes clear, Rule 15(a) mandates that a court freely grant leave to amend when justice so requires. FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a); <em>Crawford v. Roane, </em>53 F.3d 750, 753 (6th Cir.1995). In evaluating the interests of justice, courts consider several factors, including \u201cundue delay in filing, lack of notice to the opposing party, bad faith by the moving party, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments, undue prejudice to the opposing party, and futility of amendment.\u201d <em>Coe v. Bell, </em>161 F.3d 320, 341 (6th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Brooks v. Celeste, </em>39 F.3d 125, 130 (6th Cir.1994)). Furthermore, courts have interpreted the language in Rule 15(a) as setting forth a \u201cliberal policy of permitting amendments to ensure the determination of claims on their merits.\u201d <em>Marks v. Shell Oil Co., </em>830 F.2d 68, 69 (6th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Tefft v. Seward, </em>689 F.2d 637, 639 (6th Cir.1982)). In furtherance of that principle, this Circuit has acknowledged that, in general, a Rule 15(a) motion should not be evaluated purely on timeliness grounds. <em>Coe v. Bell, </em>161 F.3d at 342 (explaining that \u201cdelay by itself is not sufficient to deny a motion to amend\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Duffus, </em>174 F.3d 333, 337 (3d Cir.1999) (explaining that \u201cordinarily delay alone is not a basis to deny a motion to amend\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">With these interests-of-justiee concerns in mind, a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend is generally reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Coe, </em>161 F.3d at 341 (reviewing a denial of a motion to amend a habeas petition for an abuse of discretion); <em>Hodges, </em>570 F.2d at 649 (\u201cThe grant or denial of a motion for leave to amend under Rule 15 is within the sound discretion of the District Court, and will be reversed only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d). This Circuit has explained that a district court abuses its discretion where it \u201cfails to state the basis for its denial or fails to consider the competing interests of the parties and likelihood of prejudice to the opponent.\u201d <em>Moore v. City of Paducah, </em>790 F.2d 557, 559 (6th Cir.1986). Despite the general applicability of the abuse of discretion standard of review, it does not govern every aspect of a Rule 15(a) motion. For instance, in <em>Parry v. Mohawk Motors of Michigan, Inc., </em>this Circuit held that the futility of proposed Rule 15 amendments is evaluated <em>de novo. </em>236 F.3d 299, 306 (6th Cir.2000) (\u2018We generally review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion. However, when the district court\u2019s decision is based on a legal conclusion that the proposed amendment would be futile, we review the denial of the motion to amend <em>de novo.\u201d) </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Here, the district court denied Oleson\u2019s motion to amend because the motion to amend was filed after the district court denied Oleson\u2019s underlying \u00a7 2255 motion. Apparently, the district court believed that a Rule 15(a) motion cannot, as a matter of law, be brought after a \u00a7 2255 habeas motion is denied. To date, this Circuit has not recognized that principle as a rule of law. Rather, we have emphasized that Rule 15 seeks to ensure that cases are . decided on their merits. <em>See, e.g., Tefft v. Seward, </em>689 F.2d 637, 639 (6th Cir.1982) (\u201cThe thrust of Rule 15 is to reinforce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>principle that cases should be tried on their merits rather than the technicalities of pleadings.\u201d). And, in furtherance of this principle, we have, on rare occasion, allowed Rule 15 amendments after judgment is entered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it does not appear that we have ever allowed an amendment to a \u00a7 2255 motion after the \u00a7 2255 motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">We need not determine whether the allowance of such an amendment is permissible here because the motion to amend is futile and would be barred even if it were timely. Oleson\u2019s proposed amendment is subject to the \u00a7 2255 one-year statute of limitations affirmative defense. <em>See Dunlap v. United States, </em>250 F.3d 1001, 1004 (6th Cir.2001) (holding that the one-year bar contained in \u00a7 2255 acts as an affirmative defense and not a jurisdictional bar). Oleson\u2019s July 24, 2000 amendment is not timely because it was filed more than one year after the June 15, 1995 entry of judgment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and more than one year after the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) became effective on April 24, 1996.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see also United States v. Craycraft, </em>167 F.3d 451, 456 (8th Cir.1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>(holding that the AEDPA one-year statute of limitations applies to amendments to \u00a7 2255 motions). Nor do other exceptions to the \u00a7 2255 statute of limitations apply to save Oleson\u2019s claim. Of particular note is that \u00a7 2255 116(3)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not save Ole-son\u2019s amendment because that exception applies only to rights recognized by the Supreme Court that are retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review and <em>Apprendi </em>did not recognize retroactively applicable rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See In re Clemmons, </em>259 F.3d 489, 492-93 (6th Cir.2001) (barring a second \u00a7 2255 motion which sought to retroactively apply <em>Apprendi </em>because was not retroactive in effect). Finally, Oleson\u2019s amendment does not escape the AEDPA statute of limitations by \u201crelating back\u201d to previous claims \u2014 Oleson\u2019s amendment raises an entirely new argument. <em>See generally </em>FED. R. CIV. P. 15(c); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>221 F.3d 430, 436 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201c[A] party cannot amend a \u00a7 2255 petition to add a completely new claim after the statute of limitations has expired.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Although we evaluated Oleson\u2019s amendment for futility, which is a component of the interests-of-justice analysis, we neither apply nor reject the interests-of-justice approach here. Rather, we affirm the district court\u2019s opinion because both alternatives lead to the same result. If, as a matter of law, it is correct to bar a Rule 15(a) motion to amend after the underlying \u00a7 2255 motion is dismissed, then the district court was correct in denying Oleson\u2019s motion to amend. Similarly, if it is correct to apply an interests-of-justice analysis, Oleson\u2019s motion to amend would still be denied due to its futility. Because both alternatives lead to the same result, we affirm the district court\u2019s opinion without deciding the question of whether a Rule 15(a) motion is barred, as a matter of law, once the underlying \u00a7 2255 motion is denied. For those reasons, the district court\u2019s order denying Oleson\u2019s motion to amend is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-5\">. <em>See Saalfrank v.
