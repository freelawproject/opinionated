The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Rodriguez-Rodriguez to 96 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, his attorney has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>An-ders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-20\">Counsel argues that the district court should have granted a downward departure; however, counsel did not move for one below, and we conclude that the district court did not plainly err in declining to grant a departure sua sponte. <em>See United States v. Montanye, </em>996 F.2d 190, 192 (8th Cir.1993) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-21\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal upon our independent review pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-16\">. The Honorable Mark W.
