We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition <em>de novo. See Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Rivera contends that he was entitled to equitable tolling of the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations because his first attorney abandoned his case after nine months of the limitations period had passed, leaving his replacement attorney with only two months in which to timely file Rivera\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Equitable tolling of the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations is appropriate only where extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time. <em>See Calderon v. United States Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. of Cal. (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled on other grounds by Calderon v. United States Dist. Court for Cent. Dist. of Cal. (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530, 540 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">We have recognized equitable tolling of the AEDPA\u2019s limitations period in situations where external forces, rather than a petitioner\u2019s lack of diligence, are the cause of the petition\u2019s untimeliness. <em>See Miles, </em>187 F.3d at 1107 (equitably tolling AEDPA where prison authorities failed to follow prisoner\u2019s request to draw filing fee for habeas petition from his trust account and mail his check and petition to district court for filing); <em>Calderon (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d at 541-42 (equitably tolling AEDPA because of district court\u2019s stay preventing petitioner\u2019s counsel from filing a timely habeas petition and because of petitioner\u2019s alleged mental incompetence). We have refused, however, to toll the AEDPA\u2019s limitations period based on an attorney\u2019s negligence. <em>See Frye v. Hickman, </em>258 F.3d 1036, 1038 (9th Cir.2001) (refusing to toll the AED-PA\u2019s statute of limitations where petitioner\u2019s retained attorney negligently failed to file a habeas petition within the limitations period); <em>cf. Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990) (holding in Title VII context that attorney\u2019s ordinary negligence does not warrant equitable tolling).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Here, Rivera\u2019s attorneys\u2019 failure to file a petition within the AEDPA\u2019s limitations period did not amount to an extraordinary circumstance beyond Rivera\u2019s control. Rather, Rivera\u2019s attorneys\u2019 failure to file a petition constitutes ordinary attorney negligence. Therefore we conclude that Rivera is not entitled to equitable tolling of the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b881-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
