Jones argues that under this court\u2019s <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir.2000) <em>(Whalem/Hunt II), </em>his petition is timely because the unavailability of AEDPA in the prison law library constitutes an \u201cimpediment\u201d under AEDPA or warrants equitable tolling. We agree that in light of <em>Whalem/Hunt II </em>Jones\u2019 claim may be meritorious, and so reverse and remand for farther factual development.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">Proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>informa pauper-is, </em>Jones filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in federal district court on July 6, 1998. Jones\u2019 conviction became final prior to the passage of AEDPA, and so he had until April 24, 1997 to file his petition. <em>See Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2001). However, Jones filed a state habeas petition with the California Supreme Court on April 21, 1997 \u2014 three days before AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations would otherwise have run \u2014 thus tolling the statute until the California Supreme Court rejected his petition. The California Supreme Court denied Jones\u2019 petition on November 24, 1997. Absent a finding of an \u201cimpediment\u201d under AEDPA or absent equitable tolling, the one-year statute of limitations would have run before Jones filed his federal habeas petition the following July. The magistrate judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>recommended that Jones\u2019 federal habeas petition be rejected as untimely under AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Jones filed an objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendations, arguing for the first time that he had not been aware of AEDPA. In his objection, Jones asserted that he later heard about AEDPA from another inmate. Jones then sent an \u201cinmate request for interview\u201d form to the library asking, \u201cI would like to know what is the AEDPA enactment. There is not any posting. Thank you.\u201d A library staff person replied in a memo dated January 14, 1998, \u201cwhat is AEDPA, I have not (sic) idea. Please explain.\u201d There is nothing in the record before us indicating whether Jones responded to the request for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">After reviewing Jones\u2019 objection, the magistrate judge issued a Supplemental Report confirming the original findings and recommendation that Jones\u2019 petition be rejected. On March 31, 2000, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s findings and recommendations. Quoting from this court\u2019s panel opinion, <em>Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>204 F.3d 907, 909 (9th Cir.2000) <em>(Whalem/Hunt </em>I) the court stated, \u201cPetitioner\u2019s claim that he lacked notice of the AEDPA does not explain his failure to file a timely petition between the time his conviction became final and the expiration of the limitation period.\u201d Relying on a correct understanding of the law as it then stood, the court denied Jones\u2019 application for habeas corpus as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Jones timely appealed. In the interim, this court issued its <em>en banc Whalem/Hunt II </em>opinion, explaining that a court errs in dismissing a habeas petition that alleges impediment and equitable tolling without first allowing factual development of those claims. Petitioner Anthony Lewis Whalem/Hunt had asserted, in a declaration appended to his opposition to a motion to dismiss, that his petition was timely because the prison library did not contain AEDPA until more than two years after AEDPA\u2019s passage. In <em>Wha-lem/Hunt II, </em>we held that the assertion warranted further development. Here, Jones\u2019 allegation is even stronger than Whalem/Hunt\u2019s. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Jones also argues that the district court violated his right to procedural due process by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing regarding his claim that his medical condition warranted equitable tolling. Because the district court acted within its discretion in determining that Jones\u2019 allegations of medical problems, even if proven true, would not entitle him to equitable tolling, the court was not obligated by due process to hold an evidentiary hearing. Jones\u2019 due process rights were thus not violated with respect to his claim based on his medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b761-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publi- ' cation and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
