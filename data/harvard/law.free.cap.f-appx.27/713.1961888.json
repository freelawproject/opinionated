Henderson appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the Western District of Missouri after he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1). The district court sentenced Henderson to 180 months imprisonment and five years supervised release. Counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Henderson should have received a lower sentence because he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of ammunition, not to being an armed career offender. Henderson has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>cussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">To the extent Henderson is arguing that his sentence was too harsh, there is no jurisdictional basis for review. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (grounds for appeal of sentence by defendant). Moreover, the district court did not plainly err in sentencing him as an armed career criminal, because he did not argue below \u2014 nor does he argue on appeal \u2014 that he is not an armed career criminal, and his prior burglary and aggravated-assault convictions (for which he received multi-year prison sentences) are qualifying convictions. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) (prohibiting felons from possessing ammunition or firearms), 924(e)(1) (15-year minimum sentence for person who violates \u00a7 922(g) and has 3 previous convictions for \u201cviolent felony\u201d or serious drug offense), 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii) (\u201cviolent felony\u201d means any crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding 1 year that has as element use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against person of another, or is burglary); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4131.4(a) (defendant who is subject to enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e) is \u201carmed career criminal\u201d); <em>DeRoo v. United States, </em>223 F.3d 919, 926 (8th Cir. 2000) (reviewing for plain error district court\u2019s inclusion of predicate conviction for purposes of Aimed Career Criminal Act where inmate did not raise argument below).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We have reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-16\">. The Honorable Howard F. Sachs, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
