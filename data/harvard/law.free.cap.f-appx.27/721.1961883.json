Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Larsen v. Mayo Med. Ctr., </em>218 F.3d 863, 866 (8th Cir.) (standard of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>view), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1036, 121 S.Ct. 625, 148 L.Ed.2d 534 (2000), and the District Court\u2019s application of Minnesota law, <em>see Boerner v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>260 F.3d 837, 841 (8th Cir. 2001) (standard of review), we agree that the action is time-barred, and we affirm, addressing seriatim Stangel\u2019s various arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Specifically, (1) Stangel\u2019s conclusory assertion that he established issues of material fact is not properly before us, <em>see </em>8th Cir. R. 28A(j) (party may not incorporate by reference contents of brief filed elsewhere), and neither is his continuous-representation argument, <em>see Schafer v. Moore, </em>46 F.3d 43, 45 (8th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (declining to address argument first raised on appeal); (2) Stangel does not develop his equitable-tolling argument, <em>see Primary Care Investors Seven, Inc. v. PHP Healthcare Corp., </em>986 F.2d 1208, 1212 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that an unargued assertion of error is no more helpful to appellate court than unsupported allegation of fact is to trial court); (3) even if Stangel had been permitted to amend his complaint to add a fraudulent-concealment claim, the alleged concealed information was not knowledge that he had to have before \u201casserting his right,\u201d see <em>Cohen v. Appert, </em>463 N.W.2d 787, 790-91 (Minn.Ct.App.1990) (discussing and applying fraudulent-concealment doctrine in context of legal-malpractice action); (4) the District Court\u2019s notation of Stangel\u2019s prior lawsuits was not an indication of any bias against him, <em>cf. Bannister v. Delo, </em>100 F.3d 610, 614 (8th Cir.1996) (indicating that bias can be shown if judge\u2019s remarks or opinions reveal such high degree of antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible), cer<em>t. denied, Bannister v. Bowersox, </em>521. U.S. 1126, 117 S.Ct. 2526, 138 L.Ed.2d 1026 (1997); and (5) the District Court properly declined to rule on Stan-gel\u2019s mediation motion while it considered defendants\u2019 earlier motion for summary judgment, which had asserted the time-bar defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-16\">. The Honorable Ann D. Montgomery, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
