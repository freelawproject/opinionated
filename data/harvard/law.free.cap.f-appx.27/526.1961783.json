The case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Shephard sued the Governor of Ohio, the head of the Department of Corrections, and several correctional employees, alleging that the defendants subjected him to unconstitutional conditions of confinement. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, concluded that Shephard had not exhausted his administrative remedies, and dismissed the case. Shephard has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Shephard\u2019s claims for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a suit for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). <em>Curry v. Scott, </em>249 F.3d 493, 503 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Shephard did not exhaust his administrative remedies for any of his claims. Under \u00a7 1997e(a), a prisoner must exhaust all of his available administrative remedies before filing a \u00a7 1983 action in federal court, <em>Brown v. Toombs, </em>139 F.3d 1102, 1103-04 (6th Cir.1998), and the prisoner has the burden of demonstrating that he has exhausted these remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 1104. Before the district court adjudicates any claim set forth in the plaintiffs complaint, the court must determine that the plaintiff has complied with this exhaustion requirement. <em>Id. </em>To establish that he has exhausted his administrative remedies pri- or to filing suit, a prisoner should attach to his \u00a7 1983 complaint any decision demonstrating the administrative disposition of his claims or describe with specificity the administrative proceeding and its outcome. <em>Knuckles El v. Toombs, </em>215 F.3d 640, 642 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1040, 121 S.Ct. 634, 148 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). \u201cIn the absence of particularized averments concerning exhaustion showing the nature of the administrative proceeding and its outcome, the action must be dismissed under \u00a7 1997e.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Shephard has not demonstrated that he exhausted his administrative remedies for his claims. He has not presented any evidence or averments reflecting that he ever attempted to pursue his claims through the Ohio prison administrative review process. While Shephard asserts that he has raised his complaints in numerous letters to prison and public officials, a prisoner must utilize the formal grievance process provided by the state; he cannot comply with the requirements of \u00a7 1997e(a) by informally presenting his claims. <em>Freeman v. Francis, </em>196 F.3d 641, 644 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Accordingly, this court affirms the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">We also note that Shephard is a frequent and abusive litigant in this court and the district court. In November 1999, the court for the Southern District of Ohio commented that Shephard had filed over 50 lawsuits since 1993, and the court determined that his \u201cconduct constitutes a persistent campaign of harassment of this Court and its personnel by the filing of frivolous litigation.\u201d Consequently, the court revoked Shephard\u2019s pauper status and directed the Clerk to not file any papers tendered by Shephard, unless he received prior judicial authorization. <em>In re: Alonzo Dean Shephard, </em>No. MC-3-99-025 (S.D.Ohio Nov. 1, 1999) (Rice, C.J.). We encourage the district court in the future to follow this procedure before processing Shephard\u2019s cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">Further, we have determined that this court must take additional injunctive action against Shephard because, despite the district court\u2019s November 1999 order, She-phard continues to pursue frivolous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>vexatious litigation. A review of this court\u2019s docket reveals that, since the time of the district court\u2019s order, Shephard has filed eight separate appeals with this court, many of which subsequently were dismissed for want of prosecution. In an effort to stem this tide of litigation, this court enjoins Shephard from filing further appeals, without first satisfying the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). While this court cannot absolutely foreclose an individual from initiating an action or pursuing an appeal in federal court, <em>Ortman v. Thomas, </em>99 F.3d 807, 811 (6th Cir.1996), the court may impose prefiling restrictions on an individual with a history of repetitive or vexatious litigation. <em>Feathers v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>141 F.3d 264, 269 (6th Cir.1998); <em>Ortman, </em>99 F.3d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Therefore, the court finds that, pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), Shephard is precluded from pursuing any further civil action or appeal in forma pauperis, unless he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d In order to comply with this requirement, Shephard shall file with this court for any future appeal a pleading entitled \u201cApplication Pursuant to Court Order Seeking Leave to Proceed In Forma Pauperis under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).\u201d This application must be filed within ten days after Shephard files a notice of appeal. The application shall: 1) contain specific factual allegations demonstrating that Shephard is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury;\u201d and 2) describe the relationship between the alleged danger and the claims contained in the underlying complaint. Failure to submit this application or to comply strictly with the terms of this injunction will result in summary dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Upon timely receipt of a complete application, the clerk of the Sixth Circuit shall direct the clerk of the appropriate district court to transmit the record of the underlying case. No further proceedings shall take place in this court, nor shall any other filings be accepted, until this court has reviewed the application and the record to determine whether Shephard meets the .requirements of \u00a7 1915(g). If this court concludes that the application fails to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 1915(g), the court will deny Shephard pauper status or revoke his pauper status.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">This procedure shall govern any appeals in this court filed by Shephard until such time as the court may order otherwise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
