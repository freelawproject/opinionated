The case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In 2000, Rosas-Galvez pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The district court sentenced Rosas-Galvez to 57 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release, and the court imposed a $100 special assessment. In this timely appeal, Rosas-Galvez\u2019s counsel has filed a motion to withdraw and a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which she argues that the district court improperly sentenced Rosas-Galvez. Ro-sas-Galvez has not responded to his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. After Rosas-Galvez filed his notice of appeal in this case, the district court entered an amended judgment, in which the court reduced Rosas-Galvez\u2019s term of imprisonment to 28 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">We note that Rosas-Galvez has waived any challenge to his conviction and sentence. In his plea agreement, Rosas-Galvez specifically waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence. A defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal contained in a plea agreement normally is valid and will preclude review of an issue on appeal. <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>239 F.3d 761, 764-65 (6th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Bazzi, </em>94 F.3d 1025, 1028 (6th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Allison, </em>59 F.3d 43, 46 (6th Cir. 1995). Since this case presents no unusual circumstances which would justify excusing the waiver, review of Rosas-Galvez\u2019s issue on appeal is precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Accordingly, this court grants counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirms the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
