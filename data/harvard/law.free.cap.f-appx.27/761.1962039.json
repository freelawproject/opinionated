Cook appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 33 motion for a new trial. Following a jury trial, Cook was convicted on five counts of smuggling, importing and selling endangered red-kneed Mexican tarantulas, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545 and 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3372, 3373. We affirmed Cook\u2019s convictions, but remanded for resentencing in <em>United States v. Cook, </em>No. 94-50607 1996 WL 144224 *1-2 (9th Cir. Mar. 29, 1996) (unpublished disposition). We subsequently affirmed Cook\u2019s resentencing in <em>United States v. Cook, </em>No. 97-50205, 1998 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>879753 *1-2 (9th Cir. Dec. 16, 1998) (unpublished disposition). We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Rule 33 mandates that \u201ca motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence may be made only within three years after the verdict or finding of guilty.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 (1998). However, the district court denied Cook\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence because there was no newly discovered evidence. Cook filed his Rule 33 motion on February 3, 2000, almost six years after the jury verdict was entered on June 28, 1994. Because his motion was untimely, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion. <em>See United States v. Cook, 70S </em>F.2d 350, 351 (9th Cir.1983) (pre-1998 amendment case stating that Rule 33\u2019s time limitations are jurisdictional).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is vacated, and the case remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b785-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
