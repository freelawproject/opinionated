Moody\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), claiming there are no meritorious issues, but raising the following three claims at Moody\u2019s request: (1) whether the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary; (2) whether the district court erred by not reducing the offense level for his role in the offense; and (3) whether the court erred by not reducing the offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Although advised of his right to do so, Moody has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-28\">We have reviewed the record and find that the district court complied with all the mandates of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>accepting Moody\u2019s guilty plea. <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir. 1991). Accordingly, we find Moody\u2019s guilty plea knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">We find the district court did not err by declining to reduce the offense level for Moody\u2019s role in the offense or for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Terry, </em>86 F.3d 353, 358 (4th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 74 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Moody\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
