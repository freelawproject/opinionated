The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">McIntosh pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement on November 20, 2000. The probation officer thereafter issued the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), in which he calculated McIntosh\u2019s total offense level as 29, his criminal history category as V, and the resulting guideline range of imprisonment as 151 to 188 months. McIntosh filed objections to the PSR and requested a downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.13 and 5K2.16. The district court overruled McIntosh\u2019s objections, denied his request for a downward departure, and sentenced him at the upper end of the guideline range to 188 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In his timely appeal, McIntosh argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his request for a downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K2.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">A district court has the discretion to depart downward from the guideline range under \u00a7 5K2.13 if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity. However, the court may not depart below the applicable guideline range if (1) the significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">USSG \u00a7 5K2.13. A district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward generally is not reviewable, unless the district court mistakenly believed it did not have legal authority to depart downward. <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>179 F.3d 489, 500-01 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">In the instant case, the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward is not reviewable because the district court recognized its authority to do so. When denying the request for a downward departure, the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-13\">Now, at the time this offense was committed, [McIntosh] suffered, as the defendant says, a diminished mental capacity. But this was due to a voluntary drug addiction. While the Court can understand \u2014 is understanding of why that would happen, the Court cannot excuse the defendant. And it is no excuse. Because after the defendant\u2019s physician ceased to prescribe anymore Lorcet, the defendant obtained prescription drugs for his addiction. Also, the defendant was under influence of drugs under the instant offense. So based upon my knowledge of the record, I do not believe that Section 5K2.13 applies, and the petition for downward departure for that reason is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">(Sent.Tr., pp. 7-8).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
