The government\u2019s failure to disclose the agreement was improper, but does not rise to the level of \u201cflagrant misbehavior.\u201d <em>United States v. Kearns, </em>5 F.3d 1251, 1254 (9th Cir.1993). The district court did not err in denying dismissal of Nickson\u2019s indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Nickson additionally seeks a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G \u00a7 3El.l(a). Throughout three trials and up until his last interview with the probation officer, Nickson denied his involvement in the robberies, presenting a theory of mistaken identity. The district court found Nick-son\u2019s acceptance of responsibility to be half-hearted, and merely an attempt to obtain the two-level adjustment. The district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Gillam, </em>167 F.3d 1273, 1279 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">Finally, Nickson contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G \u00a7 3C1.1, because the letters he wrote to his ex-girlfriend were to urge her to testify <em>truthfully </em>on his behalf. Although he claims to have only written the letters to ask the prospective witness to testify as to the \u201ctruth,\u201d he clearly intended to do so through threats and intimidation. In response to Nickson\u2019s letters, the witness obtained a temporary restraining order. The district court did not err in applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. <em>See United States v. Scheele, </em>231 F.3d 492, 501 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b894-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
