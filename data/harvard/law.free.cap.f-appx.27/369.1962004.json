Penson appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his two habeas corpus petitions on statute of limitations grounds. Because the law has been clarified since the district court\u2019s decision to require consideration of the petitions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), rather than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) as determined by the District Court, we are constrained to reverse and remand for a decision as to timeliness under \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">Penson was convicted in Ohio state court in 1984 for various crimes, and was sentenced to three consecutive terms of imprisonment on December 27, 1984. After a protracted state court appeals process, including an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, the Ohio Supreme Court dismissed Penson\u2019s direct appeal on August 15,1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">On September 11, 1996, Penson filed a motion for resentencing in an Ohio trial court. On January 6, 1997, he filed a petition for a writ of procedendo in the Ohio court of appeals, asking that court to order the trial court to rule on Penson\u2019s motion for resentencing. The trial court dismissed Penson\u2019s motion for resentenc-ing on February 5, 1997, and the Ohio court of appeals denied Penson\u2019s petition for a writ of procedendo on March 11, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-19\">On July 22, 1997, Penson filed an application with the Ohio court of appeals for delayed reopening of his direct appeal pursuant to Rule 26(B) of the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure. Under Rule 26(B), a defendant has ninety days from the date of final judgment in which to file an application for delayed reopening based upon allegations of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel; otherwise, the defendant must show good cause for failing to file within the ninety-day time limit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>decision rendered December 22, 1997, the Ohio court of appeals denied Penson\u2019s application. The court noted that its judgment on direct appeal had become final on February 26, 1990, and that Penson\u2019s application for delayed reopening had not been filed until July 22, 1997, more than seven years later. The court rejected Penson\u2019s claim that his lack of legal training and experience established good cause for his failure to comply with Rule 26(B)\u2019s time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">On July 21, 1998, Penson filed the instant actions for habeas corpus relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. In a decision issued August 3, 1999, the district court dismissed Penson\u2019s habeas petitions, finding that they were barred by the one-year statute of limitations established by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). JA at 236-247. Specifically, the court found that Penson\u2019s state court petition for a writ of procedendo was not an \u201capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), and, as such, did not toll the one-year statute of limitations. JA at 239. The court further found that Penson\u2019s state-court application for delayed reopening was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2); thus, the court concluded that the pendency of that application did not toll AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. JA at 242. Finally, the court rejected as moot Penson\u2019s argument that he was entitled to equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. JA at 242-43. Accordingly, the court dismissed Penson\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">On August 17, 1999, Penson filed a motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). JA at 248-267. In a decision filed November 2, 1999, the district court denied Penson\u2019s motion. JA at 359-64. The court, however, granted Penson\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the narrow issue of \u201cwhether an application for delayed reopening under Ohio R.App. P. 26(B) is \u2018properly filed\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) when the Ohio Court of Appeals has decided that there is no good cause for the delay.\u201d JAat364.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The COA misconstrues the relevant issue on appeal. The language \u201cproperly filed\u201d appears only in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), which provides that the time during which a properly filed application for collateral review is pending shall not be counted toward the period of limitations. However, in an opinion decided after the COA was issued, we determined that a Rule 26(B) motion to reopen direct appeal is part of the direct appeal, as opposed to being part of collateral review. <em>White v. Schotten, </em>201 F.3d 743, 752 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 940, 121 S.Ct. 332, 148 L.Ed.2d 267 (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appropriate period of limitations in this circumstance is found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), which provides that a one year period of limitations applies to an application for a writ of habeas corpus. The limitation period runs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">This court recently held that the filing of a motion for a delayed appeal may toll the running of the one-year statute of limitations, however it does not cause the statute to begin running anew when the state court denies the motion. <em>Searcy v. Carter, </em>246 F.3d 515, 519 (6th Cir.2001). Furthermore, the statute of limitations is tolled only for that period of time in which the Rule 26(B) application is actually pending in the state court. <em>Bronaugh v. Ohio, </em>235 F.3d 280, 285 (6th Cir.2000). Pursuant to the holdings in <em>Searcy </em>and <em>Bronaugh, </em>it appears that petitioner\u2019s federal habeas petitions would be time barred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">We, however, cannot address this issue because we lack jurisdiction to do so. When the AEDPA applies, \u201ca court of appeals will address only the issues which are specified in the certificate of appealability.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Lyons v. Ohio Adult Parole Authority, </em>105 F.3d 1063, 1074 (6th Cir.1997), <em>overruled in part by Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). Therefore, we are constrained to REVERSE the decision of the district court and REMAND the case for a determination of timeliness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-14\">. Ohio R.App. P. 26(B)(1) states: A defendant in a criminal case may apply for reopening of the appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence, based on a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>counsel. An application for reopening shall be filed in the court of appeals where the appeal was decided within ninety days from journalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\">. At the time the parties submitted their briefs in this case, this Court's mandate in <em>White </em>had been stayed pending resolution of the state's petition for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in <em>White </em>on October 10, 2000, see 531 U.S. 940, 121 S.Ct. 332, 148 L.Ed.2d 267.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
