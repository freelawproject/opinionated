RApp. P. 34(a)(2). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-22\">Roger Lewis Grant, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, requests 1) a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition and 2) authorization to proceed <em>in forma pauperis (\u201cifp </em>\u201d). For the reasons stated below, we deny a COA, deny <em>ifp </em>status, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-23\">On April 26, 1996, an Oklahoma jury convicted Mr. Grant of one count of lewd molestation. The trial court sentenced Mr. Grant to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. Mr. Grant appealed his conviction to the Oklahoma Court of Crim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>inal Appeals (the \u201cOCCA\u201d). On January 9, 1997, the OCCA affirmed Mr. Grant\u2019s conviction. Mr. Grant declined to seek certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. On April 8, 1998, however, Mr. Grant did again challenge the validity of his conviction, this time filing a state post-conviction petition. On May 5, 1998, an Oklahoma trial court denied that state post-conviction petition. Mr. Grant responded with a May 7, 1998 state post-conviction petition in challenge to his sentence. The Oklahoma trial court denied that petition on the same day, May 7,1998. Mr. Grant elected not to appeal the denial of either of his state post-conviction petitions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">On November 29, 2000, Mr. Grant returned to the courts, this time by filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma. In his petition, Mr. Grant contended: 1) Oklahoma violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights via the denial of effective assistance of appellate counsel on his direct appeal to the OCCA; 2) Oklahoma violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights via the denial of effective assistance of trial counsel; 3) Oklahoma violated his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights via the denial of a fair and impartial jury; 4) Oklahoma violated his First Amendment rights via the prosecution\u2019s introduction of certain \u2018religiously privileged\u2019 testimony; and 5) Oklahoma violated his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights via prosecutorial misconduct. Perhaps sensing the time bar he faces, Mr. Grant included within his petition a passing reference to his \u201cActual Innocence.\u201d <em>See </em>Petition of Aplt. \u2014 Petitioner, at IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">The district court, incorporating a Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, denied relief and, implicitly, further denied Mr. Grant a COA. <em>See </em>General Order of Oct. 1, 1996 (10th Cir.) (directing that, where a district court does not explicitly rule on the COA issue, we will deem the COA denied). The district court denied the habeas petition by finding the petition time-barred under the one-year limitation period contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214) (\u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.\u201d). The district court began by observing that \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s one-year statute of limitation runs from the \u201cdate on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Here, the OCCA denied Mr. Grant\u2019s direct appeal on January 9, 1997. Though Mr. Grant did not seek certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, that option remained open to him until April 8, 1997. <em>See </em>Sup.Ct. R. 13(1) (establishing a ninety-day window during which a state court defendant may seek certiorari from a judgment in the state court of last result). Thus, Mr. Grant\u2019s conviction became final, for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(1), on April 9, 1997. <em>See Locke v. Saffle, </em>237 F.3d 1269, 1273 (10th Cir.2001) (recognizing that, where a state prisoner declines to pursue certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, \u201c[that] petitioner\u2019s conviction is not final ... until ... after the time for filing a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court has passed\u201d) (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>marks omitted). Given that Mr. Grant\u2019s conviction became final on April 9, 1997, Mr. Grant\u2019s habeas petition, absent tolling of \u00a7 2244(d)(l)\u2019s one-year statute of limitation, is untimely, and thus must be denied, if filed on or after April 9,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">The district court determined that tolling is applicable to Mr. Grant\u2019s habeas petition. Section 2244(d)(2) directs: \u201cThe time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under [\u00a7 2244(d)(1) ].\u201d Here, Mr. Grant filed two relevant state post-conviction petitions; Mr. Grant benefits from tolling in regard to each petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">Mr. Grant filed his first state post-conviction petition on April 8, 1998, the last possible day on which tolling could benefit Mr. Grant. Thus the period between April 8, 1998 and the Oklahoma trial court\u2019s May 5, 1998 denial of Mr. Grant\u2019s first state post-conviction petition is not counted against Mr. Grant. Also not counted against Mr. Grant is the period during which he could have sought appeal of the Oklahoma trial court\u2019s denial of that first post-conviction petition. <em>See Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 803-04 (10th Cir. 2000) (interpreting \u00a7 2244(d)(2)\u2019s \u201ctime during which [a petitioner\u2019s state post-conviction petition] <em>is pending\u201d </em>(emphasis added) to include the time period during which a petitioner may elect to appeal a denial of his or her post-conviction petition). Oklahoma statute provided Mr. Grant thirty days to file such an appeal, <em>see </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7 1087 (\u201cA final judgment entered under [the state post-conviction relief] act may be appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeals ... within thirty (30) days from the entry of the judgment.\u201d); since Mr. Grant declined to exercise that right, Mr. Grant\u2019s state post-conviction petition became final on June 4, 1998. Thus, on June 4, 1998, the \u00a7 2244(d)(2) tolling associated with that first state court petition ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">On May 7, 1998, Mr. Grant filed his second state petition for post-conviction relief. The Oklahoma trial court denied that petition on the same day, May 7,1998. As noted above, under Oklahoma statute, Mr. Grant then had thirty days in which to file an appeal from that denial of post-conviction relief. Since Mr. Grant again declined to exercise that right, Mr. Grant\u2019s state post-conviction petition became final on June 8, 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, on June 8, 1998, the \u00a7 2244(d)(2) tolling associated with Mr. Grant\u2019s second state court petition ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">In sum, pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), Mr. Grant\u2019s state post-conviction petitions tolled the \u00a7 2244(d)(1) one-year statute of limitation between April 8, 1998 and June 8, 1998. Since, absent tolling, April 8, 1998 was the final day on which Mr. Grant could have filed a federal habeas petition, and since the tolling period expired June 8, 1998, Mr. Grant\u2019s time in which to file his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>federal habeas appeal, in turn, expired on June 9,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Given the June 9, 1998 expiration date of the \u00a7 2244(d)(1) statute of limitation, and since Mr. Grant did not file his federal habeas petition until November 29, 2000, the district court found Mr. Grant\u2019s petition untimely. Finally, however, the district court considered the application of equitable tolling. Despite the silence of AJEDPA on this issue, we have held that \u00a7 2244(d)(1) is indeed subject to equitable tolling, though \u201conly in rare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Gibson, </em>282 F.3d at 808 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). One circumstance in which we may apply equitable tolling is when faced with a claim of \u201cactual innocence.\u201d <em>Gibson, </em>232 F.3d at 808 (\u201cEquitable tolling would be appropriate, for example, when a prisoner is actually innocent.\u201d). A necessary prerequisite to any application of equitable tolling, however, is a finding that \u201c[the] petitioner [has] diligently pursued] his federal habeas claims.\u201d <em>Gibson, </em>232 F.3d at 808; <em>accord Marsh v. Soares, 223 </em>F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]his equitable remedy is only available when an inmate [1] diligently pursues his claims and [2] demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Noting Mr. Grant\u2019s passing reference to his \u201cActual Innocence,\u201d the district court considered application of equitable tolling. The district court declined to apply equitable tolling for two reasons. First, the district court found that Mr. Grant had failed to diligently pursue his claims. Second, the district court found that Mr. Grant had failed to provide any factual basis in support of his claim of actual innocence. The district court rejected Mr. Grant\u2019s assertion that Oklahoma\u2019s denial of a trial transcript excused his failure to provide such a factual basis. <em>See Ruark v. Gunter, </em>958 F.2d 318, 319 (10th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (factual allegations are necessary to entitle a habeas petitioner to a free trial transcript). Thus, the district court declined to apply equitable tolling and, pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1), dismissed Mr. Grant\u2019s habeas petition as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Mr. Grant now seeks a COA in order to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal. Mr. Grant presses the same five allegations of error, this time expressly contending that his present claims are not time-barred pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Pursuant to <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam), we liberally construe Mr. Grant\u2019s allegations. To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Grant must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Mr. Grant may make this showing by demonstrating that the issues he raises are debatable among jurists, that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">Having reviewed Mr. Grant\u2019s request for a COA, his appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the appellate record, we conclude that Mr. Grant has failed to make the required showing for a COA. Accordingly, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s June 28, 2001 order and the Magistrate\u2019s April 18, 2001 Report and Recommendation incorporated therein, we DENY Mr. Grant\u2019s motion for a COA, DENY Mr. Grant\u2019s petition to proceed <em>iff, </em>and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1000-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judica-ta, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">. Mr. Grant later filed a number of additional state post-conviction petitions. Those petitions, however, are immaterial to our disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">. Thirty days from May 7, 1998 is actually June 6, 1998. However, June 6, 1998 was a Saturday. In Oklahoma, where a filing time limit concludes on a weekend, the petitioner may file on the next day on which the court is open: here, Monday, June 8, 1998. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 12, ch. 39, \u00a7 2006. In our case, the district court actually notes June 5, 1998 as the date on which Mr. Grant's second state post-conviction petition became final. <em>See </em>Dist. Ct. Order, dated June 28, 2001, at 2 (incorporating Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, at 4 n. 4). We take this to amount to a mere typographical error in an opinion otherwise notable for its thorough and well-considered treatment of Mr. Grant\u2019s claims. The three-day (one business day) error is, in this case, immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
