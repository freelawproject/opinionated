We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition as time barred. <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Medina\u2019s conviction became final on December 23,1996. Giving Medina credit for the time during which his habeas petition was pending in state court, the District court determined that the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations ran on September 9, 1998. However at the time that the district court ruled, it did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>262 F.3d 973, 974 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam). <em>Bunney </em>provides that pursuant to Rule 24 of the California Rules of Court, \u201ca decision of the [California] Supreme Court becomes final 30 days after filing.\u201d Applying <em>Bunney </em>to the present case, we determine that the statute of limitations did not run until October 30, 1998, and accordingly, Medina\u2019s petition, filed on September 25,1998, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"akz-dedup-0\">REVERSED and REMANDED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b832-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
