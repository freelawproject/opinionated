We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-17\">Hicks contends that the trial court denied him his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel by not granting his mid-trial request for counsel. Based on our review of the record, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-18\">Under the AEDPA, we may reverse a state court\u2019s decision denying relief only if that decision is \u201ccontrary to, or involves an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 944, 121 S.Ct. 340, 148 L.Ed.2d 274 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-19\">The state court determined that Hicks was thoroughly advised of the responsibilities and perils of waiving his right to counsel, discouraged from doing so, and warned that he could not change his mind about self-representation during trial. Indeed, the waiver petition submitted by Hicks and the trial court\u2019s extensive colloquy with Hicks support the determination that the waiver was knowing and intelligent. Because that determination is not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975) (holding that an accused seeking to represent himself must knowingly and intelligently relinquish the benefits associated with the right to counsel and should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation), the district court properly denied Hicks\u2019s petition. <em>Van Tran, </em>212 F.3d at 1154 (stating that for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), the Supreme Court need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>have addressed the identical factual circumstance in order to have created \u201cclearly established\u201d law).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b781-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
