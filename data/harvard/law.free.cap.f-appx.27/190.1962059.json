The district court sentenced Berry to 168 months in prison. Berry timely appealed, arguing that \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional. Berry\u2019s argument is that Congress intended the penalty provisions of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b) to be sentencing factors, so that a judge could determine the drug quantities attributable to a defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. Berry notes the holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be determined by the factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt. Based on <em>Apprendi, </em>Berry contends that \u00a7 841 has been void and therefore unconstitutional since its enactment with respect both to the acts deemed unlawful and to the penalties applicable to those unlawful acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">We affirm Berry\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Cernobyl, </em>255 F.3d 1215 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>(10th Cir.2001), the Tenth Circuit recently-rejected an argument virtually identical to Berry\u2019s. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s holding is consistent with the findings of other Circuits. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>253 F.3d 251, 256 n. 6 (6th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Brough, </em>243 F.3d 1078, 1080 (7th Cir.2001), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 203, 151 L.Ed.2d 144 (2001). We agree with our sister Circuits that Berry\u2019s argument lacks merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We therefore affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\">. The United States argues that, because Berry waived his appellate rights in his plea agreement, he waived his right to bring this appeal. Because Berry contends that he was convicted under an unconstitutional statute, the waiver provision does not preclude his bringing this appeal. <em>See Menna </em>v. <em>New York, </em>423 U.S. 61. 62-63 n. 2. 96 S.Ct. 241. 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975); <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>United States v. Richards, </em>204 F.3d 177, 191 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 826, 121 S.Ct. 73, 148 L.Ed.2d 36 (2000) (holding that a defendant may not waive his right to appeal a jurisdictional issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-17\">. Additionally, because Berry\u2019s 168-month sentence is less than the maximum sentence permitted by 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), there was no <em>Apprendi </em>violation in this case. <em>See United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
