On appeal, counsel moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and filed a brief arguing that the United States breached a promise to file a motion for downward departure for substantial assistance. Guzman-Fregoso filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing that his plea was unknowing and involuntary because he was induced to plead guilty by the government\u2019s promise to make such a motion, and that his counsel was ineffective. We reject these arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The plea agreement clearly preserved the government\u2019s discretion to determine whether Guzman-Fregoso provided substantial assistance, <em>see United States v. Romsey, </em>975 F.2d 556, 558 (8th Cir.1992), and he did not attempt to show the government\u2019s refusal was made in bad faith, was irrational, or was based on an unconstitutional motive, <em>see Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). In addition, Guzman-Fregoso gave assurances under oath at his plea hearing that he understood the government had discretion in determining whether to make a departure motion. His failure to attempt to withdraw his guilty plea precludes him from challenging its voluntariness on appeal. <em>See United States v. Murphy, </em>899 F.2d 714, 716 (8th Cir.1990). Guzman-Fregoso\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims are more appropriately presented in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Finally, following our independent review in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75,109 S.Ct. 346,102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-9\">. The HONORABLE MARK W.
