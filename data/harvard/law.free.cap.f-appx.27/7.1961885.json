Lara-Cruz pled guilty to the charge. Following a presentence report, the district court sentenced Lara-Cruz to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">On this appeal, Lara-Cruz raises two issues. First, he objects that the district court erred in computing his criminal history by including two criminal history points for his June 4, 1990, state court conviction and sentence on drug charges. Concededly, the two points were properly added unless the sentence was imposed \u201cmore than ten years prior to the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense. ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b) &amp; cmt. n. 2 (2000). No objection to the criminal history points was made at the time of sentencing, so our review is for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">The claim of plain error rests on Lara-Cruz\u2019s accurate assertion that he pled guilty to having been found in the United States on or about June 20, 2000, slightly more than ten years after the June 4, 1990, date on which he had originally been convicted and sentenced in state court on drug charges. The short answer is that the presentence report, to which no objection was taken, shows that Lara-Cruz originally reentered the United States in 1997 and resided in Providence until arrested in June 2000. Whether or not the offense of being \u201cfound in\u201d the United States is completed upon illegal entry or only upon arrest, Lara-Cruz\u2019s entry into the United States in 1997 was certainly the \u201ccommencement of the instance offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, cmt. n. 2, the defendant\u2019s illegal entry being a first step in thereafter being \u201cfound in\u201d the United States. <em>See United States v. Castrillon-Gonzalez, </em>77 F.3d 403, 406 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">Lara-Cruz\u2019s other objection stems from the fact that at sentencing, the district judge specified the sentence and then observed: \u201cAnd I will make a recommendation to the Bureau of Prisons, if it is at all possible, to place the Defendant in a facility near where his family resides.\u201d Apparently, the judgment of conviction omits such a recommendation. Lara-Cruz argues that this oral comment was a part of the sentence which controls any subsequent deviation in the written document, <em>see United States v. Muniz, </em>49 F.3d 36, 41-42 (1st Cir.1995), and that the district court should be instructed to incorporate the oral recommendation in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-14\">After questioning whether this court has any authority to review the district court\u2019s making or refusing to make a nonbinding recommendation concerning the place of confinement, <em>see United States v. Serafini, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>233 F.3d 758, 778 (3d Cir.2000), the government points out that the district court\u2019s own language reflected only a conditional intention and not an outright commitment. We agree that the district judge may have concluded that the recommendation was not feasible \u2014 a judgment we would have no basis for disturbing even if the matter were reviewable at all. Alternatively, the district court may simply have overlooked the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the district court but invite counsel for Lara-Cruz to call the district court\u2019s attention to the discrepancy so the district can if it so chooses, make the recommendation as to place of confinement.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
