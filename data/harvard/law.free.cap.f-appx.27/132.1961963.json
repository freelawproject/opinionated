Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), a district court \u201cmay reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant\u2019s subsequent substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person, in accordance with the guideline and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commissions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994.\u201d The record is clear that the District Court gave due consideration to the assistance provided by the defendant, determined that he did not provide substantial assistance as required by Rule 35(b), and exercised its discretion to sentence the defendant within the appropriate range provided by the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">This Court lacks jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward. See, e.g., <em>United States v. McBroom, </em>124 F.3d 533, 541 n. 9 (3d Cir. 1997); <em>United States v. Mummert, </em>34 F.3d 201, 205 (3d Cir.1994). Accordingly, appellate jurisdiction is lacking, and we dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
