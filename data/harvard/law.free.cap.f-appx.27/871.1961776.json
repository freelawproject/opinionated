On appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence at the high end of the applicable sentencing guideline range based on the likelihood of recidivism. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">We have jurisdiction because we construe Pierce\u2019s argument to be a challenge to the district court\u2019s compliance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). That section mandates a district court to consider enumerated factors \u201cin determining the sentence to be imposed.\u201d The district court\u2019s failure to consider these factors may constitute \u201ca violation of law\u201d that gives rise to appellate review under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Cervantes-Valenzuela, </em>931 F.2d 27, 29 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">Pierce contends that the court improperly focused on recidivism and failed to consider other sentencing factors mandated by \u00a7 3553(a). The record does not support that contention. Rather, the district court repeatedly acknowledged its responsibility to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court noted Pierce\u2019s background and reviewed the nature and circumstances of the offense, the seriousness of the crime, the need to provide adequate punishment, the need to deter future misconduct, the likelihood of recidivism, and the goals and purposes of the Act. The court concluded that \u201cin looking at all the factors, they all point to a top of the guideline sentence.\u201d Thus, the district court properly exercised its discretion by considering the factors mandated by \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">Moreover, even if the district court unduly focused orally on the recidivism factor, no violation of law occurred because \u00a7 3553(a) does not require an express explanation for the court\u2019s sentencing decision when the sentence imposed is within the guideline range and that range does not exceed twenty-four months. <em>See Cervantes-Valenzuela, </em>931 F.2d at 29 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1)). Furthermore, \u201c[sjimply because the court in this case chose to mention one particularly important factor does not mean that it failed to consider others or that the sentence was imposed in violation of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, we note that there is ample support for the district court\u2019s conclusion regarding recidivism. The record indicates that the court thoroughly reviewed Pierce\u2019s background, including his prior conviction for the same conduct, the substantial amount of evidence seized from his residence, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>numerous documented transmissions of pornographic images.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b896-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
