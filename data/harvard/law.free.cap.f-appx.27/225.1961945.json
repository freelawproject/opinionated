Byrd appeals the forty-six month sentence and concurrent twelvemonth sentence he received following his guilty plea to possession of cocaine base (crack) in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 844 (West 1999), and possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u00a7 5861(d) (1994). Byrd contends that the district court erred in applying <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3) (2000), in making an enhancement for reckless endangerment, USSG \u00a7 3C1.2, and in refusing to depart downward under USSG \u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Byrd was arrested after he ran a red light in full view of a marked police patrol car, and then led the police on a short chase at speeds exceeding seventy-five miles per hour. The chase ended when Byrd crashed his car. Byrd and a number of passengers in his car escaped without serious injury. Byrd was in possession of a small amount of crack. A rifle was found under the driver\u2019s seat. In connection with his plea agreement, Byrd stipulated that he was the driver of the car, that the rifle had been in his possession and had previously traveled in interstate commerce, and that it was not registered to him. The rifle stock had been shortened so that the overall length of the weapon was twenty-one inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination as to the guideline applicable to the firearm offense. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>202 F.3d 212, 218 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>530 U.S. 1236, 120 S.Ct. 2675, 147 L.Ed.2d 286 (2000). Here, \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3) clearly applied to Byrd\u2019s conviction for the firearm offense. Subsection (a)(3) applies to violations of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) where, as in this case, the offense involved a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) and the defendant had at least one prior felony conviction for a crime of violence. Moreover, Byrd stipulated that he had possessed the firearm. The cases Byrd relies on are inapposite because they deal with weapon enhancements under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). We find that the district court did not err in determining Byrd\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">The district court\u2019s determination that Byrd\u2019s conduct constituted reckless endangerment is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Sloley, </em>19 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir.1994). Byrd first maintains incorrectly that \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3) accounted for all his relevant conduct. He next asserts that the record does not establish whether anyone was put in danger during the chase or whether Byrd was the driver of the car. This argument is belied by Byrd\u2019s stipulation that he was the driver of the car and by uncontested information in the presentence report that the chase ended when Byrd wrecked the car, thus endangering his passengers. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in making an adjustment for reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Last, Byrd argues that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to depart downward. A defendant may obtain review of a district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward only when the district court mistakenly believed it lacked authority to depart. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238-39 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1130, 120 S.Ct. 968, 145 L.Ed.2d 839 (2000). Byrd does not argue, and the record does not disclose, that the district court failed to understand its authority to depart under \u00a7 4A1.3. In denying the departure, the court stated that it did not believe that criminal history category III overstated Byrd\u2019s criminal history or experience. Therefore, this portion of the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">We therefore affirm the sentence, but dismiss that portion of the appeal which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>contests the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-6\"> The government asserts that Byrd waived his appeal rights under the plea agreement. However, the government has not established that the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
