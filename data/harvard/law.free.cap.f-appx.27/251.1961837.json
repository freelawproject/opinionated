Richardson\u2019s appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>late counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Richardson has filed a pro se brief asserting additional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">First, Richardson asserts his counsel in district court provided ineffective assistance, and that this ineffective assistance invalidated Richardson\u2019s plea agreement waiver of appellate rights. The record does not conclusively establish Richardson\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance. Accordingly, this claim is denied without prejudice to Richardson\u2019s right to reassert it in a post-conviction proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001) upon the completion of direct appellate review of Richardson\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1096, 120 S.Ct. 837, 145 L.Ed.2d 704 (2000); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Second, Richardson asserts his indictment was defective. We find no error in the indictment, and consequently, this claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Third, Richardson relies on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to challenge his indictment, sentence, and the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001). Because Richardson\u2019s indictment was not defective, and because his sentence did not exceed the applicable statutory maximum, his challenges to his indictment and sentence are meritless. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490; <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 152-57 (4th Cir.2001), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Sept. 20, 2001 (No. 01-6398). Moreover, Richardson\u2019s argument that <em>Apprendi </em>renders \u00a7 841(a) unconstitutional is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 231-32 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. We deny Richardson\u2019s pro se motions for discovery and to supplement his pleading. We affirm Richardson\u2019s conviction and sentence, and deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
