Seco de Lucena pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1); two counts of manufacturing methamphetamine, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1); four counts of distributing methamphetamine, <em>id.; </em>one count of maintaining a place for manufacturing methamphetamine, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 856; and one count of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). The district court sentenced him to a total of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment and eight years\u2019 supervised release. Seco de Lucena filed a notice of appeal but his attorney now seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Seco de Lucena did not file a response to counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), and counsel\u2019s brief is facially adequate, so we limit our review to the potential issues counsel raises. <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997). We grant counsel\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">Counsel first considers whether Seco de Lucena could argue that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. We will uphold a guilty plea if we are satisfied that the defendant was informed of his rights and understood the consequences of his plea. <em>United States v. Godwin, </em>202 F.3d 969, 972 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1138, 120 S.Ct. 2023, 146 L.Ed.2d 970 (2000). Because Seco de Lucena did not move to withdraw his plea in the district court, our review would be limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Driver, </em>242 F.3d 767, 769 (7th Cir.2001). But even if we were to apply the more exacting harmless error standard, <em>see United States v. Vonn, </em>224 F.3d 1152, 1155 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. granted, </em>531 U.S. 1189, 121 S.Ct. 1185, 149 L.Ed.2d 102 (2001), we would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>agree that a challenge to Seco de Lucena\u2019s guilty plea would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">At the plea hearing the district court questioned Seco de Lucena at length to ensure that he understood the charges against him, the rights he would waive by pleading guilty, the likely effect of the sentencing guidelines, and the maximum and minimum penalties he faced. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c). The court also required the government to proffer an adequate factual basis for its case, which Seco de Lucena affirmed. Seco de Lucena testified that in exchange for his plea, he expected the government to dismiss one count of the indictment and amend another. There is no evidence the government failed to meet these obligations; nor is there any suggestion that Seco de Lucena wishes to withdraw his guilty plea. We therefore agree that an appeal on this ground would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Counsel next considers whether Seco de Lucena could argue that his trial lawyer was ineffective. Ineffective-assistance claims are usually inappropriate on direct appeal because they often require consideration of facts outside the record. <em>United States v. Hamzat, </em>217 F.3d 494, 501 (7th Cir.2000). Seco de Lucena would be better served by bringing an ineffective-assistance claim in a collateral motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 if he so desires. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Counsel also discusses whether Seco de Lucena could raise a nonfrivolous challenge to his sentence. In the district court Seco de Lucena raised a single objection to the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), namely, that it failed to afford him a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The court granted the reduction. Because Seco de Lucena stated that he had no further objections to the PSR, any other objections would be waived on appeal. <em>See United States v. Staples, </em>202 F.3d 992, 995 (7th Cir.2000). We agree that pursuing a challenge to Seco de Lucena\u2019s sentence would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Counsel also considers whether Seco de Lucena could argue that the district court improperly considered whether his drug activities affected his infant daughter in sentencing him at the high end of the range. The guidelines grant trial courts broad discretion to consider \u201cwithout limitation, any information concerning the background, character and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.4; <em>United States v. Brimah, </em>214 F.3d 854, 856 (7th Cir. 2000). Although a court cannot consider certain factors \u2014 such as the defendant\u2019s race, sex, or religion \u2014 third party effects of a defendant\u2019s criminal activity is not a prohibited consideration. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.10. We have observed that \u201cthe Supreme Court has consistently approved the use of virtually any conduct (uncharged, acquitted, or otherwise) in sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Raimondi, </em>159 F.3d 1095, 1103 (7th Cir.1998). Moreover, absent an error of law or misapplication of the guidelines, we would lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s choice of sentence within the applicable range. <em>United States v. Byrd, </em>263 F.3d 705, 707 (7th Cir.2001). We therefore agree that an appeal on this ground would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Counsel finally considers whether Seco de Lucena could challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a downward departure. Seco de Lucena moved for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, arguing that his status as a career offender significantly over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. The court recognized that it had authority to depart but found that Seco de Lucena\u2019s case did not warrant departure. We agree with counsel that we would lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s discretionary denial of a request for a downward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>departure. <em>See United States v. Atkinson, </em>259 F.3d 648, 652-53 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
