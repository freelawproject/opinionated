We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo both summary judgment, <em>Margolis v. Ryan, </em>140 F.3d 850, 852 (9th Cir.1998), and dismissal, <em>Barnett v. Centoni </em>31 F.3d 813, 816 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam). We review the district court\u2019s discovery ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., </em>175 F.3d 716, 726 (9th Cir.1999). Because the district court did not expressly rule on Sanderson\u2019s request for appointment of a medical expert, we review his motion de novo. <em>Cf. Byrd v. Guess, </em>137 F.3d 1126, 1135 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">We conclude that Sanderson failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether any defendant acted with deliberate indifference to Sanderson\u2019s medical needs. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">We also conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing defendants Ter-hune and Lindsay because Sanderson failed to allege that these supervisory defendants personally participated in, or knew of, the alleged constitutional violations. <em>See Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">We further conclude that Sanderson failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he had a state-created liberty interest in the right to counseling or written consent prior to taking medication prescribed by prison physicians. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 477-87, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (stating requirement that plaintiff identify a state statute or regulation which narrowly restricts prison officials\u2019 ability to impose deprivation); CaLCode Regs. tit. 15, \u00a7 3351 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">Because this case does not present exceptional circumstances, we deny Sander-son\u2019s request for appointment of counsel. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendants\u2019 request to stay discovery pending the outcome of the summary judgment motion because Sand-erson \u201cfailed to show the existence of additional essential and discoverable evidence.\u201d <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-18\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to appoint a medical expert witness at state expense. <em>Cf. Tedder v. Odel, </em>890 F.2d 210, 211-12 (9th Cir.1989) (finding no statutory authority allowing district courts to waive, in in forma pauperis actions, the payment of witness fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>required for Fed.R.Civ.P. 45(c) subpoenas).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b843-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
