The \u201croutine booking question\u201d exception to <em>Miranda </em>permits questions pertaining to biographical information, <em>Pennsylvania v. Muniz, </em>496 U.S. 582, 600-02, 606-07, 110 S.Ct. 2638, 110 L.Ed.2d 528 (1990), provided that they are not \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect,\u201d <em>United States v. Booth, </em>669 F.2d 1231, 1237 (9th Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980)). In evaluating whether a question falls within the exception, the \u201crelationship of the question asked to the crime suspected is highly relevant.\u201d <em>United States v. Matar-Abundiz, </em>717 F.2d 1277, 1280 (9th Cir.1983) (citing <em>Booth, </em>669 F.2d at 1238).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">The agent\u2019s question about Robinet\u2019s immigration status, in response to which Ro-binet admitted that he had overstayed his visa, was merely a review of the biographical information provided by Robinet, and was not related to the offense that the agent was investigating. Nor was Robinet charged with violating immigration laws. We conclude, therefore, that the agent did not ask this question with the knowledge that it was \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-18\">2. Robinet\u2019s question to the agent was not an equivocal request for counsel. <em>See United States v. Ogbuehi, </em>18 F.3d 807, 813 (9th Cir.1994) (a query \u201c \u2018Do I need a lawyer\u2019 or \u2018Do you think I need a lawyer\u2019 does not rise to the level of even an equivocal request for an attorney\u201d); <em>Norman v. Ducharme, </em>871 F.2d 1483, 1486 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>1989) (a defendant\u2019s question \u201cif he should see a lawyer\u201d does not constitute an equivocal request for counsel). Robinet \u201casked for advice, not an attorney,\u201d and so his subsequent statements are not subject to suppression. <em>Ogbuehi </em>18 F.3d at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">3. We also reject Robinet\u2019s contention that the agent coerced his confession through inaccurate promises of leniency, exacerbated by commentary that Robinet\u2019s position was \u201cnot good\u201d for him. \u201cAn interrogating agent\u2019s promise to inform the government prosecutor about a suspect\u2019s cooperation does not render a subsequent statement involuntary, even when it is accompanied by a promise to recommend leniency or by speculation that cooperation will have a positive effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Guerrero, </em>847 F.2d 1363, 1366 (9th Cir.1988) (citations omitted). The agent also expressly warned Robinet that he \u201ccannot make ... any promises about what will happen to [Robinet] with prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Nor was the agent\u2019s promise \u201caccompanied by threats or other coercive practices\u201d that would \u201crender a subsequent confession involuntary.\u201d <em>Guerrero, </em>847 F.2d at 1366 n. 2. The agent stopped Robi-net as soon as he saw a possibility that Robinet might incriminate himself prior to being read <em>Miranda </em>rights, explained these rights in detail, clarified unfamiliar words, told Robinet that no one would hurt him during the questioning and that he could stop the interview at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">4. The government did not ignore Robinet\u2019s request for consular notification. The district court disbelieved Robinet\u2019s testimony that he had made such request, and we accord significant deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See Trent v. Valley Elec. Ass\u2019n, </em>195 F.3d 534, 538 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 871, 121 S.Ct. 171, 148 L.Ed.2d 117 (2000). In any event, suppression is not among the judicial remedies available for violation of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. <em>United States v. Lombera-Camorlinga, </em>206 F.3d 882, 885-86 (9th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 991, 121 S.Ct. 481, 148 L.Ed.2d 455 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b920-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
