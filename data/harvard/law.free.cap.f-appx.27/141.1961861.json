Charles filed a complaint against appellants contending that they breached, or illegally ended, a contract with him because of his race. He is African American. A jury returned a verdict in favor of appellants and against Charles. Appellants filed a petition to amend the judgment to add an award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The District Court denied their petition. We review this denial for an abuse of discretion. Finding none, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, permits the court to award attorney\u2019s fees to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in suits brought under the federal civil rights statutes. The district courts have been given discretion to decide whether, in their judgment, a plaintiffs claim was frivolous or groundless. In this matter, the District Court compared the \u201cthrust of the plaintiffs contention\u201d with the evidence he adduced at trial, and concluded that attorney\u2019s fees were not indicated. We believe the decision was within the Court\u2019s discretion, see no abuse, and will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
