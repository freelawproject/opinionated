Pursuant to its statutory authority under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(i), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has adopted regulations to ensure that individuals with unescorted ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>cess to protected areas of a nuclear power plant are sufficiently trustworthy and do not pose an unreasonable risk to public health and safety, including \u201cthe potential to commit radiological sabotage.\u201d 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.56 (2000). To screen individuals, nuclear power plant licensees must have in place an access authorization program as part of the facility\u2019s physical security plan, and this plan must be approved by the Commission. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We hold that the District Court below properly granted Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and properly denied Appellant\u2019s cross-motions for summary judgment. In his 39 page Opinion accompanying the Order, dated April 6, 2001, the Magistrate Judge correctly held that issues of site access for employees are not subject to arbitration under the grievance and arbitration provisions of the current collective bargaining agreement between the employer, PSE &amp; G, and the union, Local 94. We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s arguments and find no ground to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The Order of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
