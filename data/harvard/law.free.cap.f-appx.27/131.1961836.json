Bailey appeals the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint seeking judicial review of the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security denying his application for Supplemental Security Income.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-18\">Our review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3). This Court neither undertakes a de novo review of the decision, nor does it re-weigh the evidence in the record. <em>Monsour Med. Ctr. v. Heckler, </em>806 F.2d 1185, 1190 (3d Cir.1986). \u2018We will not set the Commissioner\u2019s decision aside if it is supported by substantial evidence, even if we would have decided the factual inquiry differently.\u201d <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence is evidence that is less than a preponderance, but more than a mere scintilla. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). That is, it \u201cdoes not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence, but rather \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)); accord <em>Hartranft, </em>181 F.3d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-21\">We have carefully considered Bailey\u2019s arguments in this appeal and find that they lack merit. For the reasons substantially stated in the well-reasoned and thorough opinion of Judge Smith, we find that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and we therefore affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
