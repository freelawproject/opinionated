Having thoroughly reviewed the record and the parties\u2019s briefs on appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-25\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the government could not be compelled to file a Rule 35(b) motion under the circumstances that are present here. Appellant has not alleged that the government\u2019s decision was based on an unconstitutional motive, nor that it was unrelated to a legitimate government end. Accordingly, judicial review is not available under <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). And while \u201cthe government must perform in good faith the discretionary obligations that it undertakes in a plea agreement\u201d, <em>see United States v. Alegria, </em>192 F.3d 179, 187 (1st Cir.1999), this principle does not entitle appellant to enforce alleged oral promises that contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>vene her plea agreement, which makes no mention of Rule 35(b) motions and which provides that all promises will be \u201cin writing [and] signed by the parties.\u201d The government\u2019s refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion is not subject to judicial review under these circumstances. <em>Cf. United States v. Sandoval, </em>204 F.3d 283, 286 (1st Cir.2000)(holding government\u2019s refusal to file \u00a7 5K1.1 motion was not subject to judicial review where plea agreement made no mention of such motions and defendant did not allege a <em>Wade </em>violation); <em>Alegr\u00eda, </em>192 F.3d at 186 (holding defendant could not reasonably rely on alleged pre-plea oral promise that contravened plea agreement\u2019s integration clause). <em>See also Bischel v. United States, </em>32 F.3d 259, 264 (7th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Ringling, </em>988 F.2d 504, 507 (4th Cir.l993)(both declining to enforce alleged oral promises to file Rule 35(b) motions). Moreover, even if the government\u2019s decision was reviewable, appellant has not made the \u201csubstantial threshold showing\u201d required to merit further inquiry under <em>Alegr\u00eda, </em>192 F.3d at 189 &amp; n. 7 (holding conclusory assertions and \u201csheer speculation\u201d were insufficient to rebut government\u2019s facially valid reasons for determining defendant had not rendered substantial assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">In view of the foregoing, we need not decide whether jurisdiction was available under <em>United States v. Morales, 52 </em>F.3d 7, 8 (1st Cir.1995). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s renewed motion for appointment of counsel is <em>denied </em>and the judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed. See </em>Local Rule 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
