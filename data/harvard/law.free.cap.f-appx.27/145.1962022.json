He appeals his conviction and sentence. Madrigal\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Madrigal was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. Because we find the assignment of error to lack merit and discern no other eiTor in the record, we affirm Madrigal\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Counsel raises as a potential error the district court\u2019s denial of a defense request for a downward departure from the Criminal History category calculated under the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This departure was warranted, counsel asserts, because Madrigal\u2019s criminal history category significantly overstated his prior criminal conduct. Because the district court clearly recognized its discretion to depart, but concluded that Madrigal\u2019s prior criminal conduct was not overrepresented by the calculated criminal history category, the court\u2019s decision not to grant a downward departure is not reviewable. <em>See United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Madrigal\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b170-16\"> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
