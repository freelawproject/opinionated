Shaffer appeals his conviction upon his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), for which the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 96 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. Counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing (1) the Second Amendment was violated; (2) there was a violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Castillo v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 2090, 147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000), \u201cbecause whether the shotgun fit the definition of a weapon as defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845 was an element of the offense which should have been charged in the indictment, and was not merely a sentencing factor\u201d; (3) Mr. Shaffer was coerced into signing his post-arrest statement; (4) the district court lacked jurisdiction under Article III; and (5) the prosecution was, among other things, dishonest and orchestrated to incite fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-21\">We reject these arguments seriatim. First, \u201cit is now well-settled that Congress did not violate the Second Amendment in enacting [\u00a7 922(g)(1)].\u201d <em>United States v. Waller, </em>218 F.3d 856, 857 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam). Second, Mr. Shaffer\u2019s section 5845 argument is misplaced, given that he did not receive an enhanced sentence for possessing a sawed-off shotgun as opposed to a firearm in general. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(B)(i) (10-year mandatory minimum prison term if firearm possessed is \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d). Third, Mr. Shaffer waived his argument concerning the voluntariness of his signed statement. <em>See United States v. Vong, </em>171 F.3d 648, 654 (8th Cir.1999) (by pleading guilty defendant waived all non-jurisdictional defenses). Fourth, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>trict court had jurisdiction because section 922 is a law of the United States enacted by Congress, <em>see </em>U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 1, and federal courts have jurisdiction over cases arising from federal laws, <em>see </em>U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 1. Finally, Mr. Shaffer\u2019s improper-prosecution argument is wholly conclusory and waived by his guilty plea. <em>See Vong, </em>171 F.Sd at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Upon further review of the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-19\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
