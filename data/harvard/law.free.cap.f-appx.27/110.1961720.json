Munley, United States District Judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b135-13\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b135-14\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">Plaintiff James Aguiar appeals an order granting summary judgment to the Morgan Corporation on retaliation claims made under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e), the CM Rights Act of 1870 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981), and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (43 P.S. \u00a7 951). Aguiar contends Morgan unlawfully took adverse employment action against him because he made a statement on behalf of a black co-worker who filed a complaint of race discrimination with the Reading Berks Human Relations Council (RBHRC). The District Court granted summary judgment for the defendants because plaintiff failed to respond to Morgan\u2019s allegation that he presented no evidence of an adverse employment action or a causal connection between the alleged harassment and the termination. (District Court March 2, 2000 Opinion at 9) (\u201cWithout any such evidence it is impossible for a jury to find the plaintiffs retaliation argument to have merit; therefore, summary judgment must be granted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">We Ml affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of a grant of summary judgment is plenary. <em>Cardenas v. Massey, </em>269 F.3d 251, 256 (3d Cir.2001). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) \u201cmandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party Ml bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>(quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">At issue is whether summary judgment was properly granted on Aguiar\u2019s retaliation claim. To establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation under Title VII, \u00a7 1981, and the PHRA, a plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) he or she engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) the employer took an adverse employment action after or contemporaneous with the protected activity; and (3) a causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Weston v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em>251 F.3d 420, 430 (3d Cir.2001); <em>Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>120 F.3d 1286 (3d Cir.1997). We conclude there is sufficient evidence of the first two elements, but not enough evidence of the requisite causal connection, and therefore we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">a. Aguiar engaged in protected activity</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">In October or November of 1996, Aguiar went to the Reading Berks Human Relations Council and made a statement on behalf of a black co-worker who had filed a complaint of race discrimination. Thus, we hold that the record contains a sufficient showing that Aguiar engaged in a protected activity. See <em>Abramson v. William Patterson College of New Jersey, </em>260 F.3d 265 (3d Cir.2001) (describing acceptable indicia of protected conduct in the ADEA and Title VII contexts).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">b. Aguiar suffered adverse employment action</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Although the actual date and cause of termination is in dispute, both parties agree Aguiar was fired from his position of production employee at Morgan Corporation in July 1997. Aguiar\u2019s termination therefore fulfills the second prong of the prima facie case for a retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">c. Insufficient evidence of causal link</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">On appeal, Aguiar alleges he presented sufficient evidence of a causal connection because in his deposition he asserted that (1) a group of Morgan employees threatened him with adverse employment action one and a half weeks after he gave a statement regarding racial remarks to the human relations council in 1996; (2) one person from that same group fired him over the telephone on July 7,1997 when he requested more time off; and (3) a Morgan human relations employee informed him he was not getting a requested transfer because he was being \u201cblackballed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">We see no merit in Aguiar\u2019s contention that these alleged events establish the requisite causal connection \u201cby way of a threat and the implementation of the threat.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 16). We have stated that the existence of a causal link \u201cmust be considered with a careful eye to the specific facts and circumstances encountered.\u201d <em>Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Co., </em>206 F.3d 271, 279 n. 5 (3d Cir.2000). Evidence probative of a causal link can be inferred from evidence \u201cgleaned from the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281 (\u201ctemporal proximity or antagonism merely provides an evidentiary basis from which an inference can be drawn\u201d) (citations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">Here, plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence from which an inference of a causal connection can be drawn. Following his report to the human relations council, Aguiar received positive performance evaluations and merit pay increases until the time of his termination. (District Court March 2, 2000 Opinion at 2). When Aguiar requested a different position to accommodate his diabetes symptoms, defendant complied by offering him the only \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>available position for which he was qualified, a paint prepper. <em>Id. </em>Aguiar refused this position even though Morgan offered to pay him his former higher salary because he \u201cdidn\u2019t get along\u201d with paint. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Because of his diabetes, plaintiff was granted intermittent FMLA leave from June 16,1997 until July 14,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">When Aguiar failed to show up for work on July 14, Morgan\u2019s Employee Benefits Manager sent a letter to Aguiar\u2019s physician on July 16, 1997 requesting medical information explaining Aguiar\u2019s continued absence and \u201ccalled every number we had for [Aguiar] to try and contact him and could not get a hold of him.\u201d \"When the manager did not hear from Aguiar\u2019s physician after a week and a half (Whitmoyer Dep. 108a), another human relations manager sent plaintiff a letter informing him that he was being terminated in accordance with the corporation\u2019s \u201cno call/no show\u201d policy. This termination occurred in July 1997 more than eight months after the meeting with the human relations council. Aguiar has provided insufficient evidence of temporal proximity or a pattern of antagonism. On these facts, we conclude plaintiff has not raised a genuine issue of material fact with regard to the causal connection between the alleged adverse employment actions and the protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
