In June 2000 Clinton filed a largely inscrutable petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, which seems to argue that his detention is an illegal civil commitment. He refers to \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201cmental illness\u201d in his petition, but his grievance is vague. A magistrate judge assigned to the case could discern neither the basis for Clinton\u2019s petition, nor whether it properly fell under the rubric of \u00a7 2241 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. To aid his understanding of the petition, the magistrate judge sent Clinton a form \u00a7 2254 petition with instructions to complete it within fifteen days or face dismissal of his action for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Clinton did not complete the form provided, but instead sent an untitled document that did not clarify his petition. In response the district court dismissed Clinton\u2019s petition without prejudice, but invited Clinton to file a clarified petition. A month later Clinton filed a \u201cMotion in Ex-Parte\u201d that was no more intelligible than the original petition. The district court construed the document as a motion to reconsider, which it denied. After three more months, Clinton filed a \u201cMotion for a Certificate of Probability.\u201d The court, deeming the motion unclear, ordered Clinton to explain whether he was seeking leave to appeal or seeking reconsideration of the petition\u2019s dismissal. The court included instructions for either possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Clinton responded after a month with another \u201cMotion in Ex-Parte\u201d that addresses neither possibility. The court construed this motion as another for reconsideration of its order dismissing Clinton\u2019s petition, and denied it. Twenty-seven days later, and eight months after entry of judgment, Clinton filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Because Clinton filed his first \u201cMotion in Ex-Parte\u201d more than ten days after entry of judgment, we construe it as a request for relief from judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b). <em>See United States v. </em>47 <em>West 644 Route 38, Maple Park, Ill., </em>190 F.3d 781, 783 n. 1 (7th Cir.1999). Clinton\u2019s second \u201cMotion in Ex-Parte\u201d also sought reconsideration of the district court\u2019s judgment, and thus was also a Rule 60(b) motion. A Rule 60(b) motion does not toll the period for filing a timely appeal, but allows a court to relieve a party from judgment on the grounds of mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, fraud, or \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.CivJP. 60(b). A Rule 60(b) motion \u201cis not a permissible substitute\u201d for a timely appeal. <em>Bell v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>214 F.3d 798, 801 (7th Cir.2000). Clinton\u2019s motions, as best we can discern, merely disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusions. Clinton thus should have raised these issues in a timely appeal, but he did not. Because Clinton is attempting to make an untimely appeal from judgment, <em>id. </em>at 214 F.3d at 802, his appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
