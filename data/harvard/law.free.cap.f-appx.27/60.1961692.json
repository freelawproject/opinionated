Hellerstein, <em>Judge) </em>for possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). The United States cross-appeals for review of Mr. Reynolds\u2019 sentence. After review, we conclude that Mr. Reynolds was properly convicted and thus affirm his conviction; however, because the District Court applied an improper provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, we vacate Mr. Reynolds\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">Mr. Reynolds was convicted of a single count of possessing a firearm after having previously been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Mr. Reynolds owns and maintains three apartment buildings in the northwest area of the Bronx. On April 10, 2000, he was arrested following an altercation with a tenant, David Hunter. Mr. Hunter claimed that Mr. Reynolds assaulted him with a handgun, striking him in the face with the gun after a dispute about Mr. Hunter\u2019s failure to vacate the apartment. Mr. Reynolds denies striking Mr. Hunter and claimed at trial that the handgun was actually Mr. Hunter\u2019s, and that he took the gun from Mr. Hunter in self-defense. After a three-day trial and three days of deliberation, the jury convicted Mr. Reynolds of possession of a handgun in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), which prohibits persons previously convicted of a felony from possessing handguns. As a predicate offense for this conviction, the government proffered a certified copy of a judgment of conviction showing that in 1985 Mr. Reynolds pled guilty to criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">In sentencing Mr. Reynolds, the District Court applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(7) of the Sentencing Guidelines which applies to offenses for unlawful possession of firearms but does not carry an enhancement for the prior felony conviction. Mr. Reynolds was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>months, followed by two years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Am\">I. Mr. Reynolds\u2019 Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Mr. Reynolds raises three claims attacking his conviction. First, he contends that the government deprived him of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when it referred to the fact that Mr. Reynolds failed to speak at the time of his arrest. During cross-examination, the Assistant United States Attorney inquired why Mr. Reynolds failed to claim at the time of his arrest \u2014 as he did at trial \u2014 that the gun was not his but was taken from Hunter in self-defense. This line of inquiry followed an opening statement in which Mr. Reynolds claimed that police officers prevented him from telling his story at the time of his arrest and direct testimony from Mr. Reynolds to the same effect. Thus, as Mr. Reynolds placed his post-arrest actions and silence at issue, he cannot now claim his constitutional rights were violated when the government sought to cross-examine him on that issue. <em>See Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91., 619 n. 11 (1976); <em>Leecan v. Lopes, </em>893 F.2d 1434, 1441 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>496 U.S. 929, 110 S.Ct. 2627, 110 L.Ed.2d 647 (1990). Moreover, as Mr. Reynolds had received no assurances from the government that his silence would not be used against him, reference by the government to his post-arrest silence in cross-examination or in summation does not implicate his due process rights. <em>See Fletcher v. Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 607, 102 S.Ct. 1309, 71 L.Ed.2d 490 (1982) (\u201cIn the absence of the sort of affirmative assurances embodied in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, we do not believe that it violates due process of law for a State to permit cross-examination as to postarrest silence when a defendant chooses to take the stand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Mr. Reynolds\u2019 next claim is that he was deprived of a fair trial because Mr. Hunter testified with a Jamaican accent which might have been difficult for jurors to understand. Because Mr. Reynolds failed to contend at trial that Mr. Hunter\u2019s testimony was not sufficiently clear, we review for plain error, which will be found only \u201cin those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (internal quotations omitted). Here, the record reveals, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court actively intervened to ensure the clarity of Mr. Hunter\u2019s testimony and provided a written transcript throughout the jurors, deliberations. Thus, there is no reason to suspect that jural difficulty with Mr. Hunter\u2019s testimony so undermined the fairness of the proceeding that a new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Finally, Mr. Reynolds\u2019 third claim \u2014 that the trial judge displayed such antipathy to his counsel that the fairness of the trial was undermined \u2014 is without merit. Accordingly, having reviewed Reynolds\u2019 claims on appeal and finding no basis for ordering a new trial, we affirm the judgment of conviction entered against Mr. Reynolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">II. Mr. Reynolds\u2019 Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The United States cross-appeals, requesting that we vacate the sentence imposed by the District Court. In sentencing Mr. Reynolds, the court issued a written Memorandum and Order of Sentencing, setting forth the bases upon which Mr. Reynolds\u2019 sentence was calculated. The court applied \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(7), a provision which applies to persons convicted of firearm offenses, but who have no prior convictions. The court, however, recognized that Mr. Reynolds\u2019 1985 conviction for a drug offense was a \u201ccontrolled sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>stance offense,\u201d which qualified him for sentencing under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) of the Guidelines. Had that section been applied, Mr. Reynolds would have qualified for a base offense level of 20 rather than the level 12 actually applied. The court recognized that \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) was dictated by the Guidelines, but refused to apply it, finding that justice required application of a more lenient sentencing provision. The court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">The Government correctly argues that defendant\u2019s fifteen year-old conviction, punishable by an indeterminate term of custody between one and three years satisfies 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4).... The Defendant, Merton Reynolds, is a hardworking man. His thirty-one tenants in a poor, drug-ravaged neighborhood depend on him for the upkeep of the buildings in which they live____The different gradations of culpability are not well-treated in the specific provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines.... Jumping eight levels of culpability, from level twelve to level twenty, to account for an unlawful firearm possession by a prior felon, represents an extraordinary step. But by sweeping together the almost-benign and the seriously malignant, it threatens a basic goal of the Guidelines, to graduate punishment according to the seriousness of the crime, and then to account for appropriate adjustments and departures.... A judge is not a calculating machine, and the sentencing grid is not a strait-jacket. Law must not be defied, and a judge is not free to refuse to apply a distasteful provision of the Sentencing Guidelines. But neither should a judge neglect to apply a gradation in the Guidelines if doing so would more perfectly fit the punishment to the crime. Subsection 7 of Section 2K2.1(a) is such a gradation. It more perfectly fits the offense of which Merton Reynolds was convicted. The type and character of his prior felony, the length of time that passed between its commission and his unlawful gun possession, his apparent purpose in keeping a gun for security and not as a means to commit crimes \u2014 all make appropriate the catchall provision of [Sjection 2K2.1(a)(7) for an offense not fitting well in the other subsections of the Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\"><em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>2001 WL 396439 at *2-5 (S.D.N.Y. April 19, 2001) (internal citations omitted). The court also adjusted Mr. Reynolds\u2019 criminal history from category III to category II for the same reasons and rejected Mr. Reynolds\u2019 requested departures.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">While we find much to agree with in the District Court\u2019s general sentiments regarding the inflexibility of the Guidelines, we cannot let stand the District Court\u2019s patent rejection of the appropriate Guideline provisions. \u201c[T]he Guidelines, having the force and effect of law, are to be construed as if they were a statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Kirvan, </em>86 F.3d 309, 311 (2d Cir.1996). A district court has no authority to disregard or fail to apply a Guideline provision, even if it believes that they dictate an unjust result. <em>See United States v. Shonubi, </em>998 F.2d 84, 87-88 (2d Cir.1993). As we stated in <em>United States v. Koczuk, </em>252 F.3d 91, 95 (2d Cir.2001), \u201cdissatisfaction with the available sentencing range or a preference for a different sentence than that authorized by the guidelines is not an appropriate basis for a sentence outside the applicable guideline range.\u201d (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, comment). To the extent that the District Court believed that the Guidelines overemphasized Reynolds\u2019 criminal history, the court had the ability to reduce Reynolds\u2019 criminal history category. The court appropriately exercised that authority, and by doing so mitigated Mr. Reynolds\u2019 sentence. The government does not contest the horizontal departure to reduce Mr. Reynolds\u2019 criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>In short, the unambiguous and binding language of the Guidelines dictates that Mr. Reynolds\u2019 sentence be controlled by \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). The District Court cannot refuse to apply this provision. We thus vacate Mr. Reynolds\u2019 sentence and remand so that the District Court may resentence Mr. Reynolds in accordance with this Order. Although the court previously denied Mr. Reynolds\u2019 departure requests, the court is free to reconsider its decision upon remand. We express no view on whether vertical departures or further adjusting Mr. Reynolds\u2019 criminal history category may be appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
