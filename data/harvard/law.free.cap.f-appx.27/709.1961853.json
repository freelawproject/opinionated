Counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California) </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although we granted Lopez-Lopez permission to file a pro se supplemental brief, he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Counsel argues that the district court committed error by increasing Lopez-Lopez\u2019s base offense level for possession of a dangerous weapon. We disagree. In our view, the district court correctly applied the enhancement in light of a witness\u2019s testimony that Lopez-Lopez held up his gun and warned her, \u201c[Y]ou know what we do to narcas.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.3) (adjustment should be applied if weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable weapon was connected with offense); <em>United </em>States <em>v. Behler, </em>187 F.3d 772, 777 (8th Cir.1999) (district court\u2019s assessment of credibility is \u201cvirtually unre-viewable\u201d; clear-error standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Having reviewed the record independently in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75,109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no other nonfrivolous issues. Thus, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, deny as moot Lopez-Lopez\u2019s motion for appointment of appellate counsel, and affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-10\"> The Honorable Richard G.
