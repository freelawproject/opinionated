Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). In <em>Arbuz, </em>the Court determined that, where a state application for post-conviction or other collateral review meets applicable rules and laws governing such filings, the application is \u201cproperly filed\u201d and thus tolls the statute of limitations applicable to habeas corpus petitions. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 121 S.Ct. 361. In light of this remand, the case is once again before this court on Blackmon\u2019s application for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Upon consideration, we grant Black-mon\u2019s application for a certificate of ap-pealability, vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Blackmon\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment, and remand the case to the district court for further consideration in light of <em>Arbuz. </em>The district court dismissed Blackmon\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for habeas corpus relief as untimely and denied his Rule 60(b) motion for relief from that judgment without the benefit of <em>Arbuz. </em>However, Blackmon filed a state court petition for post-conviction relief that may have tolled the limitations period in light of <em>Arbuz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Accordingly, Blackmon\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability is granted, the district court\u2019s order denying Rule 60(b) relief is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
