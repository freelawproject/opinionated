R.App. P. 34(a)(2). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-15\">Curtis Vane Moore, a state prisoner in the custody of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections proceeding pro se, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We agree with the district court that three of Mr. Moore\u2019s claims are barred by the statute of limitations. We further conclude that Mr. Moore\u2019s fourth claim is precluded by a factual finding of the state court. As a result, we concluded that Mr. Moore is not entitled to a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-16\">In order to receive a certificate of appealability, Mr. Moore must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). He may make this showing by demonstrating that the issues that he raises are debatable among jurists, that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">The record indicates that, on March 12, 1997, in the District Court for Oklahoma County, Mr. Moore pleaded guilty to Grand Larceny After Former Conviction of Two or More Felonies. Initially, the court sentenced Mr. Moore to the nightime incarceration program in the Oklahoma County Jail. Mr. Moore failed to complete that program, and, as a result, the Okla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>homa County Court sentenced him to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Mr. Moore did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea within the ten-day period provided by Oklahoma law. <em>See </em>Okla. Ct. Crim.App. R. 4.2(a), Okla. Stat. tit. 22, Ch. 18 App. (2001). He also did not file a direct appeal of his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">However, Mr. Moore did file three applications for post-conviction relief, on December 18,1998; June 8,1999; and March 28, 2000. The Oklahoma County District Court denied the first application, and Mr. Moore did not file a state court appeal. Mr. Moore withdrew the second application, and the third application was denied by the Oklahoma County District Court. Mr. Moore did appeal the denial of the third application, and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Mr. Moore filed the instant petition in the federal district court on January 18, 2001. He alleged that: (1) he was coerced into entering a guilty plea and was thereby denied his right to a fair trial; (2) the state court violated the constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy by resentencing him after he failed to complete the nighttime incarceration program; (3) his counsel was ineffective; and (4) the state and his defense counsel coerced him into withdrawing his second application for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Applying the one-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) (part of the Anti Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, AEDPA), the district court concluded that Mr. Moore\u2019s first three claims were untimely. The court reasoned that Mr. Moore\u2019s conviction became final on March 22, 1997, ten days after the pronouncement of his judgment and sentence, and that he therefore had until March 22, 1998, to file a federal habe-as corpus action.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">The court rejected Mr. Moore\u2019s argument that his right to file a federal habeas corpus action did not arise until, on March 9, 1999, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals issued <em>Stewart v. State, </em>989 P.2d 940 (Okla.Crim.App.1999), overruled on other grounds by <em>King v. State, </em>29 P.3d 1089 (Okla.Crim.App.2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It reasoned that <em>Stewart </em>did not remove an impediment to the filing of a federal habeas action and that it did not create a new factual predicate for his claims that would extend AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), (D). The court also concluded that Mr. Moore was not entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">The court denied Mr. Moore\u2019s fourth claim on the merits. It reasoned that Mr. Moore had no constitutional right to state post-conviction relief or post conviction counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-13\">We agree with the district court\u2019s application of AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. As to his first three claims, Mr. Moore filed his federal habeas petition after the expiration of the one-year limitations period. The issuance of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s decision interpreting state sentencing law did not extend AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations, and Mr. Moore has failed to establish the \u201crare and exceptional circumstances\u201d in which equitable tolling is warranted. <em>See Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 808 (10th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">As to Mr. Moore\u2019s fourth claim, we note that the Oklahoma County District Court found that he was not coerced into withdrawing his second post-conviction application. <em>See </em>Rec. doc. 7, Ex. I, at 4. Mr. Moore has failed to establish that that finding is incorrect. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e) (stating that \u201ca determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct\u201d and that the petitioner has \u201cthe burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Accordingly, we GRANT Mr. Moore\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis, DENY Mr. Moore\u2019s application for a cer-tif\u00edcate of appealability, and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b987-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judica-ta, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-8\">. <em>Stewart </em>held that the sentencing court lacked authority to impose \"a hybrid sentence\u201d incorporating \"certain elements of a deferred judgment and a suspended sentence into a sentence of nighttime incarceration.\" 989 P.2d at 944.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
