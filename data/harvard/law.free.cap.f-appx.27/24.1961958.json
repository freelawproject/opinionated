As part of the pre-trial motion practice, Hardy filed motions for injunctive relief, to amend his complaint, and to compel discovery, which were denied in an August 24, 1999 order. After Hardy filed a self-styled \u201cappeal\u201d of that order, the district court treated it as a motion for reconsideration and denied it in a November 24, 1999 order. In a January 17, 2001 order, the district court denied another motion to reconsider as well as a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs based on Hardy\u2019s allegations that an Assistant Attorney General perjured herself in responding to the interrogatories that were the subject of his motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">On appeal, we note that there is some confusion as to what order(s) Hardy is appealing from and which issues he has properly preserved for appeal. Since Hardy\u2019s brief discusses both his motions to compel discovery and for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and states that he is appealing from the January 2001 order that denied both these motions on reconsideration, we will liberally construe Hardy\u2019s <em>pro se </em>pleadings as preserving and raising both issues for appeal. <em>See Graham v. Henderson, </em>89 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir.1996). Because we lack jurisdiction to consider either of these motions, we dismiss Hardy\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Generally, discovery orders are \u201cinterlocutory orders that must await final judgment\u201d for appellate review. <em>New York State Nat\u2019l Org. for Women v. Terry, </em>886 F.2d 1339, 1350 (2d Cir.1989). Although the collateral order doctrine provides some exceptions to this rule, <em>see, e.g., Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949); <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), we find that this case does not come within the limited group of exceptions that we have recognized under <em>Cohen. See Barrick Group, Inc. v. Mosse, </em>849 F.2d 70, 73 (2d Cir. 1988). Thus, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Hardy\u2019s pre-trial motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Similarly, we lack jurisdiction to consider the district court\u2019s denial of Hardy\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs because the denial of this motion is not a final judgment, and Hardy\u2019s motion does not warrant interlocutory appeal under <em>Cohen. See Hastings v. Maine-Endwell Cent. Sch. Dist., New York, </em>676 F.2d 893, 895-96 (2d Cir.1982)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
