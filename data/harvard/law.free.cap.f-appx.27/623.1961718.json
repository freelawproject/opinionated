After an examination of the appellant\u2019s brief and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the appellant\u2019s brief and the record. <em>See </em>Fed R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Wisconsin inmate Carl Beletsky filed what he characterized as a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 after he was designated for transfer to a private prison located out of state. The district court denied relief, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">Beletsky is serving a life sentence at Fox Lake Correctional Institution, where he participates in the state\u2019s only support group for Vietnam veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. His objections to transfer include those we have rejected before, <em>see Moran v. Sondadle, </em>218 F.3d 647, 651 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Pischke v. Litscher, </em>178 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir.1999), but his principal contention \u2014 and the only one he pursues on appeal \u2014 is that a transfer would threaten his participation in the veterans\u2019 support group and thus violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq. Though Beletsky filed his petition more than two years ago, he remains at Fox Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">The district court viewed Beletsky\u2019s petition as one arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, but it is not. Despite Beletsky\u2019s frivolous suggestion that a <em>completed </em>transfer would extinguish Wisconsin\u2019s custody over him, his purpose in bringing his petition was to <em>prevent </em>the transfer, not to challenge the fact or duration of his present custody. Beletsky could have resorted to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or to the ADA to pursue his objections to transfer, <em>see Moran, </em>218 F.3d at 651, but neither \u00a7 2241 nor \u00a7 2254 was an appropriate vehicle for the relief he sought. And as this case illustrates, the difference between these provisions is not one of mere labels; Beletsky already had two strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and averted a third plus the higher filing fee for civil cases when he characterized his petition as one for habe-as corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">We hasten to add that Beletsky should not misunderstand our statement that he <em>could have </em>proceeded under \u00a7 1983 or the ADA as an invitation to do so. Both <em>Pischke </em>and <em>Moran </em>make clear that Belet-sky\u2019s constitutional arguments are \u201cthoroughly frivolous.\u201d <em>Pischke, </em>178 F.3d at 500; <em>see Moran, </em>218 F.3d at 651. Moreover, to the extent Beletsky wants Wisconsin to \u201caccommodate\u201d his alleged disability by keeping him at Fox Lake where he can continue to participate in the veterans\u2019 support group, the eleventh amendment would foreclose any such action under the ADA in federal court. <em>See Walker v. Snyder, </em>213 F.3d 344, 346-47 (7th Cir.2000), <em>cert denied, </em>531 U.S. 1190, 121 S.Ct. 1188, 149 L.Ed.2d 104 (2001). Beletsky\u2019s only potential course of action under the ADA lies in state court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">Since Beletsky\u2019s habeas corpus petition and his appeal of its denial are frivolous, he accumulates two strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>\u00a7 1915(g); <em>see also Moran, </em>218 F.3d at 651-52. This brings Beletsky\u2019s total number of strikes to four. Accordingly he is barred from bringing future civil suits <em>in forma pauperis. See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
