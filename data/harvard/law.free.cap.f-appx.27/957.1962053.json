R.App. P. 34(a)(2). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Mr. Garcia, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) in order to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. For the reasons stated below, we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">In 1996, Mr. Garcia pleaded guilty to one violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3 (acting as an accessory after the fact to a federal crime) and 2119 (carjacking) and one violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence [here, the carjacking]). Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Garcia\u2019s plea agreement, the trial court imposed a 240 month term of imprisonment. Mr. Garcia appealed his conviction; we affirmed both the conviction and sentence on August 7, 1997. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>No. 96-2152, 1997 WL 446910 (10th Cir. Aug.7, 1997) (unpublished disposition). Mr. Garcia did not elect to seek certiorari in the United States Supreme Court; hence, Mr. Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence became final ninety days after our August 7, 1997 order and judgment. <em>See </em>Sup.Ct. R. 13(1) (establishing a ninety-day window during which a defendant may seek certiorari from a judgment of a federal court of appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">On April 30, 2001, Mr. Garcia filed his first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition; that petition is the subject of this appeal. In his petition, Mr. Garcia raises a number of arguments predicated upon his contention that \u00a7 2119, which underlies each of the charges to which he pleaded guilty, is unconstitutional. In Mr. Garcia\u2019s view, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), dictates the conclusion that Congress exceeded its Commerce Clause power in enacting \u00a7 2119. Thus, according to Mr. Garcia, he is 1) \u201cactually innocent\u201d of violating \u00a7 2119, Rec. doc. 3, at 2 (Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration), and 2) the federal district in which Mr. Garcia was convicted lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">The district court first dismissed Mr. Garcia\u2019s petition as untimely in light of \u00a7 2255\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. On Mr. Garcia\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, however, the district court recognized that a claim of actual innocence provides, in at least some circumstances, a means of avoiding the \u00a7 2255 time bar. <em>See Bous-ley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623-24, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (remanding for consideration of whether \u00a7 2255 petitioner Mr. Bousley could demonstrate actual innocence and thereby overcome his procedural default). Nevertheless, the district court concluded that \u00a7 2119 remains constitutional even after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number><em>Morrison; </em>thus, in the district court\u2019s view, Mr. Garcia could not demonstrate either actual innocence or lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Pursuant to <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam), we liberally construe Mr. Garcia\u2019s contentions. We agree with Mr. Garcia that, in at least certain circumstances, claims of actual innocence do permit a petitioner to avoid the \u00a7 2255 time bar. Because, however, we also agree with the district court that \u00a7 2119 survives <em>Morrison, </em>we need not here determine whether Mr. Garcia\u2019s claim is properly characterized as one of \u2018actual innocence.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">In <em>Morrison, </em>the Supreme Court held that portions of the Violence Against Women Act exceeded Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power; the Court concluded that Congress may not regulate \u201cnoneconomic, violent criminal conduct based <em>solely </em>on that conduct\u2019s aggregate effect on interstate commerce.\u201d 529 U.S. at 617, 120 S.Ct. 1740 (emphasis added). Section 2119 criminalizes particular carjackings based not solely upon the aggregate effect of carjackings but, rather, based upon an individualized determination that the automobile in question \u201chas been transported, shipped, or received in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d \u00a7 2119. Thus, \u00a7 2119 remains constitutional after <em>Mon\u00f1son. See United States v. Taylor, </em>226 F.3d 593, 598-600 (7th Cir.2000) (upholding the constitutionality of \u00a7 2119 in the face of a <em>Morrison </em>challenge); <em>cf. United States v. Malone, </em>222 F.3d 1286, 1294-95 (10th Cir. 2000) (upholding the constitutionality of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, in the face of a <em>Morrison </em>challenge); <em>United States v. Romero, </em>122 F.3d 1334, 1339 (10th Cir.1997) (upholding the constitutionality of \u00a7 2119 following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 551-568, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (another case limiting the Commerce Clause power)).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">To be entitled to a COA, Mr. Garcia must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Mr. Garcia may make this showing by demonstrating that the issues he raises are debatable among jurists, that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">Having reviewed Mr. Garcia\u2019s request for a COA, his appellate brief, the district court\u2019s orders, and the appellate record, we conclude that Mr. Garcia has failed to make the required showing for a COA. Accordingly, and for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s June 4, 2001 order, we DENY Mr. Garcia\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b982-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judica-ta, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
