RApp. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">James A. Anderson was convicted of conspiring to receive and distribute child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) and (b)(1); transporting child pornography in interstate commerce via delivery service in violation of \u00a7 2252(a)(1); and electronically transporting child pornography in interstate commerce in violation of \u00a7 2252(a)(1). The district court sentenced him to 104 months and to a three-year term of supervised release on each count, to be served concurrently. The district court also ordered him to pay $60,000 in restitution to an exploited child\u2019s family and imposed $300.00 in special assessments. Mr. Anderson appeals from that part of his sentence that was enhanced based on relevant conduct of one of his co-conspirators. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The facts are undisputed. Mr. Anderson was a member of a nationwide group called the Orchid Club, the purpose of which was to exchange new and rare child pornography, including private pictures produced by group members with access to children. Mr. Anderson participated in an online chat room discussion in February 1996 when Ronald Riva, one of the members, announced that Ashley, his daughter\u2019s ten-year-old friend, was spending the night at his house. He stated that she had volunteered to participate in a sexual video but that he did not have a camera at that time. Before he left the chat room, Mr. Anderson stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to miss Ashley.\u201d R. Vol. 6, at 611 (quoting Ex. 59 at 8). In March 1996, Mr. Anderson was again online when Mr. Riva stated that Ashley would again be spending the night and that he was excited about it. On April 2, 1996, Riva sexually molested Ashley, recording it by video live and on-line for club members\u2019 benefit. While Mr. Anderson was not on-line the night the video was created and transmitted, he later received still pictures of Ashley\u2019s molestation that he stored on a private drive with the files labeled \u201cAsh 1\u201d through \u201cAsh 9.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">After conviction, the United States proposed calculating Mr. Anderson\u2019s base offense level using U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1 because Mr. Anderson\u2019s offense of conviction involved causing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a visual depiction of that conduct. Even though Mr. Anderson had not himself physically engaged in the child\u2019s sexual exploitation, under the Guidelines he could be held accountable for Mr. Riva\u2019s conduct if it was a \u201creasonably foreseeable act ... of [another] in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d USSG \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). The district court agreed, noting that it could consider \u201cany explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.\u201d R. Vol. 1, Doc. 168 at 8 (quoting \u00a7 lB1.3(a) cmt.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>The court noted that the government had proved that: \u201c[Mr. Anderson] had notice of [the molestation] prior to its occurrence\u201d and that he \u201creceived a still picture [of the child] after the incident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. The court further cited the trial exhibits and testimony presented at the sentencing hearing that specifically demonstrated Mr. Anderson\u2019s knowledge of Mr. Riva\u2019s intended conduct and the purpose of the Orchid Club. The court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-5\">Based on the government\u2019s proffer of evidence at the sentencing hearing and the exhibits that were admitted, the court finds that use of the cross-reference [to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)] is warranted. The conduct of defendant\u2019s co-conspirators was reasonably foreseeable given the purpose of the Orchid Club and the on-line conversations that occurred regarding this conduct. <em>See </em>Government\u2019s Exhibit 59 at 7-8; Government\u2019s Exhibit 60 at 171-72, 176. Furthermore, given the purpose of the Orchid Club, such conduct was also in furtherance of the jointly undertaken activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">On appeal, Mr. Anderson raises a single legal issue: whether the above-described statements of the district court constitute sufficient factual findings to support its conclusion that Riva\u2019s conduct was foreseeable to Mr. Anderson. Mr. Anderson asserts that the court\u2019s statements were only legal conclusions and that \u201c[t]here were no factual findings ... of what conduct the defendant engaged in to make the acts of the Orchid Club foreseeable to him.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">We review questions of law regarding the application of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Tagore, </em>158 F.3d 1124, 1127 (10th Cir.1998). When basing an offense level upon the conduct of co-conspirators, \u201c[p]roper attribution at sentencing requires the district court to analyze, and make \u2018particularized findings\u2019 about, the scope of the specific agreement the individual defendant joined in relation to the conspiracy as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Melton, </em>131 F.3d 1400, 1404 (10th Cir.1997) (citing <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>114 F.3d 228, 234 (D.C.Cir.1997)). \u201c[E]ven a \u2018brief finding can be sufficient if, when viewed in context, it is more than simply a generalized or conclusory finding that [the defendant] was involved in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>114 F.3d at 255 (quotation omitted) (alteration in original) <em>(disagreed with on other grounds in United States v. Delatorre, </em>157 F.3d 1205 (10th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">We read the court\u2019s statement that it \u201c[b]ased\u201d its legal conclusions on the government\u2019s proffered evidence as indicative that the court adopted the government\u2019s position and found that (1) Mr. Anderson \u201chad notice of [Rivas\u2019 intent to molest and exploit Ashely] prior to its occurrence\u201d and (2) he had \u201creceived a still picture of [Ashley] after the incident.\u201d R. Vol. 1, Doc. 168 at 9. Reading these findings in context with the court\u2019s reference to specific exhibits and testimony establishing Mr. Anderson\u2019s individual knowledge and conduct regarding Ashley\u2019s molestation and exploitation, we hold that the district court made sufficiently particularized findings to support its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
