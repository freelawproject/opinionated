The district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 235 months\u2019 imprisonment and four years\u2019 supervised release. The court also imposed a $20,000 fine and $400 in special assessments. Harris filed a notice of appeal, but his counsel seeks to withdraw because he is unable to identify a nonfrivolous basis for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Harris filed a reply under Circuit Rule 51(b) in which he objects to counsel\u2019s motion and requests the appointment of new counsel. Because counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief is facially adequate, we limit our review of the record to the issues raised in counsel\u2019s brief and Harris\u2019 response. <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Counsel first addresses whether Harris could make a nonfrivolous argument that the district court failed to comply with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure when taking his pleas. At Harris\u2019 plea colloquy, the district court first determined that Harris was competent to enter a plea, then advised him in open court of the nature of the charges against him, the potential penalties, and the rights he would waive by pleading guilty. The court questioned Harris to ensure that he was not forced or coerced into pleading guilty, that an adequate factual basis for the pleas existed, and that he had discussed his decision to plead guilty with his lawyer. The district court thus substantially complied with the requirements of Rule 11. Moreover, at no point has Harris sought to withdraw his guilty plea. Thus, whether we reviewed the Rule 11 proceeding under a plain error standard, <em>see United States v. Driver, </em>242 F.3d 767, 769 (7th Cir.2001), or under a harmless error standard, <em>see United States v. Vonn, </em>224 F.3d 1152, 1155 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. granted, </em>531 U.S. 1189, 121 S.Ct. 1185, 149 L.Ed.2d 102 (2001), we would agree with counsel that any argument that Harris\u2019 plea colloquy was deficient is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Counsel next evaluates Harris\u2019 sentencing, and concludes that any challenge would be frivolous. Although Harris initially objected to several calculations in the probation officer\u2019s report, he withdrew his objections. And by affirmatively withdrawing his objections to the PSR, Harris waived his right to appellate review of those objections. <em>See United States v. Scanga, </em>225 F.3d 780, 783 (7th Cir.2000). Although Harris argues that his relevant history was not proved by a preponderance of the evidence, this was among the objections he waived. Counsel also addresses whether Harris could challenge his sentence based on <em>Apprendi. </em>We agree with counsel that any challenge based on <em>Apprendi </em>would not apply because Harris\u2019 sentence falls below the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii); <em>Talbott v. Indiana, </em>226 F.3d 866 (7th Cir. 2000). Thus any appeal challenging Harris\u2019 sentencing would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">Since Harris has no nonfrivolous issues for appeal, the motion to withdraw is GRANTED, the appeal is DISMISSED, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>and Harris\u2019 motion for appointment of substitute counsel therefore is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
