Hospital Center at Orange, </em>116 N.J. 7, 560 A.2d 1169, 1173 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The district court found that Broad-com\u2019s California claims were precluded because they arose from the same transaction as the New Jersey case. According to the district court, Broadcom failed to raise them as an affirmative defense in the New Jersey Action, where it could have argued that it could not possibly have misappropriated Sarnoffs technology in 1997 because Sarnoff had originally misappropriated it from Broadcom in 1994-95 (by violating the 1994 Joint Nondisclosure Agreement). The court reasoned that, because Broadcom possessed this potential affirmative defense, it was obligated under the entire controversy doctrine to litigate its present claims in that forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In fact, Broadcom brings two sets of claims in California: one relating to false advertising (the \u201cLanham Act\u201d claims) and one for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that Broadcom\u2019s claims that Sarnoff misappropriated trade secrets in violation of the nondisclosure agreement are so entangled with the misappropriation claims previously litigated in New Jersey that they are barred by the entire controversy doctrine. <em>Wm. Blanchard Co. v. Beach Concrete Co., </em>150 N.J.Super. 277, 375 A.2d 675, 684 (1977) (holding precluded subsequent claims that share facts which render them \u201cinextricably bound... to the matters which were already placed in controversy\u201d in an earlier case).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">However, we do not believe that Broadcom\u2019s claims under the Lanham Act are precluded under the entire controversy doctrine. These claims present no issues that would be a constituent component of the New Jersey claims and nothing that requires determination before the New Jersey case could proceed. Adjudicating false advertising claims would not amount to a \u201crerun\u201d of the New Jersey case, especially since the primary witnesses involved (clients to whom the false advertising was made) would have had no role in the New Jersey action. We thus reverse the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part. The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-15\">.

The doctrine is also referenced in the 1947 New Jersey Constitution, which confers authority on the courts to grant legal and equitable relief \"in any cause so that all matters in controversy between the parties may be completely determined.\u201d N.J.
