After the individual defendants were dismissed, Crawford &amp; Company moved for summary judgment. Crawford &amp; Company argued that Foster\u2019s Title VII claim should be barred under the doctrine of claim preclusion because Foster raised a Title VII claim against Crawford <em>&amp; </em>Company in a prior suit which was dismissed. The District Court granted Crawford &amp; Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Foster\u2019s Title VII action was barred by claim preclusion, and dismissed Foster\u2019s complaint in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-19\">We have carefully considered Foster\u2019s arguments in this appeal. We hold that they lack merit. For the reasons substantially stated in Judge Hayden\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion, we affirm the Judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
