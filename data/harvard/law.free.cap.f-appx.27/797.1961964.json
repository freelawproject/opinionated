We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 &amp; 2253(d) and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-15\">Because the AEDPA applies, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), in order to succeed, Owens must demonstrate that the state court adjudication of the merits of his claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1523, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir. 2000) <em>cert. denied </em>531 U.S. 944, 121 S.Ct. 340, 148 L.Ed.2d 274 (2000) (defining \u201cunreasonable applications\u201d as involving situations where the state court has committed clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-16\">Owens contends that his conviction must be reversed because the trial court allowed his incriminating statement, made to a corrections officer, to be admitted at trial despite the fact that he had not received warnings pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S;Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number><em>Miranda </em>was never intended to restrict law enforcement officers ability to conduct on the scene questioning to \u201cdetermine whether a crime has been committed or is in progress.\u201d <em>Lowe v. United States, </em>407 F.2d 1391, 1393-94 (9th Cir.1969). In determining whether questioning of a prisoner qualifies as on the scene questioning or impermissible interrogation, a court should examine: the language used to summon the individual, the physical surroundings of the interrogation, the extent to which the prisoner is confronted with evidence of his guilt, and the additional pressure exerted to detain him. <em>Cervantes v. Walker, </em>589 F.2d 424, 427-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The record here shows that: Owens detainment in a holding cell was a routine procedure incident to a medical examination; that he was not confronted with any evidence of his guilt; and that Lieutenant Smith, the facility lieutenant, questioned Owens as a spontaneous reaction to the alarm being raised, and was intended only to determine what had happened, whether a crime was continuing, and what immediate actions needed to be taken. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s determination that no <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required was not clear error, and that Owens Fifth Amendment rights were not violated. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Finally, even were we to assume that Owens\u2019s incriminating statements were admitted in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>we conclude that admission of the statements was harmless error. <em>See Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 295-96, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (holding that admission of evidence obtained in violation of Miranda is subject to harmless error analysis). As reflected in the record, Owens made equally incriminating and substantially similar statements to the assistant medical technician who examined him after the altercation. He has not contested the admission of these statements at trial, and the state court\u2019s finding that Owens uttered those statements therefore is presumed correct. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that the admission of Owens\u2019s statements to the corrections officer could not have had a substantial or injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\"> This, disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
