Levi pled guilty to wire fraud, aiding and abetting wire fraud, use of false identification to commit wire and mail fraud, interstate transportation of stolen property, and wire fraud while on release. After filing a timely appeal, defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and a brief in support of this motion pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Defense counsel determined after a conscientious review of the record that \u201cthere are no non-frivolous issues for review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-20\">In accordance with the mandate of An-ders, we have performed an independent review of the record to determine whether it presents any non-frivolous issues that would justify review. Because we conclude that it does not, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court and grant defense\u2019s counsel motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-21\">Counsel identified one arguable non-frivolous issue for review in his brief: whether the District Court abused its discretion by departing only one level downward in response to appellant\u2019s motion to depart on the ground that appellant\u2019s crimes were committed while he was suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity. We lack jurisdiction to review an exercise of discretion by a District Court in granting or denying a departure. <em>United States v. Denardi, </em>892 F.2d 269 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-22\">The appeal will be dismissed for want of jurisdiction insofar as it asks us to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the failure to grant a greater departure. The judgment of the District Court mil be affirmed and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw will be granted. Further, pursuant to L.A.R. 109.2(b), we find that \u201cthe issues presented in the appeal lack legal merit for purposes of counsel filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
