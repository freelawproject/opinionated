Bolar\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising three issues but asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Bolar has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. We affirm the conviction, dismiss Bolar\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s decision not to depart, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Bolar sold 53.87 grams of crack to an informant in the presence of an undercover agent. Another 79.27 grams of crack was found in a bag in his yard after Bolar agreed to sell the informant 4.5 ounces (127.5 grams) of crack, then failed to show up as arranged. Bolar did not contest the probation officer\u2019s recommendation that he was responsible for 133 grams of crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, Bolar\u2019s appellate counsel suggests that the government may have violated the plea agreement by not moving for a downward departure for substantial assistance. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. Bolar\u2019s previous attorney conceded at sentencing that Bolar\u2019s assistance to that point could not be considered substantial. Because the question of a possible breach of the plea agreement was not raised below, we review the issue for plain error only, <em>see United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), and find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Bolar also contests the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a departure based on the fact that he suffers from ulcerative colitis. The court\u2019s determination that Bolar\u2019s condition was not \u201can extraordinary physical impairment,\u201d <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 5H1.4, p.s., and thus did not warrant a departure, is not reviewable. <em>See United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Next, Bolar claims that his former attorney rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise him about the possible penalties he faced before he entered his guilty plea, and in failing to argue that the government had a duty under the plea agreement to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a departure based on substantial assistance. Because the record in this case does not conclusively demonstrate that Bolar received ineffective assistance, this claim must be made in a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>62 F.3d 641, 651 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">After the parties filed their briefs on appeal, the Supreme Court held that, other than a prior conviction, \u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Because <em>Apprendi </em>was decided while Bolar\u2019s case was on direct review, we must apply the rule of <em>Apprendi </em>to his appeal. <em>See Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Bolar\u2019s guilty plea is unaffected by <em>Apprendi See United States v. Dinnall, </em>269 F.3d 418, 423 n. 3 (4th Cir.2001) (validity of guilty plea to drug offense involving an unspecified quantity of drugs is not called into question when defendant receives a sentence in excess of the sentence authorized under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)); <em>United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 160 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc) (conviction for unspecified quantity of drugs is not error), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Sept. 20, 2001 (No. 01-6398).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">However, Bolar\u2019s 280-month sentence exceeded the applicable statutory maximum penalty for the crime of which he was convicted. Because drug quantity was not charged in the indictment, Bolar was subject to a statutory maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), for his- conviction. <em>Promise, </em>255 F.3d at 152 (applying <em>Apprendi </em>to drug offenses in \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, and holding that drug quantity \u201cmust be treated as [an] element[ ] of an aggravated drug trafficking offense\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)(B), not merely a sentencing factor). Bolar\u2019s sentence of 280 months imprisonment for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>conviction was thus plainly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 156-57, 160. The total maximum sentence to which Bolar was exposed was twenty years because he was convicted of a single count<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and the government did not seek an enhanced sentence based on his prior felony drug convictions pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (1994). The error thus affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>261 F.3d 397, 406-07 (4th Cir.2001) (holding that sentence exceeding maximum authorized by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) for offense involving unspecified drug quantity is plain error affecting substantial rights and is jurisdictional in nature), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>Oct. 31, 2001 (No. 01-687). Bolar was charged with possession of an unspecified quantity of crack with intent to distribute, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), but he \u201creceived a sentence for a crime\u2014 an aggravated drug trafficking offense under section 841(b)(1)(A) \u2014 with which [he was] <em>neither </em>charged <em>nor </em>convicted.\u201d <em>Cotton, </em>261 F.3d at 404. In <em>Cotton, </em>we concluded that an error of this nature is \u201cfundamental,\u201d and \u201cseriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\u201d and that, consequently, we are \u201cat liberty to correct it.\u201d <em>Cotton, </em>261 F.3d at 405 (internal quotations and citations omitted). We explicitly rejected the government\u2019s argument that overwhelming evidence of drug quantity can excuse the error. <em>Id. </em>at 407. We therefore exercise our discretion to notice the error, vacate Bolar\u2019s sentence, and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Promise. See </em>USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and, other than that noted above, find none. We therefore affirm Bolar\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for resen-tencing. We dismiss that portion of the appeal that challenges the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward. This court requires that counsel inform the client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b229-6\"> When the defendant has been convicted of multiple counts and the guideline range exceeds the highest statutory maximum, the district court must impose consecutive terms of imprisonment to achieve a sentence within the guideline range. <em>United States v.
