Parker appeals her sentence, arguing that the district court erred in refusing to consider the substantial assistance motion filed in her husband\u2019s case as equally applicable in her case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Parker and her husband, Jermaine, distributed crack to informants on multiple occasions. After they were arrested, Jermaine cooperated. At his sentencing, the government requested a downward departure for substantial assistance pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2000) (authorizing a sentence below the guideline range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(e) (West 2000) (authorizing a departure below the mandatory minimum sentence). The government did not move for a departure in Parker\u2019s case because she provided no useful information and, although she was free on bond prior to sentencing, she did not attempt to cooperate or assist the government during that time. Parker argued that the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion filed in her husband\u2019s case should be considered in her case as well because (1) her case was so closely connected to her husband\u2019s case that a sort of marital privilege should apply, (2) she lacked the valuable information he possessed, and (3) she had encouraged him to cooperate.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court determined that Parker had no marital right to benefit from the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion filed in Jermaine\u2019s case and that it had no authority to inquire into the government\u2019s decision not to file a motion in her case because there was no evidence that the government\u2019s decision was based on an unconstitutional motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision. The appeals court lacks authority to review the district court\u2019s decision not to depart downward unless the court\u2019s decision is based on a mistaken belief that it lacks authority to depart. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>188 F.3d 230, 238-39 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1130, 120 S.Ct. 968, 145 L.Ed.2d 839 (2000). Parker does not contend that the district court failed to understand its authority to depart on the ground she urged, but that the district court <em>ought </em>to have the authority to depart based on her husband\u2019s cooperation and the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion filed in his case. We cannot so hold. When the government has not obligated itself to move for a substantial assistance departure, the district court may review the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to move for a departure only if the defendant makes a substantial threshold showing that the government\u2019s decision was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); see <em>also United States v. LeRose, </em>219 F.3d 335, 342 (4th Cir.2000). Parker did not assert in the district court that the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ment had any unconstitutional motive for deciding not to move for a departure in her case, and she does not make that argument on appeal. The record contains no evidence that would support such a finding. Consequently, Parker has not shown that the district court erred in finding that she was not entitled to benefit from the motion filed in her husband\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-12\"> Parker\u2019s testimony at sentencing did not establish that her husband\u2019s cooperation was due solely to her influence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
