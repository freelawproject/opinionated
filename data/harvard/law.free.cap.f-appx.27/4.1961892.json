Given the highly deferential standard applicable to review of state court judgments by federal courts under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">We state the facts briefly. Petitioner was one of three young males charged in the stabbing death of a 73-year-old man in an alley in Lowell, Massachusetts, late on the night of September 18, 1988. Two of the young men, including petitioner, were charged as joint venturers, with only the third accused of directly committing the attack. Trial evidence pointed to petitioner as owner of one of two knives used in the killing, and he was alleged to have encouraged the friend who initiated the stabbing to \u201cfinish off\u2019 the seriously wounded victim to prevent identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Several hours after the crime, at about 3 a.m., petitioner was stopped in the vicinity for questioning by police officers. He was asked to remove a shoe for comparison with footprints found at the murder scene and was told his print matched, an assertion that appears to have been an intentional misrepresentation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Petitioner agreed to accompany the officers to the police station. He was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and eventually signed two statements admitting his presence at the crime scene. He also agreed to a blood test that showed traces of another individual\u2019s blood on his hand. Petitioner claims these statements and blood test results were obtained involuntarily and thus were admitted into evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Haynes v. Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 513-14, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-14\">Petitioner cites a number of factors to support his contention that the officers obtained the challenged evidence by overbearing his will, including his age (seventeen), his limited education (ninth grade), the time of day (early hours of the morning), his fatigue, his lack of contact with a lawyer or guardian, and the officers\u2019 intentional misstatement that they had evidence placing him at the murder scene. He asserts that the totality of these circumstances compels the conclusion that his cooperation with the officers was involuntary, requiring suppression of the inculpa-tory evidence resulting from the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-15\">Whether or not this would be a close case on direct review, it is far from that in its present posture. To obtain a writ of habeas corpus, petitioner must show both that the Commonwealth denied his constitutional rights and that the Massachusetts courts made a determination that was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, federal law in rejecting his claim. <em>See McCambridge v. Hall, </em>266 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2001); <em>Hurtado v. Tucker, </em>245 F.3d 7, 16 (1st Cir.2001); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A state court deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>mination is unreasonable only if it is \u201cso offensive to existing precedent, so devoid of record support, or so arbitrary, as to indicate that it is outside the universe of plausible, credible outcomes.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien v. Dubois, </em>145 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.1998); <em>see also Williams v. Matesanz, </em>230 F.3d 421, 425 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">This is not such a case. During his six hours of detention, petitioner was unrestrained, afforded access to a restroom, and offered coffee. He was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before giving the statements or consenting to the blood test. Although the hour was late, the trial court found no evidence of weariness, and petitioner can point to no evidence in the record that he was sleep-deprived. He was stopped on the street, not taken from his home. Indeed, petitioner was alert enough, and comfortable enough, to point out a typographical error in the transcription of his first statement. The officers\u2019 fabrication of evidence adverse to petitioner-the supposed footprints-is insufficient in this context to render unreasonable the state courts\u2019 conclusion that he acted voluntarily. There is no evidence of a causal connection between the deception and either petitioner\u2019s willingness to accompany the officers to the police station or his later decision, after <em>Miranda </em>warnings, to give a statement and allow the blood test. <em>See United States v. Byram, </em>145 F.3d 405, 408 (1st Cir.1998) (\u201ctrickery is not automatically coercion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Petitioner maintains that the state trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable because the judge did not explicitly consider all of the relevant factors in a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d review. He points out, for example, that the judge\u2019s decision failed to address his age, lack of education, and the footprint deception. The district court, however, carefully reviewed each of the factors raised by petitioner in concluding that, even \u201ctaken together,\u201d they do not permit a finding that the state court unreasonably applied federal law in rejecting petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim. Our own review leads us to the same determination. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying the application for a writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-11\">. A police report detailed this exchange between petitioner and officers, but the officers involved testified at a suppression hearing more than two years later that they did not recall asking for the shoe or observing that it matched footprints at the crime scene. Testimony at trial indicated that, in fact, no footprints had been found at the scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b29-17\">. Petitioner does not argue that the state court ruling was \"contrary to\u201d clearly estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>lished federal law or, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2), that it was \"based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d We therefore consider only whether the decision represented an \"unreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
