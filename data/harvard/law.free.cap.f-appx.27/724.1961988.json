We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Teal\u2019s habeas petition, <em>see Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 484 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 908, 121 S.Ct. 254, 148 L.Ed.2d 183 (2000). We vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">Teal contends that his \u00a7 2254 petition was timely filed because the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s (\u201cAED-PA\u201d) one-year limitation period was tolled during the pendency of his state habeas petitions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-12\">The AEDPA\u2019s limitation period began to run when Teal\u2019s state conviction became final on August 11, 1998. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); <em>Bowen v. Roe, </em>188 F.3d 1157, 1158-59 (9th Cir.1999). The AEDPA limitations period was tolled during the pendency of his properly filed applications for state post-conviction relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1104, 120 S.Ct. 1846, 146 L.Ed.2d 787 (2000). This includes the 30-day period after the California Supreme Court denied each state habeas petition, because each denial was not final until 30 days after filing. <em>Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>262 F.3d 973 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-15\">Because Teal filed his first state habeas petition before his conviction became final, the limitation period did not begin to run until January 21, 1999, when the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of the first state petition became final. The limitation period was also tolled during the pendency of Teal\u2019s second state petition filed on October 14, 1999,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the denial of which did not become final until January 20, 2000. At this time, Teal had 99 days to file a timely federal habeas petition; he did so on March 6, 2000, with 53 days remaining on the one-year clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">Although the district court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>that decision is applicable in this instance. Because <em>Bunney </em>renders Teal\u2019s federal habeas petition timely, we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-17\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b749-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
