The government counters that it was not bound by the plea agreement because Diaz violated its terms when he provided a false statement to Probation Services for inclusion in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">It is well established that if a defendant fails to fulfill his promises under a plea agreement, the government is released from its obligations under it. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Santiago-Gonzalez, </em>66 F.3d 3, 6 (1st Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Baldacchino, </em>762 F.2d 170, 179 (1st Cir.1985). The plea agreement here explicitly stated that it was binding on the government only if Diaz pleaded guilty to the specified offenses and \u201c[d]id not engage in any conduct which may constitute obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 of the guidelines.\u201d Obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 includes \u201cproviding materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence report or other investigation for the court.\u201d \u00a7 3C1.1 comment. (n. 4(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-15\">Diaz violated the agreement when he submitted a statement of responsibility to the probation office in which he stated that he had not used a \u201creal\u201d gun during the bank robbery. By claiming that he had used an air gun during the robbery, Diaz denied an essential element of at least two of the offenses to which he pleaded guilty. In addition to pleading guilty to conspiracy and armed robbery charges, Diaz pleaded guilty to using a \u201cfirearm\u201d during and in relation to a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and being a felon in possession of a \u201cfirearm\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3)(A). Neither a pellet gun nor a BB gun are firearms within the meaning of the statute or the Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3)(A); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 comment. (n.l(e)). The government had extrinsic evidence, as well as Diaz\u2019s own admission at the plea hearing, that Diaz used a 9 mm firearm during the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-16\">Diaz relies on the sentencing court\u2019s decision to not enhance his sentence for obstruction of justice to bolster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>his contention that he did not breach the plea agreement. Judge Lagueux\u2019s discretionary decision, however, does not amount to a finding that Diaz did not obstruct justice within the meaning of the Guidelines. To the contrary, the. sentencing court found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Diaz had brandished a 9 mm firearm during the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Having found no error in the proceedings below, we hereby affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. Loe. R. 27(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
