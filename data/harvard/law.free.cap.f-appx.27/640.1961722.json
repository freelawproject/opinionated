Farrington pleaded guilty to four counts of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). The district court sentenced him to four concurrent terms of 127 months\u2019 incarceration and three years\u2019 supervised release, and also ordered him to pay $175,075 in restitution to four victim banks., On appeal Farrington argues under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) that he should be resentenced because the district judge owned stock in one of the banks. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-19\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b665-20\">In July 2000 Tomah, Wisconsin police arrested Farrington for car theft. On July 10, 2000, Farrington confessed to committing four bank robberies (two in Minnesota, two in Wisconsin) from January to June 2000. Farrington robbed each of the banks by threatening to detonate hoax bombs.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-21\">On July 20, 2000, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment in the Western District of Wisconsin charging Farrington with robbing the First Federal Bank in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin and the M &amp; I Bank in Wausau, Wisconsin in violation of \u00a7 2113(a). On August 1, 2000, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the District of Minnesota charging him with robbing the Norwest Bank in Albert Lea, Minnesota and the Merchants National Bank in Rochester, Minnesota in violation of \u00a7 2113(a). On September 21, 2000, Farrington pleaded guilty to both Wisconsin counts. He also agreed to have the Minnesota charges transferred to Wisconsin and then pleaded guilty to those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The case then proceeded to sentencing. The probation officer determined Farring-ton\u2019s offense level to be 28, his criminal history category to be 4, and his guideline imprisonment range to be 110-137 months. Neither Farrington nor the government objected to the presentence investigation report. On November 30, 2000, Judge Shabaz sentenced Farrington to four concurrent terms of 137 months\u2019 incarceration, three years\u2019 supervised release, and ordered him to pay $175,075 in restitution. That same day the court docketed the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">On December 14, Farrington, acting pro se, filed a notice of appeal and a request to proceed in forma pauperis. The next day the district court denied his request to proceed in forma pauperis because his appeal was untimely under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(b)(1), which allows criminal defendants ten days to appeal. On December 21, this court ordered Far-rington to file a memorandum by January 4, 2001, stating why his untimely appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The order also stated that Far-rington could file a motion for additional time to appeal with the district court. Six days later Farrington filed a motion with the district court to extend the time to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">On January 3, 2001, one day before this court\u2019s deadline to submit a jurisdictional memorandum, Farrington\u2019s counsel filed with this court a motion to withdraw. On January 26, this court granted the motion and appointed new counsel to represent Farrington. On February 16, Farrington, now represented by a different lawyer, filed a new motion with the district court to extend the time to appeal under Rule 4(b). Four days later the district court granted Farrington\u2019s motion, giving him until March 5 to file his notice of appeal. He filed his notice of appeal on March 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The next day the district court issued an order construing Farrington\u2019s notice of appeal as a request to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. The court denied the request because the notice did not state the issues he wished to raise on appeal. Judge Shabaz, however, also disclosed that he owned stock in the parent of one of the victim banks: \u201cRetrospectively, the undersigned may have been required in Case No. 00-CR-85-S-01 to disclose that from July 11, 2000, to February 15, 2001, he owned 366 shares of stock in Wells Fargo Bank.\u201d (App.15.) The Norwest Bank, one of the banks robbed by Farrington, is owned by Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">On appeal Farrington argues for the first time that Judge Shabaz should have recused himself under \u00a7 455(a) because his stock ownership in Wells Fargo may have undermined his impartiality. Accordingly, he contends that the case should be remanded for resentencing by a different judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">The government argues that we do not have jurisdiction over Farrington\u2019s appeal because he did not file a petition for a writ of mandamus before the district court. Farrington seeks recusal under \u00a7 455(a), which provides that judges must disqualify themselves in any proceeding in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>circuit, appellate review of judges\u2019 failure to disqualify themselves under \u00a7 455(a) may be obtained only by petitioning the appellate court for a writ of mandamus prior to trial. <em>United States v. Ruzzano, </em>247 F.3d 688, 694 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">This circuit requires parties to seek mandamus while the case is pending before the district court because \u00a7 455(a) violations harm the legal process itself rather than the parties. Unless an error committed during a criminal adjudication affects the substantial rights of an appellant, it is not a basis for reversal on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Troxell, </em>887 F.2d 830, 833 (7th Cir.1989). Judges who proceed in a case when there is only the <em>appearance </em>of impropriety injure the judicial system as a whole and not the substantial rights of the parties. Id. The parties receive a fair adjudication, even though a reasonable member of the public might be in doubt as to its fairness because of misleading appearances. Id. Once the district court proceedings are complete, the harm sought to be avoided (the appearance of impropriety) has already been inflicted in the form of damages to the public image of the judiciary. Id. Thus, parties must act promptly in seeking a writ of mandamus to avoid that harm at the outset rather than wait until judgment has been entered. Id.; <em>but see United States v. Boyd, </em>208 F.3d 638, 650 (Ripple, J., dissenting) (urging this circuit to join every other circuit in permitting appellate review of a failure to recuse under \u00a7 455(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Parties who fail to petition for a writ of mandamus while the case is pending before the district court waive the right to request recusal under \u00a7 455(a). <em>Ruzzano, </em>247 F.3d at 694; <em>see also United States v. Mathison, </em>157 F.3d 541, 545-6 (8th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Barrett, </em>111 F.3d 947, 952-53 (D.C.Cir.1997). Even though Farrington did not seek recu-sal before the district court, he did not \u201cwaive\u201d the issue because he did not learn until three months after sentencing that the district court owned Wells Fargo stock during the adjudication of his case. <em>See United States v. Walton, </em>255 F.3d 437, 441 (7th Cir.2001) (holding that \u201cwaiver\u201d is an intentional choice not to assert a right).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">This court has twice confronted factual scenarios in which the defendant learned of the factual basis for recusal after trial. In <em>United States v. Ward, </em>211 F.3d 356, 364 (7th Cir.2000), defendant Ward argued that the district judge should have recused himself under \u00a7 455(a) because the judge\u2019s son, a lawyer, was involved in the criminal prosecution of Ward\u2019s fellow gang member. Ward did not learn of the son\u2019s involvement in the other case until after his conviction, before sentencing. <em>Id. </em>The government, citing <em>Troxell, United States v. Bond, </em>847 F.2d 1233, 1241 (7th Cir. 1988), and <em>United States v. Balistrieri, </em>779 F.2d 1191, 1204-05 (7th Cir.1985), argued on appeal that Ward had waived his \u00a7 455(a) claim because he failed to pursue it prior to trial. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Ward </em>court declined to decide the waiver issue because his recusal claim failed on its merits. The court, however, did label the application of the cases cited by the government \u201cdebatable because, given the sequence of events... it is clear that Ward did not discover the information upon which he based his motion for recusal until after his trial was concluded.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">In <em>Ruzzano, </em>the defendant claimed for the first time on appeal that Judge Conlon should have recused herself under \u00a7 455(a) because she served as an Assistant United States\u2019 Attorney at the same time that (and in the same district in which) a grand jury indicted the defendant. <em>Ruzzano, </em>247 F.3d at 693. The defendant did not petition for a writ of mandamus but raised the issue for the first time on appeal after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>discovering that Judge Conlon was an AUSA. <em>Id. </em>at 693-94. The <em>Ruzzano </em>court held that the defendant waived the issue because Judge Conlon\u2019s tenure in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office was a matter of public record. <em>Id. </em>at 694. The <em>Ruzzano </em>court acknowledged, however, that appellate review may be appropriate in some cases: \u201c[w]hile we do not foreclose the possibility that exceptional circumstances might excuse a failure to seek recusal in a timely manner, we do not believe that Ruzzano has shown such a circumstance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Ruzzano </em>court did not specify any special circumstances that might warrant appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Contrary to the government\u2019s position, we conclude that this case presents \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d that confer this court with appellate jurisdiction. Unlike <em>Ruzzano, </em>in which Judge Conlon\u2019s service with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office was a matter of public record, Farrington could not have known of Judge Shabaz\u2019s interest in the case. Athough federal judges must submit financial disclosure forms detailing their financial holdings (including stock ownership), Judge Shabaz\u2019s interest in Wells Fargo would not have been disclosed. He acquired the stock in July 2000, well after the due-date for his 2000 financial disclosure, and sold the stock in February 2001, before his 2001 disclosure was due. Moreover, the clerk\u2019s office for the Western District of Wisconsin does not maintain the disclosure forms of judicial officers in its files. Thus, no amount of diligence on the part of Farrington would have uncovered Judge Shabaz\u2019s interest in Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The government suggests that Farrington should be required to file a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, as opposed to proceeding on direct appeal. But as the government concedes, this court has never authorized collateral challenges seeking recusal without a charge of actual bias. <em>See Troxell, </em>887 F.2d at 833 (noting that charges of actual bias may be reviewed after conviction). The government also fails to demonstrate why a collateral attack is necessary. Because the government has not pointed to any cases in which this circuit has authorized collateral review under these circumstances, and because additional fact-finding is unnecessary, we will review the merits of Farring-ton\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">II. Recusal</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Farrington contends that Judge Shabaz should have recused himself because he owned stock in Wells Fargo. Farrington brings his challenge under \u00a7 455(a) and not \u00a7 455(b)(4), which mandates recusal if a judge or his family has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding. No circuit has applied \u00a7 455(b)(4) in the context of a judge who owns stock in a victim bank. <em>See United States v. Nobel, </em>696 F.2d 231, 234-35 (3d Cir.1982) (concluding that a judge who owns stock in a victim bank does not have a financial interest in the subject matter of the controversy under \u00a7 455(b)(4); thus, \u00a7 455(a) is the correct avenue of analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">\u201cSection 455(a) requires recusal if the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned by a \u2018well-informed, thoughtful observer rather than to a hypersensitive, or unduly suspicious .person.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Regan v. Arbitration Forums, Inc., </em>246 F.3d 975, 988 (7th Cir.2001) (internal quotations omitted). This circuit has not addressed whether judges who own stock in a victim bank should automatically recuse themselves from presiding over the criminal trial. Those circuits that have addressed the recusal issue in similar circumstances have not agreed on a steadfast rule, but have instead proceeded on a case-by-case basis. Three circuits-the Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ond, Fourth, and Ninth-have permitted judges who own stock in the victim bank to preside over the criminal trial. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>119 F.3d 1377 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Sellers, </em>566 F.2d 884 (4th Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Ravich, </em>421 F.2d 1196 (2d Cir.1970). On the other hand, the Third Circuit has concluded that a judge who owns a \u201csubstantial interest\u201d in the victim of a crime must disqualify himself under \u00a7 455(a). <em>Nobel, </em>696 F.2d at 235-36. The <em>Nobel </em>court, however, did not define \u201csubstantial interest.\u201d <em>See also </em>Andrew L. Wright, Comment, <em>Invested in the Outcome: When the Judge Owns Stock in the Victim of a Crime, </em>1998 U. Chi. Legal F. 481 (1998) (advocating bright-line approach whereby judges who own stock in victim banks re-cuse themselves under \u00a7 455(a) regardless of amount of stock involved).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Though this circuit has not squarely addressed the issue, the same rationale behind this court\u2019s mandamus requirement under \u00a7 455(a) leads us to conclude that Farrington cannot demonstrate that his substantial rights have been violated. As this court has noted time and again, the appearance of judicial impropriety under \u00a7 455(a) injures the legal system as a whole and not the substantial rights of individual criminal defendants. <em>See e.g., Troxell, </em>887 F.2d at 833. Moreover, there is no evidence suggesting that the district judge\u2019s stock ownership had any relevance whatsoever in the proceedings below, let alone that it affected the disposition of his case. Indeed, defense counsel conceded at oral argument that Farrington was not harmed by Judge Shabaz\u2019s interest in Wells Fargo. The injury caused by the judge\u2019s stock ownership, if any, has already been incurred, and not to Farring-ton, but to the judicial system as a whole. Farrington therefore cannot demonstrate that his substantial rights have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Consequently, we AFFIRM the sentences imposed by the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
