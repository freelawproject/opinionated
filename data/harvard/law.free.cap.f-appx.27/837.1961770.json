Araujo appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his federal habeas corpus petition. As the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">After the April 23, 1996 effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, we may grant a habeas petition on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court only if that court\u2019s decision was contrary to or involves an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Under AEDPA, we may reverse a state court\u2019s decision as involving an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established federal law only when we are left with a \u201cfirm and definite conviction\u201d that an error has been committed. <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">Because the state courts here did not articulate a rationale for their determination, we cannot review those courts\u2019 \u201capplication\u201d of clearly established law. <em>Delgado v. Lewis, </em>181 F.3d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir.1999). We nonetheless give the same deference to these state court determinations, determining only \u201cwhether, in light of an independent review of the record and the relevant law, the state court\u2019s resolution of a petitioner\u2019s claim was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">Applying this deferential standard of review, we cannot say that the state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law in this case was unreasonable. We need not decide whether Araujo\u2019s statements were solicited in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>Where, as here, a defendant testifies on his own behalf, the prosecution may impeach the defendant with evidence of a prior statement taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>so long as the statement\u2019s trustworthiness satisfies legal standards \u2014 that is, so long as the statement is voluntary. <em>See Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 224, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971). \u201c[C]oercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986). In determining whether the police used coercive activity to undermine Araujo\u2019s ability to exercise his free will, we consider \u201call the surrounding circumstances \u2014 both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation.\u201d <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 226, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). Given the comparatively mild behavior of the detective, the apparent composure of the petitioner during the police interview, and the short duration of the interrogation session, it cannot be said that the state court unreasonably applied this \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d when it deemed Araujo\u2019s statement voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">While we do not wish to condone some of the tactics employed by the detective, there is no evidence of any physical mistreatment or sophisticated psychological abuse by the interrogating authority. <em>Cf. Cooper v. Dupnik, </em>963 F.2d 1220, 1228-31(9th Cir.1992) (en banc); <em>Collazo v. Estelle, </em>940 F.2d 411, 416 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc). Nor is there significant evidence, aside from Araujo\u2019s testimony that he felt \u201cpressure,\u201d that he was psychologically overcome by the tactics. <em>Cf. Henry v. Kernan, </em>197 F.3d 1021, 1027-28 (9th Cir. 1999). Indeed, though he did change his story during the course of the interrogation, Araujo never succumbed to the detective\u2019s alleged \u201cpressure\u201d to confess to criminal wrongdoing (or even to having engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim). This suggests that Araujo\u2019s will was not overborne. Absent a showing that it was, the use of his statement for impeachment purposes was not an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Because Araujo\u2019s petition fails on the merits, we need not reach the question of the applicability of equitable tolling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b862-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
