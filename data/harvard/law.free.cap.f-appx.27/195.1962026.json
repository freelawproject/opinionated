Specifically, Walton pled guilty to seven counts of making false statements in acquiring a firearm, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(a)(6) (West 2000), and was convicted after a bench trial of six additional counts of making false statements in acquiring a firearm, as well as five counts of possession of a firearm by a drug user, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g)(3) (West 2000), conspiring to distribute cocaine base, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1994), and maintaining a crack house, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856 (1994). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Walton\u2019s first challenge on appeal relates to the sufficiency of the evidence to support each set of counts. However, we have reviewed the trial transcript and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and find any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>248 F.3d 260, 273 (4th Cir.) (providing standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 121 S.Ct. 2617, 150 L.Ed.2d 771 (2001). In particular, we note there was sufficient circumstantial evidence of a tacit agreement between Walton and her son Michael Walton to distribute cocaine base from Walton\u2019s home to support Walton\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 846. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>121 F.3d 908, 922 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Walton also challenges the district court\u2019s conversion of cash seized from her son during a search of their home into an equivalent quantity of drugs for sentencing purposes. However, because the money seized was part of the same course of conduct, and the amount of drugs actually seized during the search did not accurately reflect the scale of drug activity charged, we find this assignment of error meritless. <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>948 F.2d 877, 882-83 (4th Cir.1991). Additionally, because Walton received ten-year sentences for her firearms convictions and 151 month sentences for her convictions under \u00a7 846 and \u00a7 856, we find her sentence does not implicate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 153 n. 3, 156-57 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc) (finding sentences below the statutory maximum do not implicate <em>Apprendi ).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">Accordingly, we affirm Walton\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
