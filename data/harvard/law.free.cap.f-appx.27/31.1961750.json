The district court dismissed the complaint against Sanchez under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) for failure to effect timely service. Shepherd submitted a timely process service request to the U.S. Marshals Service, but the Service failed to serve Sanchez because multiple officers at the jail had the name \u201cSanchez.\u201d The district court also granted the defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-24\">Shepherd adheres to the Rastafarian faith. His religious beliefs require that no one else touch his hair. In early April 1996, Shepherd was handcuffed during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>search of his cell. According to Shepherd\u2019s complaint, Captain Sanchez ordered an officer to remove the bandana from Shepherd\u2019s hair. Although Shepherd protested that he could not permit anyone else to touch his hair but would remove the bandana himself, the officer \u201cgrabbed [his] dread locks and removed the bandanna, lifting up and pulling at [his] dread locks. In the process of the officer pulling at [his] dread locks, one of [his] dread locks [was] snatched out of [his] head.\u201d Several days later, while Shepherd was being escorted to the jail\u2019s main clinic, he was stopped by a group of corrections officers who stated that he could not have a bandana around his dreadlocks. Shepherd alleges that he again offered to remove the bandana himself and said that no one else could touch his hair, but that \u201cCaptain Grant snatched my dread locks pulling off my bandana stating, \u2018Fuck you Shepherd, I run this jail, get the fuck out of my face with that religious bull shit.\u2019 \u201d Shepherd\u2019s complaint implicates Warden Ortiz in the incidents solely by alleging his \u201ccontrolling interest\u201d in the prison officials\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the claim against Sanchez for Shepherd\u2019s failure to effect timely service was error. <em>Pro se, </em>incarcerated litigants proceeding <em>informa pauperis </em>are \u201centitled to rely on service by the U.S. Marshals.\u201d <em>Romandette v. Weetabix Co., </em>807 F.2d 309, 311 (2d Cir.1986) (citation omitted). A single effort to serve, abandoned after discovering that multiple officers have the same last name, did not satisfy the Marshals Service\u2019s responsibility. On remand, the district court should permit service out of time and make such orders as it deems appropriate to facilitate proper service of defendant Sanchez. <em>See Valentin v. Dinkins, </em>121 F.3d 72, 76 (2d Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">We review dismissals under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) de novo. <em>Cooper v. Parsky, </em>140 F.3d 433, 440 (2d Cir.1998). All facts alleged in the complaint are taken as true. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, <em>pro se </em>pleadings are construed liberally and as raising \u201cthe strongest arguments that they suggest.\u201d <em>Graham, v. Henderson, </em>89 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the complaint on its face focuses on the touching of Shepherd\u2019s hair, it can be read to allege that the corrections officers pulled out portions of Shepherd\u2019s dreadlocks. Circuit precedent holds that a policy requiring haircuts of all male inmates upon incarceration violates the free exercise rights of Rastafarians. <em>Benjamin v. Coughlin, </em>905 F.2d 571, 576-77 (2d Cir. 1990). Because the extension of <em>Benjamin </em>to corrections officers pulling out dreadlocks is straight-forward, dismissal for failure to state a cause of action was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The district court correctly dismissed the claim against Ortiz. Shepherd failed to allege adequate personal involvement by Ortiz to justify holding him liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Colon v. Coughlin, </em>58 F.3d 865, 873-74 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is VACATED in part and AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
