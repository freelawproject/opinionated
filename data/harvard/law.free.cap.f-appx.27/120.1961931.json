The Commissioner contends that the District Court committed two errors. First, the District Court impermissi-bly considered evidence which had not been in the record before the ALJ but was submitted for the first time to the Appeals Council with Flicker's request for review. Second, the District Court erred by not treating the ALJ\u2019s findings as conclusive, even though they were supported by substantial evidence. For the reasons which follow, we will reverse the District Court\u2019s Order and remand this case to the District Court to enter judgment in favor of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">On September 16, 1996, Fricker filed an application for SSDI benefits under 42 U.S.C. section 423 (2001), alleging that a back injury and related pain had disabled him since September 17, 1987. In this application, Fricker averred that as of December 31, 1992, his date last insured, his disability rendered him entirely unable to work. After the appropriate state agency denied, reconsidered and re-denied his application, Fricker sought and was granted a hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">During a May 18, 1998, hearing, the ALJ considered the testimony of Fricker and of a vocational expert, together with certain evidence of Fricker\u2019s medical history. This evidence included various physicians\u2019 assessments of Fricker\u2019s ability to work. Much of the medical evidence considered by the ALJ suggests that, as of the date Fricker was last insured, he was able to perform some types of work. See, e.g., Appendix at 114-17, 121, 131-33, 143-44, 287-365, 367-68, 486-89, 517, 529. An April 9, 1998, letter of Dr. Sofia Lam, considered by the ALJ stated, however, that Fricker \u201cis not capable of performing any type of gainful employment at the present time or in the future.\u201d (emphasis added). Based on the evidence before her, the ALJ found Fricker\u2019s allegations \u201cexcessive [and] not fully credible\u201d and found Fricker \u201ccapable of light and sedentary work.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ denied Fricker\u2019s request for SSDI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">On June 2, 1998, six days before the ALJ\u2019s decision, Dr. Joseph Pongonis, a physician who had earlier provided an assessment supporting Fricker\u2019s employability, wrote a letter stating \u201cI feel that [Fricker] is unable to perform any type of work at this time or in the future.\u201d (emphasis added). The Pongonis Letter was not presented to the ALJ, and the ALJ did not consider it in rendering her decision. Fricker presented the Pongonis Letter for the first time to the Appeals Council in connection with a request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">The Appeals Council denied Fricker\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.955, 404.981, 422.210 (2001). See also <em>Sims v. Apfel, </em>530 U.S. 103, 106, 120 S.Ct. 2080, 147 L.Ed.2d 80 (2000). Thereafter, Fricker commenced this civil action by filing a complaint with the District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2001). On December 11, 2000, the District Court denied the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Fricker\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In reaching its deei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>sion, the District Court considered and relied upon the Pongonis Letter which had been presented for the first time to the Appeals Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">II. Jurisdiction and Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The District Court had jurisdiction over Fricker\u2019s request for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of SSDI benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 405(g) (2001). Because the District Court\u2019s December 11, 2000 Order was a final judgment that disposed of all of the parties\u2019 claims, we have jurisdiction over the instant appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2001). We exercise plenary review over the question of whether it was proper for the District Court to consider evidence not before the ALJ. See <em>Matthews v. Apfel, </em>239 F.3d 589, 591 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Tubari Ltd., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>959 F.2d 451, 453 (3d Cir.1992)). We review de novo the issue of whether the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits was supported by substantial evidence. See <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3rd Cir.1999) (\u201cThe role of this Court is identical to that of the District Court, namely to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The first issue raised in this appeal \u2014 whether the District Court erred by considering evidence not before the ALJ\u2014 is controlled by our decision in <em>Matthews v. Apfel. </em>In Matthews, we held that \u201cwhen [a] claimant seeks to rely on evidence that was not before the ALJ, the district court may remand to the Commissioner but only if the evidence is new and material and if there was good cause why it was not previously presented to the ALJ,\u201d <em>Matthews, </em>239 F.3d at 593 (citing <em>Keeton v. DHHS, </em>21 F.3d 1064, 1067 (11th Cir.1994); <em>Newhouse v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 283, 286 (3d Cir.1985)). See also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2001) (\u201c[The District Court] may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security, but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d). Fricker and the District Court relied on the Pongonis Letter, which was. not brought before the ALJ. However, Fricker has not shown that the Pongonis Letter was new, that it referred to the relevant period when Fricker was insured, or that there was good cause for failing to present it to the ALJ. Therefore, the District Court erred when it considered and relied upon the Pongonis Letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Turning to the second of Commissioner\u2019s objections \u2014 the District Court\u2019s determination that the ALJ\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence \u2014 we also find error. As we noted in Plummer, we are \u201cbound by the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 427 (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Doak v. Heckler, </em>790 F.2d 26, 28 (3d Cir.1986)). For purposes of our review, substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u201d <em>Ventura v. Shalala, </em>55 F.3d 900, 901 (3d Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). We find that a reasonable mind certainly might accept as adequate the ample medical evidence suggesting Fricker\u2019s employability as of his date last insured. We note, moreover, that the Lam and Pongonis letters referred not to the period on or before December 31, 1992, when Fricker was last insured, but to a date over five years later. For these reasons, we find that the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Fricker\u2019s employability are conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>We will, therefore, reverse the District Court\u2019s Order and remand this case to the District Court with directions to enter an order granting judgment in favor of the Commissioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
