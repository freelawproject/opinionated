The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 and we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">The standard of review for determining whether evidence is sufficient to support a criminal conviction is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \u201cWhere ... the entrapment defense is submitted to the jury, an appellate court should not disturb the jury\u2019s finding unless, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, no reasonable jury could have concluded that the government had disproved either of the elements of the entrapment defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>231 F.3d 508, 516 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">O\u2019Brien does not now challenge his conviction on Count four. O\u2019Brien does challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to Counts one, two, and three. Because O\u2019Brien\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence argument was preserved by making timely motions for acquittal, we review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">O\u2019Brien\u2019s defense to the charges in Counts one, two, and three is that he was entrapped and that the government failed to meet its burden of showing there was no entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">A finding of no entrapment can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt if O\u2019Brien was predisposed to committing the crimes. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1430 (9th Cir.1994). Five factors are analyzed in determining whether O\u2019Brien was predisposed to commit the offenses: (1) his character and reputation; (2) whether the government made the initial suggestion of criminal activity; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>whether O\u2019Brien engaged in the activity for profit; (4) whether O\u2019Brien showed any reluctance; and (5) the nature of the government\u2019s inducement. <em>Id. </em>None of these factors is controlling, but the most important is whether O\u2019Brien was reluctant to engage in the criminal activity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">As to the first factor, O\u2019Brien did not have a criminal record prior to these events, and he apparently had a good reputation in the small town in which he lived. Therefore, the first factor favors O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In arguing the second factor, O\u2019Brien points out that \u201cLorie\u201d was the first to suggest that \u201cLorie\u201d travel in interstate commerce to visit him. Thus, the second factor favors O\u2019Brien as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">The government presented no evidence that O\u2019Brien profited or intended to profit from these activities, and therefore, the third factor either is inapplicable or favors O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">The most important factor is whether O\u2019Brien showed any reluctance. <em>Id. </em>O\u2019Brien initiated sexual discussions with \u201cLorie,\u201d strongly encouraged her to come visit and then live with him, and offered to and ultimately paid for a one-way bus ticket for \u201cLorie\u201d to come to his home. He also indicated that he had visited the \u201cGirls and Older Guys\u201d chat room and chatted with other teenage girls prior to meeting \u201cLorie,\u201d and that he had \u201cprayed for\u201d someone like \u201cLorie\u201d all his life. This evidence demonstrates O\u2019Brien\u2019s clear lack of reluctance. The government did not engage in \u201crepeated and persistent solicitation.\u201d <em>United States v. Simas, </em>937 F.2d 459, 462 (9th Cir.1991), citing <em>United States v. Reynoso Ulloa, </em>548 F.2d 1329, 1335-36 (9th Cir.1997). Thus, the most important factor of the analysis strongly favors the government\u2019s position that O\u2019Brien was predisposed to this behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">The fifth and final factor deals with the nature of the government\u2019s inducement. <em>Davis, </em>36 F.3d at 1430. Inducement is defined as \u201crepeated and persistent solicitation or persuasion which overcomes the defendant\u2019s reluctance,\u201d <em>Simas, </em>937 F.2d at 462 (internal quotations omitted), or \u201cany government conduct creating a substantial risk that an otherwise law-abiding citizen would commit an offense.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>36 F.3d at 1430. It must be initiated by someone acting on behalf of the government. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Davis, </em>we held that when there are \u201cconflicting assertions of fact,\u201d the jury\u2019s determination should prevail. <em>Id. </em>at 1431 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">In the present case, there is evidence that both does and does not support a conclusion of inducement. There is extensive evidence that O\u2019Brien initiated very explicit discussions about sex, offered to and in fact did pay for a bus ticket for \u201cLorie\u201d to come to California to live with him, and told her he wanted her to be his \u201cdaughter, girlfriend and wife.\u201d There is also evidence that \u201cLorie\u201d stated that \u201cLorie\u201d would visit O\u2019Brien. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have decided that the government proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the government\u2019s participation did not constitute \u201crepeated or persistent solicitation\u201d sufficient to constitute inducement. Thus, the fifth factor also favors the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Considering these factors in combination, with the first three favoring O\u2019Brien and the last two, including the most important, strongly favoring the government, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have determined that the government had disproved the lack of predisposition element of the entrapment defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">The same reasoning applies to the pornography distribution Counts. O\u2019Brien had child pornography on his computer prior to beginning his interactions with \u201cLorie.\u201d He also admitted trading images of child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>pornography in lesbian chat rooms independently of his interactions with \u201cLorie.\u201d Applying the analytical framework discussed earlier, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that O\u2019Brien was not entrapped on the distribution counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Thus, we hold that, as to all challenged counts, a \u201creasonable jury could have concluded that the government had disproved ... the elements of the entrapment defense.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>281 F.3d at 516. Consequently, there was sufficient evidence to support appellant O\u2019Brien\u2019s convictions on the challenged Counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b907-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
