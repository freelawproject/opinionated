Section 5K1.1 states (emphasis added): \u201cUpon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of another person who has committed the offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.\u201d The decision whether to depart downward lies in the discretion of the District Court, and we do not have jurisdiction to review an appeal challenging a District Court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward from an appropriate Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Casiano, </em>113 F.3d 420, 429 (3d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Spiropoulos, </em>976 F.2d 155, 162-63 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The record is clear that the District Court gave substantial consideration to the motion to allow a downward departure, recognized its authority to depart downward, and exercised its discretion to decline to depart from the appropriate range provided by the Sentencing Guidelines. We thus conclude that the District Court\u2019s denial was discretionary, and appellate jurisdiction is therefore lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We also reject defendant\u2019s argument that the District Court used information in violation of the immunity granted by the plea agreement and in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The information the District Court used came from the plea agreement and there is nothing to show that it came from his immunized testimony at trial. Moreover the plea agreement referred to Section IB 1.8 of the Sentencing Guidelines and Section IB 1.8(b)(5) permits the use of information provided pursuant to a cooperation agreement in determining whether and to what extent a downward departure is warranted. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
