Thomas Sees pled guilty in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey to a superseding information charging that on October 27, 1999, he knowingly and intentionally used a communication facility (a telephone) to facilitate the distribution and the possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, a felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). On appeal, Sees contends the District Court erred in failing to grant a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 based on extraordinary post-offense rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-21\">\u201cWe lack jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart downward \u2018when the district court, knowing it may do so, nonetheless determines that departure is not warranted.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sally, </em>116 F.3d 76, 78 (3d Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. McQuilkin, </em>97 F.3d 723, 729 (3d Cir. 1996)). At sentencing, the District Court explicitly articulated more than once that it had the power to depart from the Guidelines based on defendant\u2019s post-offense rehabilitation efforts. The court framed the issue before it as whether it should \u201cexercise the discretion that I recognize I have in order to make a downward departure\u201d on the basis of post-offense rehabilitation. (App.62). The District Court\u2019s recognition of its authority in this regard also was reflected in the court\u2019s willingness to hear testimony concerning defendant\u2019s post-offense rehabilitation, and in the court\u2019s discussion with counsel concerning whether to depart in view of the facts of this particular case. The District Court decided, however, that defendant\u2019s post-offense conduct was not \u201cso exceptional\u201d as to warrant a downward departure from the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-22\">As a result, we lack jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s refusal of a downward departure in this matter. The appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
