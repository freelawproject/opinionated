Davis filed a postconviction motion that the state trial court deemed untimely, and the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed Davis\u2019s convictions and sentence. Davis then petitioned the federal district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for habeas relief. The district court denied relief, concluding Davis\u2019s habeas claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and a coerced guilty plea were barred by procedural default because Davis did not present those claims for review in the Missouri Court of Appeals. Davis appeals the denial of his habeas petition, arguing the district court erroneously failed to grant an evidentiary hearing so Davis could establish actual innocence as the procedural gateway for his otherwise-barred ineffective assistance and coercion claims. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">The evidence Davis presents in support of his claim for an evidentiary hearing is an unverified letter from an individual who identifies himself or herself only as \u201cHorse.\u201d The letter begins: \u201cHello. You don\u2019t know me. I can\u2019t give my name because I have a long Police record. A history of gang related crimes. To give my name may get me in more trouble than I\u2019m already in.\u201d <em>Davis v. Gammon, </em>No. 4:97CV2139, slip op. at 4 n. 2 (E.D.Mo. Sept. 14, 2000). The letter exonerates Davis, stating the victim\u2019s death was accidental and Davis\u2019s involvement was tangential to both the robbery and burglary. Davis asserts \u201cHorse\u201d is the nickname of Marcous House, but, as the district court noted, Davis has not produced reliable evidence showing that someone named Mar-cous House exists, was the author of the letter, or possesses relevant probative evidence about Davis\u2019s innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-16\">We agree with the district court that the highly suspect letter from \u201cHorse\u201d is not sufficiently reliable to establish clearly and convincingly that a reasonable juror would not have found Davis guilty of the underly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>ing offenses. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2) (Supp.1999) (standard for holding an evidentiary hearing on claim). Having considered Davis\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations of innocence in light of the well-established controlling legal principles, we cannot say the allegations have undermined our confidence in the outcome of his state trial. <em>See Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 316, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). Thus, Davis is not entitled to a remand for the purpose of developing the evidence needed to pass his procedurally defaulted habeas claims through the actual innocence gateway. <em>See Morris v. Dormire, </em>217 F.3d 556, 560 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>531 U.S. 984, 121 S.Ct. 439, 148 L.Ed.2d 445 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The district court properly concluded Davis\u2019s state court procedural default bars consideration of his federal habeas claims. Because this appeal involves the straightforward application of settled principles of law, we affirm the district court without an extended opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-12\"> The Honorable Jean C.
