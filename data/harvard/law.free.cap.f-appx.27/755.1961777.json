We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition on statute of limitation grounds. <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999). We also review de novo a district court\u2019s decision regarding equitable tolling. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Kilpatrick\u2019s convictions became final pri- or to the enactment of the AEDPA, therefore, he had until April 24, 1997, to file his section 2254 petition. <em>See Welch v. Newland, </em>267 F.3d 1013, 1014-15 (9th Cir. 2001). Even excluding the entire time during which his state habeas petitions were pending in the California courts, Kilpatrick\u2019s federal petition should have been filed no later than May 28, 1999. <em>See Welch, </em>at 1017-18 (concluding that one year statute of limitations is tolled until the California Supreme court rejects petitioner\u2019s final collateral challenge). Kilpatrick\u2019s petition filed October 25, 1999, therefore, is untimely unless he can show he is entitled to statutory or equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Kilpatrick contends that limited access to the prison library and excusable neglect of the AEDPA one-year statute of limitations are extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling. <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d at 1107 (stating that when external forces, rather than the petitioner\u2019s lack of diligence, account for the failure to file a timely claim, equitable tolling may be appropriate). We reject these contentions. Kilpatrick does not allege that the prison library did not maintain a copy of the AEDPA or case law interpreting its provisions, nor does he explain how limited library access prevented him from filing his petition for almost one year after the California Supreme Court denied his state petition. Furthermore, Kilpatrick\u2019s federal petition raises essentially the same issues raised and briefed in the state courts. <em>See Miles, </em>187 F.3d at 1107 (concluding that equitable tolling is available only where extraordinary circumstances beyond petitioner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a timely petition); <em>Allen v. Lewis, </em>255 F.3d 798, 800 (9th Cir.2001) (determining that petitioner must show that the extraordinary circumstances were the but-for and proximate cause of his untimeliness). Therefore equitable tolling is not appropriate in this case, and the district court properly dismissed Kilpatrick\u2019s petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b780-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
