Accordingly, this argument has been waived. See <em>Linder &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>166 F.3d 547, 552, n. 5 (3rd Cir.1999). See also <em>Merkle v. Upper Dublin School Dist., </em>211 F.3d 782, 791 ( 3rd Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-22\">With respect to Orozco\u2019s second argument, namely that a downward departure should have been granted based upon his rehabilitative efforts, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this discretionary ruling on the part of the District Court. It is clear from the record that the District Court recognized that it had the authority to depart based upon Orozco\u2019s post offense rehabilitation, but that it concluded that the conduct was not so extraordinary as to take the case out of the \u201cheartland\u201d so as to justify a downward departure. Instead, the District Court exercised its discretion and imposed a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guideline range. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart in this case. See <em>United States v. Price, </em>13 F.3d 711, 736 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>We will accordingly affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
