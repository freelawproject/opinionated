Rosen, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Reno Dunkley, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, moves for in forma pauper-is status on appeal from a district court order dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Dunkley contests the length of the sentence he received from the State of New York for parole violations. He claims the amount of time he received \u201cgoes against [the New York Parole Board\u2019s] own regulations as stated in \u00a7 800.20 within their Executive Manual....\u201d He seeks modification of the 120 months parole violator sentence to reflect a two year total sentence \u201ccomputed as time served.\u201d The district court dismissed the petition in a memorandum opinion filed December 12, 2000. Reconsideration was denied. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">This court reviews de novo a district court judgment dismissing a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999). A \u00a7 2241 petition generally is reserved for a defendant to challenge the manner in which his sentence is executed, rather than the validity of the sentence itself. <em>See Capaldi v. Pontesso, </em>135 F.3d 1122, 1123 (6th Cir. 1088).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Dunkley\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because Dunkley clearly challenges the length of the sentence imposed upon him as a parole violator.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">Accordingly, the motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted for the limited purpose of permitting review in this case, and the district court\u2019s order is affirmed.
