For the reasons that follow, we affirm in part and dismiss in part for lack of appellate jurisdiction. <em>Appellate Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-17\">The bulk of Loto\u2019s brief on appeal argues that the district court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment. We lack jurisdiction to consider these arguments, for no final judgment has been entered, no certification and leave to appeal have been obtained pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), and in such circumstances an order denying a motion for summary judgment is not immediately appealable, <em>see, e.g., Switzerland Cheese Association v. E. Horne\u2019s Market, Inc., </em>385 U.S. 23, 25, 87 S.Ct. 193, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966); <em>Chappell &amp; Co. v. Frankel, </em>367 F.2d 197, 199 (2d Cir.1966) (en banc). Accordingly, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction so much of the appeal as seeks review of the district court\u2019s order denying Loto\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-18\">As to the district court\u2019s ruling that Loto is enjoined from using the Golden Dictionary mark and is required to remove all signs bearing that mark from its premises, we conclude, despite some procedural irregularities, which we consider <em>sua sponte, </em>that we have jurisdiction. First, although the district court granted Goldie partial summary judgment and stated that it was granting a permanent injunction, the record does not indicate that any final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>judgment was entered in the action in accordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 54. Nonetheless, such a ruling, as an interlocutory-injunctive order, is immediately reviewable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Second, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a judgment, which is defined to include \u201cany order from which an appeal lies,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(a), must \u201cbe set forth on a separate document,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 58, and that \u201c[a] judgment is effective only when so set forth,\u201d <em>id. See also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58 Advisory Committee Note (1963) (judgment must be set forth on a separate document \u201cdistinct from any opinion or memorandum\u201d); <em>RR Village Ass\u2019n v. Denver Sewer Corp., </em>826 F.2d 1197, 1201 (2d Cir.1987) (14-page opinion stating \u201cSo Ordered\u201d at the end does not satisfy Rule 58\u2019s separate-document requirement); <em>Calmaquip Engineering West Hemisphere Corp. v. West Coast Carriers Ltd., </em>650 F.2d 633, 635-36 (5th Cir.1981) (opinion entitled \u201cOrder Granting Motion for Summary Judgment\u201d did not satisfy requirement); <em>Caperton v. Beatrice Pocahontas Coal Co., </em>585 F.2d 683, 686 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5, 689 (4th Cir.1978) (10 page \u201cOpinion and Order\u201d did not satisfy requirement); 12 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 58.02[2], at 58-8 to 58-9 (3d ed.1999). Ordinarily, a losing party\u2019s time to appeal does not begin to run until the prescribed separate document is entered; however, the principal purpose of the separate-document requirement is to enable a party to know when the appeal time has begun, <em>see, e.g., Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, </em>435 U.S. 381, 384-86, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Indrelunas, </em>411 U.S. 216, 219-22, 93 S.Ct. 1562, 36 L.Ed.2d 202 (1973) (per curiam); <em>Leonhard v. United States, </em>633 F.2d 599, 611 (2d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 908, 101 S.Ct. 1975, 68 L.Ed.2d 295 (1981), and where the aggrieved party has taken an appeal prior to the entry of such a document, the court of appeals should disregard the flaw and entertain the appeal, <em>see Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, </em>435 U.S. at 385-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In the present case, the record does not indicate entry of any separate document setting forth the terms of the injunction. In accordance with <em>Bankers Trust Co. v. Mallis, </em>however, we disregard that failure in light of Loto\u2019s filing an appeal, and we conclude that we have jurisdiction of the appeal. Although we have one additional concern with regard to the form of the injunction, which we discuss below, it does not affect our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\n<em>The Merits of the Injunction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">As to the merits of the injunction prohibiting Loto\u2019s display of the Golden Dictionary mark, Loto argues principally that the court erred because its store offered for sale genuine Golden Dictionaries, albeit inoperable ones. We see no basis for reversal. The ultimate question on appellate review of a district court\u2019s issuance of an injunction is whether, in light of the applicable standard, the court has abused its discretion. <em>See, e.g., Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 931-32, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975) (preliminary injunction); <em>Starter Corp. v. Converse, Inc., </em>170 F.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir.1999) (permanent injunction); <em>Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Inc. v. Pussycat Cinema, </em>Ltd., 604 F.2d 200, 206 (2d Cir.1979) (preliminary injunction). An abuse of discretion may consist <em>o\u00ed </em>a clearly erroneous finding of fact or an error of law. <em>See, e.g., Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">We see no error of law or clearly erroneous finding of fact here. Given the lack of any dispute that Goldie has the exclusive right to distribute Golden Dictionaries in the United States and that the Golden Dictionaries in Loto\u2019s inventory are inoperable, and given the evidence of instances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>in which Loto, <em>inter alia, </em>falsely represented to customers that Loto was identical to or affiliated with Goldie, the issuance of the injunction was well within the scope of the district court\u2019s discretion. We affirm the granting of the injunction substantially for the reasons stated in Judge Chin\u2019s Memorandum Decision dated December 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\n<em>The Form of the Injunction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Finally, as indicated above, we have one procedural concern with the district court\u2019s injunction. \u201cSince an injunctive or restraining order circumscribes [a person\u2019s] conduct and does so under a threat of punishment, it is reasonable to require that those enjoined be given fair notice of the conduct that is being prohibited.\u201d 11A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; M. Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2955, at 321 (1995) CWrighL-Miller-Kane\u201d). Although we have concluded that in this case noncompliance with Rule 58\u2019s separate-document requirement does not deprive us of jurisdiction to hear this appeal, we think the absence of a separate document affects the adequacy of the notice given of the terms of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an injunction must \u201cdescribe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d). Although Rule 65 as a whole is entitled \u201cPreliminary Injunctions,\u201d it seems plain that \u201cRule 65(d) describes the permissible form and scope of [any type of] injunction, whether it be a preliminary, permanent, or a temporary restraining order.\u201d 11A Wright-Miller-Kane \u00a7 2941, at 34; <em>see also International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, Local 1291 v. Philadelphia Marine Trade Ass\u2019n, </em>389 U.S. 64, 74-76, 88 S.Ct. 201, 19 L.Ed.2d 236 (1967) (giving expansive interpretation to what decrees are covered by Rule 65(d)). \u201cRule 65(d) reflects Congress\u2019 concern with the dangers inherent in the threat of a contempt citation for violation of an order so vague that an enjoined party may unwittingly and unintentionally transcend its bounds,\u201d <em>Sanders v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, International, </em>473 F.2d 244, 247 (2d Cir.1972); and the requirement that the prohibited or mandated conduct not be described merely by reference to another document is designed to enh\u00e1nce the ability of affected persons to ascertain what acts are forbidden or required, <em>see, e.g., </em>11A Wrigh1&gt;-Miller-Kane \u00a7 2955, at 308-09 (\u201cThe drafting standard established by Rule 65(d) is that an ordinary person reading the court\u2019s order should be able to ascertain from the document itself exactly what conduct is proscribed.\u201d). From the Rules\u2019 requirements (a) that an injunction be entered in a separate document, and (b) that the terms of the injunction not be simply incorporated by reference to another document, we think it implicit that proper notice of an injunction\u2019s terms is not given when those terms are set forth only in an opinion. This is especially so when that opinion deals largely with other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">In the present case, apparently no order entitled \u201cPermanent Injunction,\u201d \u201cInjunction,\u201d or even \u201cOrder\u201d was entered. The district court simply stated \u201cSO ORDERED\u201d at the end of a 19-page opinion that is entitled \u201cMEMORANDUM DECISION.\u201d Further, the terms of its permanent injunction are submerged in that opinion, with the bulk of the discussion dealing with Loto\u2019s motion for summary judgment <em>(see id. </em>at 10-16). Only <em>Vk </em>pages deal with Goldie\u2019s entitlement to a permanent injunction <em>(see id. </em>at 16-17), and the ruling granting the permanent injunction is located in sections entitled \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Motions\u201d and \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment.\u201d There is no section heading in which the term \u201cpermanent in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>junction\u201d is used; the only section heading that mentions injunctions at all is one in which Goldie\u2019s \u201cMotion for a Preliminary Injunction\u201d against the sale of products bearing a different mark is denied <em>(see id. </em>at 18). We cannot conclude in these circumstances that an ordinary person is reasonably notified that his or her conduct was circumscribed. Although the failure to comply with Rules 58 and 65(d) may be harmless vis-\u00e1-vis Loto itself as a party defendant that presumably has read the court\u2019s opinion, we are less comfortable as to the effect on persons who are not parties to the litigation but who may be within the intended reach of the injunction as Loto\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s permanent injunction does not give the proper notice, and we accordingly instruct the court on remand to enter its injunction in a separate document that meets the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We have considered all of Loto\u2019s challenges to the merits of the injunction and have found no basis for reversal. The injunction of the district court is affirmed in substance; its terms are to be set forth in a separate document in accordance with this order. As to the other issues raised by Loto, the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
