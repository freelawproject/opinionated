No reference was made in the indictment to Pimen-tel\u2019s prior aggravated felony conviction. Pimentel was sentenced to a 40 month-term of imprisonment, a sentence that exceeded the two-year statutory maximum under subsection (a) of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 for illegal reentry following deportation but fell within the twenty-year statutory maximum under subsection (b)(2) of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 for illegal reentry following deportation subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony. Pimentel now challenges this sentence, arguing that his prior felony conviction is an element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the offense that must be alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely a factor permitting sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">This claim is defeated by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which holds that subsection (b)(2) of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is a penalty provision and does not define a separate crime. Consequently, the Government need not charge the prior conviction in the indictment. Pimentel concedes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>controls but raises this issue here to preserve it for further review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which holds that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As this Court has previously held, however, the <em>Apprendi </em>Court \u201ccarved out an exception that is applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326 by stating that the <em>Apprendi </em>requirement is applicable to facts \u2018[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Latorre-Benavides, </em>241 F.3d 262, 264 (2d Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The Government\u2019s motion to withdraw its cross-appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
