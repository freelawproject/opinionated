Green appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> judgment for defendants following a jury trial in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. He also appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> earlier dismissal of several of his claims and defendants, and the various discovery, case management, and evidentiary rulings of the district court judges and two magistrate judges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-22\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we determine that the dismissal of portions of Green\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim was proper, <em>see Sisley v. Leyendecker, </em>260 F.3d 849, 850 (8th Cir.2001)(standard of review); that the evidence amply supported the jury\u2019s verdict, <em>see Cross v. Cleaver, </em>142 F.3d 1059, 1066 (8th Cir.l998)(standard of review); that the trial rulings were proper, <em>see DiCarlo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>v. Keller Ladders, Inc., </em>211 F.3d 465, 467 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review); that the grant of judgment as a matter of law on the one claim not submitted to the jury was proper, <em>see Kinserlow v. CMI Corp., </em>217 F.3d 1021, 1025 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review); that the various discovery orders were not an abuse of discretion, <em>see In re Missouri Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>105 F.3d 434, 435 (8th Cir.1997) (standard of review); that the orders declining to disqualify counsel were proper, <em>see Cole v. Ruidoso Mun. Sch., </em>43 F.3d 1373, 1383 (10th Cir.1994) (standard of review); and that the magistrate judge\u2019s decision not to recuse herself was not erroneous, <em>see In re Fed. Skywalk Cases, </em>680 F.2d 1175, 1183 (8th Cir.l982)(standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. Green\u2019s motion to file his reply brief out of time is granted. The motion of the City of Omaha to strike Green\u2019s appendix and part of his addendum is granted as to documents that were not before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-9\">.
