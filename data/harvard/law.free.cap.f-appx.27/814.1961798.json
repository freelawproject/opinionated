We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Duarte-Corona contends that the district court erred when imposing consecutive sentences by failing to consider the factors set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. We review for plain error the district court\u2019s decision to impose consecutive sentences where the defendant failed to raise the issue before the district court. <em>See United States v. Chea, </em>231 F.3d 531, 535 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Indeed, our review of the record shows that the district court failed to give due consideration to the factors enumerated in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3584, 3553(a); <em>United States v. Steffen, </em>251 F.3d 1273, 1278-79 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that the district court\u2019s explanation on the record \u201cfor imposing consecutive sentences constitutes sufficient evidence of appropriate consideration of factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d). We therefore vacate only that portion of Duarte-Corona\u2019s sentence with instructions for the district court to explicitly consider the factors set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 in its determination as to whether Duarte-Co-rona\u2019s sentence should run concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive to his state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">Duarte-Corona further contends that application of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), limits his sentence to two years because: he was not charged with and did not admit to having been deported after an aggravated felony; and no certified judgment was presented at sentencing. We review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001) (citation omitted), and conclude that Duarte-Corona\u2019s contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that \u201c[t]he district court was entitled to consider any prior aggravated felony convictions in sentencing [a defendant] for illegal reentry even though such conduct had not been charged in the indictment, presented to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">AFFIRMED in part and VACATED and REMANDED in part for RESEN-TENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
