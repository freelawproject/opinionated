We reverse and remand for further proceedings. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">The district court dismissed the petition as untimely under the one year statute of limitations imposed by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAED-PA\u201d). <em>See </em>28\u201d U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Because Chaudhary\u2019s murder conviction was finalized before the AEDPA took effect, he was entitled to a one-year grace period for filing that ended April 24, 1997. <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-16\">Relying on <em>Dictado v. Ducharme, </em>189 F.3d 889, 892 (9th Cir.1999) <em>(\u201cDictato </em>J\u201d), <em>withdrawn </em>244 F.3d 724, 726 (9th Cir. 2001), the district court held that Chau-dhary was not entitled to statutory tolling pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) because Chaudhary\u2019s state habeas petition was procedurally defective. Subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision in this case, the Supreme Court held that state habeas petitions were to be considered \u201cproperly filed\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d) even though they were procedurally barred under state law. <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). Thereafter, we withdrew <em>Dictato I </em>and conformed our circuit law to the intervening Supreme Court decision. <em>Dictado v. Ducharme, </em>244 F.3d 724, 726-27 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">In addition, since the district court\u2019s decision, we have concluded that a decision of the California Supreme Court is not \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of calculating the AEDPA statute of limitations until thirty days after the issuance of the California Supreme Court decision. <em>Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>262 F.3d 973, 974 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-18\">Thus, intervening controlling authority has altered the legal assumptions upon which the district court issued its decision and remand is required. On remand, the district court will be able to consider in the first instance those arguments previously foreclosed by <em>Dictado I. </em>We express no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>opinion on the merits of any of the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b789-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
