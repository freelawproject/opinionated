Allen was indicted after a handgun was discovered in the glove compartment of a vehicle in which he was riding in the front passenger seat. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">Allen first contends the evidence was insufficient to prove he knowingly possessed the handgun. The elements of a violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1) are that: \u201c(1) the defendant previously had been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year; (2) the defendant knowingly possessed ... the firearm; and (3) the possession was in or affecting commerce, because the firearm had traveled in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Langley, </em>62 F.3d 602, 606 (4th Cir.1995) (en banc). Allen stipulated to a disqualifying prior conviction, and he does not contest the interstate or foreign commerce element. He argues the evidence did not show that he either knew the firearm was in the vehicle or that he exercised dominion or control over it at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-19\">A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and inquire whether there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>See United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1141, 119 S.Ct. 1032, 143 L.Ed.2d 41 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Our review of the record convinces us that the evidence was sufficient to support Allen\u2019s conviction. In addition to the trooper\u2019s observations of Allen during the stop of the vehicle, two rounds of ammunition and a part of the handgun fell from Allen\u2019s lap as he exited the vehicle, and a magazine spring and four more rounds of ammunition were found on the floorboard and seat in which Allen sat. Allen\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Blue, </em>957 F.2d 106 (4th Cir.1992), is misplaced, as the evidence clearly indicated more than \u201cmere presence\u201d and a \u201cshoulder dip\u201d by Allen. <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Allen next contends the Government violated his due process rights by failing to preserve the firearm for fingerprint analysis. Allen\u2019s assertion that fingerprint analysis would have provided exculpatory evidence is purely speculative, however, because he did not request that the firearm be subjected to fingerprint analysis, even though the firearm was available for such analysis and was introduced at trial. Nor did Allen object to the admission of the firearm into evidence. Accordingly, Allen must demonstrate bad faith by the Government to support a claim that he was denied due process. <em>See Arizona v. Youngblood, </em>488 U.S. 51, 57-58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988). We conclude that Allen\u2019s argument that the trooper acted in bad faith by failing to ensure the handgun was not handled after he seized it is without merit. <em>See Holdren v. Legursky, </em>16 F.3d 57, 60 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Allen\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred in giving a supplemental jury instruction on proof of knowledge and intent. The decision to respond to a jury\u2019s request for clarification, and the form of that response, are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>62 F.3d 641, 646 (4th Cir.1995). If the district court gives a supplemental instruction, the instruction must \u201crespond to the jury\u2019s apparent source of confusion fairly and accurately without creating prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Allen does not argue the challenged instruction incorrectly stated the law, but contends it did not answer the jury\u2019s question and caused prejudice because it allowed the jury to conclude he intended to possess the handgun if they found he knew it was present in the vehicle. The district court was careful to give a limited instruction addressing the jury\u2019s question, and the court also instructed the jury to again consider a previous supplemental instruction defining \u201cknowingly\u201d and the initial instruction defining the mental state required to prove the crime. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Allen\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
