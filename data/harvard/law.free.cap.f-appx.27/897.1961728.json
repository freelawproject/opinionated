The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we have jurisdiction of these timely appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-18\">Robles-Rosas and Lopez-Lopez first argue that the district court abused its discretion under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 by permitting expert testimony regarding the structure and modus operandi of drug organizations. We review evidentiary rulings of the district court for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Murillo, </em>255 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-19\">Testimony similar to that given in this case was allowed in <em>Murillo. </em>There, (1) the Government showed that the evidence was relevant to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s knowledge that he was in possession of the drugs; and (2) the defendant had raised the lack of fingerprints as probative of lack of knowledge. <em>Murillo, </em>255 F.3d at 1177.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-20\">In the present case, no conspiracy was charged, but Robles-Rosas was charged with aiding and abetting. This made testimony relating to knowledge and drug trafficking organizations much more relevant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>The expert testimony was also relevant to explain why Lopez-Lopez was in the car only shortly after the escape from the border.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The district court required the Government to articulate a rationale for the testimony and limited the testimony to only that which was relevant. The district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting expert testimony about the modus operandi of drug trafficking organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Lopez-Lopez next argues that the Government thrice made references to Lopez-Lopez\u2019s failure to testify (once each in the Government\u2019s opening statement, closing argument, and rebuttal) and that these references violate his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination under <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). We must determine whether each statement \u201cis manifestly intended to call attention to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, or is of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure to testify.\u201d <em>Lincoln v. Sunn, </em>807 F.2d 805, 809 (9th Cir.1987). \u201cA prosecutor may properly comment upon the defendant\u2019s failure to present exculpatory evidence, so long as it is not phrased to call attention to the defendant\u2019s own failure to testify.\u201d <em>United States v. Soulard, </em>730 F.2d 1292, 1306 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Because Lopez-Lopez made no timely objection, we review the alleged violations of the <em>Griffin </em>rule for plain error. <em>United States v. Sehnal, </em>930 F.2d 1420, 1425-26 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">The Government\u2019s opening statement did not impermissibly refer to Lopez\u2019s failure to testify. The Government stated that the jury should pay attention to the explanations provided by the parties. This statement was not an indirect comment on Lopez-Lopez\u2019s Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Rather, it was a call to the jury to examine the evidence presented by <em>all </em>parties-the Government and the defendants. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Lopez-Lopez argues that the Government\u2019s \u201cmagic bell\u201d story in its closing argument impermissibly commented on Lopez-Lopez\u2019s failure to testify. The story is told in the context of arguing that Lopez-Lopez\u2019s pre-arrest behavior and evasive statements to law enforcement officials while in custody were indicative of guilty behavior. They are not comments on the failure of Lopez-Lopez to testify. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">The Government\u2019s rebuttal argument, in which the Government referred to the lack of testimony regarding key elements of Lopez-Lopez\u2019s case, also does not impermissibly reference his failure to testify. The Government may draw attention to the \u201cdefendant\u2019s failure to present exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mayans, </em>17 F.3d 1174, 1185 (9th Cir.1994), citing <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>803 F.2d 969, 973 (9th Cir.1986). It is conceivable that the Government\u2019s statement might be interpreted as a comment on Lopez-Lopez\u2019s failure to take the stand in his own defense, but it is much more likely that a jury would interpret the statement as one observing that defense counsel failed to provide exculpatory evidence. Thus, applying the plain error standard, the statement does not rise to the level of \u201cseriously affect[ing] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b922-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
