Drew appeals his jury conviction under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for knowingly and intentionally causing the transmission of a program, information, or code, without authorization, which resulted in damage to a protected computer in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A) (West 2000). The court sentenced Drew to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment. Drew asserts the district court erred by: (1) applying \u00a7 1030(a)(5) to his sending large quantities of e-mails to ESI\u2019s server; and (2) improperly instructing the jury as to the elements of \u00a7 1030(a)(5). Because Drew failed to raise these claims before the district court, we have reviewed them for plain error, and we find none. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-22\">After reviewing the statutory language of \u00a7 1030, we conclude Drew\u2019s claim that \u00a7 1030 does not apply to his actions must fail. The statute\u2019s unambiguous language clearly criminalizes Drew\u2019s conduct of bombarding ESI with massive numbers of e-mail messages. Furthermore, the trial transcript discloses the jury was correctly instructed as to the elements of section (a)(5)(A). Therefore, we conclude the district court committed no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-23\">Accordingly, we affirm Drew\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"AKM\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
