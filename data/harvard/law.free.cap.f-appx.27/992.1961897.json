R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-17\">Tom Dugger, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>is before this court seeking a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) which he must obtain before he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). Dugger was convicted of second degree murder in Oklahoma state court and was sentenced to life imprisonment. On August 23, 2000, Dugger filed the instant habeas corpus petition wherein he asserted that Okla. Stat. tit. 57, \u00a7 332.7, a statute enacted after he was sentenced, requires the state of Oklahoma to recalculate his sentence under the applicable matrix of the Oklahoma Truth in Sentencing Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-18\">The district court assigned Dugger\u2019s petition to a United States magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). The magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed. After reviewing Dugger\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, and denied Dugger\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-19\">Dugger claims that Okla. Stat. tit. 57, \u00a7 332.7(F) creates a constitutionally pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>tected liberty interest in the recalculation of his sentence. That statute provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ast-dedup-1\">The Department of Corrections and the Pardon and Parole Board shall promulgate rules for the implementation of subsections A, B and C of this section. The rules shall include, but not be limited to, procedures for reconsideration of persons denied parole under this section and procedure for determining what sentence a person eligible for parole consideration pursuant to subsection A of this section would have received under the applicable matrix.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Subsection A of \u00a7 332.7 contains provisions used to determine the parole-consideration date for prisoners whose crimes were committed prior to July 1, 1998. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 57, \u00a7 332.7(A). The magistrate judge considered Dugger\u2019s argument and concluded that \u201c[t]here is simply no reasonable interpretation of subsection (F) that would require \u2018modification\u2019 or \u2018recalculation\u2019 of any inmate\u2019s sentence.\u201d We too have read \u00a7 332.7(F) and conclude that the magistrate\u2019s interpretation is irrefutable. While \u00a7 332.7(F) contemplates that an inmate\u2019s sentence may be recalculated by using the applicable matrix of the Oklahoma Truth in Sentencing Act, it is clear that the sole purpose of any recalculation is to determine the date upon which the inmate becomes eligible for consideration for parole. Contrary to Dugger\u2019s assertions, our reading of the statute does not render it unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">We fully agree with the district court that \u00a7 332.7(F) does not create any liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. Consequently, Dugger\u2019s habeas petition fails to assert the denial of a federal constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3) (providing that \u201c[t]he writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless ... [h]e is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2254(a) (same). Dugger has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right and, therefore, he is not entitled to a COA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). We deny Dug-ger\u2019s application for a COA for substantially those reasons set out in the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation dated March 19, 2001 the district court\u2019s order dated May 16, 2001 and dismiss his appeal</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1017-14\">. Dugger filed his habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court construed the petition as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. For purposes of this appeal, it is irrelevant whether Dugger\u2019s petition is properly construed as arising under \u00a7 2241 or \u00a7 2254 because he must obtain a COA in either case. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 867 (10th Cir.2000) (\"[Cjonsistent with the plain language of [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A), this court holds that a state prisoner must obtain a COA to appeal the denial of a habeas petition, whether such petition was filed pursuant to \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2241....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
