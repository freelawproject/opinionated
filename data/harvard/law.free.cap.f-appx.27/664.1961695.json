He appeals his convictions, arguing that the district court erred in excluding evidence that a government witness had failed a polygraph examination regarding that witness\u2019s involvement in the firearms theft, and also in excluding testimony regarding another individual\u2019s alleged confession. We find no error in the district court\u2019s exclusion of this evidence and therefore affirm Melton\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">Jeremy Lemke, a friend of defendant Jeremy Melton\u2019s, devised a scheme to break into and steal guns from Bob\u2019s Trading Post, a federally-licensed firearms dealer. Melton agreed to help with the break-in and theft, and Lemke\u2019s brother, Christopher, agreed to create a diversion by setting fire to another local business. Jeremy Lemke also recruited Juvenal Le-mus to participate, but on the day the burglary was to occur, Lemus could not be reached. The plan went forward without Lemus, with Melton and Jeremy Lemke breaking into and stealing 14 guns from Bob\u2019s while Christopher Lemke set fire to the other targeted business.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">During its investigation of the burglary, Treasury Department agents interviewed Lemus, who initially denied any knowledge of or involvement in the scheme. He submitted to a polygraph examination, during which he responded \u201cno\u201d to the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-17\">Did you plan with anyone to steal any of those weapons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-18\">Did you yourself steal any of those weapons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-19\">Do you know for sure who stole any of those weapons?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The polygraph examiner reported that \u201c[biased upon the physiological reactions of Juvenal Lemus, he was attempting deception in his answers to the above relevant questions.\u201d Agent Steve Smith told Lemus\u2019s attorney that Lemus had lied on all three questions, and Lemus then agreed to cooperate. Christopher and Jeremy Lemke ultimately confessed and agreed to cooperate with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Lemus and both Lemkes testified for the government about Melton\u2019s participation in the scheme. A jury convicted Melton of theft of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(u) and conspiracy to commit arson, steal firearms, and possess stolen firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">A. Exclusion of Polygraph Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">At trial, the district court ruled that Melton could not question Agent Smith and Lemus about the results of Lemus\u2019s polygraph examination. Melton\u2019s theory was that Lemus and another individual, Cory Cusak, had actually participated in the theft of firearms with the Lemke brothers. Evidence that Lemus lied on the polygraph-particularly in response to the second question about whether he had stolen any of the guns-was relevant, according to Melton, both to the issue of Lemus\u2019s credibility and to discredit the government\u2019s theory that Lemus was not involved in the burglary. Melton claims that the court\u2019s limitation of his cross-examinations of Agent Smith and Lemus violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him. We generally review a court\u2019s limitation of cross-examination, including its decision whether to exclude cross-examination about polygraph examinations, for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Robbins, </em>197 F.3d 829, 844 (7th Cir.1999), but if the limitation directly implicates the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him, we review the limitation de novo. <em>Id.; United States v. Cavender, </em>228 F.3d 792, 798 (7th Cir.2000); <em>see United States v. Nelson, </em>39 F.3d 705, 708 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">In exercising its discretion in determining whether to admit polygraph evidence, \u201cthe trial court must engage in a delicate balancing of many factors including probative value, prejudicial effect, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, and undue delay.\u201d <em>United States v. Olson, </em>978 F.2d 1472, 1480 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Robbins, </em>197 F.3d at 844. Here, the district court allowed Melton to cross-examine Le-mus about his responses to the polygraph questions and to establish that Lemus decided to cooperate after Agent Smith communicated to him his belief that Lemus had lied in response to those questions. The only effect of the district court\u2019s limitation was that Melton was prevented from questioning witnesses about the polygraph examiner\u2019s opinion that Lemus was \u201cattempting deception\u201d in response to the three questions posed during the examination. But we agree with the district court that the polygraph examiner\u2019s conclusion that Lemus \u201cwas attempting deception\u201d in his responses does not establish that Le-mus\u2019s response to any particular question was indeed false. Melton offered no expert testimony (through the examiner or otherwise) establishing the reliability of the test or supporting his interpretation of the examiner\u2019s conclusion, and therefore the court was entitled to conclude that the report did not provide a sufficient basis for inferring that Lemus lied in response to the second question or actually committed the theft. <em>See United States v. Lea, </em>249 F.3d 632, 640 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Pulido, </em>69 F.3d 192, 204 (7th Cir.1995). The district court was therefore within its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>discretion in barring cross-examination about the polygraph test or its results.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Furthermore, the district court\u2019s limitation on Melton\u2019s cross-examinations of Agent Smith and Lemus did not rise to the level of a Sixth Amendment violation. \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment only guarantees the defendant the opportunity for effective, not limitless, cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. Dillard, </em>43 F.3d 299, 305 (7th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>962 F.2d 660, 679 (7th Cir.1992). Melton was not denied the opportunity to effectively attack Lemus\u2019s credibility or challenge his testimony denying his participation in the theft. As we just noted, Melton was able to establish that Agent Smith told Lemus that he had rehable information that he lied in response to the three questions about his participation, and that Lemus made his decision to cooperate after Smith told him he was lying. Melton further impeached Lemus by cross-examining him about his pretrial diversion cooperation agreement, his lies in response to agents\u2019 questions, and inconsistencies between his statements to agents and his trial testimony. We therefore conclude that the exclusion of testimony about the polygraph\u2019s results did not violate Melton\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. <em>See Robbins, </em>197 F.3d at 844-45; <em>Dillard, </em>43 F.3d at 305.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">B. Exclusion of the Third-Party Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Melton also sought to introduce the testimony of a witness, Ray Golee, who had reported to Agent Smith that another individual, Ole Lundstedt, told him that Corey Cusak admitted that he had participated in the theft of guns from Bob\u2019s. Melton does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that the proposed testimony contained two levels of hearsay and did not satisfy the requirements of any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. He argues, instead, that the statement was nonetheless admissible as a third-party confession, relying on <em>Chambers v. Mississippi </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). In <em>Chambers, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that a mechanical application of a state\u2019s hearsay rules to exclude a third-party confession may deny -defendant due process if the excluded confession \u201cbore persuasive assurances of trustworthiness\u201d and was \u201ccritical\u201d to the defendant\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 302; <em>see also Green v. Georgia, </em>442 U.S. 95, 97, 99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738 (1979). The court in <em>Chambers </em>identified the following factors as relevant to determining the reliability of the third-party confession: (1) the statement was made to a close acquaintance shortly after the crime was committed; (2) the statement was corroborated by other evidence in the case; (3) the statement was against the declarant\u2019s interest; and (4) the declarant was available to be cross-examined about the statement. 410 U.S. at 300-01; <em>United States v. Hall, </em>165 F.3d 1095, 1113 (7th Cir.1999). These factors \u201care not exhaustive or absolute,\u201d and therefore the declarant\u2019s unavailability for cross-examination, for example, is not dispositive. <em>Cunningham v. Peters, </em>941 F.2d 535, 540 (7th Cir.1991); <em>see Sharlow v. Israel, </em>767 F.2d 373, 377 (7th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">We conclude that the district court properly excluded Golec\u2019s testimony. If Cusak did indeed confess his participation in the scheme to Lundstedt, this sort of statement would unquestionably be against interest. Melton argues that, under <em>Chambers, </em>the statement\u2019s reliability was also supported by evidence that Cusak had a criminal record and was identified as participating in the sale of the stolen weapons. But Melton did not seek to introduce Cusak\u2019s statement through Lundstedt, whose own credibility could then have been tested through cross-examination. Instead, Melton sought to introduce the statement through Golec\u2019s testimony about what Lunstedt told him, and there is nothing to support the reliability of this second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>layer of hearsay. That Cusak\u2019s alleged statement to Lundstedt was against Cu-sak\u2019s penal interest does not reveal anything about the reliability of Lundstedt\u2019s statement to Golee. The circumstances in this case do not indicate that Lundstedt\u2019s statement is entitled to more confidence that any other hearsay statement, which we ordinarily presume to be untrustworthy. The district court did not err in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The judgment of the district court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
