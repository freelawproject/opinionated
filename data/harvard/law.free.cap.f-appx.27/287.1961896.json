Ludlow was sentenced to 41 months in prison. This sentence was determined in part through the application of a two-level sentencing enhancement for more than minimal planning. USSG \u00a7 2B2.1(b)(l). Ludlow appeals the use of this enhancement. We affirm Ludlow\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b312-19\">On May 27, 1997, Glen Lindsay reported to the United States Naval Investigative Service that his home on the Millington Naval Air Station (\u201cthe NAS\u201d) had been burglarized. Investigation disclosed that the thieves had stolen a 27-inch color television, a stereo, and some other miscellaneous items. The home was entered through the dining room window, and numerous fingerprints were left behind. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>That day, three witnesses (other military personnel) observed a white male, later identified as Kenneth Ryals, and a black male, later identified as the defendant, taking the relevant items from Lindsay\u2019s residence to a pick-up truck. They attempted to prevent the thieves from leaving, but the truck took evasive action and escaped from the NAS. The witnesses did, however, record the Tennessee license plate of the suspicious vehicle. Armed with this information, the Millington Police Department soon apprehended Ryals with the truck, and he was turned over to Navy investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Under questioning at the NAS, Ryals admitted his part in the burglary and identified Ludlow as the other participant. Ryals said that he had obtained use of the truck from his uncle by telling him that Ryals needed it to \u201clook for a job\u201d in Memphis. Ryals told investigators that he had at first thought Ludlow had permission to enter Lindsay\u2019s residence and remove property. Ryals claimed that he only realized he was participating in a theft when the witnesses attempted to stop the pair from leaving, and Ludlow told him not to stop. The two men later split the profits from their venture, after Ludlow had pawned the television and the stereo at two different pawn shops.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Ludlow was indicted in November 1997 and released on bond in May 1998. When the defendant failed to appear for his court date in July 1998, an arrest warrant was issued. After spending nearly a year on the lam, Mr. Ludlow was captured in Baltimore in June 1999. Following his plea of guilty,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court conducted a sentencing hearing in February 2000. During this hearing, the district court concluded that a more than minimal planning enhancement was warranted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court acknowledged, along with both parties, that Ludlow had committed a \u201csimple burglary.\u201d However, the court pointed out that \u201cresidential burglary by its nature is not just simply an impulsive act.\u201d The court described the steps necessary to carry out a residential burglary and also discussed the fact that Ludlow had \u201ccontinued\u201d his criminal activity by pawning the stolen goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">In applying the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court makes factual findings under a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>896 F.2d 1031 (6th Cir.1990). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s \u2018more than minimal planning\u2019 finding for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>225 F.3d 637, 642 (6th Cir.2000). A factual finding is clearly eiToneous when, though there is evidence to support the finding, the reviewing court is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Ables, </em>167 F.3d 1021, 1035 (6th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). The 1998 version of the Sentencing Guidelines was used to sentence the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">\n<em>The Use of USSG \u00a7 2B2.1(b)(l)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">As explained in the Guidelines, a \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d enhancement is warranted when there is \u201cmore planning than is typical for commission of the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>fense in a simple form.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(f)). This does not require \u201cplanning in its most deliberate form; rather, it is sufficient if the evidence suggests merely that the crime was not committed in its simplest form.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>225 F.3d at 642; <em>see also United States v. Ellerbee, 73 </em>F.3d 105, 108 (6th Cir.1996) (stating that the crime \u201cjust must be something more than the crime in its simplest form\u201d). Although we have not specifically mandated how to determine the \u201csimplest form,\u201d it is a reasonable inference that this is defined by the minimal set of acts and preparations that would still allow the commission of the crime. <em>See United States v. Bean, </em>18 F.3d 1367, 1370 (7th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>No. 99-1763, 2000 WL 1769634, at *1 (6th Cir. Nov. 16, 2000) (unpublished) (\u201cthe key inquiry ... lies in determining what conduct was minimally necessary in order for [a defendant] to commit the crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Ludlow was convicted of \u201cburglary\u201d under the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, because burglary is a crime in Tennessee. The Tennessee burglary statute referenced in the indictment is Tenn, Code Ann. \u00a7 39-14-402(a)(3). Under this statute, the elements of the offense are (1) entry into a building, (2) without the effective consent of the property owner, and (3) commission or attempted commission of a felony, theft, or assault. Ludlow committed a \u201ctheft.\u201d A person commits theft of property if, with intent to deprive the owner of property, the person knowingly obtains or exercises control over the property without the owner\u2019s effective consent. Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-14-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The district court found that residential burglary required \u201cdetermining what the method of gaining access is going to be.\u201d Although this is not an element of the offense, it is not logically separable from entering a residence, since one must locate an entrance before entering, and simple, necessary, adjuncts to the elements of the offense cannot provide a sole basis for the enhancement. <em>Cf. </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.1, comment, (n.l (f)) (explaining that in a burglary, \u201cchecking the area to make sure no witnesses were present would not alone constitute more than minimal planning,\u201d but \u201cobtaining building plans to plot a particular course of entry\u201d would be more than minimal planning). The district court also found that pawning the items went beyond the basic elements of the offense. However, the government does not appear to rely on the idea that this was done in order to conceal the offense, another basis for applying the more than minimal planning enhancement, and there was no finding by the district court that the pawn arrangements had been made beforehand for easy liquidation, or even that this method of disposal was in Ludlow\u2019s mind before he entered the Lindsay home. Instead, the court found that the pawning \u201ccontinued the criminal activity\u201d of the burglary offense (which had been complete at Lindsay\u2019s residence). Planning is something that occurs prior to the commission of a crime, not afterwards, and USSG \u00a7 2B2.1(b)(l) is generally not the appropriate tool to punish a continued course of criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The district court\u2019s comments regarding how \u201cby its nature\u201d residential burglary \u201cis not just simply an impulsive act,\u201d also cannot be used to justify application of the enhancement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Simplicity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>relative to the offense involved, and includes those factors already taken into account in the base offense level guidelines. <em>See Bean, </em>18 F.3d at 1370 (noting that the opposite approach would generate double counting of offense conduct). Ludlow was sentenced according to the guideline for \u201cBurglary of a Residence,\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B2.1 (a)(1), which provides a base offense level of 17, 5 levels higher than burglary from a non-residence. USSG \u00a7 2B2.1(a)(2). Hence, to the extent that residential burglary differs in nature from burglary generally, this has already been taken into account and may not be used for further enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">However, we may affirm the district court\u2019s decision on any ground supported in the record, even though different from the grounds relied on by the district court. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>106 F.3d 695, 700 n. 4 (6th Cir.1997); <em>see also Smith, </em>2000 WL 1769634, at *4 (applying this doctrine to affirm a \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d enhancement). As recorded in the pre-sentence investigation (PSI) 1110, \u201cRyals stated that he first believed William Clifton Ludlow had permission to enter the Lindsay residence.\u201d In his appeal before us, Ludlow states that \u201c[p]aragraphs 7-11 of the PSI described the very simple facts surrounding the offense conduct,\u201d (Ludlow Br. at 5), without challenging Ryals\u2019s damaging statement. The deception of Ryals in order to gain his vehicle and assistance, which facilitated the successful commission of the offense, would clearly satisfy the requirements for \u201cmore than minimal planning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Even if we were not to rely on the veracity of Ryals on this point, the record supports yet another characteristic that distinguishes Ludlow\u2019s crime from the simplest form of burglary. The government asserts that Ludlow \u201cmust have engaged in some advance planning\u201d in order to direct his and Ryals\u2019s activities to an \u201cunoccupied residence.\u201d (Gov\u2019t Br. at 8). This is plausible, since it appears that Lud-low was targeting the NAS generally and Lindsay\u2019s residence in particular. Ludlow was most likely familiar with the routine and layout on the NAS, having been employed during 1994 and 1996 as a food service worker and janitor at the Navy Exchange Accounting Office in Millington. The record does not indicate he had any legitimate business in the area of the NAS on the day of the offense. This previous acquaintance with the crime scene, as well as the manner of the offense (the systematic looting of a residence in a special enclave set apart from any normal travel route), suggests that Ludlow\u2019s selection of the Lindsay residence was not random, or the sort of \u201cspontaneous, reckless caper,\u201d for which some courts have held the enhancement inappropriate. <em>United States v. Cropper, </em>42 F.3d 755, 758-59 (2d Cir. 1994). The pre-selection of a target shows more than the minimal planning necessary to effect an entry into a residence and commit a theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The apparent recruitment \u2014 whether or not deceptive \u2014 of Ryals, who had access to a truck capable of transporting large items like Lindsay\u2019s 27-inch television, supports the view that Ludlow\u2019s crime was not residential burglary <em>simpliciter, </em>as does the probable targeting of Lindsay. Even if the offense was hardly the heist of the century, the record provides evidence that \u201ca plan was formulated and implemented,\u201d which is sufficient to support the enhancement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Gerry, </em>960 F.2d 599, 601 (6th Cir.1992) (internal quotations omitted). Without a definite and firm conviction that no such plan existed, we will not find clear error in the use of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We hold the use of a two-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2B2.1(b)(l) not clearly erroneous, and AFFIRM Ludlow\u2019s sentence on different grounds.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">. Ludlow also pled guilty to failure to appear under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(a)(1), for which he received an additional sentence of six months in prison, consecutive to his other sentence. This charge and sentence are not on appeal here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-15\">. The presentence report had also recommended the use of the enhancement, without elaborating on the basis for applying it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">. It should be noted that, technically, Ludlow was not charged with residential burglary, which is a different offense under Tennessee law. <em>See </em>Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-14-402(a)(3) (defining burglary of a \"habitation''). However, Ludlow was sentenced under the guideline for burglary from a \"residence,\" and it is uncontested that the building he entered was indeed a residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\">. This \"plan,\u201d of course, must be one beyond that necessary to commit the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
