At the time of this plea, Jones was under a separate indictment for murder; he was convicted of that charge and received a 30-year sentence, consecutive to the 10-year term. Jones attempted to withdraw his guilty plea to the attempted murder charge, contending that he had not understood that the sentences for his two crimes could run consecutively. He also argued that the prosecution had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence (particularly a statement by Charles Coates, the intended victim, that although Jones had taken part in the assault someone else had done the shooting) and that his lawyer had coerced him into pleading guilty. The trial court considered this motion twice, denying it both times. On each occasion Jones was represented by Kathleen Pantle, who Jones had accused of coercing his plea. On appeal Jones had a different lawyer. The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, ruling that all of Jones\u2019s constitutional rights had been honored. After the Supreme Court of Illinois declined to hear the case, and the state courts denied his petition for collateral relief, Jones sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. The district judge denied his petition, and he appealed to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">Proceedings in the state courts were procedurally complex, but unraveling the details is not necessary. Nor need we discuss the bulk of Jones\u2019s contentions, for the district court\u2019s certificate of appealability identifies only two substantial issues, and we see no justification for its expansion. Thus we turn directly to the first question: whether Jones is entitled to collateral relief on the theory that failure to reveal Coates\u2019s statement before the guilty plea violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, as understood in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Phrasing the question this way is important: we must decide, not whether the state carried out all of its constitutional duties, but whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>any error justifies collateral relief under the standards adopted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Language added by the AEDPA specifies that, to obtain federal collateral relief, a prisoner must show that the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, <em>dearly established </em>Federal law, as <em>determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d </em>(\u00a7 2254(d)(1), emphasis added). Courts of appeals do not agree on whether, and if so how, the principles of <em>Brady </em>apply to pretrial disclosures, and thus affect guilty pleas. Compare <em>United States v. Avellino, </em>136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir.1998), and <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>241 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2001), petition for cert. pending, No. 01-595, with <em>Orman v. Cain, </em>228 F.3d 616, 617 (5th Cir.2000). Our own opinions, which declare that <em>Brady </em>governs trials and not pretrial discovery, e.g., <em>United States v. Higgins, </em>75 F.3d 332 (7th Cir. 1996), imply (as <em>Orman </em>held) that nondisclosure at the time of a guilty plea does not violate the Constitution. <em>Brady </em>promotes accurate truth-finding at trial, and a defendant who <em>admits </em>guilt does not avail himself of those rights. Someone who denies guilt but enters an <em>Alford </em>plea, conceding only that the prosecution could prove its case, might have a stronger position, but Jones, who in open court confessed his guilt, did not invoke the protections of the adversary process. No matter. The Supreme Court\u2019s decisions do not clearly establish that prosecutors must reveal exculpatory information before trial, so under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) Jones is not entitled to relief on federal collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Likewise Jones\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim founders on the lack of support from the Supreme Court. He relies on <em>United States v. Ellison, </em>798 F.2d 1102, 1108-09 (7th Cir.1986), for the proposition that ineffective assistance occurs as a matter of law if a lawyer whose performance is at issue represents the defendant in a request to withdraw a guilty plea. It is by no means clear that <em>Ellison </em>establishes that proposition (in <em>Ellison </em>the lawyer testified against the defendant he was representing, something that did not occur here), but even if <em>Ellison </em>were on point it would not represent \u201cclearly established Federal law, <em>as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d. </em>See <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362,120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (noting that the AEDPA precludes upsetting the judgments of state courts on the basis of precedents created by federal courts of appeals).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Decisions such as <em>Holloway v. Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978), and <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), which deal with attorneys laboring under conflicts of interest, spell out \u201cFederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201dthough the extent to which their rules are \u201cclearly established\u201d is open to debate. Courts of appeals have been unable to agree on the proper allocation of burdens under these decisions, when judges must intervene to deal with apparent conflicts, and when defendants must show prejudice from a conflict. <em>Mickens v. Taylor, </em>240 F.3d 348 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc), cert. granted, \u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 1651, 149 L.Ed.2d 467 (2001) (argued November 5, 2001), may clarify some of these matters. Our circuit has held that even in a one-defendant case, with no lawyer exposed to the dual loyalties of representing multiple persons, it is unnecessary to show prejudice, see <em>Spreitzer v. Peters, </em>114 F.3d 1435, 1450 (7th Cir.1997); but this is a minority position, which cannot be deemed to be <em>\u201cdearly established </em>Federal law, as <em>determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d. </em>Certainly no case directly establishes the principle that Jones needs: that any defendant is entitled to a new lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>on demand, as soon as he complains about the performance of the old one.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The only principle that can be deemed clearly established (at the Supreme Court level) at the moment in a one-defendant case is that, if the accused shows prejudice from a conflict that has not been waived, then relief is available. See <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), which like most of the Supreme Court\u2019s later ineffective-assistance cases insists that the defendant establish prejudice. Here Jones encounters an insuperable hurdle, for all he has done is <em>allege </em>that Pantle coerced him to plead guilty. He has not taken the first step toward proving this; he has not, for example, filed an affidavit with details. What is more, in open court Jones swore that no one had pressured or threatened him to induce his plea, or promised him anything other than the sentencing concessions recited in court. Federal courts do not permit defendants to withdraw their pleas or obtain other relief on theories that depend on a defendant\u2019s denouncing as perjury his own statements when pleading guilty. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>198 F.3d 984 (7th Cir. 1999). Yet unless we take it as established that Jones lied to the judge when pleading guilty, he cannot now show any injury from Pantle\u2019s representation at his post-plea hearings, for his coercion theory would have been untenable no matter how (or by whom) it was presented. Because Jones has not established prejudice from Pantle\u2019s representation, he is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
