Martinez, <em>Magistrate </em>Judge), dismissing his civil rights action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Hanton alleges that the defendants, who are prison officials, deprived him of procedural due process in disciplinary proceedings on a charge of attempted escape that led to his confinement in punitive segregation for fifteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Citing <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), the district court ruled that the plaintiffs disciplinary confinement in segregated housing involved no constitutionally protected liberty interest because it imposed no \u201catypical, significant\u201d hardship for a convicted prisoner. <em>Id. </em>at 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293. As a result, the district court found that Hanton\u2019s segregation was not within the concerns of the Fourteenth Amendment, and thus that he had no valid claim under the Due Process Clause. Because the district court correctly applied <em>Sandin, </em>we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The present litigation arose after prison officials issued Hanton a disciplinary report for attempted escape. Hanton however received no notification of the subsequent disciplinary hearing until the morning of this hearing. In addition, his advocate received no copy of the investigator\u2019s report until the morning of the hearing. At the hearing, Hanton further alleges that he was denied a continuance. In his ensuing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, first Hanton and then the defendants moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion and dismissed Hanton\u2019s procedural due process claim because of the failure to allege deprivation of a constitutionally significant liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">As a threshold matter, we note that although there is no indication that either the court or the defendants informed Han-ton of the nature or the consequences of a summary judgment motion, Hanton\u2019s response indicates that \u201che understood the nature of the summary judgment process,\u201d <em>Vital v. Interfaith Med. Ctr., </em>168 F.3d 615, 621 (2d Cir.1999), thereby permitting the district court to grant summary judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\"><em>Sandin </em>holds that disciplinary confinement of prisoners implicates a constitutionally cognizable liberty interest only where a prisoner demonstrates that a confinement or restraint creates punishment \u201cqualitatively different\u201d from that typically suffered by a person convicted of a crime, and the state has enacted a regulation or statute that grants inmates a protected liberty interest. <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. 483-84, 489 n. 4,115 S.Ct. 2293; <em>Brooks v. DiFasi, </em>112 F.3d 46, 48 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Miller v. Selsky, </em>111 F.3d 7, 8-9 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Frazier v. Coughlin, </em>81 F.3d 313, 317 (2d Cir.1996). Where disciplinary segregation \u201cwith insignificant exceptions, mirror[s] those conditions imposed upon inmates in administrative segregation and protective custody\u201d or is similar to conditions otherwise in the same facility, no liberty interest is implicated. <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293; <em>see also Sealey v. Giltner, </em>197 F.3d 578, 589 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">In 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 cases alleging violations of procedural due process in prison disciplinary matters, we have required that district courts \u201cexamine the circumstances of [the plaintiffs] confinement to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>mine whether that confinement affected a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>111 F.3d at 9. We review the subsequent grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Schnabel v. Abramson, </em>232 F.3d 83, 86 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The district court determined that there was \u201cno evidence that [Hanton] had suffered any unusual conditions of confinement.\u201d Even in this court, Hanton has not contradicted the defendants\u2019 position that the conditions of his confinement did not significantly differ from conditions for the general population. <em>Cf. Colon v. Howard, </em>215 F.3d 227, 231 (2d Cir.2000); <em>Sealey, </em>197 F.3d at 587. Nor has he shown that he was kept in disciplinary confinement for a particularly long time. In other instances we have rejected claims based on greater duration than fifteen days. <em>See, e.g., Colon, </em>215 F.3d at 231-32; <em>Sealey, </em>197 F.3d at 589-90; <em>Hynes v. Squillace, </em>143 F.3d 653, 658-59 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 907, 119 S.Ct. 246, 142 L.Ed.2d 202 (1998). Because \u201cthe conditions of [Han-ton\u2019s] confinement\u201d were not \u201cdramatically different from the \u2018basic conditions of [his] sentence,\u2019 \u201d his claim must be rejected. <em>Frazier, </em>81 F.3d at 317 (citing <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 485, 115 S.Ct. 2293).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
