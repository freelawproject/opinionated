We reject the appellant\u2019s argument that the prison regulations at issue in this case violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Because the prison restrictions on the wearing of certain apparel were reasonably related to legitimate penological interests, we affirm the District Court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-20\">Although prisoners\u2019 personal liberties are certainly curtailed during incarceration, the Supreme Court has made it clear that prisoners \u201cdo not forfeit all constitutional protections by reason of their conviction and confinement in prison.\u201d <em>De-Hart v. Horn, </em>227 F.3d 47, 50 (3d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 545, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979)). \u201cInmates clearly retain protections afforded by the First Amendment, ... including its directive that no law shall prohibit the free exercise of religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>O\u2019Lone v. Shabazz, </em>482 U.S. 342, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2400, 96 L.Ed.2d 282 (1987) (citations omitted)). However, certain restrictions on inmates\u2019 exercise of these constitutional rights are justified by the valid penological objectives of deterrence of crime, rehabilitation of prisoners, and institutional security. See <em>id. </em>at 50-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-22\">In <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cwhen a prison regulation impinges on inmates\u2019 constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254. Turner counsels consideration of the following four factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-23\">\u201cFirst, there must be a \u2018valid, rational connection\u2019 between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it\u201d and this connection must not be \u201cso remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\u201d Second, a court must consider whether inmates retain alternative means of exercising the circumscribed right. Third, a court must take into account the costs that accommodating the right would impose on other inmates, guards, and prison resources generally. And fourth, a court must consider whether there are alternatives to the regulation that \u201cfully accommodate[ ] the prisoner\u2019s rights at de minim-is cost to valid penological interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-24\"><em>DeHart, </em>227 F.3d at 51 (quoting <em>Waterman v. Farmer, </em>183 F.3d 208, 213 (3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Cir.1999) (internal citations omitted)). The District Court correctly applied Turner and concluded that the regulations at issue did not violate the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We also agree with the District Court that, assuming for the sake of argument that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000bb through 2000bb-4, applies, the record does not show that the regulations impose a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on religious exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We have considered all of the defendants\u2019 arguments and see no basis for reversal. The judgment of the District Court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">This cause came to be heard on the record from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and was submitted under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a) on January 17, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">After review and consideration of all contentions raised by the appellant, it is hereby ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the District Court entered on March 8, 2001, be and is hereby affirmed, all in accordance with the opinion of this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
