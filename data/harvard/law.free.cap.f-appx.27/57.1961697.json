Weinstein, Judge) denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Because we conclude that Crawford\u2019s petition is barred by the statute of limitations imposed by the Anti Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), we affirm the judgment of the District Court. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">Crawford was convicted after a jury trial in New York Supreme Court of murder, robbery and burglary arising from an incident on June 5, 1978, in which Crawford \u00e1nd a co-defendant broke into the home of an eighty-seven-year-old woman and beat her to death before stealing her television and typewriter. On June 22, 1979, Crawford was sentenced to 25 years to life for the murder conviction to be followed by maximum terms of 25 years for each of the robbery and burglary counts. Crawford appealed his conviction to the Appellate Division raising two claims which were found to be meritless. See <em>People v. Crawford, </em>113 A.D.2d 771, 493 N.Y.S.2d 361 (2d Dep\u2019t 1985). No further appeals took place until August 1995 when Crawford moved in the Appellate Division for a copy of his trial transcript, free of charge, so that he could raise a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The Appellate Division denied his request. Crawford then sought leave to appeal this decision to the New York Court of Appeals; this request was denied. See <em>People v. Crawford, </em>88 N.Y.2d 877, 645 N.Y.S.2d 452, 668 N.E.2d 423 (1996). On March 31, 2000, Crawford filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming ineffective assistance when his appellate counsel failed to seek leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals from the Appellate Division\u2019s affirmance of his conviction and failed to argue on appeal that the police lacked probable cause when Crawford was arrested. On December 14, 2000, the District Court dismissed Crawford\u2019s petition on three grounds: (1) the failure of appellate counsel to pursue a discretionary appeal does not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ineffective assistance; (2) Crawford\u2019s petition was barred by the statute of limitations for habeas petitions; (3) Crawford\u2019s claims would fail on the merits even had his counsel timely pursued further appellate review. The District Court, however, granted Crawford a certif\u00edcate of appeala-bility on the issue of whether appellate counsel\u2019s failure to seek leave to appeal constituted constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Although the certificate of appealability focused on whether Crawford\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance, we decline to reach this question because Crawford\u2019s habeas petition is barred by the statute of limitations imposed by AEDPA. Under AEDPA, prisoners in state custody generally must file a habeas petition one year from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). However, we have held that if a petitioner\u2019s conviction became final prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment, the petitioner was allowed an additional year measured from the time of AEDPA\u2019s effective date. See <em>Ross v. Artuz, </em>150 F.3d 97, 102-03 (2d Cir.1998). In other words, prisoners whose direct review ended before the passage of AEDPA on April 24, 1996 had until April 24, 1997 to file a habeas petition. In the instant case, Crawford received notice that his appeal was rejected by the Appellate Division on September 10, 1985. After allowing thirty days to pass without seeking leave to appeal to New York Court of Appeals, his conviction became final. See N.Y.Crim. P. \u00a7 460.10. Thus, after AED-PA was passed, he had one year to file his petition. He failed to do so, filing the current petition on February 24, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Nor does Crawford have any basis upon which he can claim that AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations should be tolled. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), the statute of limitations may be tolled during the time that a state-created unconstitutional impediment prevents the petitioner from filing a petition. Because there is no constitutional right to a trial transcript for collateral appeals, the state\u2019s denial of his request for a transcript did not constitute an unconstitutional impediment sufficient to toll the statute of limitations. See, e.g., <em>United States v. MacCollom, </em>426 U.S. 317, 323-24, 96 S.Ct. 2086, 48 L.Ed.2d 666 (1976); <em>Crossley v. United States, </em>538 F.2d 508, 509 (2d Cir.1976). Nor did Crawford\u2019s lack of transcript prevent him from filing a habeas petition. See, e.g., <em>Jihad v. Hvass, </em>267 F.3d 803, 806 (8th Cir.2001) (\u201c[L]ack of access to a trial transcript does not preclude a petitioner from commencing post-conviction proceedings and therefore does not warrant equitable tolling.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Although a habeas court generally must address the issues raised in the certificate of appealability, see <em>Valverde v. Stinson, </em>224 F.3d 129, 136 (2d Cir.2000), in the instant case, because Crawford\u2019s petition is untimely, his petition for a writ of habeas corpus must fail. We therefore decline to render an advisory opinion by commenting on the merits of his ineffective assistance claims. See, e.g., <em>North Carolina v. Rice, </em>404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
