Muhammed has moved for in for-ma pauperis status. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-20\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Muhammed claimed that the state of Pennsylvania had lodged an invalid detainer with the federal prison authorities where Muhammed is now imprisoned. Muhammed claimed that the detainer was invalid under state law and that the warden of the federal prison violated Muhammed\u2019s due process rights by honoring the detainer. The district court dismissed the petition because habe-as corpus relief is not available for issues of state law. The court also held that the warden did not violate Muhammed\u2019s due process rights by honoring the detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s order denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed under \u00a7 2241. <em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999). The district court properly held that a claim based solely on state law is not redressable through the federal habeas corpus process. <em>Norris v. Schotten, </em>146 F.3d 314, 328 (6th Cir.1998). Moreover, no aspect of fundamental fairness was violated here where Muhammed received a hearing on the parole violation and he should be required to serve additional time for running from his parole officer and creating a dangerous situation surrounding his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">The district court also properly concluded that the warden did not violate Muhammed\u2019s due process rights. The mere lodging of a detainer does not violate a prisoner\u2019s due process rights. <em>Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 86, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976). In addition, an adverse impact on a prisoner\u2019s classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>and Ms eligibility for institutional programs is not sufficient to Mvoke due process. <em>Id. </em>at 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274. Mu-hammed\u2019s petition lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The motion for in forma pauperis status is granted solely for the purpose of deciding this appeal, and the order of the district court is affirmed under Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
