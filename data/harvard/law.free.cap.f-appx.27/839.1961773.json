L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Underlying some of the district court\u2019s analysis was the view that Torres was not entitled to statutory tolling of the limitations period during the pendency of any state habeas petitions that were ultimately rejected on procedural grounds. That view, however, was subsequently rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). This court granted Torres a certificate of appealability on the question whether, in light of <em>Artuz, </em>his federal petition was timely. We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">Torres cites no authority that would entitle him to equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period for the entire time prior to the filing of his third state habeas petition. Assuming that equitable tolling would be available because of the failure of Torres\u2019s counsel to seek direct review by the California Supreme Court, such tolling would end, at the latest, on April 3, 1997, the date Torres filed his first state habeas petition. Thereafter, only statutory tolling is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">Torres is entitled to have the time during which his state habeas petitions were pending tolled, but statutory tolling is available for periods <em>between </em>those petitions only when the petitions comprise \u201cone complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d <em>Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1005 (9th Cir.1999). Statutory tolling does not apply to periods between petitions, such as Torres\u2019s successive petitions filed in the California Supreme Court, that do not form part of a progressive series from the superior court, to the court of appeal, to the California Supreme Court. <em>See Dils v. Small, </em>260 F.3d 984 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Nino, </em>183 F.3d at 1005; <em>Saffold v. Newland, </em>250 F.3d 1262 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Welch v. Newland, </em>267 F.3d 1013 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">Denial of Torres\u2019s first state habeas petition became final thirty days from issu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>anee of the California Supreme <em>Court\u2019s </em>order. <em>See Bunney v. Mitchell, </em>262 F.3d 973, 974 (9th Cir.2001). Assuming that Torres\u2019s second state habeas petition was filed on September 27, 1997 (pursuant to the mailbox rule, <em>see Saffold, </em>250 F.3d at 1265), ninety-one days of the one-year limitations period elapsed between Torres\u2019s first and second state court petitions. Similarly, the denial of Torres\u2019s second state habeas petition became final thirty days from issuance of the supreme court\u2019s order. Again assuming pursuant to the mailbox rule that Torres filed his third state petition on January 5, 1999, 311 more days elapsed between his second and third state petitions. As statutory tolling is not available for any of these 402 days, Torres\u2019s federal habeas petition is not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Nor does Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in this case. <em>See Kyle v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>28 F.3d 928, 929-30 (9th Cir.1994) (rule does not extend deadlines triggered by entry of court orders). However, even if Rule 6(e) were applicable, it would not affect the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Finally, operation of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period to bar Torres\u2019s federal petition does not violate the Suspension Clause. <em>See Green v. White, </em>223 F.3d 1001 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Tinker v. Moore, </em>255 F.3d 1331 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b864-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
