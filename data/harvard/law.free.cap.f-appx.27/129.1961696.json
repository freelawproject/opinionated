Wimbs contends that the District Court erred in failing to deliver eight proposed jury instructions and in delivering other instructions over her objection. Because we are convinced that these allegations of error lack merit, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-20\">The parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history underlying this matter. Accordingly, we turn directly to the merits of Wimbs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-21\">Typically we accord the District Court broad discretion in ruling on points for charge to the jury. <em>Bennis v. Gable, </em>823 F.2d 723, 727 (3d Cir.1987). \u201cOnce an instruction has been given, our standard of review changes. \u2018At that point, we generally ask ourselves whether, viewed in light of the evidence, the charge as a whole fairly and adequately submits the issues in the case to the jury and reverse\u2019 \u201d only where the instruction was capable of confusing and misleading the jury. <em>Waldorf v. Shuta, </em>896 F.2d 723, 740 (3d Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Bennis, </em>823 F.2d at 727).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-22\">We have carefully reviewed the record in this matter, devoting particular attention to Wimbs\u2019 proposed jury instructions and to the charge actually delivered. We find that the District Court\u2019s decision not to adopt the proposed instructions was fully consistent with the sound exercise of judicial discretion. Moreover, we do not find any error in the charge as it was delivered. \u201cIn reviewing a jury instruction, we look to see if the charge, taken as a whole and viewed in the light of the evidence, fairly and adequately submits the issues in the case to the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Hart, </em>273 F.3d 363, 373 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Adams, </em>759 F.2d 1099, 1116 (3d Cir.1985)). The District Court\u2019s charge to the jury in this matter was thorough and uncomplicated, and was consistent with both the law and the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Because we have failed to find merit in any of Wimbs\u2019 allegations of error, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">This cause came to be considered on the record from the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and was submitted under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a) on January 7, 2002. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this court that the judgment of the District Court entered on February 12, 2001, be and the same is hereby affirmed.
