Dearie, <em>Judge), </em>it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Defendant-appellant John Cyrus appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Raymond J. Dearie, <em>Judge), </em>convicting him of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and sentencing him principally to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The sole count of the April 16, 1998 indictment charged defendant with knowingly and intentionally possessing handguns and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The jury returned a verdict of guilty without being charged to find either that defendant had three prior convictions or to determine whether the convictions arose from crimes committed on separate occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">\u2022 Had defendant not been found to be a three-time offender under \u00a7 924(e), he would have been subject to the statutory maximum prison term of ten years under \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, the Pre Sentence Report recommended that because the defendant had three prior convictions, he was subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of \u00a7 924(e) and a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment (15 years). Defense counsel objected to the application of \u00a7 924(e), arguing that two of defendant\u2019s crimes were committed only a few hours and a few blocks apart and therefore constituted a singl\u00e9 ' criminal episode. The district judge, however, found that the crimes constituted separate convictions committed on different occasions and, pursuant to \u00a7 924(e), sentenced defendant accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">Defendant claims on appeal that in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because \u00a7 924(e) raises the statutory maximum penalty above that available under \u00a7 922(g) alone, the predicate facts under \u00a7 924(e) that the defendant have \u201cthree previous convictions\u201d and that those convictions be \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d form elements of a separate, aggravated offense which must therefore be charged in an indictment and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Appellant\u2019s argument fails for the reasons stated in our published opinion issued today in <em>United States v. Santiago </em>(98\u2014 1674). As we hold in <em>Santiago, </em>both the fact that the defendant has three prior convictions, and the fact that they were committed on separate occasions, are sentencing factors to be determined by a judge, not elements of a crime. Therefore, they need not be charged in an indictment and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The district court thus acted properly in sentencing defendant to the fifteen-year minimum term under \u00a7 924(e). Accordingly, the judgment and sentence of the district court are hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b44-11\">. We note that the defendant does not challenge on appeal the district court's determination that \u00a7 924(e)'s requirements were met, but rather the fact that it was the judge, and not the jury, who made that determination (and that it was not charged in the indictment).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
