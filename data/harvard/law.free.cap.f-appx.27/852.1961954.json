Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Greena-walt v. Stewart, </em>105 F.3d 1268, 1273 (9th Cir.1997), and affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">As the <em>Greenawalt </em>court reaffirmed, relief under Rule 60 should be granted \u201csparingly\u201d and only where necessary \u201cto prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The remedy of relief from a judgment should \u201cbe utilized only where extraordinary circumstances prevented a party from taking timely action to prevent or correct an erroneous judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">Wilson argues that extraordinary circumstances exist here. First, in Wilson\u2019s view, extraordinary circumstances exist in this case because the district court below erroneously held that his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was foreclosed by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s denial of that claim in the course of our review of his fourth habeas petition. According to Wilson, the Ninth Circuit never properly evaluated that claim because we held that the claim was not properly before us, based on Wilson\u2019s failure to raise it to the district court in the habeas case. Thus, given that we did not adjudicate the ineffectiveness claim on the merits in our review of Wilson\u2019s fourth habeas petition, Wilson views the district court\u2019s reliance on our prior rejection of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim as erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, a decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>based on procedural grounds is as binding as a decision based on substantive grounds. <em>See </em>id.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court did not err in rejecting Wilson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on our prior determination that Wilson had waived that claim by not asserting it before the district court. Wilson\u2019s own procedural mistakes do not constitute extraordinary circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Second, Wilson suggests that the loss or destruction of his original trial record<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> constitutes an extraordinary circumstance because the unavailability of the record prevented him from bringing a fifth habeas petition. Logically, the loss of the original trial record can have no bearing on the validity of the fourth habeas proceeding, which occurred before the loss of the record.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reject Wilson\u2019s contention that the loss of the trial court record in his criminal case constitutes an extraordinary circumstance for purposes of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion seeking relief from his fourth habeas judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Wilson has failed to show that extraordinary circumstances exist in this case. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that he is not entitled to Rule 60(b)(6) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b877-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-13\">. Rule 60(b) provides that \"[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment ...\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Subsections (1) through (5) enumerate specific bases for relief, and subsection (6) allows relief for \"any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-17\">. Wilson asserts that our prior determination that he had not raised the ineffectiveness claim to the district court in the fourth habeas proceeding was error. However, even if he were correct, the proper way to address that problem would have been to petition this court for rehearing immediately after we issued the memorandum disposition in his fourth habeas case. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 40; <em>see also United States v. Wingender, </em>790 F.2d 802 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b878-8\">. In <em>Greenawalt, </em>we held that a pro se habeas petitioner\u2019s failure to appeal an order dismissing his petition may have been \"attributable to inattention or inexperience, but neither deficiency constitutes a[n] extraordinary circumstance that justifies Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\u201d <em>Greenawalt, </em>105 F.3d at 1273.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\">. It appears that the record of Wilson\u2019s original criminal trial was lost in the mail in 1996 en route to the Federal Records Center from the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b878-23\">. Moreover, Wilson has provided no authority supporting his claim that it is extraordinary that a criminal trial record would be lost after so many years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b878-24\">. Other purported grounds asserted by Wilson as extraordinary circumstances are wholly without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
