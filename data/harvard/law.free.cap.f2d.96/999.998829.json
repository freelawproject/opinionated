Claims 1 to 15, inclusive, are method claims; the others are for the product. At the hearing before us counsel for appellant moved to dismiss the appeal as to claims 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. This motion will be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">As illustrative of the fourteen claims remaining in the case, we quote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-18\">\u201c2. A process which comprises crystallizing anhydrous sodium bichromate from an aqueous solution at a temperature above 83\u00b0 C. under a sub-atmospheric pressure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-19\">\u201c6. A process which comprises crystallizing anhydrous sodium bichromate from an aqueous solution of dissolved impurities at a 'temperature of about 90\u00b0 C. under a sub-atmospheric pressure of 24 to 25\" of mercury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-21\">\u201c11. A process which comprises crystallizing anhydrous sodium bichromate from a saturated aqueous solution down to one quarter the volume of the solution at a temperature above 83\u00b0 C. under a sub-atmospheric pressure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-22\">\u201c14. A process which comprises crystallizing anhydrous sodium bichromate from an aqueous solution of sodium sulphate and sodium chloride at a temperature above 83\u00b0 C. under a sub-atmospheric pressure, thereby obtaining C. P. anhydrous sodium bichromate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-23\">\u201c16. A granular body of individual separate crystals of anhydrous sodium bichromate without the presence of decomposition products of sodium bichromate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-24\">The references cited are: Caspari, 1,-003,875, Sept. 19, 1911; Harms, 1,976,936, Oct. 16, 1934; Ebner, 1,944,548, Jan. 23, 1934; Briscoe, 1,443,616, Jan. -30, 1923; British, 105,222, Jan. 17, 1918; Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 25 (1931) page 4091; Seidell \u2014 Solubilities of Inorganic and Organic Compounds, Vol. 1, page 650, Van No-strand, 1919, Copy in Division 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-25\">In the statement of the examiner after the appeal to the board is found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-26\">\u201cThis application is directed to a process of producing anhydrous sodium bichromate. An aqueous solution of sodium bichromate containing dissolved impurities, such as sodium sulphate and chloride, is heated at' a temperature above 83 \u00b0C. and preferably not higher than 90\u00b0C. to drive off the water. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1047-27\">\u201cThe process is operated under reduced pressure, to increase the efficiency of the evaporating step and to obviate the necessity for heating to higher temperatures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1047-28\">The patent to Caspari is for a process of making granular sodium bichromate. He starts, according to the specification, \u201cfrom crystallized bichromate of sodium obtained as small crystals by crystallization in motion, or from some similar form of the water containing salt granulated e. g. by grinding and screening.\u201d The substance is dehydrated, by a process described, it being taught that \u201cThe dehydration proceeds without any material change of the form of the crystals or of the granules and without any formation of dust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>The patents to Briscoe, Ebner, and Harms show processes of evaporation of various salts by use of a vacuum that is under sub-atmospheric pressure. The <em>pat</em>ent to Tucker relates to a process for the reclamation and saving of the unused excess of sodium or potassium bichromate from waste liquor, baths. It points out that a vacuum evaporator may be used in carrying out the process. Also, it teaches that when the bichromates have been recovered in crystal form, they \u201cmay then be further purified by resolution in boiling water and re-cooling, when very pure crystals are obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">The publication of Seidell discloses the temperatures, concentrates, and solid phase for two forms of sodium dichromate (which is the sanie as sodium bichromate). One of these forms contains water of Crystallization ; the other is the anhydrous form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The Chemical Abstracts publication contains a paragraph on the purification of \u25a0technical sodium dichromate in which pure sodium dichromate is obtained in hydrated form by a process of crystallization.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">We first consider the product claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">In the statement of the examiner it is said: \u201cClaims 1 to 19, all the claims, stand rejected on Caspari in view of Seidell for the temperature of crystallization and the other references for the reduced pressure feature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">The product claims, 16 to 19, were also rejected on the Chemical Abstracts publication in view of Seidell, it being said: \u201cChem. Abstracts discloses a method for obtaining pure dihydrate of Na2 Cr2 O7. To dehydrate this product by heating is not patentable, nor by recrystallization at \u25a090\u00b0 from aqueous solutions in view of Seidell.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">The broad statement'in the first ground of rejection by the examiner, quoted supra, to the effect that all the claims stand rejected upon Caspari in view of Seidell for the temperature feature, and in view of the other art for the reduced pressure feature might, without an analysis of the remainder .of the examiner\u2019s decision, leaves the impression that the Caspari patent entered into his rejection of both the method and product claims. Such, however, does not seem to be the case, and this view is confirmed by the statement in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office that \u201creference to Caspari has not been relied upon as disclosing any features'of the <em>process </em>claimed.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">The board approved the rejection of the product claims on the Chemical Abstracts publication in view of the Seidell publication, adding the opinion that Seidell alone is sufficient to anticipate them. It also approved the rejection of them upon the Caspari patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">Appellant\u2019s brief, discussing the product claims, insists that the Seidell publication \u201csays nothing whatsoever about any crystals of nor anything about <em>crystallizing </em>the anhydrous form,\u201d and that nowhere \u201cin the prior art * * * \u2022 has there been any mention previously of the crystals of this [anhydrous sodium bichromate] compound.\u201d As to the Caspari patent, it is argued, in effect, that the anhydrous sodium bichromate produced is'not crystalline but amorphous. As to the Chemical Abstracts reference, the brief simply asserts that it \u201cdoes not show the anhydrous sodium bichromate.\u201d It is also argued that the Caspari patent does not disclose a product \u201cwithout the presence of decomposition products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-12\">It will perhaps aid in understanding the issues respecting all the claims to quote pertinent definitions of certain terms used in some of them and in the foregoing argument. The quotations are from Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-13\">. \u201cCrystal 4. A body formed by the solidification, under favorably conditions, of a chemical element, a compound, or an isomorphous mixture and bounded by plane surfaces symmetrically arranged, which are the external expression of a definite internal structure. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-14\">\u201cAmorphous 1. Having no determinate form; of irregular shape * * * specif., of solids, without crystallization in the ultimate texture. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-16\">\u201cAnhydrous a. Destitute of water, esp. water of crystallization; as <em>anhydrous </em>salts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-17\">\u201cDecomposition 1. * * * separation into components; specif., decay or dissolution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-18\">The chemical formula for anhydrous sodium bichromate (or dichromate)' is Na2 Cr2 O7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-19\">It is true that the Seidell publication does not make use of either th$ term \u201ccrystals,\u201d or the term \u201ccrystallizing,\u201d and it is conceded in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office that the process of purification disclosed by the Chemical Abstracts publication is one of purifying hydrous, not anhydrous, sodium bichromate. However, both show an ultimate product correspond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>ing to the formula quoted, and it may he remarked that there is nothing in either publication which defines such product as being amorphous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">Whatever bearing the publication references may have upon the product claims at issue, it seems quite clear to us that the teaching of the Caspari patent is sufficient to anticipate them. As has been pointed out, Caspari starts with small water-saturated crystals of sodium bichromate and dehydrates them without causing any material change in the form of the crystals and without the formation of any dust. In connection with the definition of crystal, above quoted from Webster's New International Dictionary, we find the following: \u201cCrystals have the property of growing indefinitely by addition from the outside. The faces often develop unequally, but the angles between them remain constant, and each species has its fixed axial ratio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">The Caspari patent teaches that his process can be modified by adding a solution of sodium bichromate while the material is being dried until the crystals or granules reach the desired size, and it is stated that the product consists of spherical granules free from dust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">It would seem obvious, as argued, in substance, by the Solicitor for the Patent Office, that if there be no change in the form of Caspari\u2019s crystals when the hydrous sodium bichromate is dehydrated and becomes anhydrous, the product so resulting is crystalline in form and not amorphous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">With respect to the process claims, it is noted that two general features are present in all of those now before us; viz., (1) the temperatures at which crystallization is carried out \u2014 \u201cabove\u201d 83 \u00b0C., \u201cabout\u201d 90\u00b0 C. being specified in some of the claims, and (2) crystallization under a sub-atmospheric pressure, that is by the use of a vacuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">The examiner declared that the lower temperature limit, 83\u00b0C., \u201cis critical' since below this temperature the hydrated form is the stable solid phase, the anhydrous form being obtained at temperatures above 83\u00b0C.\u201d Pie also said that \u201cThe upper limit, 90\u00b0C. is preferred because sodium sulphate is less soluble at 90\u00b0 than at 83\u00b0C.\u201d It was also stated that the higher limit \u201cis adopted to avoid any danger of decomposition * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">After so stating, however, the examiner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-10\">\u201cPurification of salts by recrystallization is a well knowh method of purification, see Briscoe et al. Applicant takes impure dichromate, dissolves it in water, and recrystallizes it, at temperatures above 83 \u00b0C. It was known that the solid phase in equilibrium with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium dichromate is Na2 Cr2 O7 2II2O at circa 81 \u00b0C. and below, and the anhydrous salt at higher temperatures. Seidell is cited as evidence. Therefore to cause the recrystallization to occur above 81 or above 83 \u00b0C. would be obvious to any competent chemist skilled in the art, where the anhydrous salt is desired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-12\">\u201cSince economy in the heating operation would dictate that no temperature higher than actually necessary be employed, it is obvious to operate in the 90\u00b0 C. range. It was also known that sodium sulphate is less soluble in hot than in cold water, see any Chemist\u2019s Handbook. This would be one more reason for not carrying the temperature during crystallization any higher than necessary to crystallize the anhydrous salt. The upper limit, 90\u00b0 C. is not particularly critical, sodium dichromate (i. e., bichromate) decomposing at a much higher temperature. It melts at 320 \u00b0C. and decomposes at 400\u00b0 C. with the evolution of oxygen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1049-13\">Touching the feature of crystallizing under a sub-atmospheric pressure (that is by use of a vacuum) the examiner pointed out, with citation of the pertinent references, that evaporation under a vacuum is a common method of evaporation and \u201cis ordinarily employed where evaporation at low temperatures is desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">In approving the grounds of rejection advanced by the examiner, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-15\">\u201cAs to the process, Seidell shows the separation of- solid phase sodium bichromate in the anhydrous form at 93\u00b0. This sodium bichromate would obviously be presumed to be pure or if not pure, there would be no invention in purifying it before crystallization. Seidell does not give 83\u00b0 as a lower limit for the separation point of the anhydrous crystals, but we see no patentable invention in the determination of 83\u00b0 as the lower limit for the separation of the anhydrous form and the same is true of determining 90\u00b0 as the upper limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1049-16\">\u201cThe various references in the claims to impurities, as we have indicated, are not critical and are devoid of novelty. Sodium bichromate can be either pure or impure and if in the latter condition, from following the teachings of Seidell and applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>the anhydrous crystals of sodium bichromate separated out would naturally be pure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-4\">\u201cThe use of sub-atmospheric pressures in crystallization is conventional and shown by the British patent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">The prior art clearly teaches the obtaining of pure crystals by crystallizing hydrous sodium bichromate by the same process which appellant applies in producing anhydrous sodium bichromate in crystal form.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">In the case of Paramount Publix Corp. v. American Tri-Ergon Corp., 294 U.S. 464, 473, 55 S.Ct. 449, 453, 79 L.Ed. 997, the court said: \"The application of- an old process to a new and closely analogous subject-matter, plainly indicated by the prior art as an appropriate subject of the process, is not invention [citing cases].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">In view of the state of the art, as above set forth, we are unable to agree that the process claims of appellant are patentable upon the basis of the general features described, nor do we find any specific limitations in any of them which seem to lend patentability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">The appeal is dismissed as to claims 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13. As to all others, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Av1U\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
