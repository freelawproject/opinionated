It reads: \u201c11. A measuring device designed for use in conjunction with an inclination record which comprises a cylindrical record sheet designed to be marked by the surface of a liquid, said device comprising a transparent plane member having thereon a scale which approximates a tangent scale having as a base the diameter of said record sheet but is corrected for surface tension effects, whereby said scale, when used to measure the swing of the sinuous record formed on a developed record sheet by superposition thereon, will indicate directly the inclination to the vertical of the axis of the cylinder formed by the record sheet when the record was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-28\">The only difference between the appealed claims is that claim 10 calls for a device comprising a <em>\u201cmember </em>having thereon a scale\u201d; whereas, claim 11 calls for a <em>\u201ctransparent plane member.\" </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-29\">The claims were rejected by the tribunals of the Patent Office on the ground that they do not relate to \u201cany new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,\u201d or \u201cany new and useful improvements thereof,\u201d as provided in section 4886 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of the Revised Statutes, as amended, 35 U. S.C. \u00a7 31, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In its decision the Board of Appeals stated that the introductory and conclu\u00e1ing portions of the claims related to the use of the measuring device or scale, and that the measuring indicia might be used on any material adapted to receive it. The Board further said: \u201cThe record to be measured is produced J&gt;y contacting a marking fluid with the inner surface of the record sheet wheri rolled into cylindrical form. This record sheet is suitably encased and lowered into a well, the inclination of which it is desired to measure. The marking fluid is then introduced and subsequently removed. The cylindrical record, when flattened, will bear a sinuous trace, corresponding to the upper surface of the marking fluid. The sinuosity of this trace will be dependent upon the inclination of the record' sheet at the time the same is subjected to the marking liquid. The scale here claimed is intended for use in measuring the dip of the curve which'corresponds to the inclination of the fluid with-respect to the longitudinal axis of the record and, hence, the well which is being measured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The Primary Examiner was of opinion that the sole novelty in appellant\u2019s scale \u201clies in a mere empirical arrangement of indicia on a \u2018member\u2019 or a \u2018transparent member,\u2019 irrespective of - the physical characteristics of said \u2018member\u2019 or \u2018transparent member,\u201d\u2019 and stated that: -\u201cSaid indicia may be provided on any sort of flat material having an edge adjacent which said indicia may be disposed or may be provided on transparent material. It is therefore thought that the alleged invention defined by claims 10 arid 11 is merely an abstract idea and not a-\u2018new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\u2019, as provided in Sec. 4886, R.S.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In its decision, the Board relied upon the decision of this court in the case of In re Lockert, 65 F.2d 159, 160, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1125, wherein it was held that a chart in combination with a weighing mechanism did not \u201cconstitute, \u2018any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter,\u2019 \u201d within the purview of section 4886, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In our decision in that case, we said, inter alia: \u201cWe think it is obvious that there is no mechanical relation or co-operation between appellant\u2019s chart and the weighing mechanism to-which it is attached. Mechanically, the weighing mechanism itself operates precisely as it did before appellant\u2019s chart was perfected. The chart performs no mechanical operation or function, either alone or in combination with the weighing mechanism,\u201d and, \u201cConsidered alone, the novel feature of-appellant\u2019s chart is the mere arrangement of printed matter, and, according to the consistent holdings of this court, does not constitute\u201d patentable subject matter, within the purview of section 4886, supfa.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Counsel for appellant calls attention to the fact that this court has frequently held that the mere arrangement of printed matter on a sheet of paper does not involve patentable subject matter within the purview of the provisions of section 4886, supra, and cites the cases of In re Robert C. Russell, 48 F.2d 668, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1184; In re Reeves, 62. F.2d 199, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 767; In re Sterling, 70 F.2d 910, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1134. Counsel then states in his brief: \u201cWe fully admit that, in form, applicant\u2019s invention as defined in claim 10 is nothing more than printed matter on a sheet of paper and would, on casual consideration, appear to fall squarely within the field of unpatentable subject-matter defined in the above statements. We believe, however, that this Court has referred to \u201cmere arrangement of printed matter\u201d in a special sense on which the history of the cases relating to printed matter as a subject for patents will throw considerable light.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">In his brief, counsel has carefully analyzed several court decisions, and concludes from the views expressed in those decisions that charts which merely furnish information or afford advice to the user, identifying marks for commercial products, blank forms designed to facilitate the doing of business, etc., are not patentable subject matter within the purview of the statute. Counsel states, however, that: \u201cA combination of certain <em>printed information and a specific physical structure of a sheet of paper or the like </em>may <em>be </em>patenta ble where the structure <em>by mechanical manipulation </em>contributes to the <em>utility </em>of the <em>printed information </em>or where the printed information and the structure cooperate to produce a useful result.\u201d (Italics ours!)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">It is conceded by counsel for appellant that the \u201cscale,\u201d as defined in claim 10, \u201cdoes not fall within the favored group of physical structures consisting of component parts which cooperate with certain printed matter.\u201d He argues, however, that the \u201cscale\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>defined in that claim is an article of manufacture, because its <em>\u201csole purpose is mechanical manipulation into proper relationship. with a record taken from the surveying instrument to give a characteristic (the inclination) of the instrument in which the record was made, which characteristic is useful in a mechanical art,\u201d </em>and that it is as distinctly an article of manufacture as thermometers, litmus paper, and neon tubes, because its utility, like that of the enumerated articles, \u201cl\u00edes in physical manipulation and when so manipulated gives information of a scientifically useful nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Of course, many articles of manufacture, both scientific and otherwise, perform no function and afford no information unless they are manipulated, bu.t they are not articles of manufacture within the purview of section 4886, supra, by virtue of the fact that their utility depends upon use or manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Appellant\u2019s measuring indicia is novel, and, when the sheet of paper on which it appears is manipulated, is useful.- However, manipulation or use of his \u201cscale\u201d does not in any way change the character of its structure. There is nothing novel in appellant\u2019s paper, even though it may be transparent, as stated in claim 11, nor is there any co-operation, mechanical or otherwise, in a patentable sense between his paper -and his measuring indicia.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The tribunals of the Patent Office rec-, ognized the utility of appellant\u2019s \u201cscale,\u201d just as those tribunals and this court recognized the utility of the chart when used in connection with the weighing mechanism in the c\u00e1se of In re Lockert, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In addition to the cases hereinbefore cited, which we think are applicable to the issues involved, the following may be cited: In re Thomas J. Dixon, 44 F.2d 881, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 711; In re Edwin L. Bruce, Jr., 56 F.2d 673, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1042; In re Edward J. Clark, 58 F.2d 455, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1166; In re Bolongaro, 62 F.2d 1059, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 845; In re McKee, 64 F.2d 379, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1018; In re Johns, 70 F.2d 913, 21 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1099; In re Scott, 76 F.2d 136, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1047; In re Graf, 87 F.2d 218, 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">We are of opinion that the tribunals of the Patent Office reached the right conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
