Some time thereafter plaintiff, not being satisfied with the trade, left the bay horse with the defendant and took the black mare, and then brought this action to recover the $25. There is some evidence in regard to a warranty by the defendant as to the bay horse, but this action is not brought for a breach of warranty. The complaint alleges that defendant made certain representations as to the bay horse, and agreed \u201cthat plaintiff might take him and try him, and, if dissatisfied in any way, that he might return him to defendant, and that he would return to plaintiff what plaintiff had given him in exchange\u201d; and that the trade was made with the understanding that if the horse \u201cproved as warranted, and plaintiff should be satisfied with said horse, that the same should be considered a trade and exchange.\u201d The complaint further alleged that the horse was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>not sound, and that \u201cthe plaintiff tendered back said h.orse in as gpod condition to defendant, and thereupon demanded the return to him (plaintiff) of his said mare and $25; that the defendant received back his said horse, returned to plaintiff his said mare, but refused to deliver over or pay back to plaintiff said sum of $25, or any part thereof, so paid to him (defendant), and still withholds the same from plaintiff.\u201d The testimony of the defendant and his witnesses is wholly in conflict with the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the testimony of the plaintiff and his witnesses wholly fails to sustain the plaintiff either in his claim that he reserved the right, if he was dissatisfied, to trade back at any time after trying the horse, or that the parties ever voluntarily traded back. The testimony of plaintiff\u2019s son, who made the trade, relating to the agreement to trade back, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-4\">\u201cDefendant let out the horses again. I asked defendant how he would trade. Said \u2018$25 to boot.\u2019 Told him if his horse was all right, would give it to him. We traded, and I gave him the $25. Defendant said, \u2018Are you going right home?\u2019 Told him going to Plattsburgh and home the next day. Said, \u2018When you come along to-morrow, if you don\u2019t like this horse, drive up here.\u2019 * * * Defendant' told me, on my way back from Plattsburgh, if I wasn\u2019t satisfied when I got back to the Corners, to drive up to his place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">The young man did not return the next day, and when he returned he did not stop at the defendant\u2019s. Some days thereafter one of plaintiff\u2019s sons went to the defendant to trade back, and, referring to the horse and conversation with defendant, testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-6\">\u201cDefendant wouldn\u2019t trade back the way he was. Said if I would take him home, keep him two or three weeks, and his wind was all right, he would give me the colt. I told him if he would give me the money back and the colt, we would trade. Defendant wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s two sons went again to the defendant, and the testimony relating thereto, including some testimony about a new trade of plaintiff\u2019s black mare for a colt, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-8\">\u201cDefendant said: \u2018Boys, we have traded horses once. You are back here again. We will trade again and be done with it.\u2019 Defendant wanted to trade the colt, and Tom didn\u2019t want to. Tom told defendant he wanted the black mare back and $15, and he wpuld lose the $10. Defendant said he wouldn\u2019t do it. I hitched up, and when I got to the road the defendant stopped me, and said, \u2018If you can talk this colt in your father, come back, and I will give you a good.trade.\u2019 Defendant returned the mare, but refused to return the $25. The first time I was down on Tuesday. The second time, I think, was Thursday. I think it was Wednesday my brother Tom went down. * * * Defendant said I could take the colt or black mare, but wouldn\u2019t pay back any of the boot money.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs in this court and in the County Court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
