St. 1901, p. 3428]) declares that a discharge shall release a bankrupt from his debts, except such as have not been duly scheduled, unless the creditor had notice or knowledge of the proceedings. A bankrupt in his schedule stated the residence of a creditor as New York City, while he resided in Cincinnati. After the discharge the creditor sued the bankrupt on his claim. The bankrupt pleaded his discharge. <em>HelA, </em>that the creditor was entitled to show that he did not receive any notice or had any actual knowledge of the bankruptcy proceedings.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b548-9\">2.

To meet this, the plaintiffs showed that before and since the bankruptcy they were all nonresidents, residing in the city of Cincinnati, in the state of Ohio; that the schedule stated the plaintiffs\u2019 claim as follows: \u201cF. Westheimer &amp; Sons, 317 Main Street, New York City, Liquors, 134.27;\u201d and thereupon offered in evidence a deposition in which the following questions, among others, were put to one of them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-17\">\u201cDid you at any time between August 22, 1901, and November 4, 1901, receive any notice that the said defendant, Michael D. Howard, had filed a petition in bankruptcy?\u201d \u201cWhen and through whom did you first learn of said defendant\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings?\u201d \u201cDid your firm between August 22, 1901, and November 4, 1901, or at any time, receive any written or printed notice of the petition of the defendant in bankruptcy, or of any meeting of his creditors, or of his application for discharge in bankruptcy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-18\">These questions were excluded, when they should have been admitted, and, as they go to the very gist of the case, the exclusion constitutes reversible error. The bankruptcy law of July 1,1898, c. 541, \u00a7 7, subd. 8, 30 Stat. 548 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3425], requires the bankrupt to prepare, verify, and file a schedule of his property containing, \u201ca list of his creditors, showing their residences, if known, if unknown that fact to be stated * * Other provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>contemplate various notices to creditors of successive steps in the proceeding. Section 17 (30 Stat. 550, 551 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3428]) declares that \u201ca discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all his provable debts except such as * * * (3) have not been duly scheduled in time for proof and allowance with the name of the creditor if known to the bankrupt, unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the proceedings in bankruptcy.\u201d In Columbia Bank v. Birkett, 174 N. Y. 112, 66 N. E. 652, Gray, J., says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cIn my opinion, there are features in the present bankruptcy act which differentiate it from preceding acts, and which indicate a legislative intent that greater strickness shall prevail in notifying the creditor of the various proceedings in bankruptcy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">If, by the default of the bankrupt, no notice reaches the creditor, and no actual knowledge on his part is shown, the debt is not discharged. The schedule of debts which the bankrupt files furnishes the basis for the notices sent by the referee or the court, and \u201cthus the bankrupt appears to be made responsible for the correctness of the list of his creditors.\u201d 174 N. Y. 116, 66 N. E. 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">In the case at bar the schedule gives the address 317 Main street, New York City. There is no presumption that notices so addressed reached them at 317 Main street, Cincinnati, Ohio. The questions excluded by the justice were competent to show, first, that no notices reached the plaintiffs, and, secondly, that they had no actual knowledge of the proceedings. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
