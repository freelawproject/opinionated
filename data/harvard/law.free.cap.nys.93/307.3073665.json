The plaintiff was injured while at work upon a machine for stamping or embossing book covers, which, according to his testimony, after having worked perfectly on the day of the accident, suddenly became out of order. He thereupon went to one Asa^Bennett, whom he describes as \u201cthe foreman over me,\u201d and called his attention to the condition of the machine. He says, in substance, that Bennett then came over to the machine, and, after examining it and adjusting it, told him that it was all right, and directed him to continue his work upon it; that the machine appeared to work all right at first, but that upon the second attempt to operate it the pressure of his foot upon the treadle failed to stop the plunger, as it should have done, and that the plunger descended upon his hand and crushed it. Bennett denies having been called to look at the machine before the accident, or having given any direction about it; but assuming the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the proof is clear that the machine was in good order in the first place and suddenly became out of order, and the question is whether the notice which was given to Bennett under the circumstances, and Bennett\u2019s action in the premises, as narrated by the plaintiff, furnish a sufficient basis to charge the employer with lia*bility. There is no evidence tending to show that Bennett was employed to exercise any duty of superintendence or inspection over the machine upon which the plaintiff was at work, unless such inference is to be drawn from the simple fact that the plaintiff denominated Bennett as his foreman. I do not think that was enough. The plaintiff himself testified that at the time of the accident Bennett was doing his own work in his regular employment upon the same kind of a machine, about 10 feet distant, and it appeared from Bennett\u2019s own testimony'that he was only a stamper. There was also uncontradicted evidence on behalf of the defendant that another person was superintendent \u00f3f the defendant\u2019s factory, who was absent from the building at the time of the accident; and there was no proof that the functions of this superintendent, in his absence, had been devolved upon Bennett or any one else. It would be going-further than any decided case which I can now recall to hold that a master is liable for the sudden derangement of a piece of machinery, previously in perfect order, where such derangement had existed only for a few minutes before the injury complained of, and notice thereof had been given only to a fellow servant or employ\u00e9 not shown to have been charged with any duty in respect to the examination or repair of the machine. I conclude, therefore, that the proof was too meager to sustain a cause of action at common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The notice served upon the defendant was insufficient under the employers\u2019 liability act. It was given in behalf of John Hughes, instead of Michael J. Hughes, the plaintiff. Furthermore, it stated the cause of the injury to be the defective condition of the stamping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>press, \u201cin that the whole machine was out of plumb.\u201d There was no evidence tending in the slightest respect to show that_the accident was due to such a cause. The insufficiency of the notice might have been obviated by proof under the statute \u201cthat there was no intention to mislead and that the party entitled to notice was not in fact misled thereby,\u201d but the record contains no testimony tending to establish either of these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">For these reasons, I advise a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
