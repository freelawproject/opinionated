The defense pleaded was a discharge in bankruptcy. In support of the defense a properly certified copy of the order of confirmation of a composition in bankruptcy was offered and admitted in evidence. \u2022 This order of confirmation recited that \u201cthe consideration and money required by law to be deposited\u201d had been deposited \u201cas ordered.\u201d This order acted as a discharge, and can be pleaded in bar. Bankr. Law, \u00a7 12, subd. \u201cd,\u201d Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 550 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3427]; Collier on Bankruptcy (5th Ed.) p. 159; Glover Grocery Co. v. Dorne (Ga.) 8 Am. Bankr. Rep. 702, 42 S. E. 347; In re Becket, Fed Cas. No. 1,210. The order of confirmation was sufficiently proved by the certified copy under the seal of the clerk of the court. Code, \u00a7 943; Bankr. Law, \u00a7 21, subd. \u201cf,\u201d Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 552 [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3431].</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">It is claimed that the debt was revived by a new promise. But this was not proven. The letters of the defendants, or either of them, taken singly or together, do not show as required by the statute the note or memorandum subscribed by the party to be charged promising or agreeing to pay the debt \"discharged by the composition agreement. _ Personal Property Law, Laws 1897, p. 510, c. 417, \u00a7 21, subd. 5. While an oral promise, if definite and. unambiguous, is sufficient under the bankruptcy law (Collier on Bankruptcy [5th Ed.] p. 217; Smith v. Stanchfield [Minn.] 7 Am. Bankr. Rep. 498, 87 N. W. 917), the written promise required by local statute controls (Id.).' No oral promise is shown in the case, and no written promise is deducible from the letters. The plaintiffs assert iri their communications that such a promise has been made, but the defendants\u2019 letters are .barren of. anything beyond the admission of a moral obligation. The simple acknowledgment that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>a debt is still existing, which is sufficient to remove the bar of the statute of limitations, is insufficient to revive a debt discharged in bankruptcy. Scheper v. Briggs, 28 App. Div. 115, 118, 50 N. Y. Supp. 869. Under the provisions of the personal property law cited there must be a clear 'expression of intention on the part of the debtor to bind himself to the payment of the debt. Id.; Lawrence v. Harrington, 122 N. Y. 408, 25 N. E. 406. And while the promise need not be expressed in so many words, it must be one which is necessarily\" implied from the words of the writing. The defendants\u2019 letters do not meet these tests. They show a recognition of a moral duty, but any construction of the writings beyond that is forced and unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
