Olson, as,follows: \u201cOne-half when second payment of building loan is due and payable, and balance immediately after inclosure payment is due and made.\u201d This agreement appears to have been signed the day the defendant delivered to the purchaser a deed of said property. The case does not show that the' plaintiff, the broker, had the written authority of the owner of the property to make a sale, and want of such authority was alleged in the answer. It does not appear whether the paper of August 4th was or was not signed before the deed conveying the property to said Olson was signed. It if were signed before such deed, we are of the opinion that it would be a sufficient compliance with section 640d of the Penal Code. But the burden was on the plaintiff of establishing that at the time he made the sale, he had the written authority required by the statute and decisions to make the sale, and, not having established that fact, it is well settled, at least in this department, that he cannot recover. Borgio v. Gange (Sup.) 87 N. Y. Supp. 538; Cohen v. Boccuzzi (Sup.) 86 N. Y. Supp. 187; Whiteley v. Terry, 83 App. Div. 197, 82 N. Y. Supp. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-13\">But, irrespective of the point above stated, there is another reason for reversing the judgment. If the paper of August 4th be treated as a compliance with the statute, then plaintiff was to be paid one half of the amount due when the second payment of the building loan was due and payable, and was to be paid the other half immediately after the inclosure payment was due and paid. The evidence shows that neither one of these events has happened, and that the reason they did not happen was because of the failure of the purchaser to comply with the terms of the building loan agreement. There is no allegation on the part of the plaintiff that the contingency or contingencies contemplated by the agreement of August 4th had ever happened, nor was any excuse for there not having happened pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>The plaintiff also alleges on this argument that an act of the defendant prevented the happening of the contingency mentioned, in the agreement of August 4th; but such excuse is not pleaded, and it is well settled that, not having been pleaded, it could not \u25a0be proved on the trial. Elting v. Dayton, 63 Hun, 629, 17 N. Y. Supp. 849. Moreover, plaintiff was not entitled to anything until the second payment of the building loan was due and payable, and was not entitled to the full commissions until the inclosure payment was due and paid. In other words, these two events were conditions precedent to plaintiff\u2019s right to recover commissions from the defendant, and should have been pleaded and proved on the trial. Tooker v. Arnoux, 76 N. Y. 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
