The defendant urges as grounds for reversal of the judgment in favor of the plaintiff, first, that the proof failed to show negligence on the part of the defendant or freedom from contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff; second, that the verdict is against the weight of evidence; and, third, that the court erred in refusing to charge as requested by the defendant, and in the admission of certain evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">There was a sharp conflict between the parties as to the circumstances leading up to the accident. The proof on the part of the plaintiff, if believed by the jury, warranted them in finding that the plaintiff, after alighting from the north-bound car, waited until she had an unobstructed view of the opposite track as far northward as the center of the block between Twenty-Seventh and Twenty-Eighth streets; that the car causing the injury was then just entering the block across Twenty-Eighth street; that she looked to the northward, and did not see any approaching car; that, deeming it safe to attempt the crossing, she then proceeded slowly to cross the defendant\u2019s tracks, going in the roadway provided for foot passengers and vehicles alike by those engaged in the construction of the subway; that she did not again look to the northward; that when she had reached a point somewhere between the rails of the south-bound track she was struck by the fender of the car approaching from the north, thrown over, striking her head against the stanchion at the corner of the platform of the car, and then thrown .a distance of 20 or 30 feet in a southeasterly direction onto the north-bound track; that the motorman was propelling the car at the rate of .at least 15 miles an hour, without slackening its speed until within 10 feet of the plaintiff, and without sounding the gong or giving any warning; and that after the collision the car went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>130 or 140 feet before stopping. The distance between the two tracks of the defendant is five feet six inches, and the distance between the rails of each track is four feet four inches. . The defendant\u2019s theory of the accident\u2014that the plaintiff, upon alighting, without stopping to look or listen, immediately passed around the rear of the north-bound car, and, instead of being struck when between the rails of the south-bound track, negligently walked against the side of the car, was fairly submitted to the jury upon such a conflict of evidence as that we cannot say its finding is against the weight of evid\u00e9nce. The evidence clearly made the defendant\u2019s negligence a question of fact for the jury, and it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The place where she alighted .must have been, according to the evidence, approximately 15 feet from the westerly rail of defendant\u2019s tracks. It cannot be said, as matter of law, that a person fail's to observe the caution of an ordinarily prudent person when, at the- intersection of two city streets, upon alighting from a car and waiting until he has a clear view for a space of at least half a block, upon looking and seeing no car, he undertakes to cross a space of 15 feet, relying upon the assumption that any approaching car will be under the control of the motorman so that it may readily be stopped, or at least that some warning will be given of its approach in time to enable him to escape danger. The rights of the parties were equal, and the same degree of. care was imposed upon both. The reasons urged by the- appellant as ground for reversal of this judgment would require that the plaintiff should have looked in the direction from which the car colliding with her came at every instant of time while attempting to cross the defendant\u2019s tracks. But this is not the rule, even in the case of highway crossing cases, where the rights and obligations of the parties are entirely different. A person who looks, and sees no car approaching for a sufficient distance to warrant an ordinarily cautious person in believing that it is safe to attempt a crossing, has the right to proceed relying upon the assumption that the street railroad company will respect his equal right of passage, and, in the absence of any additional facts calling for the exercise of greater vigilance, cannot be said to be negligent, as a matter of law, if he does not thereafter look in the direction from which danger happens to come. The case of Dolfini v. Erie Railroad Co., 178 N. Y. 1, 70 N. E. 68, has not changed the law of. negligence, as urged by the appellant. That case simply applied to the peculiar facts shown to have existed the rule that the testimony of a witness, when contradicted by indisputable physical facts, was not sufficient to present a question for a jury; and the case of Reed v. Metropolitan Street Railway Co., 180 N. Y. 315, 73 N. E. 41, also relied upon by the appellant, would have been in point if the jury had found that the accident occurred in the manner claimed by the defendant. Counsel for the appellant with great industry has apparently, collated in his brief all of the cases in this state, as well as many in other jurisdictions, bearing upon accidents at crossings. Without discussing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>these authorities, it is sufficient to say that we find none, when considered in the light of the point actually decided, in conflict with the views here expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">At the close of the charge, after charging at the request of the defendant that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence if she failed to look after her view ceased to be obstructed by the car from which she had alighted, the court was requested to charge \u201cthat, irrespective of the speed at which the car came down the avenue, that if she stepped in front of that car from four to ten feet, and it was impossible for the motorman to stop his car within that distance, that then she was guilty of contributory negligence, and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d It is not quite clear what was intended by this request, but, assuming that it meant that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence if she stepped upon the track when the car was only 10 feet away, then it was not a correct statement of the law applicable to this case, because, having looked and ascertained that the way was clear for a sufficient distance to warrant a reasonable person in believing it was safe to-cross, it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that she was bound to see the car if it was only 10 feet from her when she stepped upon the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The court was requested to charge: \u201cI ask your honor to charge the jury that, if she went into the side of this car at the dashboard after the fender had passed her in safety, she was guilty of contributory negligence, and the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d The court replied, \u201cI decline to charge that, except as covered by the charge already made,\u201d This request had been substantially covered in the main charge. The court had clearly and concisely-stated the claims of the two parties, plainly telling the jury that, if the defendant\u2019s theory was correct, the plaintiff could not recover, and in stating the theory of the defendant the court said \u201cthat the old lady escaped the fender in front of this car, and deliberately walked into the car, so that whatever injury she received was by reason of her own carelessness\u2014the result of her own carelessness in not taking proper heed to where she was going\u2014the car coming along with nothing to obstruct her view of this car, so far as shown, after the uptown car had gone on uptown.\u201d The court also said: \u201cOf course, if this lady came around behind the other car, and walked right in front of his car, or right into his car, almost at the time of his seeing her, why, then the defendant would not be to blame (because you cannot expect impossibilities of a motorman), providing he had his car under control, and was going at the time at a reasonably slow rate of speed.\u201d Also: \u201cShe had alighted from one car, passed around to another railroad track. She should use the reasonable care of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances. You must decide whether she did or did not. If you find that she did not use such care, then your verdict will be for the defendant, because she must show that she was careful\u2014 reasonably careful\u2014in attempting to cross over this downtown railroad track.\u201d We think the request which was declined so far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>as it embodied a correct principle of law applicable to this case, was fully covered by the court in its charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The exceptions to the rulings as to the testimony of Dr. Russell present no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The record does not show that objection was made to the granting of an additional allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
