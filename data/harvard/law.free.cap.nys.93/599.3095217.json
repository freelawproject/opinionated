J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcXy\">I think the defendant was entitled to have his motion granted. The action was brought to recover the sum of $115 as the contract price for the doing of certain plumbing work, which work, according to the written contract, was to be completed on or before August 19, 1903. The def\u00e9ndant denied that the work had been performed according to the contract, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>completed at all, and alleged as a counterclaim expenditures incurred by him, and damage incident to the1 work amounting to $32.99. The action was commenced in January, 1904. The case was tried without a jury, and the court rendered a decision and entered judgment in accordance with it, the precise words of which are as follows: \u201cDismissing the complaint on the ground this action is prematurely brought, the work not being completed according to the contract, and judgment for the defendant on the counterclaim for the sum of $25, without costs.\u201d The defendant\u2019s motion was to amend this judgment so that it would read: \u201cJudgment for the defendant dismissing the complaint on the merits and judgment for the defendant on the counterclaim for $25.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">No question is raised as to the propriety of the defendant\u2019s attempt to procure an amendment of the judgment by motion under section 254 of the Municipal Court Act of the City of New York (chapter 580, p. 1563, Laws 1902). The respondents\u2019 contention is that the judgment is not on the merits, and that the recovery for the counterclaim does not carry costs. The judgment is certainly on the merits. There could be no decision in favor of the defendant to the effect that the work was not completed within the time contracted for, and awarding to him damages resulting from the failure of the plaintiffs to perform their contract without involving an adjudication fatal to the enforcement of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The case of Conolly v. Hyams, 47 App. Div. 592, 62 N. Y. Supp. 567, presented a very different question. In that case there was no judgment rendered upon a counterclaim, and the plaintiff\u2019s sole default was in failing to obtain the architect\u2019s certificate. It was held that the mere failure to produce the certificate did not authorize a dismissal of the complaint on the merits. The work, however, was all done, and the right of the plaintiff to recover on proper proof was undoubted. There was no adjudication of a violation of the contract. Here the decision is that the plaintiffs have no right to recover, because the work never has been and never may be done, and compensation has been decreed to the defendant for the damages which he has sustained by reason of that condition, and the violation of the contract which it involves.\" I think the defendant is also entitled to $15 costs, under the provisions of section 332 of the Municipal Court Act, supra, subdivisions 2 and 5 (Laws 1902, pp. 1585, 1586, c. 580).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The order should accordingly be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
