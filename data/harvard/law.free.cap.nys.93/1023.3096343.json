Appeal by John S. McEwan from an order made at Special Term under Election Law, Laws 1896, c. 909, p. 922, \u00a7 56, dismissing his appeal from the decision of the Secretary of State. Affirmed.</summary>\n<seealso data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"seealso\" id=\"b1054-9\">See 91 N. Y. Supp. 941.</seealso>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1054-10\">Upon October 5, 1905, there was filed in the office of the Secretary of State a certificate of nomination by the Social Democratic Parly, so called, of candidates for presidential electors, for governor, and for other state officers, to be voted for at the general election to be held November 8, 1904. On the same day the appellant, McEwan, filed objections to said certificate, objecting to the use of the word \u201cDemocratic\u201d as part of the party name in said certificate. A hearing was had by the Secretary of State upon said objections, and upon October 19, 1904, the Secretary of State handed down a decision overruling appellant\u2019s objections. Upon the same day, upon appellant\u2019s complaint, Mr. Justice Betts granted an order to show cause, returnable before him on October 22, 1904, for a review, of such determination pursuant to the provisions of section 56 of the election law (Laws 1896, p. 922, c. 909). Meanwhile one James O\u2019Neill, who had filed no objections whatever to the certificates of nomination, obtained from Justice Cochran an order to show cause, returnable before Justice Howard on October 20, 1904, for the review of the same determination. No formal notice was provided to be given to the objector, McEwan, although he was notified by telephone, and appeared before Justice Howard, and objected to his jurisdiction to review the proceeding while'an appeal had been taken by him as objector, which was pending before Justice Betts. This objection was overruled by Justice Howard, who made a determination upon the 21st day of October Sustaining the decision of the Secretary of State. Thereafter the matter came on upon the appellant\u2019s objection before Justice Betts, who denied the appeal of the appellant upon the ground that the matter had been once determined by Justice Howard. Ifrom this order of Justice Betts this appeal is taken.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1054-11\">Argued before PARKER, P.

By section 65 of that law a written objection may be filed to the use of a name which is claimed to be in violation of this rule. Such an objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>was duly filed by this appellant to the use of the name the \u201cSocial Democratic Party,\u201d as being so similar to the name the \u201cDemocratic Party\u201d as that its use was unauthorized within the statute. Section 56 of the election law aforesaid provides for the determination of this question, first, by the officer with whom the certificate is filed, and then provides that \u201cthe Supreme Court or any justice thereof within the judicial district, or any county judge within his county, shall have summary jurisdiction upon complaint of any citizen to review the determination and acts of such officer and to make such order in the premises as justice may require.\u201d The appellant first contends that the proceeding before Justice Howard was unauthorized, because made upon the complaint of one who had not filed an objection to the party certificate. But the right of appeal given by the statute seems to be given \u201cto any citizen.\u201d Under such comprehensive language we would be unjustified in confining that right to one who had filed objections to the certificate. We are not unmindful of the complications that might arise from this interpretation of the statute. \u2022 Should we, by forced construction, interpret the statute as the appellant here contends that it should be interpreted, another year would find more objections to the certificate, and the same complications would be presented as are now presented by our.holding that the right of review is given, as expressed in the statute, to \u201cany citizen,\u201d whether or not such citizen originally filed objections to said certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">But to r\u00e9verse this order the appellant has the further burden of showing that the Secretary of State erred in permitting the filing of the said party certificate. It is strenuously insisted that the name the \u201cSocial Democratic Party\u201d is substantially the same as the name the \u201cDemocratic Party,\u201d and that therefore the certificate should not have been filed. This question, however, we deem foreclosed by authority. In the Matter of Greene, reported in 9 App. Div. 223, 41 N. Y. Supp. 177, it appeared that a party which had been theretofore known as the \u201cDemocratic Party Reform Organization\u201d in October, 1896, filed certificates of nomination for national and state tickets under the name \u201cNational Democratic Party.\u201d This was objected to under the same provision of law under which the objection was filed in the case at bar on the ground that the name \u201cNational Demoratic Party\u201d was substantially the same as the name \u201cDemocratic Party.\u201d The court there held that, notwithstanding the name was assumed in a year in which there was a national election, the names were not substantially the same, and that the Secretary of State properly filed the certificate of nomination under the name \u201cNational Democratic Party.\u201d This decision was affirmed in the Court of Appeals in 150 N. Y. 566, 44 N. E. 1124, without opinion. In the Appellate Division two judges dissented, arguing that, while the name . \u201cIndependent Democratic Party\u201d or \u201cReform Democratic Party\u201d might not be substantially similar to the name \u201cDemocratic Party,\u201d nevertheless in a year where there was a national ticket the name \u201cNational Democratic Party\u201d was substantially the same as the name \u201cDemocratic Party.\" It thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>appears by the decision as well as by the reasoning of the dissenting judges that the name \u201cSocial Democratic Party\u201d cannot be held to be substantially the same as the name \u201cDemocratic Party.\u201d The argument of the appellant that such was not the real ground of the decision in the case cited is, we think, untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">We are therefore of opinion that this order must be sustained both upon the ground upon which it was placed by the learned justice at Special Term, and also upon the ground that the appeal has no substantial merit. Order affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
