I think it quite clear, first, that this clause related not to any past action by the municipal authorities, but to future action on their part; and, secondly, that it contemplated an effective approval. Under the Greater New York charter as it existed when the contract was made, which was before the amendments of 1901 went into effect (Laws 1901, p. 1, c. 466), an approval of a school site in the borough of Brooklyn, in order to become effective, required the action, first, of the school board of the borough; secondly, of the board of education of the city of New York; and, finally, that of the comptroller. Laws 1897, pp. 41, 377, 394, c. 378, \u00a7\u00a7 149, 1055, 1090. Section 1090 authorized the school board of the borough to choose and determine in the first instance the sites for all school buildings within its jurisdiction, and to transmit its determination to the board of education by properly certified resolutions. Under the by-laws of the board of education enacted pursuant to section 1070 of the charter, there was a committee on sites, having charge and management of all proceedings relative to the acquisition of sites for school buildings, subject to the approval of the board itself. In brief, under the provisions of the charter, and of the rules, regulations, and by-laws established in accordance with those provisions, the procedure necessary to make the selection of a school site effective required action on the part of the board of education confirming the determination of the local school board in selecting the site. No such confirmatory action was taken by the board of education in reference to the property which was the subject of the contract in this case until March 19, 1902, long after the expiration of the period within which the defendant undertook to convey the property. Under these circumstances, I think the defendant failed to make out any justification for her refusal to carry out the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It appears that the preliminary approval of the site by the school board of the borough of Brooklyn had been given on the 5th day of February, 1901, two days before the contract was executed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>it is suggested in behalf of the appellant that this was the approval contemplated by the parties. Such a view seems to me hardly reasonable, inasmuch as, if that approval had been all that was in contemplation, it is difficult to see why the defendant entered into the contract at all. The approval which the parties had in mind must have been an act or series of acts to be performed subsequent to the date of the contract, February 7, 1901, and prior to the 1st day of April, 1901.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The proof was sufficient to justify the finding of the jury to the effect that the property was really worth in the market $750 more than the consideration which the plaintiff was obligated to pay under the contract. There was no error in adding interest to this amount. Interest is allowable in an action to recover unliquidated damages for the breach of an executory contract of sale where the property has a market value. Sweeny v. City of New York, 173 N. Y. 414, 66 N. E. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">I advise an affirmance'of the judgment and order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
