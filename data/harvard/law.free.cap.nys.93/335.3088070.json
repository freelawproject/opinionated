Stoothoff, the defendant, mortgaged certain Brooklyn property to Frank C. Lang. By mesne conveyances the title became vested in Harriet A. Winslow, subject to the Stoothoff mortgage. Harriet A. Winslow de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>vised the premises to Delia O. Winslow, Frances A. Winslow, and Louisa Winslow. Subsequently Lang began a suit to foreclose the mortgage, whereupon Delia O. Winslow, Frances A. Winslow, and Louisa Winslow made an agreement with Lang by which, in consideration of an extension of the time for the payment of the mortgage, they bound themselves to pay the principal sum and interest. This extension agreement contained the following provision: \u201cNothing herein contained shall invalidate any of the securities now held for said debt, or impair any condition in said bond and mortgage contained.\u201d Lang obtained Stoothoff\u2019s consent to the extension on -the copy of the agreement which he retained, which consent was in the following words: \u201cIn consideration of the foregoing extension of the time of the payment of the mortgage therein described, I hereby consent to the same and waive all defenses that I may have on account of said extension.\u201d The Wins-lows were not informed of this consent until long after it was given. Subsequently the executors of an assignee of the mortgage began an action to foreclose- the same; making the Winslows, who had previously sold the property, and Stoothoff, parties to the suit, and asking judgment against them for any deficiency. In that action a deficiency judgment was obtained against the Winslows and Stoothoff for $677.90. This judgment was paid by Frederick K. Winslow, the plaintiff, who is the assignee of any rights of Delia O. Winslow, Frances A. Winslow, and Louisa Winslow. Frederick K. Winslow thereupon brought this action to compel Stoothoff to pay the amount of the \u25a0deficiency judgment, and has succeeded at 'Special Term, where it was held that his consent to the extension of the mortgage continued his status as the primary debtor, and that upon paying the amount of the deficiency judgment the Winslows became entitled to recover that amount from him.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b366-5\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

Murray v. Marshall, 94 N. Y. 611; Antisdel v. Williamson, 165 N. Y. 372, 59 N. E. 207. The consent to the extension was obviously obtained to prevent this result. The assumption by the Winslows of the payment \u2022of the principal sum and interest secured by the bond and mortgage, in consideration of the extension, had nothing to do with Stoothoff\u2019s liability. It was an independent promise to satisfy the mortgage debt, made in order to secure a postponement in the enforcement of the mortgage against the land for a period of three years. The Winslows did not thereby agree to pay the mortgage debt if Stoothoff failed to pay it, but they assumed its payment absolutely. When, therefore, they were forced to pay, they were paying, not Stoothoff\u2019s debt, but their own. I cannot see how the fact that the deficiency judgment might be enforced against Stoothoff in any manner operates to relieve the Winslows from their obligation under a wholly independent agreement made between them and the mortgagee. No privity between them and Stoothoff was created by his consent to the extension, which was a transaction wholly between him and the mortgagee, in no wise affecting the enforceability of their promise to pay the mortgage debt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The extension agreement was fully executed so far as the mortgagee is concerned, and he thereupon became entitled to enforce that part of it which bound the Winslows to pay the mortgage debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">For these reasons, it seems to me that the judgment at Special Term should have been the other way, and I therefore advise a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted; costs to abide the final award o\u00a3 costs. All concur, except HOOKER, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
