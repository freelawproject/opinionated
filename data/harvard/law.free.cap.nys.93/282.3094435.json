H. Murphy, attorney in fact for said Frank Miller. Defendant, answering, alleged no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation of the transfer of the cause of action to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">. Plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain the action was in issue upon the trial, and it was incumbent upon him, therefore, to show that he was the owner of the claim in suit. He rested his case, however, after giving evidence tending to show the sale and delivery of the lumber and trim, and offering the written assignment of the claim in evidence, which was received under defendant\u2019s objection and exception. The referee has found that the claim and account were duly assigned to the plaintiff, and states in his opinion that \u201cthe instrument of assignment introduced in evidence, executed and acknowledged by the attorney in fact of said Frank Miller, transferred the cause of action to the plaintiff.\u201d There is no trouble with the as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>signment itself. The fault lies in the failure of the plaintiff to show that Murphy was the attorney in fact for Frank Miller, or that he had any authority to execute and deliver it. The contention of respondent\u2019s counsel that the written assignment establishes the fact of a valid assignment is incorrect. It shows that Murphy assumed authority to make such an assignment, but fails to show that it was vested in him. It was necessary for the plaintiff, in order to maintain his cause of action, to show that Murphy had authority to assign the claim to him, and, because of his failure to do this, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted before another referee, to be appointed at\u00b0 Special Term; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
