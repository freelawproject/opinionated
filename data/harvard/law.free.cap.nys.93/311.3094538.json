Butler, of counsel for the respondent,\u201d etc. No reason appears for changing this recital.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The appeal in this case was by the defendant from a judgment by default rendered in the Municipal Court, and, if the defendant did not appear in the action, an appeal could be taken from the judgment. New York Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 311 (Laws 1902, p. 1578, c. 580). Counsel for appellant earnestly contends that there was no general appearance for the defendant, but the record is conclusively against him, for it appears by the justice\u2019s affidavit and the stenographer\u2019s minutes that on November 27, 1903, the return day of the summons, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s counsel\u201d appeared specially, and upon being informed by the court \u201cthat, if he did not plead generally, judgment would be given by default against the defendant, counsel for defendant then pleaded generally.\u201d This \u201ccounsel,\u201d as appears by the affidavit of the real counsel, had not been admitted to practice as an attorney, and was forbidden to practice by section 63 of the Code of Civil Procedure; but the real counsel who sent him there cannot avail himself of the imposture, if such it was, which he made possible. He afterward attempted to withdraw the general appearance, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff after an inquisition. The defendant having once appeared in the action, the court gained jurisdiction, and the defendant, subsequently permitting judgment by default, is not at liberty to appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">For these reasons, the motion should in all respects be denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
