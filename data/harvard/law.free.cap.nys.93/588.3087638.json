On January 31, 1902, Frederick Klee became a member of the branch, and in the beneficiary certificate issued to him named his wife, the plaintiff, as the person to whom the benefit of $500 should be paid on his death. One year later the plaintiff abandoned her husband, running off with a boarder in their household, and taking with her all the effects, including the benefit certificate. Thereupon Frederick Klee made an application for the * cancellation of the first certificate, making the required declaration' as to its loss or disappearance. Waiving its surrender, the association issued a new certificate to Frederick Klee, in which he designated his mother, the defendant, as beneficiary. At the time of this designation he was living in the household of his mother, a very sick, man, nursed by her until his death in July, 1903. The defendant claimed to have paid the premiums on both certificates, but the plaintiff asserted that at least part of the moneys therefor was advanced by her. The association, on the rival claims of wife11 and mother, brought the money into court, where the mother\u2019s claim was upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">I am of the opinion that if the defendant was a proper person to be designated as beneficiary, the cancellation of the first certificate was effectual. Lahey v. Lahey, 174 N. Y. 146, 66 N. E. 670, 61 L. R. A. 791, 95 Am. St. Rep. 554; Shipman v. Protected Home Circle, 174 N. Y. 409, 67 N. E. 83, 63 L. R. A. 347. The association is incorporated under a general statute of the state of New Jersey making it lawful to pay death benefits, according to rules and by-laws adopted, \u201cto the husband, wife, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, and legal representatives of such member.\u201d 1 Gen. St. N. J. p. 153, \u00a7 24. Under this state law, which is controlling, and precludes the designation of other beneficiaries than those designated in the act, the certificate of incorporation provided for the payment of the benefit to the \u201cfamily, orphans, or dependents, as such member may direct.\u201d These words \u201cfamily, orphans, or dependents\u201d must be read in reference to the statute under which incorporation was had, as the corporation has no authority to create a benefit fund for others than the persons within the classes limited by law. Bacon, Benefit Society (3d Ed.) \u00a7 244; Massey v. Mutual Relief Society, 102 N. Y. 523, 7 N. E. 619; American Legion of Honor v. Perry, 140 Mass. 580, 5 N. E. 634. Thus the word \u201cdependents\u201d cannot be construed in its usual broader sense, but must be held to apply to one of the persons named in the legislative act. On the other hand, with this rule of construction in mind, I think the word \u201cfamily\u201d was set out in the certificate of incorporation to embrace, under certain circumstances, all the other persons mentioned in the act, except legal representatives. Little is to be derived in this case from examining the various definitions that have been given to the term \u201cfamily\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>in benefit or other cases. Precedents may be found where it has been held to include a mother and others where it has excluded her. See 1 Bacon, supra, \u00a7 256. Each case must be examined on its own facts. Here, at the time of Klee\u2019s death, his mother was part of his immediate domestic circle, lived under one roof with him. While, in accuracy, it might be more correct to say that he was a member of her family than that she was a member of his, yet the term is to be read in the light of the facts in reference to the meaning intended by the certificate of incorporation when viewed in connection with the enabling act. That limited the beneficiaries to a few named persons. Th\u00e9 restriction is greater than is usual in similar statutes. \u2018All the persons named, barring legal representatives, are kindred, and may be, as they frequently are, included in the term \"family.\u201d \"Now, this word \u2018family\u2019 is an expression of great flexibility. It is applied in many ways. It may mean the h\u00fasband and the wife having no children, and living alone together, or it may mean children, or wife and children, or blood relatives, or any group constituting a distinct domestic or social body.\u201d Carmichael v. N. W. Mut. Ben. Ass\u2019n, 51 Mich. 494, 16 N. W. 871. I\u00bft is reasonable to assume that the incorporators intended to use the term in its broader sense, colloquially, perhaps, having in mind that all the persons contemplated by the statute would be embraced by the broad designation. It may have, been deemed necessary to use the word \"orphans\u201d so that in the case of the death of a surviving father or mother it might not be said that, there being no family left, they could not take in the absence of a special characterization. As the right to designate beneficiaries is unlimited in the absence of restriction (Massey v. Mutual Relief Society, supra), we should not construe a general term in limine unless compelled to do so. I therefore conclude that the use of the term \u201cfamily\u201d in the certificate was made in reference to the enumerated persons in the state statute, and that under the circumstances here disclose4 the defendant was properly designated as a beneficiary. It follows, therefore, that the judgment should be affirmed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
