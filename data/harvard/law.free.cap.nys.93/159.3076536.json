The action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u2022commenced on the 7th day of November, 1904. It thus appears that the inquiry covered a period of more than 10 months. The issue \"framed is altogether too general and indefinite as to place. It is manifest that it would be impossible for the defendant to prepare dor the trial of the issue. Witnesses might be summoned to show the commission of the act of infidelity in any foreign state or country. The defendant doubtless could, upon motion, have had the \u25a0complaint made more definite in this regard. Cardwell v. Cardwell, 12 Hun, 92. And he would at least have been entitled to a bill \u25a0of particulars of the precise places, and also of the times, unless the plaintiff be relying upon circumstantial evidence showing a \u00bfgeneral course of conduct from which the inference of criminal intimacy may be drawn. Krauss v. Krauss, 73 App.. Div. 509, 77 N. Y. Supp. 203. The defendant, however, notwithstanding his \u25a0failure to move to have the complaint made more definite or certain, \u2022or for a bill of particulars, is, entitled to have the issues framed with such a degree of definiteness as will avoid surprise on the trial and enable him to prepare his defense. Carrillo v. Carrillo (Sup.) 6 N. Y. Supp. 305. These views require the elimination of \"the words \u201cand elsewhere.\u201d Since, however, the co-respondent is named, and there was no motion for a bill of particulars of the places in the city of New York where the plaintiff claims the \u2022adultery was committed, it is likely that the defendant will be prepared to meet any evidence offered tending to show misconduct in the city where the trial is to take place. If not, he should have presented an affidavit showing the necessity for having the issue \u25a0so framed as to specifically designate the precise places by streets \u2022and numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The order also frames as issues to be tried by the jury the questions. as to whether the adultery was committed without the consent, connivance, or procurement of the plaintiff, whether five years \u2022elapsed since the plaintiff discovered the facts, and whether she has voluntarily cohabited with the defendant since such discovery. 'These are issues to be tried by the court, if necessary, after the rendition of the verdict upon the issue of adultery. We disapprove of the practice of submitting these issues to a jury, since there is no \u2022authority therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">It follows; therefore, that the ord\u00e9r should be modified by striking out the words \u201cand elsewhere,\u201d in the second issue as framed, and by striking out the third, fourth, and fifth issues, and, as thus modified. affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
