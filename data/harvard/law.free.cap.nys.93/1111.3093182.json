J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS6\">An order having been made under section 873, Code Civ. Proc., for the physical examination of plaintiff and her examination before trial, the court below, by the order appealed from, has stricken out of the order the provision for plaintiffs oral examination, leaving intact the appointment of the referee named in the original order (although nothing is left for him to do), and the provision for a physical examination by the physician named. This reduces the order to the precise form condemned by the Court of Appeals in Lyon v. Manhattan Railway Company, 142 N. Y. 301, 37 N. E. 113, 25 L. R. A. 402. As was forcibly demonstrated by the opinion in that case, it would be utterly impossible under such an order to attain the end which the Legislature had in. view, and would defeat every practical and useful object sought to be accomplished. While the affidavits on the part of defendants may not be sufficient to justify an order for the general examination of plaintiff as a witness before trial, they are certainly sufficient to sustain an order for her physical examination. Green v. Middlesex R. R. Co., 10 Misc. Rep. 473, 32 N. Y. Supp. 177; Moses v. Newburg El. R. Co., 91 Hun, 278, 36 N. Y. Supp. 149. If it was proper to order a physical examination of plaintiff, provision for her oral examination must accompany the order. Section 873 of the Code provides that \u201cwhere the person to be examined is a party to a pending action * * * the order may, in the discretion of the judge designate and limit the particular matters as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>to which he shall be examined.\u201d If plaintiff considered that no proper case had been shown for her general examination, her proper remedy was to apply for a modification of the order so as to limit the scope of her examination, which, in the discretion of the court below, might have been confined to questions touching the nature and extent of her injuries. But for the striking out of all provision for an oral examination there is no warrant or authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, without prejudice, upon payment of such costs and disbursements, of a motion by plaintiff to limit the scope of her oral examination. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
