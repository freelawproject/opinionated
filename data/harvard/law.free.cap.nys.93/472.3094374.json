It is therefore only necessary to consider the power of the justice to impose, in addition to the payment by defendant of $10 costs, and that the judgment entered stand as security, the condition that, defendant consent \u201cin writing that William Bianchi, at plaintiff\u2019s election, may be either substituted or joined as party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>plaintiff in this action.\u201d The appeal is taken from that portion of the order which imposes the last-mentioned condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">Section 255 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1563, _c. 580) authorizes the court to grant or deny a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, and section 256 defines the conditions which the court may impose for setting aside a judgment in such a case. \u201cThe Municipal Court is purely a creature of the statute, and has no jurisdiction not specially conferred thereby.\u201d Leavitt v. Katzoff, 43 Misc. Rep. 27, 86 N. Y. Supp. 495. The question here presented was substantially involved in the case of Schwartz v. Schendel, 24 Misc. Rep. 701, 53 N. Y. Supp. 773, where this court held that the justice of a Municipal Court exceeded his authority in imposing costs, beyond those prescribed by statute, upon an application to open a default.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">One of the grounds here urged upon the motion for a new trial' was that the defendant, after the entry of judgment, discovered' that the plaintiff, two months before the commencement of this action, had transferred to one William Bianchi, as trustee, all his business assets. If the defendant can show that plaintiff has no-standing in court, he would be entitled to a dismissal of the complaint, with costs. The joining of Bianchi as a party plaintiff would seem to be purposeless. Either Bianchi or plaintiff is the legal owner of the alleged claim. Both cannot maintain the action. If Bianchi be the owner, the court is virtually compelling defendant to submit to a litigation which Bianchi may not deem proper to-bring, and the court would, in effect, permit a new action to be brought against a defendant in violation of section 26 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1498, c. 580), which limits the jurisdiction of the court over the parties by requiring either \u201cthe service of a summons or the voluntary appearance of and joinder of issues by the parties.\u201d Bianchi has no standing in this action, and if the facts alleged in the moving affidavits entitle the defendant to the relief desired, as, indeed, is not denied, then justice requires that the motion be granted upon terms permitted by the statute, and that all conditions in excess thereof be eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The order should be modified by striking therefrom the portion from which the appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Order modified accordingly, and, as so modified, affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
