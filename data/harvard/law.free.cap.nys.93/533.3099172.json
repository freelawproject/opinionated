From an order setting aside an inquest and opening a default taken at trial term, plaintiff appeals. Modified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-11\">The action was at issue, and was duly reached on the day calendar of the trial term for trial. Defendant having failed to appear upon call of the calendar, the cause was called for inquest on plaintiff\u2019s motion, and an inquest was thereupon duly taken. The motion to open the default and set aside the inquest was subsequently made and granted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b563-12\">Argued before SCOTT, P.

In the present case, however, the terms imposed upon opening the default seem to be quite inadequate. In addition to the $10 motion costs provided for by the order, there should be added a trial fee of $30 and the plaintiff\u2019s disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">The order will be modified to this extent, and, as modified, affirmed, without, costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
