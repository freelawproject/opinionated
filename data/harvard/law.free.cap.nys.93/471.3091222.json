It was alleged that plaintiff was induced to purchase of defendant a barber shop business, consisting of stock, fixtures, and good will, for the sum of $500, relying upon the false and fraudulent representations of the defendant that the business was a profitable one; \u201cthat the gross receipts had averaged during the year previous from sixty to sixty-five dollars,\u201d presumably per day, as testified to by plaintiff; that said representations were false and untrue, and so known to be by defendant, and that the plaintiff was thereby damaged in the sum of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">The alleged representations were established upon the trial, but the plaintiff failed to sustain the burden of proof in two essential respects: First, in omitting to show that the gross receipts of the business had not averaged from $60 to $65 per day during the previous year; and, secondly, in neglecting to give any proof which would furnish a basis for estimating damages. The only witness called to prove the falsity of the representations was a barber who had been employed in the shop for upwards of a year previous to the sale, but who repeatedly stated that he could not tell what the daily receipts were; that he \u201cdid not bother with that\u201d; that, if he should say \u201c$40 or $50 or $60, I must lie. I say that I did not bother with it, and that is all. * * * I don\u2019t know anything, and I did not work myself on commission. I got a steady salary, and not a commission, * * * arid I was working in the front and in the cigar store and all around.\" This witness, in the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>of considerable prodding, stated that $9 was \u201cabout the highest\u201d sum taken in per day, and that sometimes it would be $6, $7, or $8. Fraud will not be presumed, and it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to furnish reasonably satisfactory evidence thereof. On the question of damage, the proof is altogether deficient. No testimony of any kind bearing upon the subject of damages was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The learned justice and the counsel for the plaintiff apparently tried the case as though it were one for rescission of contract, an action in equity not cognizable in the Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
