The defendants were the contractors for the ironwork therein. They had set up vertical iron bars from floor to ceiling in front of the open elevator shaft, which were called \u201cchannel bars,\u201d and which were designed to hold the fire bricks making the \u201cfinal wall\u201d of the shaft. At the time of the accident a scaffold 6 feet above the floor, laid upon wooden supports, called \u201chorses,\u201d extended from the wall 20 feet across the room, so close to the elevator shaft as to leave but a narrow space.- The plaintiff testifies that the space was about 10 inches wide; one \u201ccould hardly get through that.\u201d His witness Raymond testifies that the space was 10 or 12 inches, so that a man \u201ccould barely squeeze through if he was not too large.\u201d The plaintiff sought passage from one end of the building to the other. He attempted \u201cto squeeze through\u201d this space, and in so doing took hold of the iron bar so that the bar \u201cwent out\u201d and he fell into the open elevator shaft. The said witness Raymond testifies</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-17\">\u201cWell, as the horse was close to the uprights, the channel Irons, or T-irons, whichever they were, I don\u2019t recollect, but the horse was standing too close for a man to walk through with his shoulders facing forward, and so he faced towards the shaft and walked in sideways, and as he grabbed hold of this first upright he come to it leaned out with him, and he squeezed in between the horse and the upright, and he fell out with it. He swung out with the upright. The upright leaned up against the wall\u2014the upright being longer than the width of the shaft\u2014and the upright leaned in about a thirty-degree angle, and he hung on for about two or three seconds, and finally bis fingers gave way and he dropped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The negligence imputed to the defendants is their failure to \u201cproperly construct and erect the said vertical bars or pillars, and particularly the one in question,\u201d \u201cto properly bolt, fasten, and rivet the said bars, and leaving the same in a seemingly safe and permanent condition,\u201d and \u201cto give any notice of the unsafe and dangerous condition of the said bars or pillars.\u201d The plaintiff and his witness Raymond admit that one could have gained a passage under the scaffold, but they assert that the space thereunder was incumbered by fireproofing, barrels, laths, and other material. Raymond admits, however, that one could have moved three or four bundles of laths, and passed underneath the scaffold in perfect safety, if he had \u201cgone and asked permission of the lather, or whoever owned the property that was there.\u201d There was a sharp contradiction as to whether there was any material impediment. But, further, there is convincing evidence that at this time there was a passageway\u2014evidently the projected hallway\u2014running from front to rear, in such condition that one could pass along it. The plaintiff testifies that he did not look to see whether there was such a passageway. Raymond, in rebuttal, testifies that there was no flooring on it, simply beams running across an open space; but it is clear enough that it afforded access. The plaintiff says that he thought the way he attempted to take was the easiest and the shortest, and Raymond says it was the nearest. The plaintiff knew that the building was under construction. He had been working on this floor \u201cfor one day or two,\u201d or \u201cmaybe more,\u201d and he was familiar with the plans of the floor, and knew the rooms in it, though he testifies, \u201cI cannot understand that plan,\u201d referring to a plan exhibited to him. There is no proof that any other person had ever attempted such a passage, and there is no proof of any invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">I think that there is no negligence shown as against the defendants. The case falls within the rule that negligence is not imputable to an accident, \u201cnot the reasonable, natural, and probable result\u201d under the circumstances, \u201cwhich ought to have been foreseen by the defendants in the exercise\u201d of due prudence. I have collated some of the authorities in McKenzie v. Waddell Coal Co., 89 App. Div. 415, 85 N. Y. Supp. 819, and in Saverio-Cella v. Brooklyn Union R. R. Co., 55 App. Div. 98, 66 N. Y. Supp. 1021, and I need not repeat them. The defendants had not finished this work. I cannot see that they lacked due prudence in leaving for a time this iron bar incompletely secured, so that they ought to have foreseen, notwithstanding other and natural means of passage, that a workman, if \u201cnot too large a man,\u201d might attempt \u201cto squeeze through\u201d the narrow opening sideways, and in so doing would use the iron bar on the assumption that it was then so secured that he might, with impunity, use it to widen his passage, or to aid his passage, or as a fender against the open shaft.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">I advise a reversal of the judgment and order, and the granting of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Judgment and. order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
