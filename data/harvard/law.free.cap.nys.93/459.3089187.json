The pleadings were oral, and the answer was a general denial. The proof established an appraisal of the furniture, which service was worth $10; but, save as to this it\u00e9m, the award of $170 to the plaintiffs was so clearly against the weight of evidence as to demand a reversal of the judgment, in the exercise of the power vested in the appellate court by section 326 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1583, c. 580).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-19\">That the plaintiffs found a person who was ready and willing to buy the defendant\u2019s lease and furniture was sufficiently established; but it was equally clear that what the plaintiffs did to bring about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>this result was done by them at the instance and request of the proposed purchaser, and not at the instance and request of the defendant at all. In brief, the brokers, so far as the projected transfer of the lease was concerned, were acting throughout the transaction as the agents of the intending vendee, rather than as the agents-of the intending vendor. Under such circumstances, the brokers are not entitled to enforce payment of their commission by the intending vendor. Fowler v. Hoschke, 53 App. Div. 327, 65 N. Y. Supp. 638; Haynes v. Fraser, 76 App. Div. 627, 78 N. Y. Supp. 794. The oral testimony tending to show that the true relation of the parties was such as has been stated is cogently confirmed by a letter to the' defendant written by the plaintiff Kaake the day after he had presented to her his bill of $10 for the services rendered by his firm in appraising the furniture. This communication, considered in connection with a memorandum at the foot of the bill itself, leaves no room to doubt that the writer had then abandoned any claim for commissions, such as that subsequently asserted in this-suit. .He speaks of the would-be vendee as his \u201ccustomer,\u201d and treats his firm\u2019s claim for. commissions growing out of the attempted sale of the lease as something which had- been relinquished; offering to deduct the $10 from their commission if they should find a customer for the defendant\u2019s property in the future. This correspondence makes the weight of evidence against the plaintiffs too-heavy to permit this court to sustain a decision in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">It follows that there should be a reversal and a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
