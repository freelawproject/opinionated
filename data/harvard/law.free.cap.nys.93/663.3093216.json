That the plaintiff, at the time referred to in the complaint, sustained severe personal injuries, or that he was free from negligence, was not seriously contested at the trial. It was, however, contended that the defendant' was not responsible, inasmuch as its negligence was not the proximate cause of the- accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The facts are not complicated. The plaintiff started to walk in a westerly direction across Broadway at Eighty-First street, in the city of New York. An excavation for the subway had been made at this point in the center of Broadway, over a portion of which planks had been placed, with a railing on either side, to-facilitate travel across the street. Defendant\u2019s north-bound cars run on the easterly, and its south-bound cars on the westerly, side of Broadway. About the same time, but a little to the rear of the plaintiff, a truck attempted to cross, going in the same direction; and just as the plaintiff was upon the bridge one of the defendant\u2019s north-bound cars struck the hind wheels or rear portion of the truck, and threw it against the plaintiff with such force that a portion of the bridge was broken and he was thrown into the excavation, thereby sustaining the injuries of which he complains. In his complaint he alleged that his injuries were caused \u201csolely through the fault, carelessness, and negligence of the defendant\u201d;, and the learned trial justice, ,at the conclusion of the trial, as appears from the charge and refusals to charge, seems to have entertained the idea that by reason of such allegation a recovery could not be had if the negligence of the driver of the truck contributed in any way to the accident. Evidence was offered on the part of the defendant from which it claimed the jury might find that the driver of the truck was either alone responsible for the accident, or else his negligence contributed to it, and in either case, if the jury did so find, defendant could not be held liable; and at its request the learned trial justice, in effect, so instructed the jury. Exceptions were taken by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to such instruction-, and he, in turn, requested the court to charge that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">\u201cIf the jury finds that plaintiff was free from contributory negligence, and that the railroad company was negligent, and such negligence was one of the causes of the accident, without which it would not have happened, the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict,, irrespective of the fact that the driver of the truck was also negligent\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>This request was refused, and an exception also taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">In both instances the court erred. The rule has long been settled in this state\u2014evidenced by the following out of many authorities which might be cited\u2014that a third person who is injured by the negligence of two or more persons, he himself being free from negligence, may maintain an action against them jointly or severally to recover the damages sustained (Webster v. Hudson River R. Co., 38 N. Y. 260; Barrett v. Third Ave. R. Co., 45 N. Y. 628; Ring v. City of Cohoes, 77 N. Y. 83, 33 Am. Rep. 574; Kunz v. City of Troy, 104 N. Y. 344, 10 N. E. 442, 58 Am. Rep. 508; Cohen v. Mayor, 113 N. Y. 532, 21 N. E. 700, 4 L. R. A. 406, 10 Am. St. Rep. 506; Phillips v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 127 N. Y. 657, 27 N. E. 978; Murphy v. Leggett, 164 N. Y. 121, 58 N. E. 42; Rider v. Syracuse R. T. Ry. Co., 171 N. Y. 139, 63 N. E. 836, 58 L. R. A. 125; Leeds v. N. Y. Telephone Co., 178 N. Y. 118, 70 N. E. 219; Lipp v. Otis Bros. Co., 28 App. Div. 228, 51 N. Y. Supp. 13), and when such action is brought a defendant cannot successfully defend the same on the ground that the negligence of another contributed to the injury (Travell v. Bannerman, 71 App. Div. 439, 75 N. Y. Supp. 866).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In Webster v. Hudson River R. Co., supra, there was evidence to the effect that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused in part, at least, by the negligence of a third party; and the trial court was asked to charge that, if the jury so found, the plaintiff could not recover. This vvas refused, and on appeal the court, in holding that no error was committed, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cThe fact that the Boston Road was also guilty of negligence furnishes, in law or morals, no excuse for the negligence of the Hudson River Company, and no reason why they should not respond in damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In Kunz v. City of Troy, supra, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201cA defendant whose negligence was a constituent element of the transaction, and without which the injury would not have happened, is legally responsible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">And in Phillips v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., supra, it was held that where, in an action to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, it appeared there were two proximate causes of the injury\u2014one the negligence of the defendant, and the other an occurrence happening without fault on the part of the plaintiff\u2014the latter was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">But it is unnecessary to multiply authorities. The rule is too well settled to require it. The request here made, under the Webster Case, was proper, and the instruction should have been given. The vice of the charge as made, and the refusal of plaintiff\u2019s request, is apparent, and, if not, it will be on reading the same in connection with the main charge and other instructions given at the request of defendant\u2019s counsel. In the main charge the jury\u2019s attention was called to the allegations of . the complaint to the effect that the injuries were inflicted solely through the negligence of the defendant, and, in that connection, stress was laid upon the fact that the negligence of the truckman was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>During the course of the trial the defendant put in evidence an ordinance of the city of New York to the effect that vehicles proceeding in a northerly or southerly direction had the right of way over vehicles proceeding in an easterly or westerly direction, and the court instructed the jury, as requested by defendant\u2019s counsel, that \u201csuch right of way required the driver of the truck or wagon to stop his horses and let the car pass, if that was necessary to prevent the obstruction of the car upon its passage.\u201d This was error. It entirely eliminated the respective positions of the car and the truck at the time the truck commenced to cross Broadway. There was evidence to the effect that the car at that time was at Eightieth street, and the truck, at the time the collision occurred, had almost passed over the tracks; and, if the speed of the car had been slackened at all, a collision would not have occurred. The car did not have an absolute right to the exclusive use of the street. The truckman had a right to cross Broadway; so did the plaintiff; and the defendant was bound to operate its cars having .regard to that right, and, if it failed to do so, it was obligated to make good to the plaintiff any damage he sustained by reason thereof. But under the instruction the jury could not do otherwise than find that the driver of the truck was negligent because he did not let the car pass before he attempted to cross the tracks. A collision did occur, and, if he had not attempted to cross defendant\u2019s tracks until the car had passed by, it would not. Therefore he obstructed the passage of the car, which, under the instructions given, he had no right to do. And then to refuse to charge the request of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, above quoted, was equivalent to saying to the jury that they could not under any circumstances render a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Numerous other errors are alleged as to the charge as made, but it is unnecessary to consider them in detail, inasmuch as there must be a new trial, and it is not at all likely similar errors will again be committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
