The defendant denied this allegation, and interposed a defense, which it will be unnecessary to mention, in view of the disposition we are to make of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-18\">The judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff upon the verdict of the jury must be reversed, because of exceptions taken upon the trial. The plaintiff, after giving evidence tending to show the amount due and owing, together with an acknowledgment of the indebtedness by defendant, called his father as a witness, who was permitted to testify that he loaned the company money from time to time, and was then asked,., \u201cAnd kept it going in that way <em>?&gt;y </em>Counsel for defendant objected to this question. The objection was overruled; whereupon an exception was taken, and the witness answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d He was then asked, \u201cAnd you had to sue for your own money, too, Mr. Davis, didn\u2019t you ?\u201d Counsel for defendant objected to this question as immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent and not within the issue.- The objection was overruled, and exception was taken by the defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked, \u201cYou had to sue for part of your money?\u201d and the witness-answered, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d No objection was taken to the last question, but it was a substantial repetition of the one preceding, and the objection and exception are available. This evidence did not tend in any way to prove the alleged indebtedness to the plaintiff or to-corroborate the testimony he had given. It might easily have prejudiced the jury, and the presumption is that it did. The evidence was clearly incompetent and improper, and its admission was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>error. Other exceptions were taken to the admission of evidence upon the trial and to the charge to the jury; but, as the judgment is to be reversed for the reasons already stated, it is unnecessary to discuss them.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Judgment and order reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
