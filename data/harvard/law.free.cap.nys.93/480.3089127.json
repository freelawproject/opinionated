The defense alleges that a case of goods received by it from the Old Dominion Steamship Company upon., a bill of lading issued to the plaintiffs was duly transported by it to the city of its destination; that due notice of its arrival was given to one M. Hirsh, the person directed to be notified in the bill of lading; that, no demand for delivery having been made, the case was placed in storage. Defendant further alleged that at the same time there were two other cases in its storehouse marked in the same manner as the case referred to in the complaint, and that, when the said Hirsh subsequently presented a bill of lading for two cases, the defendant, \u201cwithout any negligence on its part,\u201d delivered to him two of the said three cases, and subsequently, pursuant to a notice \"from the Old Dominion Steamship Company, returned the third case to that company. The defense closes with a conclusion of the pleader \u201cthat the misdelivery, if any, was due to the negligence of the plaintiffs, or failing to properly mark each of the said three cases so that they could be identified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The difficulty, with the defense attempted to be pleaded is that it does not allege that plaintiffs consigned the two other cases transported by the defendant, or that plaintiffs had anything to do with said cases, nor are there any facts stated from which it may be inferred that plaintiffs were the consignors of the other two cases, or were in any way connected with the marks upon them. There is no allegation showing how the several cases were marked, the pleader contenting himself with alleging a conclusion that the two other cases were marked \u201cin the same manner as the case referred to in the complaint.\u201d Reference to the copy bill of lading annexed to and referred to in the answer shows that the goods were consigned to L. Ullmann &amp; Co. (not Hirsh), that the bill of lading contained the word \u201corder\u201d before the name of the consignees, L. Ullmann &amp; Co., and that in such cases a proper indorsement by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>consignees was required before the delivery of the property at destination. There is no allegation that the consignees had indorsed the bill of lading presented by M. Hirsh, or that M. Hirsh was entitled to receive the goods. Subdivision 2 of section 500 of the Code of Civil Procedure requires \u201ca clear, precise and unequivocal statement of any new matter constituting a defense or counterclaim.\u201d The pleading to which the demurrer was interposed should be condemned as being neither clear, precise, nor unequivocal. It states no defense, and is insufficient in law, and the demurrer should not have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The interlocutory judgment entered should be reversed, and the demurrer to the second separate defense sustained, with costs below and costs of this appeal, with leave to defendant to amend within six days upon the payment of all costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
