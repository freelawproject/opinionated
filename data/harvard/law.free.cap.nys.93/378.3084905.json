The proof introduced by the plaintiff shows that the defendants had obtained a contract from the city for the purpos\u00e9 of laying a sidewalk around the Tombs building, then in course of construction; that during the progress of the work of laying the sidewalk a number of flagstones were piled up near the curb, leaving considerable space between the pile and the building or house line; and that plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by his stumbling over the pile of stones.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-26\">It is well settled that a temporary obstruction of the street or highway, when it appears that the act was done with the consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>of the proper public authorities, and in the course of construction of a building, sidewalk, or other work, is not a nuisance.

Upon the facts disclosed, the action was not maintainable upon the theory of a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
