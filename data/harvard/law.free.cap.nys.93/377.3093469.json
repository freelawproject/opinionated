No facts are pleaded, nor are any disclosed in the answering affidavit upon this motion, from which it may be said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>defendant is fairly apprised of the precise nature of the plaintiff\u2019s .claim in respect of waiver. Plaintiff should be required to furnish particulars as to the nature of the acts which constitute the alleged .waiver, the times when such acts were done, and by whom done. It also seems to me that the plaintiff should be required to furnish particulars of the reasonable value'of the property which he claims was destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The order will be modified to the extent indicated, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
