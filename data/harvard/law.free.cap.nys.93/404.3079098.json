BARTLETT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALT\">We agree with the learned surrogate that the trust attempted to be created by the-first paragraph of the will is void. He was also right in holding that the invalidity of this trust did not wholly destroy the will. An ineffectual attempt to create a trust estate does not affect bequests which are otherwise valid. Everitt v. Everitt, 29 N. Y. 39, 82. Where a will is good in part and bad in part, the good portions should be preserved, if they are separable and capable of being carried out in fulfillment of the general plan of the instrument. Kalish v. Kalish, 166 N. Y. 377, 59 N. E. 917; Smith v. Chesebrough, 176 N. Y. 317, 68 N. E. 625. The Kalish Case declares the rule to be firmly established in this state \u201cthat, when the several parts of a will are so intermingled or interdependent that the bad cannot be separated from the good, the will'must fail altogether; but, when it is possible to cut out the invalid portions, so as to leave intact the parts that are valid, and to preserve the general plan of the testator, such a construction will be adopted as will prevent intestacy, either partial \u2022 or total, as the case may be\u201d; and in Smith v. Chesebrough it was expressly held that, where the invalid parts could be expunged without essentially changing or destroying the testator\u2019s general testamentary scheme, the valid parts of the will should be upheld. We think that the learned surrogate has given the appellants the full benefit of this rule, except in one instance. It seems to us that the life estate in the Warren street house, in Brooklyn, devised to Edgar A. Trotter by the fourth paragraph of the will, may be upheld. The time given to the devisee within which to elect whether he will occupy the premises or not is not an illegal suspension of the power of alienation, since it must necessarily be exercised within the devisee\u2019s lifetime; and the devise is quite as distinct and separable from the objectionable portions of the will as the other testamentary provisions, which have, as we think, been properly sustained by the decree under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">By the provision in paragraph E of the second codicil, substituted for the sixteenth paragraph of the will, the division of the testator\u2019s residuary estate is postponed until \u201cthe termination of all life annuities by death of the beneficiaries named.\u201d In behalf of the life annuitants, who are at least four in number, we are asked to construe this provision as directing the distribution of the residuary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>estate upon the death of each annuitant, instead of after the death of all, or else to disregard the provision altogether. The language of the testator is too plain to permit the adoption of the construction suggested, and it is not clear that the testator\u2019s intent as to the final disposition of his residuary estate would be carried out if the provision were wholly disregarded. It is quite conceivable that the residuary legacies might have been different, both as to beneficiaries and proportionate shares, if the testator had not supposed that the residuary estate could be preserved intact until the termination of all the life annuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Concurring, as we do, in the results reached by the learned surrogate, with the exception which has been noted, it follows that his decree should be modified so as to adjudge the devise of the life estate to Edgar A. Trotter to be valid; and, as thus modified, the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court of Kings county modified so as as to adjudge that the devise of the life estate to Edgar A. Trotter is valid, and, as thus modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
