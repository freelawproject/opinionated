The action is one brought to recover for damages sustained by plaintiff, a truck driver, while driving his truck along West Broadway, in this city, by a collision therewith of one of defendant\u2019s cars, as alleged, through the negligence of defendant. Defendant\u2019s motorman, called as a witness on its behalf, had testified to his recollection of the occurrence in question, when, at the close of his recross-examination, he was asked: \u201cQ. Did you see this gentleman, Mr. Tennessee, standing there?\u201d To which he answered:. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is. I did not see him.\u201d Tennessee was the first witness called on plaintiff\u2019s behalf, and had testified as an eyewitness of the occurrence. The motorman,. Harvey, was then asked whether Tennessee had not asked him why he (Harvey) ran into the truck, to which he had made an abusive reply, and Harvey denied the same absolutely. The witness Tennessee, recalled, was then, against defendant\u2019s objection,, allowed to testify that he had asked the motorman immediately after the accident, \u201cDo you know that you hurt a fellow?\u201d To which the motorman made the abusive reply as to which he had been questioned. The motorman\u2019s alleged reply was in no way relevant or material as to the matter at issue.- It contained no admission or declaration as to the cause of the collision. It in no way contradicted any of his testimony brought out upon direct examination. The only purpose of offering the proof, and the effect of its receipt, were to impress the jury with the idea of Harvey\u2019s lack of credibility. But the matter in question (i. e., the conversation with Tennessee) was not brought out on. the direct examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>Harvey, nor was he questioned regarding any such topic. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, therefore, by asking him the question as to any conversation with Tennessee, made him the plaintiff\u2019s witness as to such new matter, and could not contradict him thereupon; and as the only effect of Tennessee\u2019s evidence was to impeach Harvey upon a point of conversation between them which threw no light on the cause of the accident, and not to give any material evidence upon any issue in the case, it was improperly received.

Rep. 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
