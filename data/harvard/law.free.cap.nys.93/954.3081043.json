From a judgment for defendant, plaintiff appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b985-5\">William Shelp and family prior to May 13, 1901, had resided for more than a year, and thereby gained a settlement, in the town of Delaware, county of Sullivan. On that day he voluntarily moved himself and family into the <em>town of </em>Hancock, <em>county </em>of Delaware. While in such town of Delaware he supported his family continuously, and no relief was ever asked or furnished him or the family by that town. In the July following, application was made by his family to the overseer of the poor of the town of Hancock for relief; and on investigation, he finding them destitute, relief was furnished them, and the superintendent of the poor of Delaware county notified. The superintendent thereupon took charge of them, and thereafter furnished them necessary relief for some three or four months, amounting in all to $83.89. It seems to be conceded that during such time Shelp himself was confined in jail in Delaware county for some offense committed in July. As soon as the county superintendent took charge of the family, he served upon the overseer of the poor of the town of Delaware, Sullivan county, a notice to take charge of such family, as required by section 51 of the poor law (Laws 1896, p. 154, c. 225). Such overseer thereupon served upon the said superintendent a notice denying all liability for their support, as permitted by section 52 of such law. This action was thereupon brought against such town to recover the amount so expended by the superintendent of Delaware county. It was tried and submitted to the court without a jury. A decision was rendered in favor of the \u25a0 defendant, dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, with costs, and from the judgment entered thereon this appeal is taken.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b985-6\">Argued before PARKER, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYQq\">I think it may be conceded that Shelp and his family had gained a settlement, and still retained it, in the town of Delaware, Sullivan county, when they applied for relief to the overseer of the town of Hancock (see section 40 of the Poor Law, Laws 1896, p. 149, c. 225) ; and still the said town of Delaware was-not liable to reimburse the county of Delaware for such relief. When such family became in need of public relief, it was actually residing in the county of Delaware. It had not been moved or enticed to move into such county as a \u201cpoor person\u201d; but it had gone voluntarily into that county from the town of Delaware, without having ever become, been treated, or been considered as a \u201cpoor person\u201d while in that town. In July, therefore, when it asked for public relief, it was in the situation referred to in subdivision 2 of section 42 of the poor law. It \u201chad not gained a settlement in any town or city in the county in which it became poor, sick or infirm,\u201d and it must therefore, as further provided by such subdivision, \u201cbe supported and relieved by the superintendent of the poor at the expense of the county.\u201d Clearly that is of the county in which it became poor, viz., Delaware county. Now, Delaware county, as between it and any town in that county, agrees to such conclusion; but it claims that, under the provisions of section 51 of such law, it may demand to be reimbursed by any town outside of such county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>in which the person relieved then had a settlement. It is to be noticed, however, that the provisions of section 51 apply only to a \u201cpoor person\u201d who has been moved or strayed from one town, or county, to another \u201cnot legally chargeable with his support.\u201d Now, clearly, under the definition of \u201ca poor person\u201d given by section <em>2 </em>of such poor law, Shelp and his family were not \u201cpoor persons\u201d when they strayed from the town of Delaware, Sullivan county, into-Delaware county. See, also, Wood v. Simmons, 51 Hun, 325, 4 N. Y. Supp. 368. Section 51 also provides that notice by the superintendent furnishing the support may be given to the overseers of the town or city from which he strayed, \u201cif such town or city be liable for his support, and if there be none in the county from which he came that is liable, then to the county\u201d; thus clearly indicating that the section refers to a person that is being helped or is in need, of public relief at the time he is moved or strayed into the prosecuting county. In other words, when a person becomes a \u201cpoor person\u201d after he has left the town or county in which he has gained' a settlement, he must be supported by such latter county, and there is no provision of law authorizing the county so supporting him to-ask for reimbursement from the town or county from which he came, even though his settlement still remains there.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">I conclude, therefore, that this judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
