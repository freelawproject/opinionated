Clark v. Durland, 35 App. Div. 312, 55 N. <em>Y. </em>Supp. 14. The additional evidence did not suffice to establish the plaintiffs\u2019 title. The judgment obtained at their instance after the first trial of this action, reforming the deed from Mary A. Durland to Elizabeth Barrell and others so as to exclude from the description therein \u201ceight and seventy one-hundredths acres of land covered by the waters of Wickham\u2019s Pond,\u201d etc., was not binding upon the defendant herein, as he was not a party to the action for reformation. So far as the record in that action has any effect upon this litigation, it would appear rather to constitute an admission by all the parties to the deed which was sought to be reformed to the effect that it did in terms convey the 8.70 acres of land covered by the waters of the pond. The learned judge at Special Term rightly concluded that the new proofs did not justify a different result from that formerly reached in this court, and it follows that the judgment now appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
