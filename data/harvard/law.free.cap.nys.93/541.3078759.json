Sills and others against Daniel Gaffney. From a judgment in favor of plaintiff and from an order denying a motion to set aside an order directing substituted service of the summons and from an order denying defendant\u2019s motion to vacate and set aside the judgment, defendant appeals.

Young, of counsel), for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b571-15\">GREENBAUM, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj4M\">The fact seems to be undisputed that the \u2022order for substituted service of the summons upon the defendant and the papers upon which it was granted were not filed until the 9th day of January, 1905, the day before the return day (10th) of the summons. The language of section 34 of the municipal court act (Laws 1903, p. 1501, c. 580) is that \u201cthe order and the papers upon which it [referring to an order for substituted service] was granted must be filed and the service must be made not less than six days before the return day of the summons; otherwise, the order becomes inoperative.\u201d The clear and unmistakable meaning \u25a0of this provision is that a failure to strictly comply with its terms respecting filing of the order and papers therein mentioned is fatal to the maintenance of the action and to the jurisdiction of the court. Behm v. Damm (Sup.) 91 N. Y. Supp. 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">It is unnecessary to consider at length the other grounds for reversal urged by the appellant. It will be sufficient to meet the point of the respondents as to the nonapplicability of the judgment and orders herein by stating that it is doubtless correct that an appeal merely from an order denying defendant\u2019s motion to vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and set aside the order directing substituted service will not lie;but the appeals in this case are also from the judgment and the order denying defendant\u2019s motion to vacate and set aside the judgment. The judgment was not one entered by default. The defendant was not obliged to interpose a verified, or, for that matter, an unverified, answer, since the court had no jurisdiction in the action, and a judgment entered under such circumstances was a nullity, and is not to be treated as by default. The appeal from the judgment enables the court to review all the proceedings upon which the judgment is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The appeals from the order will be dismissed, and the judgment will be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
