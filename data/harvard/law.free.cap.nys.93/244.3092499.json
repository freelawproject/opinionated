She sued to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained by reason of the negligence of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>fendant\u2019s servant, driving its horse and wagon, at the intersection of Flatbush avenue and Fulton street, in the borough of Brooklyn. The accident occurred in the daytime, and the proof was ^wholly void of evidence tending to establish her freedom from contributory negligence, assuming that on the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence there was sufficient proof to carry -the case to the jury. The plaintiff called the defendant\u2019s driver as a witness, and proved by him that as he was jogging along she deliberately backed into the shafts, notwithstanding he called to her loudly, and turned his horse away as quickly as he could in an effort to avoid the collision. The only other evidence given in relation to the actual occurrence was her own, and she testified to nothing on that subject except the fact that she stood in the street waiting for a car without moving for from 5 to 10 minutes, adding the statement that \"the next thing I recall is the hospital.\u201d The inference is that while so-standing she was struck by the defendant\u2019s horse and wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">Having called the defendant\u2019s driver as her witness, the plaintiff must be deemed to have vouched for his general credibility, so that that question was not presented for the jury\u2019s consideration. She was, of course, at liberty to contradict his statement that she backed into the wagon by testifying that she did not move, and to that extent it may be conceded that there was some evidence in support of the charge of negligence on the part of the defendant. It is all the evidence there is on that point. But there was absolutely nothing to show the exercise of care on the plaintiff\u2019s part; no proof that she exercised her faculties in any way; that she looked for vehicles; that she saw, or did not see, the defendant\u2019s horse and wagon; or that she did anything in fact, except to remain standing at the intersection of the two crowded city streets until she was struck and injured. That such evidence is insufficient to establish care is too plain to require citation. It certainly cannot be asserted that it is adequate proof of ordinary care to testify that one has stood motionless in a busy thoroughfare until run into by a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">It follows that the judgment must be affirmed. .</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Judgment of the County Court of .Kings County affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
