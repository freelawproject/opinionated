On July 21,1904, a package containing the dress was delivered to the express company, marked as follows: \u201cMiss May Rogers, c/o Mr. H. B. Wilson, Island Royal, St. Lawrence River, Jefferson County, N. Y. From Mrs. Rogers, 14 West 72nd Street.\u201d Island Royal is a private island eight or more miles from Clayton, and one or two miles from Alexandria Bay. The American Express Company\u2019s lines run to both of these points, but there is no local express between either of them and Island Royal. The plaintiff received a receipt, the material portions of which, for the purposes of this appeal, read as follows: \u201cReceived of Rogers, 14 W. 72, mdse. Marked, May Wilson, Island Royal, St. Lawrence River, N. Y., which this Company undertakes to forward to the nearest point to destination reached by it, subject to the following conditions.\u201d Across the fine print underneath this clause was written: \u201cPd. to Station.\u201d The express company\u2019s agent who made out the receipt testified, without objection, that he told the plaintiff when he did so that \u201cPd. to Station\u201d meant Clayton, and that he placed no other words indicative of destination on the paper. The package was sent to Clayton, where it remained until September 5th. The defendant claimed that the usual notice by postal was sent to the consignee, but that the package was not called for. On September 5th, on instructions from New York, it was forwarded to Alexandria Bay, where it was delivered to Mrs. H. B. Wilson.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">On the state of the record, I am of the opinion that judgment should not have gone for the defendant. Its obligation in this case was substantially that of a common carrier; that is to say, as it had no express line running directly to the destination, its duty would have been performed by forwarding to \u201cthe nearest point,\u201d and thence making a constructive delivery by giving the consignee notice of its arrival. Tarbell v. Royal Exchange Shipping Co., 110 N. Y. 170, 17 N. E. 721, 6 Am. St. Rep. 350; King v. New Brunswick Steamboat Co., 36 Misc. Rep. 555, 73 N. Y. Supp. 999. The \u201cnearest point\u201d in this case was Alexandria Bay. Conceding that the statements of the New York agent to the plaintiff, coupled with the words \u201cPd. to Station,\u201d written on the receipt, were sufficient to vary the written contract, and make the constructive delivery point Clayton\u2014a proposition by no means free from doubt\u2014 it still remained for the defendant to prove the giving of adequate notice. Conceding again that the local custom to notify by postal was sufficiently established (The G. S. Roth Clothing Co. v. The Marine Steamship Co., 44 Misc. Rep. 237, 88 N. Y. Supp. 987), the proof failed to show that the notice was actually sent. Receipt of the postal was denied by the consignee. Much testimony was talc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>en on the question of sending the postal. No notice to produce was served, but, as the objection to the testimony was not clearly made on the ground of its not being the best evidence, the secondary evidence must be examined solely from the standpoint whether it established the mailing. Suitable objection and timely motion to strike out were made on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The agent of the defendant at Clayton swore that he knew of his own knowledge that a notice \u201cwent through the mail,\u201d describing its contents; that he recalled this particular notice; and that he mailed it personally. But he testified further that he did not personally address the notice, and that he did not see it after it was addressed. He relies for the fact that he mailed it personally on the practice that he. always mailed all notices \u201cin a bunch,\u201d and on his \u201crecords.\u201d These records were made up by a clerk who was not called. The. witness testified vaguely to a system of checking these records which was not intelligibly proven. He swore that the method'was not one whereby the clerk repeated the addresses, and he checked them. It is apparent that he is testifying merely to a deduction from an entry in a book not made by himself. While testifying: \u201cI would be willing to- swear that the postal was mailed from the system. It is an utter impossibility that it should not be mailed\u201d\u2014he admitted that the \u201cparticular reason\u201d that he knows the notice was mailed was more from custom than personal knowledge. In view of his admission that he did not write the notice or see it after it was written, his whole testimony is a series of inferences that \u201cit must have been mailed.\u201d This is not proof. If no notice was given, the defendant has not performed his contract, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The record would have justified a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. There is nothing in the point of negligence, and some damage was proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
