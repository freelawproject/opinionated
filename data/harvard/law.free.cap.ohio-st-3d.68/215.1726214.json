Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826, one of the three leading cases involving valuation of subsidized apartments, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u201cAn apartment property built and operated under the auspices of the Department of Housing and Urban Development is to be valued, for real property tax purposes, with due regard for market rent and current returns on mortgages and equities.\u201d See, also, <em>Canton Towers, Ltd. v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 4, 3 OBR 302, 444 N.E.2d 1027, and <em>Oberlin Manor, Ltd. v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 56, 543 N.E.2d 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">While there is no dispute about what kind of rent is applicable (\u201c \u2018economic rent is a proper consideration in a situation in which contract rent is not truly reflective of true value in money,\u2019 \u201d <em>Canton Towers, supra, </em>3 Ohio St.3d at 7, 3 OBR at 305, 444 N.E.2d at 1030, quoting <em>Wynwood Apts., Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>[1979], 59 Ohio St.2d 34, 37, 13 O.O.3d 19, 21, 391 N.E.2d 346, 347), none of these cases specifically discusses the appropriate treatment of expenses in determining the value of subsidized apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Villa Park points out that Garvin \u201creviewed actual expenses and market expenses\u201d and \u201cstabilized operating expenses to reflect \u2018market expenses.\u2019 \u201d Villa Park argues that all apartments (subsidized and nonsubsidized) have expenses for administration, utilities, maintenance, insurance, etc. that can be stabilized to reflect market expenses. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers, The Appraisal of Real Estate (9 Ed.1987) 445, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-11\">\n<em>\u201cOperating expenses are the periodic expenditures necessary to maintain the real property and continue the production of the effective gross income.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">if * * \u00cdf!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\">\u201c * * * [A]n appraiser analyzes and reconstructs expense statements to develop a typical expense expectancy for the property on an annual accrual basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">\u201cOperating expense estimates usually list fixed expenses, variable expenses, and a replacement allowance.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">Garvin reviewed and stabilized expenses and developed an expense budget that included administrative and other operating expenses and reserves for replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The BTA found that Garvin erred in using actual expenses. The question is: Did Garvin use actual expenses improperly or, as he contends, by proper adjustments to actual expenses, did he stabilize them to \u201creflect market operating expenses\u201d? In other words, did he employ an alternate way of showing expenses that was equivalent to using market operating expenses?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In <em>Oberlin Manor, supra, </em>we criticized the board of revision\u2019s appraiser for basing \u201chis opinion on data from other subsidized apartments and actual income, expense, and cost figures from Oberlin Manor.\u201d <em>Id., 45 </em>Ohio St.3d at 56, 543 N.E.2d at 768. We accepted the opinion of value expressed by Oberlin Manor\u2019s appraiser, based on \u201cinformation derived from the general apartment market.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Garvin\u2019s testimony in the instant appeal may be equivalent to information derived from the general apartment market and, thus, would be likewise acceptable, based as it is on his analysis that adjusted actual expenses to \u201creflect economic or market expenses\u201d and that included reserves for replacement to compute net rentals. \u201cSuch reserves are proper items of expense to be utilized when estimating the true value of real property through an income approach.\u201d <em>Freshwater v. Belmont Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 140, 141, 568 N.E.2d 1215, 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Here, as in <em>Freshwater, </em>the following caveat applies: \u201cThe BTA should analyze the reserves to determine if they include any inappropriate items, or if they are otherwise excessive, which would warrant a modification in the amount deducted as expenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The BTA should also decide, in the context of Garvin\u2019s testimony, the meaning of the terms' \u201cstabilized\u201d and \u201creflective of\u2019 and whether Garvin\u2019s stabilized expenses are in accordance with economic or market expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">In its review of the record, the BTA apparently overlooked the fact that the cost of electricity was included in the rent that Phase I tenants paid and that Garvin adjusted his market rent to compensate for this. The BTA observed: \u201c$108,500 [Garvin\u2019s electricity expense] is excessive for electricity since the market rents used in the income approach presume the tenants will pay electricity.\u201d This error affected the BTA\u2019s determination of market expenses and the resultant true value. The BTA should review the $108,500 cost of electricity to see what impact, if any, it has on market rent and market expenses and whether Garvin correctly calculated for this expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The decision of the BTA is reversed and remanded to the BTA with instructions to (1) review and reconsider the record, (2) make factual findings, that are supported by the record, of the appropriate economic or market rents and expenses to be used in the income approach to value, and (3) indicate the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>calculations the BTA uses to determine the fair market value or the \u201ctrue value in money\u201d of the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-5\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.

Bd. of Revision </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 55, 57, 552 N.E.2d 892, 893, we said that \u201c[i]t has been held by this court that the best method of determining true value of real property, in the absence of an actual sale of such property in an arm\u2019s length transaction, is an appraisal based on the amount that such property would bring if sold on the open market. * * * \u201d (Citation omitted.) Further, in <em>Cardinal Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 13, 73 O.O.2d 83, 336 N.E.2d 433, paragraph four of the syllabus, this court held: \u201cThe fair market value of property for tax purposes is a question of fact, <em>the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities, </em>and this court will not disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals with respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawful. * * * \u201d (Citation omitted and emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">A review of the decision of the BTA reveals that the BTA, in placing a value on the Villa Park Apartments, used the income approach to valuation. The BTA was required to follow, and in my judgment did follow, this court\u2019s cases in <em>Canton Towers, Ltd. v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 4, 3 OBR 302, 444 N.E.2d 1027, <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd. v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826, and <em>Oberlin Manor, Ltd. v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 56, 543 N.E.2d 768. In doing so, the BTA was presented with separate appraisals from the competing interests. The BTA received the evidence, weighed it, accepted in part and rejected in part the methods used and appraisals submitted, and arrived at the true and taxable value of the property. In reaching its decision, the BTA acted well within its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">In <em>R.R.Z. Assoc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 198, 201, 527 N.E.2d 874, 877, we stated that \u201c[t]he BTA need not adopt any expert\u2019s valuation. It has wide discretion to determine the weight given to evidence and the credibility of witnesses before it. Its true value decision is a question of fact which will be disturbed by this court only when it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawful. * * * \u201d (Citation omitted.) Further, this court has stated that \u201c[w]e do not sit either as a \u2018super\u2019 Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Tax Appeals or as a trier of fact <em>de novo.\u201d </em>(Citation omitted.) <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 398, 400, 20 O.O.3d 349, 351, 422 N.E.2d 846, 848. Findings of fact by the BTA based upon sufficient probative evidence will not be overruled by this court. <em>Hawthorn Mellody, Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 47, 19 O.O.3d 234, 417 N.E.2d 1257, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We should not substitute our judgment for the decision of the BTA. Because I believe that in this case that is what the majority is doing, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b436-6\">F.E. Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
