Resolution of this issue hinges on an interpretation of certain administrative rules promulgated by the Director of OEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Former R.C. 3704.03(F)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> authorized the Director of OEPA to \u201c[a]dopt, modify, and repeal rules consistent with the purposes of this chapter prohibiting the location, installation, construction, or modification of any air contaminant source * * * <em>unless an installation permit </em>therefor has been obtained from the director or his authorized representative.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Am.Sub.H.B. No. 694,139 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3460, 3740. Pursuant to this statutory authority, the director promulgated Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-02(A), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">\u201c[N]o person shall cause, permit, or allow the <em>installation </em>of a <em>new source of air pollutants </em>* * * or cause, permit, or allow the modification of an air contaminant source * * * <em>without first obtaining a permit to install </em>from the director. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">\u201cInstall\u201d and \u201cinstallation\u201d are defined in Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(1) as \u201cto construct, erect, locate, or affix any air contaminant source or any treatment works.\u201d \u201cAir contaminant source\u201d means \u201ceach separate operation or activity that results or may result in the emission of any air contaminant.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(D). See, also, R.C. 3704.01(C). Particulate matter, such as dust, is within the definition of \u201cair contaminant.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(C). See, also, R.C. 3704.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(K) defines \u201cnew source\u201d as \u201cany air contaminant source * * * for which an owner or operator undertakes a continuing program of <em>installation </em>or <em>modification </em>or enters into a binding contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuing program of installation or modification, <em>after January 1, 197k </em>* * *\u2022\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 3745-31 sets forth PTI regulations which govern \u201cnew sources\u201d of air pollution. In brief, the rules require that a PTI be obtained for any new source of air contaminants. Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-02(A). The applicant must submit information about the new source to the OEPA, Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-04, and, based on this information, the OEPA has discretion whether to grant or deny the permit, Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-05. The process of conducting a new source review by the OEPA involves a potentially complicated, costly, and time-consuming procedure. As part of the review, the OEPA determines whether the proposed new source conforms to applicable state and federal air pollution laws, and whether the new source is the best available technology. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Essentially, the requirement of a PTI, with respect to a new source review, can be triggered by the \u201cinstallation\u201d or \u201cmodification\u201d of an air contaminant source that was installed or modified after January 1, 1974. For the most part, a \u201cmodification\u201d does not occur unless there is a physical change or deviation in the method of operation of an air contaminant which increases emissions allowable under applicable law, or results in the release of a contaminant into the air that was not previously emitted. Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-OKJ). The precise focus in this case is not whether a \u201cmodification\u201d has in fact occurred but, rather, whether the replacement of the Raymond mill in 1987 with a virtually identical mill constituted the \u201cinstallation\u201d of an air contaminant source, as that term is defined and set forth in relevant administrative rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Appellee asserts, and the court of appeals concluded, that the replacement Raymond mill was \u201cinstalled,\u201d as defined in Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(1), and, therefore, the mill constituted a \u201cnew source of air pollutants\u201d within the meaning of Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-02(A). National and <em>amici curiae </em>extensively challenge the appellee\u2019s and the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-02(A) and they especially take issue with the contention that the replacement of the like-kind Raymond mill amounted to the \u201cinstallation\u201d of a \u201cnew source\u201d of air contaminants. National asserts that \u201cinstallation,\u201d as defined and used in the rules, does not include like-kind replacement of a piece of equipment which is a component of a complex manufacturing operation. National suggests that the OEPA should have focused on whether the replacement of the mill resulted in a \u201cmodification\u201d of an air contaminant source as opposed to whether the replacement amounted to the \u201cinstallation\u201d of a new source of air contaminants.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">In considering the parties\u2019 contentions, the trial court determined that Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-02(A) does not govern the <em>replacement </em>of any air contaminant source but, rather, requires a PTI only for the <em>installation </em>of a new source of air contaminants or the <em>modification </em>of an air contaminant source. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>further concluded that the term \u201creplacement\u201d could easily have been included in the rules but, since it was not, the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>applies. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">As set forth above, \u201cinstall,\u201d as defined in the administrative rules, means to construct, erect, locate, or affix any air contaminant source. Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01 does not, however, provide a definition of the terms \u201cconstruct,\u201d \u201cerect,\u201d \u201clocate\u201d or \u201caffix.\u201d According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 542, \u201cerect\u201d and \u201cconstruct\u201d are synonymous terms. \u201cConstruct\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]o build; put together; make ready for use * * * [and] is distinguishable from \u2018maintain,\u2019 which means to keep up, to keep from change, to preserve.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Black\u2019s at 312. Further, \u201cconstruction\u201d is defined as \u201c * * * [t]he <em>creation of something new, </em>as distinguished from the repair or improvement of something already existing. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>United, States v. Narragansett Improvement Co. </em>(D.R.I.1983), 571 F.Supp. 688, 693 (\u201cThe uniform conclusion is that \u2018construction\u2019 imports the creation of something new and original that did not exist before.\u201d). In addition, the word \u201clocate\u201d means \u201c * * * [t]o decide upon the place or direction to be occupied <em>by something not yet in being </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Literally construed, the word \u201cinstallation,\u201d as defined in Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(1) and used in Ohio Adm.Code 3745-3l-02(A), connotes the establishment or formation of something <em>that has yet to be </em>in existence. The term, however, does not explicitly or implicitly refer to the <em>replacement </em>of a virtually identical (like-kind) component of a complicated manufacturing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">In reaching our conclusion, we are conscious of the long-accepted principle that considerable deference should be accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of rules the agency is required to administer. See <em>State ex rel. Brown v. Dayton Malleable, Inc. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 151, 155, 1 OBR 185, 189, 438 N.E.2d 120, 123. See, also, <em>Jones Metal Products Co. v. Walker </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 173, 181, 58 C.C.2d 393, 398, 281 N.E.2d 1, 8. Further, this court has stated on previous occasions that an administrative rule that is issued pursuant to statutory authority has the force of law unless it is unreasonable or conflicts with a statute covering the same subject matter. <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Bindley </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 232, 234, 527 N.E.2d 828, 830. Here, appellee interprets the word \u201cinstallation\u201d to embrace the replacement of a like-kind part of a rather complex manufacturing process, thereby requiring National to undergo the rigors of a new-source review. The interpretation of \u201cinstallation\u201d proposed by appellee is, in our opinion, unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">It is interesting to note that following the trial court\u2019s ruling the OEPA proposed that Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(D) be amended to negate the interpretation reached by the trial court. Included in the appendix of National\u2019s brief is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>letter from Donald E. Waltermeyer to Mary Cavin, hearing clerk for OEPA. In that letter, Waltermeyer submitted that the OEPA should, along with the proposed revision to Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(D) incorporating the phrase \u201cpiece of equipment\u201d within that rule, consider adding the words \u201c\u2018new or replacement\u2019 prior to \u2018air contaminant source\u2019 in the definition for \u2018Install.\u2019 \u201d Waltermeyer noted that the language \u201cnew or replacement\u201d would \u201celiminate any confusion that might exist,\u201d and that its inclusion would <em>\u201cclarify </em>and <em>solidify </em>Ohio EPA\u2019s longstanding position in these situations.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Appellee\u2019s interpretation of \u201cinstallation\u201d here is interesting in light of the requested revisions by the OEPA and Waltermeyer. If the definition of \u201cinstallation\u201d is as clear as appellee presently urges there would be no need for a clarification to \u201csolidify\u201d the OEPA\u2019s position. Further, to allow appellee to broadly interpret a rule that the OEPA has tacitly admitted is less than all-inclusive would be tantamount to unannounced rulemaking in violation of R.C. Chapter 119. See, generally, <em>Brost v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 218, 581 N.E.2d 515. See, also, R.C. 3704.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Appellee further implies that a decision that National was not required to obtain a PTI as a condition to replacing the Raymond mill diminishes the OEPA\u2019s authority to further the purposes of R.C. Chapter 3704. However, this implication lacks merit when one considers the broad discretionary powers conferred upon the OEPA by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The broad range of powers given to the Director of OEPA by the General Assembly are delineated in R.C. 3704.03. In essence, the OEPA has been given authority to develop programs and implement standards for the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution consistent with the federal Clean Air Act, Section 7401 <em>et seq., </em>Title 42, U.S.Code. R.C. 3704.03(E); see, also, R.C. 3704.02(A)(2). In carrying out its responsibilities, the OEPA acts as a guardian of the law. More specifically, the OEPA can exercise its authority and designate a representative to inspect any facility (public or private), at any reasonable time, to ensure that the facility is in full compliance with applicable law. R.C. 3704.03(L). Along with the discretion to inspect, the authorized representative can take samples, conduct tests and examine records or reports with respect to any emission of air contaminants. <em>Id. </em>Also, prior to the issuance of a PTI or renewal of a PTO, the OEPA can require the applicant \u201cto install such equipment and conduct such tests and analyses as the director finds reasonable and necessary to determine adequately the amount and content of any emissions from such sources, the ambient air quality at the proposed site and in areas that may be affected by emissions from such sources, and any violation or potential violation of Chapter 3704. of the Revised Code or the regulations or orders promulgated thereunder.\u201d R.C. 3704.031. A person who violates any rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>adopted by the OEPA is subject to prosecution. R.C. 3704.06(A). At the request of the OEPA, the Attorney General is required to file suit for injunctive relief, civil penalties or \u201cany other appropriate proceeding\u201d in a court of competent jurisdiction against any person violating or threatening to violate R.C. 3704.05. R.C. 3704.06(B). As a result, a court with jurisdiction can grant prohibitory or mandatory injunctive relief, and require the payment of a civil penalty up to <em>$25,000 for each day of each violation. </em>R.C. 3704.06(B) and (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">There is no question that Ohio\u2019s Air Pollution Control Law has some sharp teeth. The OEPA has been provided with the authority and the means to effectuate the goals of Ohio\u2019s Air Pollution Control Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We are aware of and in complete agreement with the purposes of R.C. Chapter 3704, and commend the Director of OEPA for his efforts in promulgating rules to further protect and enhance the quality of air in this state. Ohio\u2019s Air Pollution Control Law was enacted to allow the Director of OEPA to adopt rules and maintain standards for the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution consistent with the federal Act. R.C. 3704.02(A)(2). Of equal importance, R.C. Chapter 3704 was also established for the purpose of protecting and enhancing Ohio\u2019s air resources \u201cso as to promote the public health, welfare, and <em>economic vitality </em>of the people of the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Former R.C. 3704.-02(A)(1). Am.Sub.S.B. No. 258, 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 847, 849. (The current version adds \u201cproductive capacity\u201d to this list of things to be protected.) To reflect this purpose, the General Assembly has repeatedly stated that actions required by the OEPA must not only be technically feasible but <em>economically reasonable. </em>See, <em>e.g., </em>R.C. 3704.03(1) and (R).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">As is evident, the General Assembly intended to strike a balance between the prevention, control and abatement of air pollution and excessive regulation or unwarranted interruption of a business to the point where it can no longer function competitively at a local, national or even worldwide level. Obviously, the balance sought by the General Assembly can be lost if the quest for clean air is accompanied by excessive regulation. Excessive regulation can disrupt vital functions of a business, threatening the company\u2019s very existence. Similarly, exposing a business to regulations not explicitly covered by statute or rule could have an equally detrimental impact. R.C. Chapter 3704 sets forth the role a business, as an employer, plays in society. Indeed, the goal for clean air should not, unless there is <em>no </em>other solution, lead to possible lost jobs or irrecoverable employment opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">We also note that appellee, in concluding that the court of appeals\u2019 decision would not have a detrimental impact on businesses in this state, states that \u201c[b]usinesses are not going to have to cease operations simply because they choose to repair or replace a piece of equipment. Yet, they will have to <em>plan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>ahead </em>and submit an application for a PTI before they decide to replace an air contaminant source.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellee\u2019s comment ignores the realities in which some businesses must operate. Granted, it would inure to a company\u2019s benefit if it could plan for all interruptions in the workplace. Realistically, however, such a situation cannot exist under all circumstances. Therefore, a balance between needed business regulation and needed business preservation must be struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We believe that absent a precise and reasonable directive from the General Assembly or a reasonable rule properly promulgated by the Director of OEPA on the subject, a business entity should not be forced to encounter the potential costs and delays associated with a PTI.if a component of a manufacturing process becomes inoperable and the component is replaced with a like-kind piece of equipment. Thus, we hold that a like-kind replacement of a piece of equipment that is a component of a complex manufacturing operation involving the emission of an air contaminant does not constitute \u201cthe installation of a new source of air pollutants\u201d within the meaning of Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Keeping in mind the purposes of R.C. Chapter 3704, we must strive to reach a balance between promoting and enhancing clean air and protecting and encouraging economic growth and opportunities for the people of this state. This requires that business entities not be subjected to an interminable task of dealing with excessive regulation or requirements not explicitly covered by statute or rule. Therefore, any uncertainty with regard to the interpretation of R.C. Chapter 3704 and rules promulgated thereunder should be construed in favor of the person or entity (manufacturer or otherwise) affected by the law. Here, the mere replacement of the Raymond mill with a like-kind Raymond mill did not constitute the \u201cinstallation\u201d of a new source of air pollutants as that term is used in Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-02(A). If the General Assembly or the Director of OEPA wishes to bring \u201creplacement\u201d within the ambit of \u201cinstallation,\u201d they must use the proper channels.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed. The judgment of the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b601-9\">Moyer, C.J., Wright and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b601-10\">A.W.

While I agree with the majority\u2019s assessment that the agency\u2019s interpretation would produce some harsh results in this case, I do not believe that it is the function of this court .to assay the wisdom of a policy choice made by the agency entrusted to make such a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 3745-31 governs review of \u201cnew sources\u201d of air pollution. Essentially, the regulations require a PTI, the issuance of which is preceded by a new source review, to be obtained for any \u201cnew source\u201d of air pollutants. Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-02(A), 3745-31-04 and 3745-31-05. As relevant here, the regulations define \u201cnew source\u201d to include \u201cany <em>air contaminant source </em>* * * for which an owner or operator undertakes a continuing program of <em>installation </em>* * * after January 1, 1974 * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(K). \u201cInstall\u201d and \u201cinstallation\u201d are defined as \u201cto construct, erect, locate, or affix any air contaminant source.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(1). \u201cAir contaminant source\u201d means \u201ceach separate operation or activity that results or may result in the emission of any air contaminant.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(D). See, also, R.C. 3704.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">This case presents two questions: (1) whether the Raymond mill at National\u2019s limestone plant may be ranked as an \u201cair contaminant source\u201d; and, if so, (2) whether the term \u201cinstallation\u201d can be construed to encompass like-kind replacement. Although the majority\u2019s analysis is focused entirely on the issue of whether like-kind replacement constitutes an \u201cinstallation,\u201d its ultimate holding inexplicably includes a factual determination that the Raymond mill at National\u2019s limestone plant is \u201ca piece of equipment that is a <em>component </em>of a complex manufacturing <em>operation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The majority, therefore, makes a <em>sub silentio </em>finding that the Raymond mill does not rank as an \u201cair contaminant source.\u201d It is necessary, therefore, to consider both prongs of the definition of \u201cnew source,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201cair contaminant source\u201d and \u201cinstallation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Although the majority gives lip service to \u201cthe long-accepted principle that considerable deference should be accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of rules the agency is required to administer,\u201d it does not pay homage to that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The General Assembly has enacted in R.C. Chapter 3704 a technical and complex regulatory scheme to comply with the federal Clean Air Act, Section 7401 <em>et seq., </em>Title 42, U.S.Code, and to deal with the problems of air pollution that confront Ohio. It has entrusted the OEPA with the responsibility of administering the statute, and has delegated to it certain policy-making authority. In contrast, \u201c[j]udges are not experts in the field, and are not part of either political branch of the Government.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 837, 865, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2793, 81 L.Ed.2d 694, 717. Thus, where the legislature \u201chas not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation. Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>tion of the statute.\u201d (Footnotes omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d at 703. This principle of deference has particular force where the agency interprets its own regulations. <em>Wisconsin Elec, Power Co. v. Reilly </em>(C.A.7, 1990), 893 F.2d 901, 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">In determining whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is permissible under the statute, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Chevron, supra, </em>explained that:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">\u201cWhen a challenge to an agency construction of a statutory provision, fairly conceptualized, really centers on the wisdom of the agency\u2019s policy, rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left open by Congress, the challenge must fail. In such a case, federal judges \u2014 who have no constituency\u2014 have a duty to respect legitimate policy choices made by those who do. The responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones: \u2018Our Constitution vests such responsibilities in the political branches.\u2019 <em>TVA v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 195 [98 S.Ct. 2279, 2302, 57 L.Ed.2d 117, 147] (1978).\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 866, 104 S.Ct. at 2793, 81 L.Ed.2d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Instead of respecting these principles, the majority steadfastly violates them. Concerned with the \u201csharp teeth\u201d of Ohio\u2019s Air Pollution Control Act, the majority takes it upon itself \u201cto reach a balance between promoting and enhancing clean air and protecting and encouraging economic growth.\u201d In so doing, the majority, in direct contrast to every tenet of agency deference, actually proposes that \u201cany uncertainty with regard to the interpretation of R.C. Chapter 3704 and rules promulgated thereunder should be construed in favor of the person or entity (manufacturer or otherwise) affected by the law,\u201d and that the balance should tip in favor of the business entity \u201cabsent a precise and reasonable directive from the General Assembly or a reasonable rule properly promulgated by the Director of OEPA on the subject.\u201d As a result, the majority has turned the principle of agency deference on its head in order to substitute its policy choices for the policy choices made by the agency entrusted to make such choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">II. Air Contaminant Source</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Since the majority has failed to explain the basis of its finding that National\u2019s Raymond mill is \u201ca piece of equipment that is a component of a complex manufacturing operation,\u201d it has left its reasoning to speculation. The majority tells us neither why the Raymond mill itself falls short of being a \u201cseparate operation or activity,\u201d nor what the \u201ccomplex manufacturing operation,\u201d of which the Raymond mill is a \u201ccomponent,\u201d consists of. In any event, it is clear that it is permissible, both legally and factually, for the OEPA to rank the Raymond mill as an air contaminant source.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Prior to 1975, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) ranked individual pieces of equipment, including mills, as a \u201cstationary source\u201d under the federal Clean Air Act. See <em>ASARCO, Inc. v. Environmental Protection Agency </em>(C.A.D.C.1978), 578 F.2d 319, 322-323. See, also, Butler, New Source Netting in Nonattainment Areas Under the Clean Air Act (1984), 11 Ecology L.Q. 343, at 349, 353. Between 1975 and 1981, the EPA introduced successive plantwide definitions of \u201cstationary source\u201d into its various regulations governing the programs set forth in Parts A, C and D of the federal Clean Air Act. <em>Id. </em>at 350, fn. 67; <em>Chevron, supra, </em>467 U.S. at 853-857, 104 S.Ct. at 2787-2789, 81 L.Ed.2d at 709-712.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The EPA now gives the states the option of adopting the following plantwide definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d in their state implementation plans:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\"><em>\u201cStationary source </em>means any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant subject to regulation under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\"><em>\u201cBuilding, structure, facility, or installation </em>means all of the pollutant-emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) * * *.\u201d Sections 51.165(a)(1)\u00ae and (ii) (Part D permit requirements for state implementation plans), and 51.166(b)(5) and (6), Title 40, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The EPA, however, continues to approve state implementation plans that deviate from the plantwide definition if the state \u201cspecifically demonstrates that the submitted definition is more stringent, or at least as stringent, in all respects.\u201d Sections 51.165(a)(1) and 51.166(b), Title 40, C.F.R. See, also, Section 7416, Title 42, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">In clear contrast to the EPA-authorized plantwide definition of \u201cstationary source\u201d as a combination of <em>\u201call </em>of the pollutant-emitting <em>activities </em>which belong to the same industrial grouping,\u201d the General Assembly and the OEPA have chosen to define an \u201cair contaminant source\u201d as <em>\u201ceach separate </em>operation or activity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 3704.01(C); Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(D). In turn, the OEPA has consistently interpreted R.C. 3704.01(C) and Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(D) to allow for the ranking of individual pieces of equipment as sources of air pollution subject to PTI review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Rather than precluding regulation at the level of equipment, the definition of \u201cair contaminant source\u201d set forth in R.C. 3704.01(C) and Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(D) gives flexibility to the OEPA to regulate at different levels. Nothing in these definitions prevents a factual determination that the smaller process of grinding, rather than the larger process of hydrate production, constitutes a \u201cseparate operation or activity,\u201d or that the operation or activity of grinding could factually consist entirely of a single piece of equipment such as the Raymond mill.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In fact, the PTI regulations compel the conclusion that there are times when an operation or activity will consist entirely of a single piece of equipment. Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-03(A)(l) contains a laundry list of new air contaminant sources that are exempted from a PTI review. Many of the sources in this list are specifically identified as equipment. By negative implication, this listing evinces an intent to allow individual pieces of equipment to be ranked as air contaminant sources if not excepted. If the definition of \u201cair contaminant source\u201d precluded the ranking of equipment as a source, there would be no need to exempt certain specific types of equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Clearly, it is improper for this court to find as a matter of law that the only operation or activity taking place at National\u2019s limestone plant is the entire \u201ccomplex manufacturing operation.\u201d To do so is to incorporate into the statute and regulation the very plantwide definition of \u201cair contaminant source\u201d that the General Assembly and the OEPA chose not to adopt. Further, the record in this case clearly reveals sufficient facts to support the finding made by the OEPA that the operation or activity of grinding at National\u2019s plant is a separate operation or activity consisting entirely of the Raymond mill. The production of hydrate begins with the extraction of dolomitie limestone from the earth through the use of explosives. The extracted limestone is crushed and screened, then burned in kilns at approximately 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit. The result is dolomitie quicklime. When the quicklime cools, it is screened and fed into a hydrator, where it is mixed with water to form hydrate. The .hydrate is then fed into the Raymond mill, where it is ground into finer material in accordance with customer specifications. <em>It is at this point in production that the air-polluting particles at issue in this case are generated. </em>The only reason that these particles are not released at the site of the mill is that they are trapped, along with the rest of the hydrate, in an air stream that circulates through an essentially closed-air system, and are routed to a baghouse where they are filtered out before the air is emitted into the atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Certainly, under these facts the OEPA can determine that the Raymond mill is an air contaminant source. It is the Raymond mill by itself that generates the particulate matter that is sought to be regulated. The routing of the particulate matter that the mill generates does not vitiate the status of the mill as a source of air pollutants any more than the rerouting of exhausts from an automobile would change its status as a source of air pollutants.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">III. Like-Kind Replacement Versus Installation</p>\n<p id=\"Aau\">The majority concludes that \u201c[t]he interpretation of \u2018installation\u2019 [as including \u2018replacement\u2019] proposed by appellee is, in our opinion, unreasonable.\u201d In reaching its conclusion, the majority selectively extrapolates dictionary definitions of the terms \u201cconstruct,\u201d \u201cconstruction\u201d and \u201clocate\u201d to illustrate that \u201c[l]iterally construed, the word \u2018installation,\u2019 as defined in Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(1) and used in Ohio Adm.Code 3745-341-02(A), connotes the establishment or formation of something <em>that has yet to be </em>in existence.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">As the majority points out, the terms \u201cconstruct\u201d and \u201cconstruction\u201d mean the creation of something new, as distinguished from the repair or improvement of something already existing. See Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1983) 281; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 312. This, however, does not disclose whether the replacement of an entire air contaminant source is to be considered a mere repair or improvement, or whether it is to be considered as the creation of something new. Depending upon the statutory or contractual context of their use, the terms \u201cconstruct\u201d and \u201cconstruction\u201d can mean \u201creplacement\u201d as opposed to repair or improvement; and the terms \u201creplace\u201d and \u201creplacement\u201d can mean the comparable exchange of something new for something old or worn out, as opposed to the maintenance or repair of something existing. See 8A Words and Phrases (1951) 470; 37 Words and Phrases (1950) 11; Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">It would indeed be an interesting display of linguistic gymnastics were a member of the majority to attempt to convince the carpet salesperson, who replaced his worn-out carpet with like-kind carpet, that installation charges are unwarranted because the word \u201c \u2018installation\u2019 connotes the establishment or formation of something that has yet to be in existence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Clearly, the use of such common, ordinary meanings is woefully inadequate to decisively classify replacement sources of air pollution as falling outside the definition of \u201cinstallation.\u201d The majority\u2019s conclusion, resting as it does on such a precarious foundation, is unstable at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">One of the stated purposes of Ohio\u2019s Air Pollution Control Act is to enable the state, through the Director of Environmental Protection, to develop a program that is consistent with the federal Clean Air Act. R.C. 3704.02(A)(2) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>3704.01(K) (formerly [H]). In addition, former R.C. 3704.02(B) provided, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">\u201cThe provisions of Chapter 3704. of the Revised Code, all regulations adopted pursuant to Chapter 3704. of the Revised Code, and all permits * * * shall, to the extent reasonably possible, be construed to be consistent with the federal Clean Air Act * * *.\u201d Am.Sub.S.B. No. 258, 138 Ohio Laws, Part I, 847, 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The federal Clean Air Act embodies a construction/modification dichotomy similar to the OEPA\u2019s installation/modifieation dichotomy set forth at Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 3745-31. As relevant here, the Clean Air Act provides for various sets of requirements applicable to newly constructed or modified stationary sources of air pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Like Ohio\u2019s regulations, the federal Act makes its permitting provisions applicable to new sources of air pollution. Sections 7410(A)(2)(D), (2)(I) and (4), Title 42, U.S.Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similar to Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 3745-31, the federal Act defines the term \u201cnew source\u201d as including \u201cconstruction or modification,\u201d and defines \u201cmodification\u201d as any change \u201cwhich increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted.\u201d Section 7411(a)(2) and (4), Title 42, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">In enacting the Clean Air Act, particularly the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub.L. 95-95, 91 Stat. 685, Congress had fully considered the proper political \u201cbalance between promoting and enhancing clean air and protecting and encouraging economic growth\u201d which the majority of this court has taken upon itself to reconsider. The House Committee Report succinctly specifies that the section of the Act governing nonattainment areas seeks \u201cthe dual goals of attaining air quality standards and providing for new economic growth.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 95-294, 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; AdmimNews (1977) 1077, 1091. The report goes on to explain that:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">\u201cIn revising its plan to permit new growth, the * * * State plan * * * must require permits for the construction and operation of new or modified major sources. Additionally, the owner or operator of a prospective new source (or modification) must demonstrate that all sources owned by him * * * are in compliance or on a schedule for compliance. The source must also demonstrate that the issuance of a permit will not cause or contribute to concentrations of any air pollutant, for which national ambient air quality standards have not been promulgated, which would pose a significant risk to health.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The portion of the Senate Committee Report dealing with nonattainment areas explains further that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cA major weakness in implementation of the 1970 Act [Clean Air Amendments of 1970, Pub.L. 91-604, 84 Stat. 1676] has been the failure to assess the impact of emissions from new sources of pollution on State plans to attain air quality standards by statutory deadlines. States have permitted growth on the assumption that a deadline was sufficiently distant so that future emissions reductions could be made to compensate for the initial increase. It can now be seen that these assumptions were wrong. Some mechanism is needed to assure that before new or expanded facilities are permitted, a State demonstrate that these facilities can be accommodated within its overall plan to provide for attainment of air quality standards.\u201d S.Rep. No. 95-127 (1977) 55.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">With these considerations in mind, Senator Muskie made the following poignant remarks in submitting the Conference Committee Report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201cI should note that the test for determining whether a new or modified source is subject to the EPA interpretative <em>regulation </em>\u2014 and <em>to the permit requirements of the revised, implementation plans </em>under the conference bill \u2014 is whether the source will emit a pollutant into an area which is exceeding a national ambient air quality standard for the pollutant \u2014 or precursor. <em>Thus, a new source is still subject to such requirements as \u2018lowest achievable emission rate\u2019 even if it is constructed as a replacement for an older facility resulting in a net reduction from previous emission levels.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>source \u2014 including an existing facility ordered to convert to coal \u2014 is subject to all the nonattainment requirements as a modified source if it makes any physical change which increases the amount of any air pollutant for which the standards in the area are exceeded.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 123 Cong.Rec. (1977) 26847.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">In light of the foregoing legislative history of the Clean Air Act, it is obvious that, after giving thoughtful consideration to the competing interests of clean air and economic growth, Congress intended for replacement sources to be governed by the regulations applicable to newly constructed sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The majority, in an effort to bolster its position, states that \u201c[i]t is interesting to note that following the trial court\u2019s ruling the OEPA proposed that Ohio Adm.Code 3745-31-01(D) be amended to negate the interpretation reached by the trial court\u201d and that a letter by Donald E. Waltermeyer, an OEPA employee, proposed a further change of \u201cadding the words \u2018 \u201cnew or replacement\u201d prior to \u201cair contaminant source\u201d in the definition for \u201cInstall.\u201d \u2019 \u201d The majority deduces therefrom that \u201c[i]f the definition of \u2018installation\u2019 is as clear as appellee presently urges, there would be no need for a clarification to \u2018solidify\u2019 the OEPA\u2019s position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>I cannot accept the majority\u2019s view of the reasons behind the proposed amendment. The agency\u2019s amendment \u201cto negate the interpretation reached by the trial court\u201d is just that. The need for \u201cclarification to \u2018solidify\u2019 the OEPA\u2019s position\u201d was not the result of anything the <em>agency </em>had done, but a result of what the <em>trial court </em>had done. The majority\u2019s treatment of the proposed amendment as tantamount to a judicial admission ignores the very letter by Waltermeyer proposing the amendment. That letter specifically explains that:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">\u201cThe Ohio EPA Division of Air Pollution Control, has always considered the act of replacing an existing air contaminant source as being one that requires a Permit to Install. This has always been Ohio EPA\u2019s interpretation of the rules, even when the new equipment is identical to the equipment being replaced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Based on the foregoing, I would find the OEPA\u2019s interpretation to be a permissible one and affirm the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b609-6\">AW. Sweeney and F.E. Sweeney, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">. In his uncontroverted affidavit, Robert F. Hodanbosi, Manager of the Air Quality Modeling and Planning Section of the Division of Air Pollution Control in the OEPA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">\u201cI have consistently determined, since I began my current duties as Manager in the Division of Air Pollution Control in 1978, that sources like the \u2018nev/ Raymond Mill * * * are new sources * * * which must obtain permits to install, as required by O.A.C. Rule 3745-31-02.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>In addition, a review of the Ohio EPA Weekly Review from April 1973 to the present reveals that for the last twenty years, the OEPA has applied its various definitions broadly to include individual pieces of equipment as subject to the PTI requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b607-9\">.
