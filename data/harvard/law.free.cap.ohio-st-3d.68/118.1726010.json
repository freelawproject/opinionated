The commission\u2019s order is misleading because it states that claimant experienced no wage loss. The evidence, however, suggests otherwise. Appellants do not dispute claimant\u2019s assertion that she was unemployed from the date she was terminated through July 31, 1990. Appellants also have not challenged her claim that self-employment has been less lucrative than her position with Schottenstein.. Thus, there is no real disagreement that after she was terminated claimant made less than she would have at her old job.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Closer examination suggests that the commission instead based its decision on a perceived lack of causal relationship between claimant\u2019s injury and reduced wages. The commission essentially ruled that \u201cbut for\u201d her employment discharge, claimant would still be at Schottenstein with no diminution of earnings. This finding raises a question of first impression for our consideration: Does a claimant\u2019s discharge from his or her position of employment automatically preclude R.C. 4123.56(B) wage loss benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Arguing in the affirmative, appellants rely on the voluntary employment separation principles that govern temporary total disability. Temporary total disability compensation has traditionally been denied to those who have voluntarily abandoned their former position of employment. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 29 Ohio App.3d 145, 29 OBR 162, 504 N.E.2d 451; <em>State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 42, 517 N.E.2d 533; <em>State ex rel. Rockwell Internatl. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 44, 531 N.E.2d 678; <em>State ex rel. McGraw v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 137, 564 N.E.2d 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">We agree that firing can constitute a voluntary abandonment of the former position of employment. Although not generally consented to, discharge, like incarceration, is often a consequence of behavior that the claimant willingly undertook, and may thus take on a voluntary character. See <em>Ashcraft. </em>We decline, however, to extend these voluntary abandonment principles to R.C. 4123.56(B) wage loss because wage loss is broader in scope than temporary total disability. As explained by a Georgia court in <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Ins. Co. v. Giles </em>(1986), 177 Ga.App. 684, 685, 340 S.E.2d 284, 285:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">\u201cIt is not the ability to perform the particular job in which one was engaged at the time of injury which is the determining factor in a case such as this, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>rather whether the claimant\u2019s inability to find <em>any </em>work for which he is suited by training and experience is a result of the injury suffered.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In <em>Giles, </em>the claimant, an insurance claims adjuster, resumed his duties after injury, only to quit in favor of better work. He was later laid off and was unable to find another job, prompting his claim for wage loss compensation. His former employer challenged claimant\u2019s compensation eligibility, arguing that his inability to secure other claims adjuster work was due, not to the injury, but to economic conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The Georgia Court of Appeals upheld the claimant\u2019s right to benefits. The court stressed claimant\u2019s construction experience, teaching degree and extensive coaching background, and held that \u201cwhile [claimant\u2019s] inability to find work as a claims adjuster may not be related to his injury,- his inability to find <em>other </em>work for which he is suited <em>is </em>related to his injury.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id., I77 </em>Ga.App. at 685, 340 S.E.2d at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">We find particularly persuasive the reasoning advanced by the Minnesota Supreme Court in <em>Marsolek v. George A. Hormel Co. </em>(1989), 438 N.W.2d 922. There, after his industrial injuries, the claimant returned to work and was assigned to light duty. Claimant\u2019s activities during a later strike, however, prompted his dismissal. Unable to find other employment, claimant sought compensation for lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The high court found that claimant\u2019s firing did not automatically foreclose wage loss compensation, starting its analysis \u201cwith the basic tenet that an employer is liable for the payment of compensation benefits * * * when an employee suffers a wage loss that is attributable to a work injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">\u201c[B]y focusing so much effort on the * * * effect of the misconduct, the parties\u2019 attention has been diverted from the essential purpose of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act, * * * which is to compensate injured workers for a wage loss that is attributable to a work injury. Accordingly, for purposes of clarification, we now hold that a justifiable discharge for misconduct suspends an injured employee\u2019s right to wage loss benefits; but the suspension of entitlement to wage loss benefits will be lifted once it has become demonstrable that the employee\u2019s work-related disability is the cause of the employee\u2019s inability to find or hold new employment. Such a determination should be made upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 924.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system was created \u201c[f]or the purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s employment * * Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution. Like the court in <em>Marsolek, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>supra, </em>we find that those purposes are not furthered by denying a claimant even the opportunity to show the potential impact on the claimant\u2019s ability to do other work. Accordingly, we hold that firing may, but does not automatically, bar wage loss compensation under R.C. 4123.56(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In this case, the commission did not evaluate the effect that claimant\u2019s injury may have had on her ability to get or keep other employment. For this reason, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and return the cause to the commission for further consideration and amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
