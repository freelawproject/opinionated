I have always believed that legal scholars and most judges consider freedom of speech provisions a bulwark to be defended. Today, sad to say, we have beaten a hasty retreat from our previous pronouncement in this very case, and Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution is being treated more as an obstacle to be avoided than as an affirmative statement of a fundamental right and a ringing statement of truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">I recognize the tension between the search for social justice and the long and honorable tradition of defending speech from government intrusion. I also appreciate the political benefits of punishing the distasteful \u201chate speech\u201d found here. However, I cannot compromise the principles noted above and must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">I am extremely disappointed that a majority of this court are willing to dispose of a case of significant constitutional import through a brief entry devoid of analysis. I feel certain that the United States Supreme Court, in remanding this case, expected this court to engage in a.thorough analysis not only of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>application of <em>Wisconsin v. Mitchell </em>(1993), 508 U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 2194, 124 L.Ed.2d 436, but also of Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. Certainly, the citizens of Ohio deserve no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">If the Ohio statute were identical or nearly identical to the Wisconsin statute, a rubber-stamp entry would be understandable. However, the two statutes are completely different in both wording and scope of application, as are the free speech provisions of the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">Under the Wisconsin statute, the maximum sentence a judge may impose is increased when the defendant intentionally selects the victim because of his or her protected status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, the Wisconsin statute applies across the board to all criminal offenses (except those where proof of race, ancestry, etc. is already an element of the crime itself). Former Wis.Stat. Section 939.645(4). In contrast, the Ohio statute creates a new offense, ethnic intimidation (R.C. 2927.12), one element of which is the commission of any of five offenses: aggravated menacing (R.C. 2903.21); menacing (R.C. 2903.22); criminal damaging or endangering (R.C. 2909.06); criminal mischief (R.C. 2909.07); and certain types of telephone harassment (R.C. 2917.21[A][3], [4], or [5]). A defendant can be found guilty under R.C. 2927.12(A) if he or she violates one of the predicate offenses \u201cby reason of the race, color, religion, or national origin of another person or group of persons.\u201d Conviction under R.C. 2927.12 is an offense one degree higher than the predicate offense. R.C. 2927.12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Because of these differences between the Wisconsin statute and the Ohio statute, it is not at all apparent that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Wisconsin v. Mitchell </em>mandates holding that the Ohio statute is constitutional. In fact, I am persuaded that these critical differences support an opposite conclusion. I find the Wisconsin statute distinguishable from the Ohio statute in ways which render the Ohio statute unconstitutional under both the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Of particular concern is the difference in the scope of application of the statutes. Under the Wisconsin statute, the penalty enhancement for intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>selection of the victim applies to almost all offenses. On the other hand, the predicate offenses upon which the Ohio statute is based are limited to those criminal offenses most closely associated with expressive conduct or unprotected speech. I recognize and agree that the state may punish some speech, such as fighting words. However, the government may not make distinctions based on the viewpoint or content of the speech. This focus on expressive conduct makes the Ohio statute analogous to the statute held unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in <em>R.A.V. v. St. Paul </em>(1992), 505 U.S.-, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305. As the court in <em>Mitchell </em>characterized it, <em>R.A.V. </em>involved a challenge to a municipal ordinance which prohibited the use of \u201cfighting words\u201d that insult or provoke violence \u201con the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender * * *.\u201d In <em>Mitchell </em>the United States Supreme Court distinguished the Wisconsin statute from the ordinance in <em>R.A.V. </em>\u201cBecause the ordinance only proscribed a class of \u2018fighting words\u2019 deemed particularly offensive by the city\u2014 <em>ie., </em>those that \u2018contain * * * messages of \u201cbiased-motivated\u201d hatred,\u2019 505 U.S. at ---, 112 S.Ct. [at 2547-2548], 120 L.Ed.2d [at 323] \u2014 we held that it violated the rule against content-based discrimination. See, <em>id., </em>at---, 112 S.Ct. [at 2547-2548], 120 L.Ed.2d [at 323-324]. But whereas the ordinance struck down in <em>R.A.V. </em>was explicitly directed at expression <em>(ie., </em>\u2018speech\u2019 or \u2018messages\u2019) <em>id. </em>at-, 112 S.Ct. [at 2547], 120 L.Ed.2d [at 322], the statute in this case is aimed' at conduct unprotected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>508 U.S. at---, 113 S.Ct. at 2200-2201, 124 L.Ed.2d at 446-447.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">In the present case, the conduct of the defendants which is unprotected by the First. Amendment, <em>ie., </em>the making of menacing threats, is <em>already </em>prosecutable under R.C. 2903.21 and 2903.22. A prosecution under R.C. 2927.12 is aimed at punishing the <em>content </em>of the \u201cfighting words\u201d used. Consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>R.A.V., </em>the state may not proscribe a class of \u201cfighting words\u201d which it deems to be particularly offensive. Thus, there is nothing in the <em>Mitchell </em>decision to change our previous conclusion that R.C. 2927.12 \u201cconstitutes a greater infringement on speech and thought\u201d than the Wisconsin statute because the Ohio statute \u201csingles out racial and religious hatred as a viewpoint to be punished.\u201d <em>State v. Wyant </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 566, 579, 597 N.E.2d 450, 459 <em>(\u201cWyant </em>I\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">A clear example of the difference between the Wisconsin and Ohio statutes can be seen by applying the statutes to Wyant\u2019s conduct. Wyant\u2019s conduct would not violate the Wisconsin standard. There is <em>no </em>evidence he <em>selected </em>his victims because they are black. Rather, there is evidence he selected his victims because they had a camp site Wyant wanted his relatives to have and because they had complained to a park official about Wyant\u2019s playing loud music. Certainly Wyant chose to use certain words because of the race of his victims. But this fact highlights the problem with the Ohio statute. Wyant was convicted of a felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>instead of a misdemeanor solely because he made racial references in his menacing threats. Wyant was more severely punished because of his purported racist feelings, <em>not </em>because of his conduct. In effect, Wyant received six months for aggravated menacing and an additional one year for his expressed racist thoughts. As deplorable as Wyant\u2019s beliefs may be, his expression of those beliefs is not separately punishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">This example reflects another difference between the two statutes. Under the Wisconsin statute the defendant\u2019s motive in selecting the victim is a factor the judge may consider during sentencing. In <em>Mitchell, </em>the United States Supreme Court emphasized that a defendant\u2019s motive has traditionally been a factor considered during the penalty phase of the prosecution. <em>Id., </em>508 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2199, 124 L.Ed.2d at 445. As discussed at length by Justice Herbert R. Brown in <em>Wyant I, </em>motive is <em>not </em>traditionally a factor in the guilt phase of a prosecution. <em>Id., </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 571-574, 597 N.E.2d at 453-456. Instead, it is the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the act which is traditionally an element of the offense. However, R.C. 2927.12 makes the defendant\u2019s motive \u2014 his or her thoughts and beliefs \u2014 an element of the offense. The Wisconsin statute, on the other hand, focuses on the defendant\u2019s intent and conduct. Since the Ohio statute directly penalizes biased motive, rather than the conduct of intentionally selecting a victim because of a biased belief, the Ohio statute violates both Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Whether or not the <em>Mitchell </em>decision dictates that R.C. 2927.12 be held constitutional under the First Amendment, I believe that it is unconstitutional under Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As we said in <em>Wyant I, </em>\u201cthe Constitution of Ohio is even more specific [than the First Amendment]; it guarantees to every citizen freedom to \u2018speak, write and publish his sentiments on <em>all </em>subjects.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 577, 597 N.E.2d at 457. Unlike the First Amendment, Section 11, Article I contains not only a negative clause (\u201cno law shall be passed\u201d) but also an <em>affirmative </em>clause guaran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>teeing freedom of speech to all Ohio citizens. It is a basic rule of constitutional construction that \u201cthe whole section should be construed together, and effect given to every part and sentence. * * * \u201d <em>Froelich v. Cleveland </em>(1919), 99 Ohio St. 376, 124 N.E. 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. Therefore, we must give effect to the affirmative language in Section 11, Article I which is not included in the First Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This language constitutes a \u201cpromise to affirmatively protect the right\u201d of free speech. <em>Ferner v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Convention &amp; Visitors Bur., Inc. </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 842, 848, 610 N.E.2d 1158, 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The historical context within which the Ohio Constitution was written also supports a reading which is more expansive than the First Amendment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Early state constitutions were often based on constitutions from other states, not on the federal Bill of Rights. For example, the free speech provision of the 1802 Ohio Constitution appears to have been based on the 1790 Pennsylvania Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Reliance on another state\u2019s constitutional language reflects the different purposes to be served by the federal Bill of Rights and the state constitutions. To obtain ratification of the United States Constitution, the federal Bill of Rights was added as a curb on the broad powers granted to the national government. The states were seen as protectors of their citizens\u2019 individual civil rights \u2014 rights contained in the state constitutions. The affirmative clause of Section 11, Article I reflects this role of the state in affirmatively protecting its citizens\u2019 right to free speech. Because the Ohio Constitution provides a more expansive protection for freedom of speech than does the United States Constitution, nothing in the <em>Mitchell </em>decision alters our conclusion in <em>Wyant I </em>that R.C. 2927.12 violates the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The majority\u2019s disposition of this appeal is also inadequate because reliance on <em>Mitchell </em>addresses only the free speech challenge to the statute. The defendants in this case also raised challenges on the grounds of vagueness, equal protection, due process and overbreadth. In our unanimous opinion in <em>Wyant I </em>we said that \u201c[t]hese arguments <em>may have merit, </em>especially in view of the concurring opinion by Justice White in <em>R.A.V. v. St. Paul, supra, </em>505 U.S. at-, 112 S.Ct. at 2550, 120 L.Ed.2d at 327.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Wyant I, </em>64 Ohio St.3d at 579-580, 597 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>N.E.2d at 459. We merely declined to resolve them because our holding in <em>Wyant I </em>made it unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">It can, perhaps, be argued that reliance on <em>Mitchell </em>disposes of the over-breadth challenge. In no way, however, can it be argued that <em>Mitchell </em>disposes of the vagueness and equal protection arguments, because the United States Supreme Court specifically declined to address those arguments. <em>Mitchell; supra, </em>508 U.S. at-, 113 S.Ct. at 2197, 124 L.Ed.2d at 443, at fn. 2. The majority\u2019s reversal of our holding in <em>Wyant I </em>concerning the free speech challenge to R.C. 2927.12 now makes it essential that we address these other constitutional challenges to the statute. This is especially true since the lower court opinions declaring R.C. 2927.12 unconstitutional relied primarily on the vagueness challenge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For example, Judge Kessler, the trial judge in the <em>May </em>case, found that the phrase \u201c \u2018by reason of as used in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2927.12 describes no statutorily cognizable mental state, as required by Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.21 for an element of the offense, and is, therefore, impermissibly constitutionally vague under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d He also found the statute vague \u201cbecause the language of the statute does not sufficiently specify the relationship of the race, et cetera of the other \u2018person or group of persons\u2019 to the actor or victim.\u201d <em>State v. May </em>(May 15, 1990), Montgomery C.P. No. 89-CR-4687/2, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">If the majority is construing the \u201cby reason of\u2019 language of R.C. 2927.12 to mean that the defendant intentionally selected his or her victim because of race, color, religion or national origin, it has an obligation to say so. The majority also has an obligation to inform trial judges that they should formulate jury instructions to explain this meaning to juries in R.C. 2927.12 prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">At the very least, Wyant is entitled to have his conviction vacated and remanded for a new trial, which would include such jury instructions. The jury received no instructions regarding the meaning of this language in R.C. 2927.12. Otherwise, there is no way to assure that he was convicted based on his conduct, not based on his beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">For the above reasons, I would reaffirm our decision in <em>Wyant I, </em>and hold that R.C. 2927.12 violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and also violates, independently, Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<judges id=\"b385-11\">Pfeifer, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>A.W.
