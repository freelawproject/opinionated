We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Roc Syl argues that the BTA failed to set forth the reasons for its decision. However, that issue is not properly before us because it was not raised in Roc Syl\u2019s notice of appeal. <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. J.C. Penney Properties, Inc. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 203, 204-205, 11 OBR 521, 522, 465 N.E.2d 48, 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Roc Syl also complains that the BTA misread <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd. v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826, regarding the presumption of validity accorded to a board of revision determination. We disagree with Roc Syl and find that the BTA properly construed and applied <em>Alliance Towers. </em>That decision dealt essentially with the proper method of determining the true value of subsidized housing, a subject that is not germane to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Nevertheless, <em>Alliance Towers </em>does say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">\u201cThe taxpayers offered no testimony or evidence that the action of the board of revision was not performed in good faith and in the exercise of sound judgment. Absent this proof, the action of the board of revision must be presumed to be valid.\u201d <em>Alliance Towers, </em>37 Ohio St.3d at 25, 523 N.E.2d at 834.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In other words, <em>Alliance Towers </em>resolves the issue of whether the board of revision acted in good faith and exercised sound judgment, not whether the board of revision\u2019s finding of true value should be presumed to be correct. Roc Syl\u2019s appeal does not present the issue of \u201cgood faith\u201d or \u201csound judgment\u201d; moreover, the BTA found that Roc Syl failed to sustain its burden of proving that the board of revision\u2019s true value determination was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The sockdolager to the school board\u2019s dispute over the true value determination of the subject property is, as stated in <em>Zindle v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 202, 203, 542 N.E.2d 650, 651:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">\u2018We further reiterated the established principle that a taxpayer has the duty to prove his right to a reduction in value.\u201d See, also, <em>R.R.Z. Associates v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 198, 202, 527 N.E.2d 874, 878, and <em>W. Industries, Inc. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1960), 170 Ohio St. 340, 10 O.O.2d 427, 164 N.E.2d 741.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">In <em>Crow v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 55, 57, 552 N. E.2d 892, 893, we stated: \u201cAppellant had the duty to prove his right to a reduction in value but failed to do so.\u201d Likewise, this requirement applies with equal force to a party that asserts a right to an increase in real property valuation, as the school board did here. It failed to present sufficient probative evidence to support its claimed true value. The BTA ultimately determines the weight and credibility to be accorded to evidence before it. <em>Cardinal Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d. 13, 19-20, 73 O.O.2d. 83, 87. 336 N.E.2d. 433. 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>For the reasons stated, the decision of the BTA is affirmed as it is neither unreasonable nor unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\n<em>.Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
