No one disputes that the commission\u2019s decision involves claimant\u2019s \u201cright to participate\u201d in the workers\u2019 compensation program and is, therefore, appealable. <em>Afrates v. Lorain </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 22, 584 N.E.2d 1175. Underlying this dispute is a single question: Has claimant\u2019s time for appeal to the common pleas court run?</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Claimant\u2019s death moots that inquiry. Admittedly, the procedural issue before this court was initiated by the employer, and, as a general rule, an employee\u2019s death does not destroy the employer\u2019s right to appeal a ruling adverse to it. <em>Seabloom Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co. v. Mayfield </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 108, 519 N.E.2d 358. In <em>Seabloom, </em>the district hearing officer had allowed the claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and, during the course of the employer\u2019s appeal to the Industrial Commission, claimant died from unrelated causes. We upheld the employer\u2019s right to continue its cause of action and preserved the employer\u2019s opportunity to prove that claimant\u2019s earlier injury was unrelated to his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">In the present case, however, the employer\u2019s appeal is an outgrowth of the occupational disease claim that claimant sought to keep alive. If claimant were to prevail on the issue before us, it would simply mean that claimant could, if she were alive, appeal the claim\u2019s disallowance to common pleas court. This underlying \u201cright to participate\u201d question, however, has been abated by claimant\u2019s death. We find the following language persuasive: \u201cWhere there is a denial of benefits to an employee and upon appeal * * * he dies before disposition of the action, the action abates by force of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation statutes and the general statutes of abatement and revivor, <em>i.e., </em>R.C. 2311.21 and 2311.26, are inapplicable.\u201d <em>Ratliff v. Flowers </em>(1970), 25 Ohio App.2d 113, 116, 54 O.O.2d 213, 215, 266 N.E.2d 848, 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b238-11\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
