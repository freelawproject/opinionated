In deciding this case two issues must be addressed. First, the court must determine whether and to what extent R.C. 1707.12 prevails over the public records statute, R.C. 149.43. If R.C. 1707.12 controls and the Division obtained the information through an investigation, then this court must determine whether Dublin has a \u201cdirect economic interest\u201d in the information and, if so, whether R.C. 1707.12(C) exempts the information from disclosure as either \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d or \u201ctrial preparation records.\u201d For the reasons stated below, we hold that R.C. 1707.12, not 149.43, governs the disclosure of information collected by the Division. We further hold that Dublin, as the target of an investigation, has no direct economic interest in the Division\u2019s files and pursuant to R.C. 1707.12(B) the information obtained by the Division cannot be disclosed. We do not reach the issue of what constitutes confidential law enforcement investigatory records or trial preparation records within the meaning of R.C. 1707.12(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Dublin argues that R.C. 149.43 rather than 1707.12 controls the availability of the records in this case because there is no conflict between the two statutes and R.C. 1707.12 is silent on the matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In doing so, Dublin relies on R.C. 1.51. We find Dublin\u2019s position untenable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>It is a well-settled principle of statutory construction that when two statutes, one general and the other special, cover the same subject matter, the special provision is to be construed as an exception to the general statute which might otherwise apply. <em>Acme Eng. Co. v. Jones </em>(1948), 150 Ohio St. 423, 38 O.O. 294, 83 N.E.2d 202, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Elliott Co. v. Connar </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 310, 175 N.E. 200, syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Steller v. Zangerle </em>(1919), 100 Ohio St. 414, 126 N.E. 413. The General Assembly codified this common-law rule in 1972 by enacting R.C. 1.51. That statute states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">\u201cIf a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the conflict between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In construing R.C. 1.51 this court has ruled that \u201c[w]here there is no manifest legislative intent that a general provision of the Revised Code prevail over a special provision, the special provision takes precedence.\u201d <em>State v. Frost </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 121, 11 O.O.3d 294, 387 N.E.2d 235, paragraph one of the syllabus. Likewise, in <em>Cincinnati v. Thomas Soft Ice Cream, Inc. </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 76, 80, 6 O.O.3d 277, 279, 369 N.E.2d 778, 781, we stated that \u201cthe later, general provision * * * shall control over the special provision * * * only if this court determines that the \u2018manifest intent\u2019 of the General Assembly is that the general provision shall prevail.\u201d See, also, <em>State ex rel. Myers v. Chiaramonte </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 230, 75 O.O.2d 283, 348 N.E.2d 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In <em>State v. Chippendale </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 118, 556 N.E.2d 1134, we provided a framework in which to analyze a conflict between general and special provisions: \u201c[I]t is critical in the first instance to determine whether the statutes * * * are general, special or local. If the statutes are general and do not involve the same or similar [subject matter], then R.C. 1.51 is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120, 556 N.E.2d at 1136. However, when two statutes, one general and the other specific, involve the same subject matter, R.C. 1.51 must be applied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Proceeding with the analysis, the <em>Chippendale </em>court stated: \u201cWhere it is clear that a general provision * * * applies coextensively with a special provision, R.C. 1.51 allows [both provisions to apply]. Conversely, where it is clear that a special provision prevails over a general provision or the [general provision] is silent or ambiguous on the matter, under R.C. 1.51, * * * only * * * the special provision [applies]. The only exception in the statute is where \u2018 * * * the general provision is the later provision and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.\u2019 Thus, <em>unless the legislature enacts or amends the general provision later in time and manifests its intent to have the general provision apply coextensively with the special provision, the special provision must be the only provision applied * * </em>*.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 120-121, 556 N.E.2d at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Employing the framework outlined above, we now turn to Dublin\u2019s position. R.C. 149.43 is the public records statute. It is clearly a general provision. By contrast, R.C. 1707.12 applies only to documents filed with or obtained by the Division through any investigation. It is a specific statute enacted as part of an overall statutory scheme that authorizes the Ohio Division of Securities to investigate alleged violations of Ohio\u2019s securities laws. Therefore, in accordance with the <em>Chippendale </em>analysis, this court must apply R.C. 1.51.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">In doing so, we initially conclude that the conflict between R.C. 149.43 and 1707.12 is irreconcilable since R.C. 1707.12 appears to be an exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>general public records provision and the language of R.C. 1707.12 expressly limits inspection requests. There is no question that R.C. 149.43 was enacted subsequent to R.C. 1707.12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, pursuant to R.C. 1.51, the subsequent, general provision prevails over the special provision only if \u201cthe legislature enacts or amends the general provision later in time and manifests its intent to have the general provision apply coextensively with the special provision. * * * \u201d <em>Chippendale, supra, </em>52 Ohio St.3d at 120-121, 556 N.E.2d at 1137. While much of the language of both statutes is similar, neither statute refers to the other. The later, general statute, R.C. 149.43, has never, in either its original form or subsequent amendments, manifested an intent to apply coextensively with the special provision. There is nothing in the language of either statute to lead this court to believe the legislature intended the two to be coextensive. Indeed, we may properly assume that the General Assembly had knowledge of the prior legislation when it enacted R.C. 149.43, and had it intended to modify the effect of R.C. 1707.12 it would have done so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Thus, because the General Assembly enacted R.C. 149.43 subsequent to R.C. 1707.12, and never manifested an intent that the two provisions be coextensive in either the original enactment or any successive amendment, we hold that R.C. 1707.12 is the sole provision governing information collected by the Ohio Division of Securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Having determined that R.C. 1707.12 is the proper provision to be applied, we must now ascertain which section of the statute governs Dublin\u2019s request for inspection. R.C. 1707.12 provides a three-tier inquiry for assessing information requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">First, under R.C. 1707.12(A), \u201c[a]ll applications and other papers filed with the division of securities shall be open to inspection at all reasonable times, except for unreasonable or improper purposes.\u201d The key word in this section is \u201cfiled.\u201d R.C. 1707.12(A) is the least restrictive provision among the three and its plain language dictates that we interpret it to cover those documents, such as applications, routinely <em>filed </em>with the Division. Accordingly, the appeals court properly held that the Division had a duty to release the registration filings, broker applications, and dealer financial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Second, R.C. 1707.12(B) mandates that \u201c[i]nformation obtained by the division through any investigation shall be retained by the division\u201d and shall be made available only to law enforcement personnel or to those who have a \u201cdirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>economic interest\u201d in the information. Because we find that Dublin does not possess a direct economic interest, this part of our opinion is limited to the R;C. 1707.12(B) analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The term \u201cdirect, economic interest\u201d is not defined in the statute. Furthermore, aside from the case history presented in this action by Dublin, R.C. 1707.12 has generated little case law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, we are guided in our interpretation solely by the language of the provision and the intent of the Ohio General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Dublin asserts it has a direct economic interest in the Division\u2019s files by virtue of its duty to self-regulate under Ohio Adm.Code 1301:6-3-15. One manner of fulfilling its responsibility, it claims, is to inspect and follow up on all complaints lodged against it with the Division. If Dublin failed to meet its responsibility, it could be subject to license suspension, license revocation, or other administrative proceedings. The prospect of such an action, Dublin argues, surely vests the company with a direct economic interest in inspecting any unfavorable information obtained by the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">While we find Dublin\u2019s definition of \u201cdirect economic interest\u201d interesting, it must be rejected in this context as too broad. We also reject the suggestion that Dublin\u2019s inability to inspect consumer complaints filed with the Division results <em>ipso facto </em>in a failure to meet its duty to self-regulate. Dublin was the target of an administrative investigation by the Division and is currently under criminal investigation by a special prosecutor. In a word, it was hardly the legislative intent of R.C. 1707.12 to place investigatory files in the hands of a subject under investigation. Instead, we hold that persons with a \u201cdirect economic interest\u201d should generally be limited to consumers who, for example, may wish to file a civil suit against a dealer where the Division investigated the consumer\u2019s complaint but chose not to proceed against the dealer. While R.C. 1707.12(B) generally exempts from inspection \u201c[information obtained by the division through any investigation,\u201d the General Assembly specifically intended to provide a right of inspection to <em>consumers </em>with a direct economic interest in the information, not to the <em>target </em>of an investigation. The court of appeals erred in ruling otherwise and in releasing the sundry complaint letters and other information noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Accordingly, Dublin is not entitled to inspection of those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>For the reasons and to the extent stated herein, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b649-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.

I concur with the majority\u2019s syllabus, but I respectfully disagree with its disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">While R.C. 1707.12 is the sole provision governing information collected by the Ohio Division of Securities (the \u201cDivision\u201d), the Division has failed to prove that the documents it wishes to conceal from disclosure fulfill the statutory test in R.C. 1707.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">While I am aware that Dublin Securities, Inc. has recently been indicted, this occurrence is irrelevant to the matter before us. The majority devotes a significant portion of its opinion to analyzing R.C. 1707.12(B), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-11\">\u201cInformation obtained by the division <em>through any investigation </em>shall be retained by the division and shall not be available to inspection by persons other than those having a direct economic interest in the information or the transaction under investigation, or by a law enforcement officer pursuant to the duties of his office.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">This provision prohibits disclosure <em>only </em>when the records at issue were obtained \u201cthrough any investigation.\u201d Before the Division can exclude documents from disclosure pursuant to R.C. 1707.12(B), it must prove that an active investigation was underway at the time the Division received the document in question. The record is devoid of any evidence indicating that the Division had begun investigating Dublin Securities before receiving the requested documents. A governmental body refusing to release records has the burden of proving that the records are exempted from disclosure. See <em>State ex rel. Natl. Broadcasting Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 79, 526 N.E.2d 786, paragraph two of the syllabus. The Division failed to meet its burden of proof and may not refuse to disclose the documents in question on the basis of R.C. 1707.12(B). Thus, the majority\u2019s detailed analysis of whether Dublin possesses \u201ca direct economic interest\u201d pursuant to R.C. 1707.12(B) is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">Likewise, the Division has failed to prove that the documents in question are exempted from disclosure pursuant to R.C. 1707.12(C), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-14\">\u201cConfidential law enforcement investigatory records and trial preparation records of the division of securities or any other law enforcement or administrative agency which are in the possession of the division of securities shall in no event be available to inspection by other than law enforcement agencies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The court of appeals correctly determined that the items which the Division wishes to conceal are neither \u201cconfidential law enforcement investigatory records\u201d nor \u201ctrial preparation records.\u201d Because I find no abuse of discretion with its determinations, I would affirm the lower court\u2019s application of R.C. 1707.12(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The exceptions to disclosure contained in R.C. 1707.12(B) and (C) do not apply to the documents in question.
