Claimant\u2019s challenge requires us to determine whether there is \u201csome evidence,\u201d as <em>Kinsey v. Bd. of Trustees of Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund of Ohio </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 224, 551 N.E.2d 989, requires, to support the denial of compensation for permanent total disability. The appellate court found that there was, and, for the reasons to follow, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">R.C. 742.01(G) defines \u201cpermanent disability\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-14\">\u201c[A] condition of disability with respect to which the board of trustees of the police and firemen\u2019s disability and pension fund finds there is no present indication of recovery. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">R.C. 742.01(F) describes \u201ctotal disability\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201c[Ijnability to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which the member of the fund is reasonably fitted by training, experience, and accomplishments, provided that absolute helplessness is not a prerequisite of total disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">A determination of permanent total disability must, therefore, include consideration of all relevant medical and nonmedical factors. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Montague v. Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund of Ohio </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 661, 605 N.E.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">As to his vocational prospects, claimant is a thirty-year-old college student who plans to get a Ph.D. in psychology. As to his psychological impairment, Drs. Daniels and McCafferty forecast that claimant\u2019s work-related psychological condition will improve. As to his physical abilities, the medical evidence uniformly indicates a capacity for sedentary work. All of these factors and the evidence underlying them were discussed, in the board\u2019s order, leaving it supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Claimant admits that he intends to pursue a career that is consistent with the sedentary limitations placed on him. Claimant argues that the board erred in considering his potential for future employment. He contends that the only relevant question is whether he can work <em>now. </em>Stressing that he has not yet completed his studies, claimant argues that there are no jobs within his current capacities and, accordingly, a finding of permanent total disability is warranted. Claimant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Claimant does not seek compensation merely for \u201ctotal disability,\u201d he seeks compensation for <em>permanent </em>total disability. \u201cTotality\u201d demands an inability to perform gainful employment. \u201cPermanency\u201d requires that the \u201ccondition of disability\u201d underlying the inability to work is one that will not improve. Considering these criteria together, \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d implies an inability to <em>ever </em>work. A claimant who, as here, has re-employment potential does not meet the criteria for permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">R.C. 742.37 supports our interpretation. Subsection (C)(2) orders that permanent total disability compensation continue until death. Since inability to work is a prerequisite to payment, Subsection (C)(2) obviously contemplates that the inability to work will never change.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b236-12\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
