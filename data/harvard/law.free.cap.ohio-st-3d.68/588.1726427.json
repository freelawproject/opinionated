We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">Appellant\u2019s argument erroneously assumes that evidence of a pre-existing <em>condition </em>is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a pre-existing <em>disability </em>as well. Appellant, however, ignores that claimant worked without any apparent problems prior to her industrial accident. Because her psychological condition did not affect her ability to work before the accident, appellant cannot persuasively argue that the claimant has a pre-existing emotional <em>disability. </em>See <em>Marshall v. Ouachita Hosp. </em>(1980), 269 Ark. 958, 961, 601 S.W.2d 901, 902. (Appellate court upheld claimant\u2019s contention that although he was a polio victim, he had no pre-existing disability in the workers\u2019 compensation sense, since he had been able to work as a lab technician and perform all required tasks for twenty-two years prior to his work-related accident.)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Equally important, even if there were a pre-existing disability, there is evidence that claimant\u2019s inability to work is due entirely to her industrial injury. Again, Dr. Bonds specifically stated in two places in his report that claimant\u2019s industrial injury was solely responsible for her inability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The appellate court judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b806-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
