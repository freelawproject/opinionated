I respectfully dissent from the conclusion of the majority that this case was improvidently allowed. Entirely aside from any ultimate decision on the merits of the case, I believe the case presents a question of great public interest as to the possible retroactive effect of R.C. 2744.05(B) regarding the impairment of a remedy instead of a substantive right. This court may not be required to overrule <em>Vogel v. Wells </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 91, 566 N.E.2d 154, but could instead determine the constitutional question regarding the possible retroactive effect of R.C. 2744.05(B) should we find that only a remedy was affected. Thus, we could distinguish the <em>Vogel </em>decision. The majority\u2019s decision that the ease was improvidently allowed, however, raises an implication that application of the statute in this case affects a substantive right without consideration of the argument that application of the statute may have affected only a remedy.</p>\n<judges id=\"b823-14\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
