These requirements, imposed by S.Ct.Prac.R. V(l), apply for briefs in support of motions, just as they do for merit briefs in original actions. See S.Ct.Prac.R. VIII(10), V(2), and VI(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Birdsall relies on <em>Drake v. Bucher </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 37, 34 O.O.2d 53, 213 N.E.2d 182, in which an appeal was dismissed <em>sua sponte </em>because the brief \u201cutterly fail[ed] to comply with virtually every rule of this court as to form and content,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 38, 34 O.O.2d at 54, 213 N.E.2d at 183, and was \u201ca substantial disregard of the whole body of these rules,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 40, 34 O.O.2d at 55, 213 N.E.2d at 184, that could not be tolerated. Birdsall also relies on <em>State ex rel. Queen City Chapter of the Soc. of Professional Journalists v. McGinnis </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 54, 10 OBR 316, 461 N.E.2d 307, in which an original action in mandamus was dismissed by this court because the relators failed to file an appropriate brief after being ordered to do so twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">The judges\u2019 noncompliance in this case, however, is not so pervasive as that in <em>Drake, supra. </em>Nor have the judges ignored a court order to file a complying brief as did the relators in <em>McGinnis, supra. </em>Moreover, the <em>Drake </em>court observed that the promotion of justice may sometimes require \u201ca certain liberality in enforcing a strict attention to the'rules,\u201d 5 Ohio St.2d at 40, 34 O.O.2d at 55, 213 N.E.2d at 184, and striking the judges\u2019 motion, part of which we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>dispositive, will serve only to delay final judgment. Accordingly, we overrule the relator\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We also overrule the respondents\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss. In mandamus actions, such motions ascertain whether the complaint alleges \u201c \u2018the existence of [a clear] legal duty and the want of an adequate remedy at law\u2019 \u201d\u2014 the conditions for the writ to issue \u2014 \u201c \u2018with sufficient particularity so that the respondent is given reasonable notice of the claim asserted.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 548, 605 N.E.2d 378, 381, quoting <em>State ex rel. Alford v. Willoughby Civ. Serv. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 221, 224, 12 O.O.3d 229, 230, 390 N.E.2d 782, 785. The respondent judges, however, do not. attack the sufficiency of the complaint. They argue that Birdsall has an adequate remedy by way of the certification procedure provided in R.C. 2501.12 and, thus, seek a judgment on the merits of this dispute. See <em>State ex rel. Schneider v. N. Olmsted Bd. of Edn. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 281, 282, 530 N.E.2d 206, 207 (\u201c[W]hen a court denies mandamus because an adequate legal remedy exists, the denial is an adjudication on the merits.\u201d). We have said that such motions are \u201cill-conceived.\u201d <em>Assn. for Defense of the Washington Local School Dist. v</em>. <em>Kiger </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 116, 117, 537 N.E.2d 1292, 1293.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The judges\u2019 argument that Birdsall had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law is better raised by their motion for summary judgment. A Civ.R. 56 motion for summary judgment allows us to consider pleadings and certain evidence in determining whether material facts are not in dispute and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. This standard is consistent with the judges\u2019 argument that Birdsall should have timely filed his request for certification under R.C. 2501.12 and with Birdsall\u2019s failure to dispute the facts of his untimely request or the adequacy of this remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">R. C. 2501.12 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">\u201cA motion seeking an order of the court of appeals to certify the record of a case to the supreme court for the reason that the judgment of the court of appeals in the case is in conflict with a judgment pronounced upon the same question by another court of appeals of this state, shall be filed in the court of appeals within thirty days after the journal entry of the judgment in the case sought to be certified has been approved by the court in writing and filed with its clerk for journalization. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">But Birdsall argues that S.Ct.Prac.R. Ill completely controls certification of conflicts by courts of appeal, apparently because R.C. 2501.12 has been superseded pursuant to Section 5(B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution, which invalidates all laws in conflict with Supreme Court Rules of Practice promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">S. Ct.Prac.R. Ill provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201cSection 1. Time for Filing Copy of Order of Certification. Where the judges of a Court of Appeals have made an order finding that a judgment upon which they have agreed is in conflict with a judgment pronounced upon the same question by another Court of Appeals and providing for certification of the record of the case to the Supreme Court for review and final determination, a party who would be adversely affected by the judgment so agreed upon shall, within thirty days of the such order of certification, file in the Supreme Court a certified copy of such order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We see no conflict between S.ChPrac.R. Ill and R.C. 2501.12. Compliance with the thirty-day period in the statute does not preclude compliance with the rule because the rule does not impose any time period for requesting the court of appeals to certify a conflict. But, cf., <em>Rockey v. 84 Lumber Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 221, 224, 611 N.E.2d 789, 791. Nor does R.C. 2501.12 impose additional burdens for accomplishing this purpose. <em>Id. </em>S.Ct.Prac.R. Ill governs procedure once a conflict is determined by a court of appeals; the statute establishes the procedure for submitting the issue to the court of appeals initially. Accordingly, the provisions of both laws must be given effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Moreover, we agree with the judges that Birdsall might have challenged the time restriction in R.C. 2501.12 directly by appealing their refusal to certify the conflict. Wfliile not appealable by right as a case that originated in the court of appeals, <em>Waller v. Leach </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 181, 34 O.O. 62, 70 N.E.2d 267, the court\u2019s judgment was a final order and, therefore, within our discretionary review authority. The availability of a discretionary appeal is an adequate remedy that will ordinarily preclude a writ of mandamus. <em>State ex rel. LTV Steel Co. v. Gwin </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 245, 248-249, 594 N.E.2d 616, 620. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Foreman v. Logan Cty. Court of Appeals </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 93, 53 O.O.2d 251, 264 N.E.2d 642; <em>State ex rel. Wolfe v. Richards </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 63, 187 N.E. 1, which hold that we will not review a court of appeals\u2019 denial of certification for the reason that no conflict exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Accordingly, relator\u2019s motion to strike and respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss are overruled. Respondents\u2019 alternative motion for summary judgment, however, is granted and the writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">\n<em>Motion for summary judgment granted and unit denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-9\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
