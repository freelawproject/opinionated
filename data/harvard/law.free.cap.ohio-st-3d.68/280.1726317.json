However, as appellant points out, the premise of that penultimate paragraph of division (D), necessary to invoke its conclusion, is that the appellant not have been released on his own recognizance, <em>or </em>upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond, <em>or </em>pursuant to division (D)(1), (2) or (3). Appellant was, in fact, released pursuant to division (D)(2); therefore, the premise of the paragraph was not fulfilled and the conclusion that Judge Carey could set bond pursuant to the felony provisions of division (C) could not be invoked, especially in light of Crim.R. 46(J).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Under Crim.R. 46(D), a judge may set a felony bond for an alleged misdemeanant only if the alleged misdemeanant has not been previously released on his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>her own recognizance, pursuant to an unsecured appearance bond, or pursuant to a bond as provided in division (D)(1), (2) or (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">In the instant case, Judge Carey converted a misdemeanor bond to a felony bond. This is not authorized by Crim.R. 46 and is therefore excessive as a matter of law. Accordingly, the decision of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.

A person arrested for a misdemeanor and not released pursuant to Crim.R. 4(F), shall be released by the clerk of court, or if the clerk is not available the officer in charge of the facility to which the person is brought, on his personal recognizance, or upon the execution of an unsecured appearance bond in the amount specified in the bail schedule established by the court. If the clerk or officer in charge of the facility determines pursuant to a division (F) that such release will not reasonably assure appearance as required, the person shall be eligible for release by doing any of the following, at his option: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-15\">\u201c(1) Executing an appearance bond in the amount specified in the court\u2019s bail schedule, with a deposit of either $25.00 or a sum of <em>money </em>equal to ten percent of the amount of the bond, whichever is greater.

When a person is not released because of his physical, mental, or emotional condition, and it appears that his release into the temporary custody of a responsible relative, friend, or other person will obviate the danger to himself or others, he shall be released into such temporary custody on his making bail under division (D)(1), (2) or (3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">\n<em>\u201cIf a person is not released on his own recognizance, or upon the execution of an unsecured appearance bond, or pursuant to division (D)(1), (2), or (S), he shall be given a hearing without unnecessary delay before a judge or magistrate who shall determine the conditions of his release pursuant to division (C).</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">\u201cEach court shall establish a bail schedule covering all misdemeanors including traffic offenses, either specifically, or by type, or by potential penalty, or by some other reasonable method of classification.
