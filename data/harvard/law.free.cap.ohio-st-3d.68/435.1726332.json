Ivy </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 114, 115, 4 O.O.3d 243, 244, 363 N.E.2d 367, 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Generally, an employer or principal is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees or agents under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>but not for the negligence of an independent contractor over whom it retained no right to control the mode and manner of doing the contracted-for work. <em>Councell v. Douglas </em>(1955), 163 Ohio St. 292, 295-296, 56 O.O. 262, 263-264, 126 N.E.2d 597, 599-600.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">This issue was addressed in <em>Albain v. Flower Hosp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 251, 553 N.E.2d 1038. At paragraph four of the syllabus in <em>Albain, </em>this court recognized and adopted the following exception to hospital nonliability for the negligence of independent contractors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">\u201cA hospital may, in narrowly defined situations, under the doctrine of agency by estoppel, be held liable for the negligent acts of a physician to whom it has granted staff privileges. In order to establish such liability, a plaintiff must show that: (1) the hospital made representations leading the plaintiff to believe that the negligent physician was operating as an agent under the hospital\u2019s authority, and (2) the plaintiff was thereby induced to rely upon the ostensible agency relationship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">In attempting to apply <em>Albain </em>to the facts of this case, we find ourselves questioning the very basis of the holding in paragraph four of the syllabus. Concomitantly, we are not unmindful of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>which dictates adherence to judicial decisions. <em>Stare decisis, </em>however, was not intended \u201cto effect a \u2018petrifying rigidity,\u2019 but to assure the justice that flows from certainty and stability. If, instead, adherence to precedent offers not justice but unfairness, not certainty but doubt and confusion, it loses its right to survive, and no principle constrains us to follow it.\u201d <em>Bing v. Thunig </em>(1957), 2 N.Y.2d 656, 667, 163 N.Y.S.2d 3, 11, 143 N.E.2d 3, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">With the foregoing in mind, we now proceed to reconsider the holding in <em>Albain </em>as it is applicable to the instant case. In adopting an agency-by-estoppel exception, we noted in <em>Albain </em>that the majority of jurisdictions which have recognized this type of hospital vicarious liability has done so based on either Section 267 of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Agency (1958) 578, or Section 429 of the Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 421. In adopting Section 267, we stated that \u201cSection 267 poses a stricter standard, and requires actual reliance * * * \u201d <em>Id., </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 262, 553 N.E.2d at 1048-1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">We then proceeded to narrowly define the situations to which the doctrine could apply, without any discussion or analysis of how the multitude of cases from other jurisdictions has applied Sections 267 or 429 to vicarious hospital liability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Rather, based on a law review, Comment, Hospital Liability for Physician Malpractice: The Impact of <em>Hannola v. City of Lakewood </em>(1986), 47 Ohio St.L.J. 1077, and a severely criticized dissenting opinion in <em>Pamperin v. Trinity Mem. Hosp. </em>(1988), 144 Wis.2d 188, 423 N.W.2d 848, we limited the doctrine in a way that simultaneously abrogated the very exception we claimed to create.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">We began our analysis in <em>Albain </em>with the statement that the doctrine of agency by estoppel was first applied to hospitals in <em>Grewe v. Mt. Clemens Gen. Hosp. </em>(1978), 404 Mich. 240, 250-251, 273 N.W.2d 429, 433, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201c \u2018[I]f the individual looked to the hospital to provide him with medical treatment and there has been a representation by the hospital that medical treatment would be afforded by the physicians working therein, an agency by estoppel can be found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albain, </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 262, 553 N.E.2d at 1048.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">We then used this language to form the basis of what we set forth' as the first element required under paragraph four of our syllabus, <em>viz., </em>that the plaintiff must show that the hospital made representations leading her to believe that the negligent physician was operating as an agent under the hospital\u2019s authority. <em>Id. </em>at 263, 553 N.E.2d at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">A close reading of the <em>Grewe </em>opinion, however, reveals that the above passage was not meant to summarize what we articulated as the first prong of agency by estoppel. Rather, it was advanced as the total set of requirements imposed upon a plaintiff relying on the doctrine to establish liability of the hospital. In the very next paragraph, the court in <em>Grewe </em>explained that:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">\u201c[T]he critical question is whether the plaintiff, at the time of his admission to the hospital, was looking to the hospital for treatment of his physical ailments or merely viewed the hospital as the situs where his physician would treat him for his problems. A relevant factor in this determination involves resolution of the question of whether the hospital provided the plaintiff with [the treating physician] or whether the plaintiff and [the treating physician] had a patient-physician relationship independent of the hospital setting.\u201d <em>Id., </em>404 Mich, at 251, 273 N.W.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">In applying this test, <em>Grewe </em>recognized that it is not the patient/plaintiffs duty to inquire as to the employment relationship between the hospital and the physician it provides. Rather, it is the hospital\u2019s duty \u201c\u2018to put [plaintiff] on notice that the [treatment was not rendered as] an integral part of [the hospital], and it cannot be seriously contended that [plaintiff], when he was being carried from room to room suffering excruciating pain, should have inquired whether the individual doctors who examined him are employees * * * or * * * independent contractors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 273 N.W.2d at 434, quoting <em>Stanhope v. Los Angeles College of Chiropractic </em>(1942), 54 Cal.App.2d 141, 146, 128 P.2d 705, 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Yet, in direct contrast to the very case we relied upon in adopting paragraph four of our syllabus in <em>Albain, </em>we proceeded to reject plaintiff\u2019s averment in <em>Albain </em>that upon her arrival at the hospital she believed \u201cthat [the hospital] would provide me with a physician.\u201d We found that plaintiff \u201cdid not believe that a physician <em>who was an employee of the hospital </em>would be provided her\u201d because the treating physician \u201cnever discussed her employment status with [plaintiff] in any manner.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id., </em>50 Ohio St.3d at 264, 553 N.E.2d at 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We also added a second element \u2014 that the plaintiff must show that she was induced to rely upon the apparent-agency relationship. In fact we applied this element in a way that is contrary to the holding of cases in all other jurisdictions that we have found which adopted and applied the doctrine in actions against hospitals. See discussion <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We stressed that \u201c[a]s to this second element * * * the question is * * * <em>not </em>whether the plaintiff relied on the reputation of the hospital.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 263, 553 N.E.2d at 1049-1050. Rather, the plaintiff must demonstrate that she \u201cwould have refused * * * care if she had known [that the treating physician] was not an employee of the hospital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264, 553 N.E.2d at 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">By requiring the patienVplaintiff in <em>Albain </em>to demonstrate that she would have refused care had she known of the independent status of the treating physician, we have created an exception that is so illusory that it forces the emergency patient to demonstrate that she would have chosen to risk further complications or death rather than be treated by a physician of whose independence she had been unaware. In addition, <em>Albain </em>imposed the burden that the patient ascertain and understand the contractual arrangement between the hospital and treating physician, while simultaneously holding that her belief upon arrival that the hospital would provide her with a physician is insufficient. Thus it is virtually impossible for the plaintiff, especially in a wrongful-death case, to establish reliance as required in <em>Albain.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">It is no wonder that among the many cases from other jurisdictions dealing with this issue, we were unable to find a single case in support of such a narrow interpretation of agency by estoppel in a hospital setting. In fact, <em>Albain </em>is so much an aberration that its requirements, proposed elsewhere, have been called \u201castonishing,\u201d \u201cabsurd,\u201d \u201cunfair,\u201d criticized for creating a \u201cfalse dichotomy\u201d between reliance on the apparent agency relationship and the hospital\u2019s reputation, and scoffed at for focusing on notice that comes \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d <em>Paintsville Hosp. Co. v. Rose </em>(Ky.1985), 683 S.W.2d 255, 258; <em>Capan v. Divine Providence </em>Hosp. (1980), 287 Pa.Super. 364, 369, 430 A.2d 647, 649; Note, <em>Pamperin v. Trinity Mem. Hosp. </em>and the Evolution of Hospital Liability: Wisconsin Adopts Apparent Agency (1990), Wis.L.Rev. 1129, 1147, 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Appellant, in conciliatory fashion, proposes that in the event that we choose not to reexamine <em>Albain, </em>we can find evidence of reliance in the fact that Kimberly drove directly by Sycamore Hospital in order to be treated at Southview. If we were to do as appellant suggests, then the outcome would be different had she suffered the asthma attack at a place geographically closer to Southview than to Sycamore Hospital. It is disconcerting at best that the fortuity of geographic proximity should determine the outcome under a doctrine so deeply rooted in public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Because of the history surrounding the growth of hospital liability and strong public policy arguments, we choose to revisit paragraph four of the syllabus of <em>Albain. </em>At common law, hospitals enjoyed immunity from liability even for the negligent acts of their employees. The concept is said to have originated in mid-Nineteenth Century England and was based on the theory that charitable funds could not be diverted from the use intended by their donors. American courts imported the \u201ctrust fund\u201d theory and added others to justify the exemption of hospitals from tort liability, even long after the theory was discarded in England. The other theories included implied waiver, public policy and the idea that <em>respondeat superior </em>is not appropriate because the hospital derived no benefit from the physician\u2019s services. See, generally, Note, Independent Duty of a Hospital to Prevent Physicians\u2019 Malpractice (1973), 15 Ariz.L.Rev. 953, 954-956. As one court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201c[Sjince [a hospital] ministers to those who cannot pay as well as those who can, thus acting as a good Samaritan, justice and sound public policy alike dictate that it should be exempt from the liability attaching to masters whose only aim is to engage in enterprises of profit or of self-interest * * *.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Henke </em>(1917), 165 Wis. 166, 170, 160 N.W. 173, 175 (overruled by <em>Kojis v. Doctors Hosp. </em>[1961], 12 Wis.2d 367, 107 N.W.2d 131).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">This court first applied the doctrine of charitable immunity to hospitals in <em>Taylor v. Protestant Hosp. Assn. </em>(1911), 85 Ohio St. 90, 96 N.E. 1089, relying on each of the aforementioned justifications. In summary, we made the following predictive observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">\u201cExperience has shown that the ends of justice are best secured by holding the master responsible for injuries caused by the wrongful acts of his servant, done in the prosecution of his private ends and for his benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">\u201cDoubtless the rule will be extended to meet the requirements of manifold new conditions brought about by growth and advance. Courts are constantly confronted with the necessity of extending established principles to new conditions. But in this case it is sought to extend the rule to masters different from others, and who do not come within its reason, and to hold a public charity involving no private profit responsible for the negligence of servants employed solely for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>public use and a public benefit. We think such extension is not justified. Public policy should and does encourage enterprises with the aims and purposes of defendant, and requires that they should be exempted from the operation of the rule\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 103, 96 N.E. at 1092.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Indeed, our reasoning was painfully reflective of the realities of the time:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">\u201cThe hospital of the early mid-nineteenth century would not be recognizable as such to a modern observer. \u2018Respectable\u2019 people who fell sick or who were injured were treated by their doctors at home; only the lowest classes of society sought help in the \u2018hospital,\u2019 which was most often a separate wing on the almshouse. As late as 1873, there were only 178 hospitals in the United States, with a total of 50,000 beds. These hospitals were private charities, and their trustees were usually unable to raise sufficient funding to. provide a pleasant stay. The hospital of the time was dirty, crowded and full of contagious disease. The \u2018nurses\u2019 were usually former patients. Doctors, who were not paid, tended the ill for a few hours per week out of a sense of charity mixed with the knowledge that they could \u2018practice\u2019 their cures on the poor and charge young medical students for instruction in the healing arts. These young \u2018house doctors\u2019 also worked without pay, practicing cures on the ill.\u201d Note, <em>supra, </em>1990 Wis.L.Rev. at 1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">As the role of the hospital in society changed, the justifications underlying charitable immunity eroded. At first, courts drew a distinction between medical and administrative acts of employees, imposing liability on the hospital for the latter but not the former. See <em>Schloendorff v. Soc. of New York Hosp. </em>(1914), 211 N.Y. 125, 105 N.E. 92. This distinction represented a judicial policy of compromise between the doctrines of <em>respondeat superior </em>and charitable immunity. See <em>Bing v. Thunig, supra, </em>2 N.Y.2d at 662, 163 N.Y.S.2d at 7, 143 N.E.2d at 6. In <em>Bing, </em>however, it was observed that liability based on <em>respondeat superior </em>is the rule and immunity the exception. <em>Id. </em>at 666, 163 N.Y.S.2d at 10, 143 N.E.2d at 8. In abolishing immunity, that court made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u201cThe conception that the hospital does not undertake to treat the patient, does not undertake to act through its doctors and nurses, but undertakes instead simply to procure them to act upon their own responsibility, no longer reflects the fact. Present-day hospitals, as their manner of operation plainly demonstrates, do far more than furnish facilities for treatment. They regularly employ on a salary basis a large staff of physicians, nurses and interns, as well as administrative and manual workers, and they charge patients for medical care and treatment, collecting for such services, if necessary, by legal action. Certainly, the person who avails himself of \u2018hospital facilities\u2019 expects that the hospital will attempt to cure him, not that its nurses or other employees will act on their own responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, 163 N.Y.S.2d at 11, 143 N.E.2d at 8.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>This court reached the same conclusion as did <em>Bing </em>when, in <em>Avellone v. St. John\u2019s Hosp. </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 467, 60 O.O. 121, 135 N.E.2d 410, we abolished the doctrine of charitable immunity for hospitals (later in <em>Albritton v. Neighborhood Centers Assn. </em>[1984], 12 Ohio St.3d 210, 12 OBR 295, 466 N.E.2d 867, the doctrine of charitable immunity would be abolished altogether in Ohio). We observed that \u201cthe average nonprofit hospital of today is a large well run corporation, and, in many instances, the hospital is so \u2018businesslike\u2019 in its monetary requirements for entrance and in its collections of accounts that a shadow is thrown upon the word, \u2018charity,\u2019 and the base of payment mentioned above is broadened still more.\u201d <em>Id., </em>165 Ohio St. at 474, 60 O.O. at 125, 135 N.E.2d at 415. Again in predictive fashion, we left open the question as to a hospital\u2019s liability for the negligent acts of independent medical practitioners working in the hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 477-478, 60 O.O. at 126-127, 135 N.E.2d at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">With the demise of charitable immunity, the issue pushed to the forefront was whether and under what circumstances a hospital could be held liable for the negligence of those independent physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In <em>Cooper v. Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati, Inc. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 242, 254, 56 O.O.2d 146, 152, 272 N.E.2d 97, 104, we declined to apply the doctrine of agency by estoppel to a hospital unless \u201c \u2018induced reliance\u2019 [is] shown * * * as required by <em>Johnson v. Wagner Provision Co. </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 584 [26 O.O. 161, 49 N.E.2d 925].\u201d <em>Johnson </em>indeed requires \u201creliance upon an ostensible agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph four of the syllabus. <em>Johnson, </em>however, approved and followed <em>Rubbo v. Hughes Provision Co. </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 178, 20 O.O. 233, 34 N.E.2d 202. <em>Id., </em>141 Ohio St. at 590, 26 O.O. at 164, 49 N.E.2d at 928. In <em>Rubbo, </em>we found the element of reliance to take on a different character, where a plaintiff responds to a business advertisement. We held the doctrine of agency by estoppel applicable \u201c[w]here the proprietor of a provision market advertises an article for sale in his market and a purchaser, <em>in reliance that he was buying from such proprietor and without knowledge to the contrary, </em>buys such advertised article at a counter in the market which the proprietor had leased to another * * (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\"><em>Rubbo </em>imposed no requirement that the plaintiff show induced reliance upon the employment relationship between the proprietor and the lessee. Rather, the focus shifted to reliance upon the relationship between the proprietor\u2019s advertisement and the article purchased. In fact, we agreed with the court of appeals in that case that \u201c \u2018prospective purchasers going to the company\u2019s place of business had a right to <em>assume </em>that the company was selling [the advertised article] in the absence of knowledge to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>138 Ohio St. at 181, 20 O.O. at 234, 34 N.E.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Nor does <em>Rubbo </em>require proof that representations were made directly to the plaintiff in order for the doctrine to apply. \u201c \u2018[Representations need not be made to the plaintiff directly * * * [;] \u201c[i]t is sufficient if the representation is made to a third person to be communicated to the plaintiff, or to * * * a class of persons of whom the plaintiff is one, or even <em>if it is made to the public generally with a view to its being acted on, </em>and the plaintiff as one of the public acts on it * * \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 182, 20 O.O at 235, 34 N.E.2d at 205, quoting from <em>Globe Indemn. Co. v. Wassman </em>(1929), 120 Ohio St. 72, 85, 165 N.E. 579, 583, which was quoting from <em>Swift v. Winterbotham </em>(1872-1873), 8 L.R., Q.B. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions that have addressed the issue of a hospital\u2019s liability for the negligence of those with whom it contracts, but over whom the hospital retains no right of control, have adopted the approach of <em>Grewe </em>and <em>Rubbo </em>with virtual unanimity. Without exception, and irrespective of whether Section 267 of the Restatement of Agency 2d or Section 429 of the Restatement of Torts 2d is utilized, the cases applying this kind of liability do not require an express representation to the patient that the treating physician is an employee of the hospital or direct testimony as to reliance. Rather, the element of representation is satisfied when the hospital holds itself out to the public as a provider of medical services, and the element of reliance is satisfied if the patient looks to the hospital, rather than a specific physician, to provide her with medical care. In applying the traditional elements in this way, those courts invariably recognize the status of the modern-day hospital and its role in contemporary society. Not only is the hospital of today a large, well-inn business, as we noted in <em>\u00c1vellone </em>when we abolished charitable immunity for hospitals, but advances in medical technology have inevitably spawned increased specialization and industrialization. Hospitals are the only place where the best equipment and facilities and a full array of medical services are available at any time without an appointment. With hospitals now being complex full-service institutions, the emergency room has become the community medical center, serving as the portal of entry to the myriad of services available at the hospital. As an industry, hospitals spend enormous amounts of money advertising in an effort to compete with each other for the health care dollar, thereby inducing the public to rely on them in their time of medical need. The public, in looking to the hospital to provide such care, is unaware of and unconcerned \"with the technical complexities and nuances surrounding the contractual and employment arrangements between the hospital and the various medical personnel operating therein. Indeed, often the very nature of a medical emergency precludes choice. Public policy dictates that the public has every right to assume and expect that the hospital is the medical provider it purports to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">A hospital may be held liable under the doctrine of agency by estoppel for the negligence of independent medical practitioners practicing in the hospital if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>holds itself out to the public as a provider of medical services and in the absence of notice or knowledge to the contrary, the patient looks to the hospital, as opposed to the individual practitioner, to provide competent medical care. <em>(Albain v. Flower Hosp., supra, </em>paragraph four of the syllabus, overruled.) Unless the patient merely viewed the hospital as the situs where her physician would treat her, she had a right to assume and expect that the treatment was being rendered through hospital employees and that any negligence associated therewith would render the hospital liable. <em>Gilbert v.

There is nothing in the record to indicate that Kimberly was informed or knew that the emergency care she received was being rendered by an independent contractor merely using the hospital as a situs to provide such care. Rather, appellant\u2019s testimony indicates that Kimberly was looking to Southview to provide such care.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court entered upon the verdict is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-8\">Douglas, F.E.

Simply informing her that some doctors and staff have a different technical relationship with the hospital than the one she expected does not lessen the reasonableness of her reliance upon the hospital. Even if the patient understood the difference between an employee and an independeni&gt;contractor relationship, informing her of the nature of the relationship after she arrives is too late. The puipose of any notice requirement is to impart knowledge sufficient to enable the plaintiff to exercise an informed choice.

I respectfully dissent. In its attempt to mitigate the perceived harshness of <em>Albain v. Flower Hosp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 251, 553 N.E.2d 1038, the majority swings the pendulum so far to the other side as to make a hospital the virtual insurer of its independent physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">In <em>Albain, </em>this court held that a hospital may be found liable for the acts of its staff physicians under the doctrine of agency by estoppel. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph four of the syllabus. To establish such liability, <em>Albain </em>required the plaintiff to prove that \u201c(1) the hospital made representations leading the plaintiff to believe that the negligent physician was operating as an agent under the hospital\u2019s authority, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>(2) the plaintiff was thereby induced to rely upon the ostensible agency relationship.\u201d In my view, the instant case presents a set of facts that could be found to satisfy the <em>Albain </em>test for agency by estoppel and demonstrates that there is no need to overrule paragraph four of the <em>Albain </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">As the majority points out, the evidence in this case established that Southview Hospital, through its advertising materials, held itself out as a hospital with an emergency room that possessed \u201cthe latest technology and equipment\u201d and that could \u201chandle all major medical emergencies.\u201d . Prior to her medical emergency, plaintiff had made a specific decision to go to the Southview Hospital emergency room if she were to have a medical crisis. She apparently passed directly by a closer hospital on her way to Southview. As I read <em>Albain, </em>a reasonable trier of fact could have, based on this and other evidence at trial, found Southview hable through agency by estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Instead, the majority overrules paragraph four of the <em>Albain </em>syllabus and substitutes a new test for agency by estoppel. Thus, a majority of the court persists in its eagerness to overrule recent and well-reasoned precedent. The court justifies its departure from the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>in this case by implying that the standards enunciated in <em>Albain </em>will lead to \u201cunfairness, * * * doubt and confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">At a time when the rising cost of medical care surpasses most other issues on national agendas, a majority of this court have acted to substantially increase the acts of doctors for which hospitals will be required to provide insurance. The test the majority has established will unfortunately increase the cost of providing medical services and create more unfairness, doubt and confusion than it resolves. Numerous questions arise when one tries to analyze and predict the consequences of the newly announced standard. For example, what does it mean for a hospital to \u201chold itself out\u201d to the public as a provider of medical services? Does not every medical hospital do so when it erects a sign saying \u201chospital\u201d on its premises? The majority cites approvingly to <em>Rubbo v. Hughes Provision Co. </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 178, 20 O.O. 233, 34 N.E.2d 202, for the proposition that the hospital need only make a representation to \u201ca class of persons of whom the plaintiff is one.\u201d Does this require that the plaintiff even be <em>aware </em>of the representation? Does the \u201cholding out\u201d of the hospital require any specific representations about the emergency room?</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">As to the second prong of the newly announced test, what constitutes \u201cnotice or knowledge to the contrary?\u201d The majority has indicated that a sign in the emergency room is not sufficient. Will disclaimers in the hospital\u2019s brochures and advertisements be sufficient? Will a hospital be able to insulate itself by promoting, for instance, \u201cthe excellent care provided by its <em>independent </em>staff physicians?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>In addition, the final element of the majority\u2019s new test, which requires that the plaintiff look to the hospital as opposed to the individual physician to provide competent care, is entirely subjective. Once a plaintiff testifies that he or she \u201clooked to the hospital\u201d as opposed to the individual practitioner, a hospital defendant will have almost no effective means to disprove the plaintiffs subjective state of mind. The majority criticizes <em>Albain </em>for requiring the plaintiff to prove reliance in a wrongful death case, stating that it would be \u201cvirtually impossible.\u201d The newly announced test, however, which depends exclusively on the decedent\u2019s state of mind at the time he or she received medical care, presents the very same problem of proof. Finally, to what extent must the plaintiffs \u201clooking to the hospital\u201d be a direct result of the hospital\u2019s representations as opposed to the plaintiffs ambient information \u2014 or disinformation \u2014 about how hospitals are structured and operate in general?</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">More doubt and confusion will arise when the majority\u2019s holding is applied in other factual settings. For example, some large department stores rent space in their stores to purveyors of individual lines of products, such as cosmetics. In doing so, does a department store hold itself out to the public as a \u201cprovider\u201d of cosmetics, subjecting it to liability for the negligent acts of the independent contractors on its premises?</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The majority asserts, and I agree, that <em>stare decisis </em>should not prevail when precedent leads to injustice and unfairness. I also agree that the role of hospitals in society has changed dramatically over time. Nevertheless, I do not agree that merely because hospitals have come more to resemble businesses than charitable institutions, this court should dramatically weaken their ability to limit contractually their liability for their independent agents. This court should not force hospitals to be excess insurers of their staff physicians. Nor has plaintiff shown that, in the great majority of malpractice cases, the physician\u2019s insurance will be inadequate to' cover the full amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Estoppel is an equitable doctrine that, according to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 551, mandates that \u201c[a] party is prevented by his own acts from claiming a right to detriment of other party who was entitled to rely on such conduct and has acted accordingly.\u201d (Citing <em>Graham v. Asbury </em>[1975], 112 Ariz. 184, 185-186, 540 P.2d 656, 657-658.) It is a doctrine rooted in considerations of fairness that prevents a party from benefiting from a representation, and later denying it. By requiring reliance, the <em>Albain </em>test properly embodied this concept. By eliminating the need for a nexus between the representation and a specific act by the plaintiff in reliance thereon, the new standard loses sight of the basis for applying estoppel in the first place. The new standard penalizes a hospital where it has reaped no benefit from its own actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The essence of the problem in these cases is the tension between making hospitals liable in all instances and making them liable in none. The majority criticizes <em>Albain </em>because it \u201cabrogated the very exception [it] claimed to create.\u201d The fact that the instant case may be decided favorably to the plaintiff under <em>Albain, </em>however, demonstrates otherwise. Moreover, I believe that the majority has committed the same fault to the opposite extreme: it has created a rule that swallows the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">If the <em>Albain </em>standard unduly limits the class of potential plaintiffs, the more jurisprudentially sound approach would be to modify, interpret or soften the holding of that case instead of conducting the radical surgery performed by the majority opinion. For example, this court could choose not to follow the dicta in <em>Albain </em>that the plaintiff prove that he or she would have refused treatment had he or she known of the agency relationship. 50 Ohio St.3d at 264, 553 N.E.2d at 1050. This is the difference between the incremental development of the common law and judicial legislation. In a time of ever-increasing medical costs and potentially drastic changes to our health care system, this court would do well to take caution in its radical redistribution of liabilities for acts of medical malpractice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b665-7\">A.W.

My former colleague, Justice Ralph Locher, certainly said it right.

I say this because the precedent overturned today merely states that if a hospital employs an intern, resident or any other medical practitioner, it must answer in damages for their actions on the job. Conversely, if a doctor is working as an independent contractor within a hospital <em>and </em>the medical facility <em>does not hold itself out as that doctor\u2019s employer, </em>the hospital should not be joined in an action for malpractice against the doctor. Today, the majority rejects this precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">From this day on no malpractice action evolving out of an incident within a hospital will be brought without joining the medical facility as a co-defendant and this will include the costs of defense attendant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">In this period of burgeoning costs to the medical consumer the majority has surely taken a step backwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">I concur in the Chief Justice\u2019s commentary and vigorously dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-13\">.
