When the appellant does not attack the jurisdiction of the court, a writ of habeas corpus will be denied. R.C. 2725.05; <em>Stahl v. Shoemaker </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 351, 354, 4 O.O.3d 485, 487-488, 364 N.E.2d 286, 288. However, even if the court considers this petition as one for a writ of mandamus, the relief must still be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">R.C. 2967.15 requires the authority \u201cto make a determination of the case of the parolee alleged to be a violator of the conditions of his pardon or parole <em>within a reasonable time </em>\u201d or release him on parole. (Emphasis added.) Seebeck alleges he was entitled to a parole revocation hearing within sixty days of his arrest, since he is a technical parole violator. He bases his argument on the 1974 federal district court case of <em>Inmates\u2019 Councilmatic Voice v. Rogers </em>(Dec. 12, 1974), N.D. Ohio No. C72-1052, unreported. This case has been vacated, <em>Rogers v. Inmates\u2019 Councilmatic Voice </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 1031, 95 S.Ct. 2646, 45 L.Ed.2d 687; a new order issued on August 19, 1975; modified upon appeal on September 9, 1976, at 541 F.2d 633; and explained upon further appeal by intervenor plaintiffs in <em>Inmates\u2019 Councilmatic Voice v. Wilkinson </em>(Mar. 25, 1993), C.A.6, Nos. 92-3218 and 92-3275, unreported, 1993 WL 87431, table citation (1993), 989 F.2d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In <em>Inmates\u2019 Councilmatic Voice v. Wilkinson, </em>the court stated that all jurisdiction in the original <em>Inmates\u2019 Councilmatic Voice </em>case had terminated at least by 1981. With the status of the federal law unclear on the sixty-day rule, we hold that the standard to be used in Ohio is the reasonable time standard, developed in <em>Coleman v. Stobbs </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 137, 139, 23 OBR 292, 293, 491 N.E.2d 1126, 1128, and modified in <em>Flenoy v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 131, 134, 564 N.E.2d 1060, 1063-1064, and in <em>State ex rel. Taylor v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth. (1993), </em>66 Ohio St.3d 121, 127-128, 609 N.E.2d 546, 550-551.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\"><em>Coleman v. Stobbs </em>presented a two-part test for determining whether a delay of a parole revocation hearing by the Adult Parole Authority entitles an alleged parole violator to relief. First, the court must determine whether the delay was reasonable. \u201cThis involves the consideration and balancing of three factors: (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reasons for the delay, and (3) the alleged parole violator\u2019s assertion of his right to a hearing within a reasonable period of time.\u201d <em>Id., </em>23 Ohio St.3d at 139, 23 OBR at 293, 491 N.E.2d at 1128. Second, the court must determine whether the delay somehow prejudiced the alleged parole violator. The court identified three protected interests in this context:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\u201c(1) [Prevention of oppressive prehearing incarceration, (2) minimization of anxiety and concern of the alleged parole violator, and (3) limitation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>possibility that delay will impair the accused parole violator\u2019s defense at his final parole revocation hearing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Although the <em>Flenoy </em>case modified the <em>Coleman </em>test by placing the prejudice factor on the same plane as the reasonableness-of-time factor, we held in <em>Taylor </em>that, \u201cprejudice should ordinarily receive substantial emphasis because the remedy \u2014 outright release of a felon * * * is so drastic.\u201d 66 Ohio St.3d at 128, 609 N.E.2d at 551. Seebeck has shown neither unreasonable delay nor prejudice. Moreover, there is no \u201c60 day rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-8\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
