Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809: \u201cInsurers may contractually preclude intrafamily stacking \u2014 the stacking of uninsured/underinsured limits of polices and coverages purchased by family members in the same household. * * *\u201d <em>Savoie, supra, </em>paragraph two of syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Because this case involves the stacking of two insurance policies owned by two brothers, but the jurisdictional memoranda received by this court do not reveal whether the brothers lived in the same household, we remand the cause to the trial court to obtain the information from the parties which is necessary to properly apply the intrafamily/interfamily stacking test announced in <em>Savoie, supra, </em>and to apply <em>Savoie.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b314-10\">AW. Sweeney, Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b314-11\">Moyer, C.J., concurs separat\u00e9ly.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b314-12\">Wright, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b314-13\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AX5\">concurring separately. I concur separately in the judgment entry in the above-styled case. As my dissent in <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809, stated, I do not agree with the law announced in the majority decision. Nevertheless, it is the law on the issue in the above-styled case. As I believe all parties should receive equal application of the law announced by this court, and only for that reason, I concur in the judgment entry.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b314-14\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQt\">dissenting. I must dissent in continuing protest to the majority\u2019s sundry holdings in <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>N.E.2d 809. As stated in the dissent in <em>Savoie, </em>that holding lacks sound reasoning, reverses ten years of established case law and flouts the will of the General Assembly. Thus, I feel compelled to remain in this posture until the General Assembly has had the opportunity to undo the damage caused to the public by this unfortunate, result-oriented decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
