An abridged portion of appellee\u2019s Proposition of Law Number One in its motion follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAE6\">\u201c * * * [T]his Court\u2019s opinion went far beyond the briefs and arguments of counsel, making this case proper for rehearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-14\">\u201cIn paragraph 3 of this Court\u2019s syllabus, this Court held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-15\">\u201c[\u2018]An underinsurance claim must be paid when the individual covered by an uninsured/underinsured policy suffers damages that exceeds [sic] those monies available to be paid by the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carriers. <em>(Hill vs. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 243, 553 N.E.2d 658, overruled.)[']</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUV\">\u201cAppellee Motorists Mutual Insurance Company submits that paragraph 3 of the syllabus directly contravenes O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18(A)(2) which provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-16\">\u201c[\u2018]The limits of liability for an insurer providing underinsured motorist coverage shall be the limits of such coverage, less those amounts actually recovered under all applicable bodily injury [liability] bonds and insurance policies covering persons liable to the insured.]\u2019]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-17\">\u201cPursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18(A)(2), a direct set-off <em>[sic, </em>setoff] must be applied to the underinsured motorist coverage in order to establish the amount of underinsurance coverage available to the insured. As indicated by this Court in <em>James vs. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 386, 389 [18 OBR 440, 443, 481 N.E.2d 272, 274], underinsurance was created to cure the uninsured motorist loophole. However, underinsurance was not created to provide the insured with an excess insurance policy. In fact, this Court held in <em>James, supra </em>at 389 [18 OBR at 443, 481 N.E.2d at 274] that the plain meaning of the insurance policy and O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18 \u2018entitles the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>[insurer] to a set-off [sic] directly against the limits of its underinsured motorist coverage.\u2019 The decision of this Court as set forth in paragraph 3 of the syllabus is contrary to O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.-18(A)(2) in that insurers which provide underinsured motorist coverage which may be available in wrongful death cases are not entitled to a set off [sic] of payments made by the tortfeasor from available coverage, and are thus deemed excess insurers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZu\">\u201cIn addition, the Ohio General Assembly evaluated underinsured motorist coverage on several occasions before enacting the current statute. The analysis of that statute, as published by the Legislative Service Commission, describes the intent as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiK\">\u201c[\u2018]To make clear that the insurer is not liable to the insured for any amounts that would <em>duplicate the insured\u2019s actual recovery of amounts under insurance and bonds covering persons liable to the </em>insuredand also that the insurer is not liable for any amounts of damages sustained by the insured in excess of the limits of the underinsurance motorist coverage, (emphasis added)!\u2019]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At_\">\u201cThus, Motorists Mutual Insurance Company asserts that the holding of this Court is contrary to both the plain meaning of O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18 as well as the express intent of the General Assembly. Moreover, the specific words used in the statute must be construed according to their common usage and not interpreted to mean something other than specifically stated. O.R.C. \u00a7 1.42. Therefore, O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18(A)(2) can only be interpreted to require that an insurer providing underinsured motorist coverage is entitled to a direct set off [sic] from policy limits of all amounts recovered by the insured from the tortfeasor or the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3s\">\u201cAppellee Motorists Mutual Insurance Company respectfully requests a rehearing on this critical issue since this Court\u2019s decision as set forth in paragraph three of the syllabus is contrary to prior decisions of this Court and, more importantly, the intent of the General Assembly as espoused in O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18(A)(2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am3\">Appellee\u2019s abridged statement under its Proposition of Law Number Two reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATQS\">\u201c * * * [T]his Court has repeatedly held that any policy language contrary to [O.R.C.] \u00a7 3937.18 violates public policy. <em>Ady </em>vs. <em>West American Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 593 [23 O.O.3d 495, 433 N.E.2d 547], syllabus. Likewise, insurance policies with language which comport [sic] with O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18 must be deemed appropriate and valid. However, this Court\u2019s decision herein, as set forth in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the syllabus, directly contravenes O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18 and prior decisions- of this Court which were not expressly overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acjj\">\u201cParagraph 1 of the syllabus, which prohibits the limitation of wrongful death claims to the \u2018per person\u2019 policy limit, is contrary to the general premise that insurers and private persons may enter into [a] contract. Moreover, O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18 does not prohibit such limitations of coverage even though the statute does prohibit certain other policy restrictions (i.e., reduction in coverage amounts because of worker\u2019s [sic] compensation benefits).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWv\">\u201cIn addition, as discussed earlier, [O.R.C.] \u00a7 3937.18(A)(2) permits the set-off [sic] of payments made by the tortfeasor from the coverage available pursuant to an underinsured motorist policy. Paragraph 3 of the syllabus in the case herein is contrary to that specific statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANn\">\u201cMoreover, this Court\u2019s holding with respect to interfamily stacking and the alleged narrow construction of O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18(G) is clearly an invasion into the province of the General Assembly. In fact, the anti-stacking language provided in O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18 was included in the uninsured motorist statute in June, 1980 in response to this Court\u2019s repeated opinions that \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses were repugnant to the public policy and O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18. <em>Curran vs. State Automobile Ins. Co. </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.3d[2d] 33 [54 O.O.2d 166, 266 N.E.2d 566],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1L\">\u201cIn <em>Karabin vs. State Automobile Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 163 [10 OBR 497, 462 N.E.2d 403], this Court discussed the initial amendment to [O.R.C.] \u00a7 3937.18(E), and determined that this section \u2018provides a specific modification[,] permitting insurers to confine their liability to the limits of a single policy.\u2019 <em>Karabin, supra </em>at 165 [10 OBR at 499, 462 N.E.2d at 405-406]. Most important, however, was this Court\u2019s interpretation of the anti-stacking language within [O.R.C.] \u00a7 3937.18(E) and this Court\u2019s conclusion that the legislative intent was clear and that the statute itself was unambiguous. <em>Karabin, supra </em>at 166 [10 OBR at 499, 462 N.E.2d at 406].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af0\">\u201cWithin the case <em>sub judice, </em>this Court completely ignores its prior interpretations of this statute and has single-handedly altered the legislative intent. Indeed, [O.R.C.] \u00a7 3937.18(G) was authored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>by the General Assembly in direct response to this Court\u2019s conclusion that anti-stacking language was contrary to public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APz\">\u201cMotorists Mutual Insurance Company asserts that the anti-stacking provisions in insurance policies which are based upon O.R.C. \u00a7 3937.18(G) are consistent with the intent of the General Assembly and cannot be invalidated absent an amendment to the statute. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
