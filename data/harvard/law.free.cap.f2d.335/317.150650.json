BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b367-22\">This case presents for review the propriety of the District Judge\u2019s granting of Insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment in a suit by the widow of the Assured as administratrix of the Assured\u2019s estate to establish the Insurer\u2019s liability for failure to defend suits by third parties against the estate. The facts are these.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-23\">On July 3, 1958, the named Assured<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was involved in an automobile accident in Orange County, Florida. The automobile specifically covered by the policy was totally demolished. The Assured was killed and other persons were killed and injured. These other persons, some individually and others through the personal representatives of their estates, subsequently instituted actions in the Florida State Courts. These suits were brought against \u201cLola J. Burton as ad-ministratrix of the estate of William C. Burton, deceased.\u201d Through counsel she notified the Insurer of the actions and fully complied with all the related policy conditions requiring transmittal to the Insurer of pleadings, correspondence and the like. But the Insurer refused to come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>in and defend. Judgments totaling some $160,000 were entered on March 26,1962, against \u201cLola J. Burton as Administra-trix of\u201d Assured\u2019s estate. The Insurer refused to pay the judgments, and this action in the Federal District Court resulted. The Federal suit was brought by \u201cLola Burton, administratrix of the estate of William C. Burton, deceased.\u201d The complaint plainly asserted a claim for damages totaling $200,000 allegedly arising out of the Insurer\u2019s refusal to defend the third-party actions and pay the State Court judgments which resulted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Included in that figure were claims for attorneys\u2019 fees in defense of the State Court third-party suits and in prosecution of this Federal Court suit, and for costs and interest. The District Judge, was apparently convinced that it was a case of all or nothing and if the relief prayed for in the complaint could not now be granted, there was no alternative but to grant the Insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. He therefore entered judgment for the Insurer denying recovery on all claims except the one for damage to the automobile. This was done on the ground that the widow, \u201cLola Burton, administratrix of the estate of William C. Burton, deceased,\u201d although sued as such was not the duly appointed and legally qualified administratrix of the Assured\u2019s estate at the time the State Court third-party suits were instituted and when the judgments in those suits were entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The unsuccessful complainant appeals, asserting two things primarily as a basis for reversal. The first is that her subsequent valid appointment as administra-trix on December 20, 1962, relates back to validate the judgments entered March 26, 1962, in the State Court third-party suits against her in her representative capacity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second is that the effect of the District Judge\u2019s ruling is to sustain an impermissible collateral attack on the judgments in the third-party suits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\"> In view of our disposition of the case we need not now decide these questions. The District Judge apparently thought that the pleadings limited the scope of available relief, and if that formally sought was not allowable none could be granted. This is not the law. As we have many times said, except in the case of a default judgment, the Court is bound to grant whatever relief the facts show is necessary or appropriate. F.R.Civ.P. 54(c); Smoot v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 299 F.2d 525; Arthur H. Richland Co. v. Harper, 5 Cir., 1962, 302 F.2d 324; Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen v. Central of Georgia Ry. Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 605; Shull v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 445. To grant summary judgment dismissing the whole main ease could be sustained, not by showing that the relief prayed for was not available, but rather that there was no genuine issue of fact on which <em>any </em>kind or type of relief, complete, final, contingent or interim, could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">The case was decided below and argued here as though this was a suit on the State Court judgments. On that ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>proach the arguments assumed that the crucial thing at stake was the validity of these State Court judgments. The case is a long way from that point. The important thing at this stage is the nature and scope of the Insurer\u2019s duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The policy contained the traditional defense coverage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we have said before, the obligation of the Company under this standard provision<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is distinct and separate. American Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. v. Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 453; National Surety Corp. v. Wells, 5 Cir., 1961, 287 F.2d 102.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As we indicated in the American Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company case, it is distinct and separate \u201cin the sense that the duty to defend does not depend upon the payment to a damage claimant or the rendition of a judgment declaring the assured\u2019s legal obligation to pay.\u201d 280 F.2d 453, at 458. When rightly considered and construed, \u201c[t]he effect of the policy is that the insurer undertakes to defend claims of the type for which it would have to make payment.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">On that approach what is the test for determining whether the claim is \u201cof the type for which [the Insurer] would have to make payment\u201d? Does the duty to defend depend on the facts ultimately established in the damage suit? Or does it ordinarily depend on what the third party claimant contends ?</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">For us the moving hand of Florida makes the Erie choice here simple and inescapable. Aligning Florida with the majority a late, if not the latest, writing Court, Ford Motor Co. v. Mathis, 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 267, 269, spells it out plainly.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-13\">\u201cThe rule seems established everywhere that a public liability carrier\u2019s duty to defend the insured in an action brought against him-is to be determined from the allegations of the complaint, declaration, or other statement of the cause of action, filed in such action against the insured. See New Amsterdam Casualty Company v. Knowles, Fla.1957, 95 So.2d 413, and the annotation in 50 A.L.R.2d 465, page 504.\u201d Bennett v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., Fla.Ct. App.1961, 132 So.2d 788.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">See the comprehensive discussion in 7A Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4682 (1962); and the full treatment of the subject by Judge Pope in The Travelers Indemnity Co. v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 9 Cir., 1964, 330 F.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">The comment in III Risjord &amp; Austin, Automobile Liability Insurance Cases, case 3112,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> disagreeing with a decision which in effect determined the duty to defend on what was finally ascertained to be the true facts after the defense was all over, puts it well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-16\">\u201cIf the petition stated a cause of action against [the Assured], we think that the insurer was obligated to defend [him], whatever the true facts may have been.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">Did the complaint state a cause of action against the Assured? If so, what is the remedy for the Company\u2019s breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of its \u201cabsolute duty\u201d? National Surety Corp. v. Wells, 5 Cir., 1961, 287 F.2d 102, 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Under the policy, the Company undertook</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\u201c(1) <em>To </em>pay all damages which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay because\u201d of (A) personal injuries (death) and (B) property damage \u201ccaused by accident arising out of ownership, maintenance or use, * * * of the automobile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">There is no question about the State Court suits being against the \u201cinsured.\u201d The policy definitions state \u201cunder coverages A [personal injury], B [property damage] * * * the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes (1) the named insured * * <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> William C. Burton, husband of Appellant here, was the named insured. He was the owner and driver of the \u201cprivate passenger automobile * * described in the [policy] declarations,\u201d and this was the automobile involved in the accident which resulted in the State Court suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">More important, the broad definition of \u201cInsured,\u201d note 9, supra, extends coverage for personal injury and property damage claims to \u201c(4) * * any person or organization legally responsible for the use thereof by an <em>insured </em>as defined under the three subsections above.\u201d When this is read with the balance of the policy, and particularly the provisions respecting notice of an accident or likely claim,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it is obvious that the policy covers, and was clearly intended to cover (1) the named Assured and, in the event of his death (2) his estate or personal representatives against whom claims surviving under applicable law may be collected or recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-17\">These State Court third-party suits on their face showed that three things were presented: (1) the negligent operation of the described insured automobile, (2) negligent operation thereof by the named Assured causing the damages sought, and (3) the death of the named Assured and the asserted existence of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-19\">Thus the third-party suits charged as plainly as words can a claim for which the Assured would be liable if proved. And, of course, the Insurer knew of those suits. It is uncontradicted on this record that the Insurer received copies of every pleading, motion or other document filed in each of the State Court suits. It is also uncontradicted that the widow complied with all policy conditions relating to notice, cooperation with the Insurer and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-20\">It is difficult to comprehend the position of the Insurer. With notice of the accident and the pendency of suits which on the face of the complaints charged a case for liability of the Assured, the Insurer stood mute. It refused to defend, or presumably to budge or even so much as speak. Whether this was the reason, or whether counsel now hard pressed to rationalize the strange result so far reached have simply advanced it as the best way out,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Insurer\u2019s justification seems to be this. The suits purported to be brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>against the administratrix of the estate, but the Insurer knew better since no valid appointment had ever been made. Moving at this point to a mighty (and mighty quick) climax, the Insurer\u2019s argument then proceeds, therefore it is no suit at all because it is brought against a party who does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"> While this is a pretty and beguiling theory, it is in essence the tired, weary and universally rejected notion that the duty to defend extends only to meritorious suits. But at this late date, it should now be clear that the duty of defense has nothing at all to do with whether the suits are intrinsically meritorious or not. American Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. v. Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 453, 458. Indeed, if suits are brought against the wrong party or in the wrong court, or if necessary parties are missing, it is to Insurer\u2019s advantage to come in and defend knowing all the while that liability cannot be maintained in that suit and hoping against hope that the statute of limitations will run or other impedients will arise before a proper suit is instituted. A pleading that is demurrable (under the old concepts) or one subject to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, F.R. Civ.P. 12(b), if it otherwise describes an occurrence within the coverage imposes on the Insurer at least the duty to supply the defense of filing the demurrer or motion. And, knowledge by the Insurer that the wrong party has been sued is not different from knowledge that the liability facts are different than alleged in the third-party suits. Yet clearly in the latter instance the duty to defend is positive. Indeed, the duty to defend encompasses the duty of honorably bringing forward whatever defense will exonerate the Assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Since the asserted filing of the third-party suits against the wrong (or nonexistent) party goes only to the merits and not the duty to defend, the Insurer may not drag this in through the back door by claiming it got no notice. Of course it had notice. It cannot in fact deny this. But by metaphysical dialectic it says that what its files revealed it did not in law know because the party sending the materials, i. e., the notice, did not exist. But this is confusing duty to defend with notice of claim, and on that the record is all one way.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The upshot is that there is here a clear case of breach of the Company\u2019s duty to defend.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But to say that there was such a breach is a long way from declaring that this necessarily means that the Insurer is now liable for the State Court judgments or that such judgments are even valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The duty to defend is not the duty to pay, although a consequence of a failure to defend is often an obligation to pay. But that depends on there being valid judgments against the assured. Perhaps this is just a way of saying that the duty to defend is not only distinct and separate, but it is continuous until satisfied. The situation here, therefore, is one in which this continuing duty to defend takes on a different form. Failure to defend initially has resulted in outstanding judgments. So long as these are still outstanding, it is impossible to go back of them to assert nonliability. But if, under applicable Florida law, these judgments are not valid, then the duty to defend now comprehends the obligation of taking all available steps to set aside such judgments or otherwise have them declared to be of no legal effect against the estate of the deceased Assured or the validly appointed administratrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>It was at this point that the Judge fell \u2014 indeed may have been pulled \u2014into error from the misconception by all parties of the nature of this suit at this stage. It is not for the Federal Court in this case to determine whether the State Court judgments are valid, enforceable or not.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor was it open for the Federal Court in this suit to determine whether some judicial mechanism is now available in the Florida Courts to test the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">The predicament of the Insurer may be summed up in this way: either pay the judgments<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or get them judicially invalidated or set aside. The predicament is its own, flowing as it did from the bold, and legally impermissible, course of ignoring \u2014 as though it did not even exist \u2014 the State Court suits which presented matters within the coverage, Its present duty to take action to obliterate the State Court judgments is in no way lessened by the fact that so far the judgments have not been paid by the Estate. Where defense has been erroneously denied, the judgment need not first be paid to permit direct recovery or some other suitable relief from the Insurer, Although we could see a cloud of uncertainty in 1957, Dotschay v. National Mut. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1957, 246 F.2d 221, the recent decisions in National Mut. Ins. Co. v. Dotschay, Fla.D.Ct.App., 1961, 134 So. 2d 248; American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Davis, Fla.D.Ct.App., 1962, 146 So.2d 615, make the Erie horizon clear for us. By them Florida adopts the almost universal principle that the Assured need not sacrifice his credit, his substance, his assets by first paying the judgments as a condition precedent to suit against his defaulting Insurer. Smoot v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 299 F.2d 525, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"A2ly\">The record therefore establishes as a matter of law that the Insurer had the duty to aet. it did not. It now has a duty to act, and since it declines to do S0) it is essential that a suitable remedy t&gt;e fashioned by the Federal Court to secure compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"A7W\">What seems to have troubled the District Judge, and presumably the Insurer, was a feeling that some kind of order had to be entered which disposed of the whole case now, once and for all. But the Federal Court is not so rigidly bound. Relief to be granted depends not on the prayer, but on what the facts\u2014 either found by a trier or established as a matter of law \u2014 reasonably requires, F. R.Civ.P. 54(c). And there is like flexibility in the operative terms of any decree or judgment. Thus, where things depend on the outcome of litigation elsewhere, or future developments as to controlling substantive or procedural law, the Federal Court has the power \u2014 and the duty where appropriate \u2014 -to enter a conditional order or decree. Smoot v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 299 F.2d 525; Travelers Ins. Co. v. Busy Elec. Co., 5 Cir., 1961, 294 F.2d 139, at 145; Sax v. Sax, 5 Cir., 1961, 294 F.2d 133,139; Dotschay v. National Mut. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1957, 246 F.2d 221. Thus, the Court by taking full advantage of the elasticity of declaratory orders, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2201, may mold a decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>which protects all parties, but which assures compliance by the Insurer with all of its obligations depending on ultimate developments as to these State Court judgments. The order would first declare a duty to defend and a prior breach of that duty. It could then provide that the Insurer pay the judgments (or appropriate part thereof, see note 14, supra) unless by appropriate proceedings it obtains judicial determination which is fully effective to protect the Assured, the Assured\u2019s Estate and the Adminis-tratrix. Under such an order the Insurer might not ever have to pay out a cent on the judgments. But in so doing (at its expense), it would be supplying the defense \u2014 even though belatedly\u2014 which it contracted to furnish. On the other hand, to now deny relief outright to the Assured on the supposition (or holding) that the State Court judgments are void, invalid, wholly unenforceable leaves the Assured exposed to substantial perils from which there can be no escape once the Federal Court judgment below becomes final to constitute a <em>res judicata </em>bar. For example, the decree below would not bind the judgment creditors, nor would it exonerate the Estate. Proceedings by the judgment creditors might well result in a Florida decision that the judgments are enforceable. But it would then be too late to compel the Insurer to make good on its promise to defend. If, on the other hand, the State Court judgments are as defective as urged, there will be no difficulty in the Insurer, for and on behalf of, and probably in the name of, its Assured having the judgments declared of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">These considerations show why on the record as of the time of the order appealed from, the Court below had the duty of retaining the case, not dismissing it outright, for the entry of appropriate orders, conditional, contingent, or otherwise, to make certain that the rights of all \u2014 Insurer and Assured \u2014 were preserved and enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">For reasons which are apparent from a consideration of all of these factors, it is plain that we do not, we could not, blueprint the exact nature of the proceedings on remand or the relief to be granted. But to remedy the breach of the unconditional contractual obligation to defend, United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Russom, 5 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 296, 301, the District Court must mold and enter an appropriate decree or decrees.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Summary judgment on this phase of the case was therefore improper, and we consequently reverse for further and not inconsistent proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-24\">.

It is too early to even intimate the dollar limits \u2014 the full amount of the judgments? Or up to the face amount ($50.-000/$100,000) of the policy?
