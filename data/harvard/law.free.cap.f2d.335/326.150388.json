The milk was transported by Stonehouse, a Chicago hauling contractor, in tank-trucks driven by eight members of Local 753 to Wanzer\u2019s Chicago plant. Early in 1962, while Wanzer and PMA were negotiating a new contract for the sale of milk to Wanzer, f. o. b. Wanzer\u2019s Chicago plant, Wanzer terminated its hauling contract with Stonehouse. PMA and Wanzer made their agreement effective May 15, 1962, and PMA made a related agreement with Quality Carriers, a Wisconsin hauling contractor, to haul the milk to Chicago. Quality\u2019s drivers were members of Local 43, a Wisconsin union, an affiliate, with Local 753, of the same International.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-24\">Local 753 interpreted Wanzer\u2019s action as a reduction of the \u201ctransportation division\u201d in violation of Article 44 of the collective bargaining agreement, and demanded that Wanzer have its milk transported by members of Local 753, whether through Stonehouse, another independent contract hauler, or by Wanzer employees. Wanzer responded with compromise offers to the Union, PMA and Quality, without success. And strike threats made previously grew into a strike which was enjoined by the district court upon complaint of the Board\u2019s General Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-25\">The Trial Examiner found that Wan-zer and Stonehouse were co-employers of the eight Local 753 members displaced by the termination of Stonehouse\u2019s haul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ing contract, and that Wanzer\u2019s action was a reduction of its \u201ctransportation division\u201d in violation of Article 44 which he found to be a \u201cwork preemption\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"Aay\">The Board, while adopting most of the Examiner\u2019s fact findings, did not deem it necessary to decide whether Stone-house and Wanzer were co-employers or separate entities. It found that one of the objects of the Union\u2019s broadened interpretation of Article 44 was to prevent Wanzer from contracting out the hauling except to an employer whose employees were Local 753 members; that such a contract condition is violative of \u00a7 8(e) of the Act; and that by threatening to strike, and by striking, to compel Wanzer to enter into an agreement proscribed by \u00a7 8(e), the Union committed an unfair labor practice in violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (A) of the Act. The Board also found that a \u201cfurther object\u201d of the Union\u2019s action was to compel Wanzer to disrupt an existing business relationship with PMA because it had engaged Quality, whose drivers did not belong to Local 753, to haul milk to Wanzer\u2019s Chicago plant; and that this attempt to disrupt an existing business relationship is a \u201ccease doing business\u201d object within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">There is no credibility question which prevented the Board from making findings different from those of the Examiner on the evidence that is not in conflict. Our function, therefore, is limited to determining whether the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We think the Board was justified in deciding that the Union\u2019s conduct following their demands under their \u201cbroadened interpretation\u201d of Article 44 constituted unfair labor practices; and that the Union threatened to, and did, strike, because Wanzer could not, or would not, continue to have the eight displaced Union men drive the tank-trucks hauling the milk. The Board could also reasonably infer that to accede to the Union demands would be forcing Wanzer to disrupt, or cease, a business relationship with PMA; that the Union knew or should have known that this would be a necessary result of the demands; that accordingly the Union\u2019s conduct was unlawful under \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (B); and that in striking to enforce Article 44, as interpreted by it, the Union was forcing Wanzer to condition whatever means were to be used to transport the milk on employment of Local 753 members, an unfair labor practice under \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) and (ii) (A). District No. 9, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. N. L. R. B., 114 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 315 F.2d. 33 (1962). We are unable to say these inferences are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Neither can we say that, on those findings, the Board could not reasonably conclude that one of the objects of the Union\u2019s conduct was to force a disruption of the business relationship among Wanzer, PMA and Quality. N. L. R. B. v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, 341 U.S. 675, 688, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284 (1951). Less than a total cessation of an existing business relationship is within the meaning of \u201ccease doing business\u201d in \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B). Local 3, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 140 N.L.R.B. 729, 730 (1963), enforced, 325 F.2d 561 (2d Cir. 1963). The inference is warranted that the Union, virtually, exerted pressure on Wanzer to break its contract with PMA that the milk be delivered f. o. b. Chicago unless Quality\u2019s drivers were members of Local 753. It follows that we must disagree with the Union\u2019s contention that it had not committed an unfair labor practice because it was not asking Wanzer to cease doing business with anybody, not asking Wanzer to buy milk from anybody but PMA at any time, but only asking Wanzer to live up to its agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The conclusion is not erroneous that the Union\u2019s interpretation of Article 44 would be an activity secondary in nature and within the proscription of \u00a7 8(e). Bakery Wagon Drivers Union v. NLRB, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 87, 321 F.2d 353 (1963), District No. 9, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. NLRB, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 315 F.2d 33 (1962), Los Angeles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Mailers Union v. NLRB, 114 U.S.App. D.C. 72, 311 F.2d 121, 124 (1962). The Union contends that Article 44 is a valid \u201cwork preemption\u201d agreement which it had the right to demand and enforce. However, it is the Union\u2019s broadened interpretation of Article 44, conditioning, while not forbidding, Wanzer\u2019s right to subcontract, and not Article 44 literally, which the Board found unlawful. And if Article 44 had the meaning contended for by the Union, in itself it would be prohibited under \u00a7 8(e), and any attempt to have it enforced by the Union would have constituted an attempt to \u201center into\u201d it within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (A). District No. 9, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. NLRB, 114 U.S. App.D.C. 287, 315 F.2d 33, 35 (1962), Los Angeles Mailers Union v. NLRB, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 72, 311 F.2d 121, 123-24 (1962). There is no merit therefore in the Union\u2019s contentions that it was unconcerned about Wanzer\u2019s business with PMA, that its objective was the lawful one of keeping its members in jobs, and that it was only trying to have Wanzer perform its obligations under Article 44. It is well settled that one unlawful object is sufficient for a finding that \u00a7 8(b) (4) has been violated, although there might be other lawful objects. NLRB v. Denver Bldg. <em>&amp; </em>Constr. Trades Council, 341 U.S. 675, 689, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The record as we decide gives substantial support to the Board\u2019s findings of the Union\u2019s unlawful objectives \u2014 to forbid contracting out of hauling except to employers whose employees were members of Local 753, and to compel Wanzer to disrupt an existing business relationship with PMA because Quality\u2019s drivers were not members of Local 753. We cannot say therefore that the Board should have decided whether Wanzer and Stonehouse were co-employers; or should have considered the Union\u2019s contentions that Wanzer was, in effect, a \u201cprimary employer\u201d within the meaning of the proviso to \u00a7 8(b) (4) (B), or an \u201cally\u201d with Stonehouse. The substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s eonclusion that the Union exerted pressure on Wanzer to force it to disrupt an existing business relationship with PMA unless Quality employed drivers who were members of Local 753 distinguishes NLRB v. Local 825, Int\u2019l Union of Operating Engineers, 326 F.2d 218 (3d Cir. 1963), and justifies the inference that the pressure was exerted \u201cfor reasons not strictly germane to the economic integrity of the principal work unit,\u201d District No. 9, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. NLRB, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 315 F.2d 33, 36 (1962), and constituted a secondary activity outlawed by \u00a7 8(b) (4) (i) and (\u00fc) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">For the reasons given, the petition to enforce the order is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-23\">.
