The defendant denied liability and, in turn, filed a Third-Party Complaint against Chesapeake Operating Company, the stevedore employer of the plaintiff, which complaint was dismissed prior to the trial had before the court without a jury. The court found neither unseaworthiness nor negligence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and entered judgment for defendant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Plaintiff was regularly a bulldozer operator and was so engaged until shortly before the accident. He went .to work with fellow longshoremen at eight o\u2019clock in the morning and started to unload ore from the \u201cafter deep tanks\u201d of the vessel\u2019s No. 4 hatch. Discharge of the cargo was accomplished by use of a \u201cgrab bucket\u201d owned and furnished by the stevedore which was attached to the ship\u2019s gear. Its movements controlled by the ship\u2019s winches, the bucket grabbed the ore and lifted it through the hatch, depositing it in railroad cars on the pier. During the early stages of the work the bucket was allowed to fall free into the hold. However, as unloading progressed it was necessary to position the bucket at various points around the square of the hatch and, in this operation, hooks or blocks were placed at the forward and after ends of the hatch coaming. The bucket was lowered to a position in the center of the hatch just above or on the shaft alley by means of the \u201cup and down fall\u201d which was controlled by a winch on deck. Another fall, called the \u201cburden fall,\u201d which was slack, was placed in the hook and was controlled by a second winch operated by longshoreman Clarence Dates. A strain was then taken on the burden fall while the up and down fall was slacked off. By this means the bucket was pulled to a position directly beneath the hook through which ran the burden fall and over piles of ore.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s usual job.was to operate a. small bulldozer to push the ore from the-wings and far sections of the hold into' piles within reach of the grab bucket when falling free or when pulled forward or aft in the maneuver described. It is apparently undisputed that at least two of the stevedore\u2019s bulldozers had broken down during operations on that particular day and had to be removed. A third was brought into the hold and there was testimony to the effect that about one hour before the accident its use was discontinued because the clutch was slipping and plaintiff was instructed by his foreman to move the bulldozer to the wings and out of the way. The stevedores then used shovels to get the ore which was close to the \u201cskin\u201d of the tank, between the ribs, in the bilge pockets and close areas in position to be grabbed by the bucket. However, other testimony showed that, at the time the use of the last bulldozer was discontinued, it was not inoperable but the quantity of ore in the-hold was so low and so positioned that, the use of the bulldozer was impracticable. After the shoveling was begun the-longshoremen, including plaintiff, pushed or guided the grab bucket with their hands to spot it over various piles of ore.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Immediately prior to the accident they were using the hook on the aft side of the hatch coaming to spot the bucket and four men in the hold were pushing or guiding. Lambert, the stevedore foreman, was at the forward end of the-bucket. Next to him, on the same side- and only about a foot away, was Burgess. Two other men were on the port side of' the bucket. The four would push or guide the bucket over a pile of ore at which time Lambert would yell \u201cback on it\u201d to Downing, the stevedore \u201cgang carrier,\u201d who was on deck. This was the signal for the bucket to be lowered into-the ore and for the men around the bucket, to get out of the way. Downing would immediately relay this signal to winch-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>man Dates who would then ease off on the winch controlling the burden fall, thereby lowering the bucket. The position of Dates\u2019 winch prevented him from seeing or hearing Lambert. The accident occurred when the bucket dropped and landed on Burgess\u2019 foot, causing .serious injury. Plaintiff testified that he did not hear Lambert\u2019s signal to drop the bucket although it was heard by the other men guiding the bucket and by Downing who was on deck. Lambert testified that he warned all hands, including Burgess, to be careful. The District Court observed that, after the pushing or guiding operation was begun, there had been \u201cfrom seven to thirty hoists before the accident occurred; testimony varied that much.\u201d It seems clear, however, that the accident happened within forty-five minutes to an hour after the use of the bulldozer was discontinued. There was no difference between the operation in the course of which Burgess was injured and the previous manual bucket-guiding operations; when the bucket was properly spotted, Lambert signaled to Downing who passed the signal to Dates who, in turn, promptly lowered the bucket. Unfortunately, however, the bucket landed on Burgess\u2019 foot on this particular occasion. Following the accident the longshoremen continued to follow the same procedure until the discharge of the ore was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">Plaintiff contended at trial that the failure of the ship\u2019s crew to provide a proper amount of illumination in the hold rendered the ship unsafe and unseaworthy. But the District Court found as a fact, from a preponderance of the evidence, that the lighting was adequate and noted that \u201cBurgess himself testified that the lighting was adequate for his purpose of bulldozing the ore, as well as guiding the bucket.\u201d (215 F.Supp. 319, 323). This finding is amply supported by the evidence. Except as to alleged inadequate lighting, it is uncontroverted that all of the gear and equipment furnished by the ship was in perfect working condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">The \u201ctop man\u201d aboard for plaintiff\u2019s employer was supervisor Henry Thompson. The stevedores had complete control of the discharging operation and they selected the method used. Both Chief Mate Daly and Frank DiVenti, the latter being the only mate on watch at the time of the accident, had occasionally observed the discharging operations but neither of them saw or knew that the stevedores were pushing or guiding the bucket.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\"> It must be borne in mind that this was a trial before the court sitting as the trier of fact without a jury. It is well established that a Court of Appeals may not set aside findings of fact made by the District Court in Admiralty unless they are \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d for no greater scope of review is exercised by appellate tribunals in admiralty cases than exercised by them under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A finding of fact is clearly erroneous only when \u201calthough there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d 2<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Plaintiff challenges as clearly erroneous the finding below that \u201chandling the bucket in the manner indicated was customary and proper under the circumstances\u201d because the evidence, upon which the court based its findings as stated in its opinion, is inconsistent with the evidence in the case, and also \u201cbecause the court based its finding upon improper interpretation of evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">In his brief plaintiff contends \u201cthat the court erred in not making a finding of fact on the point of whether the bucket was guided or shoved at the time of the happening of the accident and should have found that the bucket was being shoved at the time of the happening of the accident and that the shoving of the bucket was an unsafe procedure.\u201d In view of the findings of fact, which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>overwhelmingly supported by the evidence, we ai'e at a loss to understand this contention. In the second paragraph of the District Court\u2019s reported opinion (215 F.Supp. 319, 320), it is unequivocally stated that the incident occurred while Burgess was <em>guiding </em>or <em>pushing </em>a grab bucket along with other employees of the stevedoring firm. Again, at page 321, the court stated as a fact that, when Burgess was injured, he and two other stevedores were assisting Lambert in <em>pushing </em>the bucket into position over the ore. The plaintiff\u2019s statement is all the more unintelligible since there appears to be no conflict whatsoever in the evidence as to the manner in which the bucket was being handled. Burgess did deny knowledge of the giving of a signal to lower or drop the bucket, but on that point the court found that it was agreed by everyone save Burgess that Lambert signaled Downing on deck, who passed the word to the winehman.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Thus, our first problem is to interpret this assertion of ei*ror. We think the thrust of plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the shoving of the bucket was <em>cm unsafe procedure </em>and the trial court should have so held in those words rather than finding that pushing or shoving the bucket in position to pick up the ore was \u201ccustomary and proper under the circumstances.\u201d However, from the court\u2019s reported opinion, considered as a whole, it is apparent the actual finding was intended as the equivalent of a finding that the procedure followed was reasonably safe and not unusually or unreasonably dangerous in ore discharging operations. Such finding was amply supported even though there are conflicts in the evidence on which it was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Downing, the gang carrier and plaintiff\u2019s lead witness, attempted to create the inference that the procedure used was. unsafe but it was clearly demonstrated that' his opinion derived entirely from the fact that the plaintiff was injured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He-said he had seen that same method used before and the men continued to use it after the accident. Although he was the gang carrier and responsible for the safety of his men, he did nothing to prevent them from using this procedure which fact strongly tends to support an inference that he considered the method of discharging reasonably safe and proper. Three other longshoremen testified that they did not consider it' to be a safe operation to unload ore by pushing or shoving a bucket as was done in this case. Plaintiff contends that Daly, the Chief Mate, testified that the procedure was unsafe but his statements, called to\u2019 our attention and selected out of context by plaintiff, were qualified in his further testimony when he stated that he didn\u2019t, see the men pushing the bucket, he didn\u2019t, know \u201cwhat they were doing in pushing-it\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I would consider it safe or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Ford Mercer, an expert ship\u2019s surveyor and marine consultant of at least twelve years\u2019 experience who was called by the defendant, explained that the bucket must, be guided at times in order to spot it over the largest piles of ore so that a \u201cfull, grab\u201d can be assured as often as possible-He had observed as many as two hundred ore-discharging operations in a single: year. He testified that it was a routine-operation to push or guide the bucket in-the manner adopted by the stevedores; that he had seen it done \u201cfrequently\u201d and \u201chundreds of times\u201d; and that the pushing method was not restricted to ore; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>operations but was used also in connection with general cargo. He did not regard the method of discharge here used as unreasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Thompson, the supervisor for plaintiff\u2019s employer, with about eight years\u2019 experience in that job, personally observed the men pushing the bucket. He testified that there was nothing at all unusual about pushing or guiding the bucket by hand and that he had seen buckets pushed in a similar manner \u201cever since I have been with the company in the business * * *.<em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Lambert, a foreman for plaintiff\u2019s employer, with about twenty years\u2019 experience on the waterfront, was actually pushing the bucket along with plaintiff and two others. He also testified that the usual method of discharge was being used and that it was a customary procedure to push or guide the bucket as was done here. As appears from the record, plaintiff\u2019s own counsel, in addressing the court, said: \u201cThe testimony of the foreman for the company was that he considered it safe procedure at this time, your Honor, that he had seen it done since then * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">It is true that witness Mercer testified that it would have been safer for the longshoremen to have pushed the bucket into position with the bulldozer than to push it by hand. This was in response to .a purely abstract and hypothetical question posed on cross-examination but there was no evidence in the ease that the longshoremen ever actually pushed this bucket by using the bulldozer or even contemplated such a procedure. Furthermore, there is no evidence that such a method \u2022of operation is ever used with this type \u2022of bucket which was described as the lightest type used in discharging ore. Responding to questioning, Mercer explained that the operator was positioned back of a wide steel blade on the bulldozer which would contact the bucket in a pushing operation and that if he, Mercer, were doing this type work he would rather see a bucket pushed by a bulldozer than to push it himself. He further commented on the type of the vessel, the deep tanks of the cargo \"hold, the small compartments \u201cwhere they don\u2019t have a large working area.\u201d The following questions and answers appear in the transcript of his testimony on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-12\">\u201cQ. Mr. Mercer, it would have been a lot saf er if it was necessary to push the bucket to push it with the bulldozer in this case also, wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-13\">\u201cA. I imagine it would, yes, sir, but a bulldozer has a wide steel blade and the operator sits pretty far back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-14\">\u201cQ. And then there would not have been any men exposed to danger around the bucket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-15\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct, if there was enough room where the bulldozer had room to maneuver the bucket where they wanted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">Roberts, a witness for the plaintiff, testified that he was one of the men engaged in pushing the bucket and that this was an unsafe procedure, but grave doubt was cast upon the reliability of his testimony since the stevedore\u2019s records showed that he did not work on the AFRICAN DAWN on the date of the accident and had not been paid for such work.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">It was the function of the trial court to weigh and appraise all of the conflicting testimony. This the court did, and it is apparent that the testimony of the defendant\u2019s witnesses was accepted and believed, while the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses was rejected. The court had the opportunity to observe the demeanor and attitude of the witnesses who testified in open court and, having the flavor of the trial, was in the best position to determine their credibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. requires that due regard \u201cbe given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Illustrative of the reason for the court\u2019s rejection of Downing\u2019s testimony, defendant points to the fact that Downing testified at trial that he thought the lights in the hold were bad but, in a prior signed statement given to an investigator, he had stated that the lights were good. The court found as a fact that the lights were adequate, commenting specifically on the inconsistency of Downing\u2019s position. Downing further testified that the bulldozer had broken down. However, in a recorded interview prior to trial, Downing had stated that the bulldozer had not broken down but had been put to one side because the unloading had proceeded to a point where its use was no longer practicable. The court stated in its opinion that' the \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d showed that the discharging had reached a point where use of the bulldozer was not feasible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court further stated that it was \u201cimpelling\u201d to find that the bulldozer was not defective although a determination of the point was not necessary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Obviously, the court did not credit the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses on the question of the safety of the discharge procedure any more than it believed their testimony as to inadequate lighting in the hold and the alleged breakdown of the bulldozer. A factor to be considered is that the witnesses who testified that the method of discharge was routine, customary, proper and safe were persons in supervisory capacities or with responsible positions and, thus, best equipped to pass upon the propriety and safety of the method of work pursued. The vacillation and questionable credibility of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, coupled with strong, affirmative testimony by experienced men in responsible and supervisory positions, indicates more than that the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. We are persuaded that the finding of the court was clearly correct. While, standing alone, the fact that the method of pushing or guiding the bucket is a routine and customary practice will not be accepted as conclusive evidence of due and reasonable care, yet it is strong-evidence thereof.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">All of the gear furnished by the ship' and by the stevedore was in proper working condition. Burgess contends, however, that the manner of using the gear was unsafe which not only rendered the ship unseaworthy but constituted negligence on the part of the ship\u2019s officers and agents as a breach of their duty and obligation to supervise unloading operations. In the face of an adverse finding that the use of the gear and equipment was safe, reasonable and proper under the circumstances, which finding is supported by competent evidence, plaintiff\u2019s contentions as to unseaworthiness and negligence are without foundation and must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">For the reasons stated herein, the judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-8\">.

SPENCER BELL, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ab4\">&lt;dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">When the quantity of ore remaining in the vessel\u2019s after deep tanks had been reduced to such an extent that it was no longer efficient to use the bulldozer, those in charge were left with the choice \u2022of either shoveling the coal into the \u2022center of the hatch where it could be reached by the grab bucket or devising some expedient by which the grab bucket \u2022could be moved closer to the margins of the tank. Rather than use the slower and more expensive method of shoveling the coal into position under the hatch, the men were permitted manually to push or guide the grab bucket with their hands to spot it over piles of ore positioned away from the center of the hatch. At a given signal the winchman dropped the bucket onto the ore. While playing \u201cdrop the handkerchief\u201d in this manner with a two ton grab bucket, the predictable happened to the libellant\u2019s foot as he was pushing or guiding the bucket. To make the game even closer to Russian Roulette, the winchman could neither see nor hear the men in the hold. Commands were relayed to him from the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The trial court credited the testimony of the ship\u2019s officers, the expert, the foreman, etc., none of whom customarily put their feet under the handkerchief. These gentlemen all testified it was a customary and reasonably safe way to unload a ship. We agree \u2014 that' is, it was safe for the experts, officers and foremen, and also for the ship. I have no doubt that it was cheaper and more expeditious to push the bucket to the ore than the ore to the bucket. But no expert' will make me believe that the practice here indulged was \u201creasonably safe.\u201d There was no real dispute about the method of operation. I think the court was clearly in error in holding that it was not negligent. If the practice was pursued long enough to be actually or constructively brought to the attention of the ship\u2019s officers, their failure to stop it was negligence for which they should be held liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">It is probably true that this method often has been and is used, and often will be, so long as the courts tolerate it and the industry is indifferent to its appalling safety record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The philosophy of the industry seems to be \u2014 if the men are willing to risk their lives and limbs \u2014 why should you care? The answer is that it is not the industry, and in this day of organized relief not the individual, who pays the price of such stupidity \u2014 it is society, and society cannot' afford it. Other industries have stopped it, and the shipping industry will- if the courts withdraw the monetary incentive to such substandard practices involving needless hazards to their workmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-7\">. The House Report accompanying the 1958 Amendment to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act points out that stevedoring is the most hazardous of all industries which report their experience to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, having an injury frequency rate of seven times that of manufacturing.
