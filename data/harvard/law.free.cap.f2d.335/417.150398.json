At the outset, appellee objects that our opinion, reported at 329 F.2d 100, contains substantial errors of fact. In particular, appellee urges the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">(1) \u201cThere is nothing in the record to support the Court\u2019s finding that \u2018 * * * no other ease was scheduled to be - considered by that Grand Jury.\u2019 \u201d The burden of appellee\u2019s criticism is contained in the following sentence of his brief: \u201cIndeed, when the Court considers the fact that a grand jury serves for six months, it would be literally impossible for the jury commission to know that no other cases would be scheduled for consideration by that grand jury.\u201d That is quite true. Our statement was in the past tense, <em>\u201cwas </em>scheduled\u201d not <em>\u201cwould be </em>scheduled,\u201d and was plainly limited to the crucial time when the jury commission chose the list of names of twenty citizens from which the foreman was selected and the other eleven grand jurors wer.e drawn. That statement was accurate and we adhere to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">(2) Appellee urges that: \u201cMr. Arcen-eaux did not testify that the 20 names selected for the Grand Jury Venire were in addition to the General Venire of 300.\u201d In the opinion we quoted at length from the testimony of Mr. Arceneaux, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-15\">\u201cA. That grand jury was not picked out of that original group of three hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-16\">\u201cQ. It was not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-17\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-18\">\u201cQ. How was that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-19\">\u201cA. The grand jury is picked by names in the additions to the three hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-20\">\u201cQ. In additions to the three hundred ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-21\">\u201cA. Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-22\">\u201cQ. Now, as I understand it, when you prepare the grand jury you don\u2019t look in the box of three hundred and select out twenty names? You simply get together and you all select twenty names, period, and put them on there. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-23\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.\u201d 329 F.2d at 102, 103.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-24\">Appellee insists that \u201cinstead the grand jury venire was taken from those names added to the 1958 list, which 1958 list had been depleted because of the removal of those names drawn or selected for the various juries drawn since 1958.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>While we think that our statement was accurate, we will accept the appellee\u2019s version. The difference is immaterial for the reasons stated in our opinion, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201c * * * even if the list of twenty had been selected from the general venire list, it would nonetheless remain true that six Negroes were purposely included in that list of twenty because of the fact that they were Negroes; that the identities of the six Negroes so included were known to the jury commissioners; that they knew also that the grand jury to be chosen from that list of twenty was to consider whether to return an indictment against Collins, and that no other case was scheduled to be considered by that grand jury.\u201d 329 F.2d at 104.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">(3) Appellee urges: \u201cAt page 10 of the March 11th opinion, it is stated that Collins was indicted for aggravated kidnapping. The only suggested source of this finding is in appellant\u2019s brief, for Collins was not indicted for aggravated kidnapping.\u201d The order of the State Court appointing counsel to represent Collins stated that he was \u201c* * * charged with the crimes of aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping, and attempted murder by warrants signed by this Court * * * \u201d (E. p. 29.) He was not, however, indicted for aggravated kidnapping, but was indicted for aggravated rape and attempted murder (R. p. 5). This correction, though immaterial, is made for the sake of accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">In the list of twenty from which the foreman was selected and the other eleven grand jurors drawn, six Negroes were purposefully included because they were Negroes. The other fourteen on the list of twenty were white persons. In such an organization of the grand jury, there was discrimination against Collins because of his race or color and he was deprived of the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Cassell v. Texas, 1950, 339 U.S. 282, 70 S.Ct. 629, 94 L.Ed. 839; Akins v. Texas, 1945, 325 U.S. 398, 65 S.Ct. 1276, 89 L.Ed. 1692; Hill v. Texas, 1942, 316 U.S. 400, 62 S.Ct. 1159, 86 L.Ed. 1559. That was the extent of our holding. Collins v. Walker, 5 Cir. 1964, 329 F.2d 100, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">Except for numbers, the grand jury was organized according to a system remarkably like that considered in Hill, Akins and Cassell, supra. As said in Cassell, \u201cActing under the Texas statutes, the Dallas County grand-jury commissioners chose a list of sixteen males for this September 1947 grand jury from citizens eligible under the statute. The judge chose twelve of these for the panel. No challenge is now made to the fairness of this statutory system. We have approved it.\u201d 339 U.S. at 283, 284, 70 S.Ct. at 630. As further observed in Cassell, the grand-jury commissioners for 21 consecutive lists subsequent to the Hill case had limited Negroes in the list of 16 selected for grand jury service to not more than 1 on each grand jury. 339 U.S. at 285, 286, 70 S.Ct. 629. Mr. Justice Reed said that, \u201cIf, notwithstanding this caution by the trial court judges, commissioners should limit proportionally the number of Negroes selected for grand-jury service, such limitation would violate our Constitution. Jurymen should be selected as individuals, on the basis of individual qualifications, and not as members of a race.\u201d 339 U.S. 286, 70 S.Ct. 631. \u201c * * * the Constitution requires only a fair jury selected without regard to race. Obviously the number of races and nationalities appearing in the ancestry of our citizens would make it impossible to meet a requirement of proportional representation. Similarly, since there can be no exclusion of Negroes as a race and no discrimination because of color, proportional limitation is not permissible.\u201d 339 U.S. 286, 287, 70 S.Ct. 631-632. \u201cProportional racial limitation is therefore forbidden. An accused is entitled to have charges against him considered by a jury in the selection of which there has been neither inclusion nor exclusion because of race.\u201d 339 U.S. 287, 70 S.Ct. at 632. Chief Justice Vin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>son and Justices Black and Clark concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Reed. Justices Burton and Minton concurred in the opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, who said: \u201cIt (the Constitution) does command that no State purposefully make jury service turn on col- or.\u201d 339 U.S. 291, 70 S.Ct. 634. \u201cThe basis of selection cannot consciously take color into account.\u201d 339 U.S. 295, 70 S.Ct. 636. Mr. Justice Clark, also concurring, recognized the holding that there must be no \u201cpurposeful systematic limitation of the number of Negroes on grand juries,\u201d 339 U.S. 296, 70 S.Ct. 636; and \u201cthat representation on the grand jury by race in proportion to population is not permissible for there must be \u2018neither inclusion nor exclusion because of race.\u2019 \u201d 339 U.S. 298, 70 S.Ct. 637. Mr. Justice Jackson dissented on the ground that the defendant had not been harmed by the method of selection of the grand jury. 339 U.S. 305, 70 S.Ct. 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The main difference between this Collins case and the Cassell ease is that in Cassell one Negro was purposefully placed on the list of sixteen from which the grand jury was selected, while in Collins six Negroes were purposefully placed on the list of twenty from which the grand jury was selected. In both instances, the basis of selection was race. That is the fatal defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The appellee\u2019s most serious apprehensions relate to the effect of our holding on the \u201cgeneral venire list\u201d of three hundred persons. LSA-R.S. 15:-179. We recognized (see 329 F.2d 105) the affirmative constitutional duty resting upon the jury commissioners \u201c * * not to pursue a course of conduct in the administration of their office which would operate to discriminate in the selection of jurors on racial grounds. Discrimination can arise from the action of commissioners who exclude all negroes whom they do not know to be qualified and who neither know nor seek to learn whether there are in fact any qualified to serve. In such a case discrimination necessarily results where there are qualified negroes available for jury service.\u201d Hill v. Texas, supra, 316 U.S. at 404, 62 S.Ct. at 1161, followed in Avery v. Georgia, 1953, 345 U.S. 559, 561, 73 S.Ct. 891, 97 L.Ed. 1244. We further recognize that \u201c[o]ur duty to protect the federal constitutional rights of all does not mean we must or should impose on states our conception of the proper source of jury lists, so long as the source reasonably reflects a cross-section of the population suitable in character and intelligence for that civic duty.\u201d Brown v. Allen, 1953, 344 U.S. 443, 474, 73 S.Ct. 397, 416, 97 L.Ed. 469. Further, in United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 53, 67, we stated that \u201cvery decided variations in proportions of Negroes and whites on jury lists from racial proportions in the population, which variations are not explained and are long continued, furnish sufficient evidence of systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service. Brown v. Allen, 1953, 344 U.S. 443, 471, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469.\u201d Thus it may be that the \u201cgeneral venire list\u201d of three hundred persons is required to reflect a suitable cross-section of the population, and that the jury commissioners have an affirmative duty to include qualified Negroes in that list. If such a requirement and duty have once been met in compiling the \u201cgeneral ve-nire list\u201d no repetition is necessary or even allowed in the selection of the list of twenty \u201ctherefrom.\u201d Certainly, as to the list of twenty, the basis of selection cannot consciously take race or color into account. There may be a very real distinction in this respect between the \u201cgeneral venire list\u201d of three hundred and the \u201clist of grand jurors\u201d consisting of the names of twenty citizens selected \u201ctherefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We limited our holding in the present case as follows: \u201cThe only list of importance to the decision of this ease is the list of twenty from which the foreman was selected and the other eleven grand jurors drawn.\u201d 329 F.2d 105. The question of whether it would be a denial of equal protection of the laws to intentionally include names of persons selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>on the basis of individual qualifications and also on the basis of race in the \u201cgeneral venire list\u201d of three hundred is not here before us and is not decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The appellee\u2019s second petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b469-7\">JONES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ag2\">(concurring specially).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Systematic inclusion of Negroes on a jury, as well as systematic exclusion, is in violation of the due process clause or the equal protection clause, or both. The representation of the respective races on juries must not be proportional, but too few of one race or too many of the other may be evidence of discrimination. The basis of selection cannot consciously take color into account yet, as Judge Rives so aptly says, that in the general venire list, it may be that \u201cthe jury commissioners have an affirmative duty to include qualified Negroes in that list.\u201d Thus it seems that perhaps Negroes must be included in the general venire list, although it will be assumed that this is not to be done purposefully lest the Constitution be infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The systematic inclusion of Negroes on the grand jury which indicted Collins rendered the indictment and all subsequent proceedings invalid. No difficulty is anticipated in the selection of a grand jury to indict and a petit jury to try the appellant in compliance with the principles which the courts have announced.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b469-10\">BENJAMIN C. DAWKINS, Jr.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0x\">District Judge (dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Originally I concurred in the majority opinion on grounds different from those therein expressed, with a footnote reserving grave doubts as to the soundness of the majority\u2019s views. To further clarify my position now, I attach a copy of the original opinion (Appendix A). As I noted therein, the majority decision now rendered indeed places jury commissioners, in both state and federal courts, in a virtually insoluble dilemma, where compilation of a constitutional jury list may be an impossibility. Furthermore, it is directly contrary to the ruling of the United States Supreme Court in Akins v. Texas, 325 U.S. 398, 65 S.Ct. 1276, 89 L.Ed. 1692 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">In Akins the jury commissioners selected sixteen names and placed them on a list from which twelve grand jurors were chosen. The commissioners were instructed not to discriminate against Negroes, and in carrying out this instruction they intentionally selected <em>one </em>Negro and placed his name on the list of sixteen. Of course, in that case the contention was that there was discrimination because of the limitation of Negroes on the list to only one. The Court held that discrimination had not been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">The dissenting justices in Akins expressed their views in a manner almost exactly like that now adopted by the majority here. At page 410, 65 S.Ct. at page 1282 in his dissenting opinion Justice Murphy stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al2\">\u201c * * * By limiting the number to one they thereby excluded the possibility that two or more Negroes might be among the persons qualified to serve. All those except the one Negro were required to be of white color. At the same time, by insisting upon one Negro, they foreclosed the possibility of choosing sixteen white men on the panel. They refused, in brief, to disregard the factor of color in selecting the jury personnel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">It is as apparent as apparency can be that the majority in the present case is reasoning as the minority did in the Akins case. For example, in the original opinion here, that has since been withdrawn, but now is disclosed by this dissent, the majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-17\">\u201cThe prohibition is often referred to as being against the systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service because of their race or color. Systematic \u00bfreclusion of any limited number of Negroes because of race means, however, a corresponding systematic exclusion of Negroes from the remaining number on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>venire. For example, while improbable, it is by no means impossible that a grand jury drawn from the general venire list of 300, assuming that list to be prepared without racial discrimination, might have contained more Negroes than the five who sat on the grand jury which indicted Collins.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">And in the substituted opinion the majority states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">\u201c * * * six Negroes were deliberately included in this list of twenty because of their race. When to this circumstance is added the additional facts then known to the jury commissioners that the grand jury to be chosen from that list of twenty was to consider whether to return an indictment against Collins, and that no other case was scheduled to be considered by that grand jury, the conclusion becomes inescapable that in the organization of the grand jury which indicted Collins there was discrimination against him because of his race or color.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">It is not mentioned at all that we were Informed in oral argument, undisputed by appellant\u2019s counsel, that one of the six held a Ph. D. degree, and that the other five were successful businessmen or farmers \u2014 independent, reasonably educated men. They were not mere \u201cUncle Toms,\u201d who had any economic or physical compulsion against them, regardless of their actions as grand jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In denying the second petition for rehearing, the majority has stated that the jury commission did not know that no other case would be referred to the grand jury, although it knew at the time of selection that only Collins\u2019s case then was pending. Thus the decision rests solely on the intentional \u00bf\u00abelusion of Negroes on the jury venire. Consequently, the opinion in effect holds that the intentional placing of the names of six Negroes on the list of twenty from which the grand jury was chosen discriminated against Collins, a Negro. What greater <em>non sequitur </em>can there be ? Such a holding is precisely contrary to the' ruling by the Supreme Court in Akins v. Texas, supra. It cannot rationally be argued that the Court there did not consider the position now asserted by the majority, for the simple reason that the same contentions were advanced by the dissenting opinion in Akins and <em>rejected.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">The opinion by the majority (in which Judge Jones evinces a somewhat reluctant special concurrence) relies almost entirely \u2014 if not entirely \u2014 upon Cassell v. Texas, 339 U.S. 282, 70 S.Ct. 629, 94 L.Ed. 839 (1950), where, in my opinion, loose language was used to the effect that: \u201cAn accused is entitled to have charges against him considered by a jury in the selection of which there has been neither \u00bf\u00abelusion nor exclusion because of race.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In support of this conclusion, the following remark from Justice Frankfurter\u2019s concurring opinion is quoted: \u201cThe basis of selection cannot consciously take color into account.\u201d d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">A fair and profound analysis of Cassell will clearly show that the above quotations as to \u00bf\u00abelusion are purely <em>dicta, </em>nothing more or less. The Court stated that the reason for granting certiorari was \u201c * * * to consider petitioner\u2019s claim that in this case Negroes were omitted from the list of grand jurymen either because of deliberate limitation by the Dallas County jury commissioners, or because of failure by the commissioners to acquaint themselves with available Negroes.\u201d In that part of the opinion in which the Court discussed the fact that proportional representation of races on a jury is not a constitutional requisite, it made the passing statement that there should be neither inclusion nor exclusion because of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\"><em>But </em>in the very next sentence, immediately following, the Court stated: \u201cOur holding that there was discrimination in the selection of grand jurors in this case, however, is based on another ground.\u201d It then discussed in detail the failure of the jury commissioners to familiarize themselves with eligible jurors without regard to race. It was carefuly emphasized that they admittedly knew members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>of the white race, but since they had made no <em>conscious </em>effort to acquaint themselves with qualified Negroes and other minority groups they had used a system which resulted in racial discrimination and was unconstitutional. Whether or not intentional Miclusion of Negroes would have been unconstitutional was not before the Court or involved in the case, and only mentioned in passing.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In Cassell there was no majority opinion as such, but a 4-3-1 split, with one justice not participating. See \u201cThe Supreme Court, 1949 Term,\u201d 64 Howard Law Rev. 127 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The slight weight to be given <em>dicta </em>is clearly stated in Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahn-dedup-0\">\u201cThe counsel for the defendant in error urge, in opposition to this rule of construction, some <em>dicta </em>of the court, in the case of Marbury v. Madison [1 Cranch 137, 2 L.Ed. 60]. It is a maxim, not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision. The reason of this maxim is obvious. The question actually before the court is investigated with care, and considered in its full extent. Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to the case decided, but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The actual holding in Cassell has been digested accurately in 31 Am.Jur., <em>verbo </em>Jury \u00a7 98, as follows: \u201cDiscrimination in selecting a jury on racial grounds means purposeful, systematic <em>noninclusion because of color or race.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The Supreme Court earlier stated the same rule in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">\u201c * * * What an accused is entitled to demand, under the Constitution of the United States, is that, in organizing the grand jury as well as in the empaneling of the petit jury, there shall be <em>no exclusion </em>of his race, and no discrimination against them, because of their race or color.\u201d Martin v. State of Texas, 200 U.S. 316, 321, 26 S.Ct. 338, 50 L.Ed. 497. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">If I am wrong in this analysis of Cas-sell, and I am convinced otherwise, then it would be logical to conclude that all juries, grand and petit, state and federal, which have been selected since that decision, throughout the nation, wherever significant racial or ethnic differences exist and where jury commissioners consciously and conscientiously have' attempted to constitute jury lists on a nondiscriminatory, representative basis, then all indictments and convictions in such areas have been unconstitutional and invalid. This, I cannot believe the Supreme Court ever meant to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">The Court first applied the Fourteenth Amendment to prohibit discrimination against Negroes in the selection of jurors in Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1879). It then held that a State could confine the selection of jurors to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to persons within certain ages, or to persons meeting certain educational requirements. The Court recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment was designed primarily to make Negroes full citizens and as to the selection of juries Negroes were to be treated equally with whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">At the same term, in Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313, 322-323, 25 L.Ed. 667, the Court stated, \u201cIt <em>is </em>a right to which every colored man is entitled, that, in the selection of jurors to pass upon his life, liberty or property, there shall be no exclusion of his race, and no discrimination against them because of their color.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370, 26 L.Ed. 567 (1880), reiterated the proposition that exclusion of Negroes from juries because of their race or color was unconstitutional. Over and over again, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the Supreme Court, in the last 80 years, has emphasized and re-emphasized the same rule concerning <em>exclusion </em>from jury lists because of race.

Alabama, 84 S.Ct. 1152 (1964)</p>\n<p id=\"Aa7\">In order to insure that there is no exclusion of persons because of their race, the Supreme Court has directed jury commissioners to make a <em>conscious </em>effort to select a jury composed of a <em>cross-section </em>of the community. In Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 474, 73 S.Ct. 397, 416 (1953), Justice Reed, speaking for the majority, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atz-dedup-0\">\u201cOur duty to protect the federal constitutional rights of all does not mean we must or should impose on states our conception of the proper source of jury lists, <em>so long as the source reasonably reflects a cross-section of the population suitable in character and intelligence for that civic duty.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a8t-dedup-0\">in making their selection of prospective jurors commissioners <em>must, </em>indeed, are bound, to acquaint themselves with qualified members of all races and use a method which will insure selection from each major racial group. Hernandez v. Texas, supra; Cassell v. Texas, supra; Hill v. Texas, supra; Smith v. Texas, supra. In the latter case a unanimous court held: \u201cWhere jury commissioners limit those from whom grand juries are selected to their own personal acquaint-anee, discrimination can arise from corn-missioners who know no negroes as well as from commissioners who know but eliminate them.\u201d Thus it was ruled that a commissioner who knows no Negroes must make a <em>conscious </em>effort to learn of qualified Negroes and select some of them in order not to discriminate.</p>\n<p id=\"ajr-dedup-1\">On May 30, 1962 (reh. den. June 29, 1962), in United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, 304 F.2d 53, at page 60, Judge Rives, the organ of the Court here, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeJ6\">\u201cPrior to 1960&gt; the Commissioners personally handed out the majority of the pink application cards (the remaining applicants came by the office), and they handed them out only one at a time to individuals whom they knew, although on one or two occasions Commissioner Allen thought he had asked a Negro minister for the names of qualified Negroes. The only sources of Negro applicants the Commissioners could name were the waiters at Morrison\u2019s Cafeteria, the Negroes working at the downtown hotels, those at the shoe shine parlors, mail carriers, and a few they came in contact with through business. Commissioner Allen noted that they often choose names from the rosters of various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>organizations such as the Junior Chamber of Commerce or the Kiwanis Club. When asked if he had ever used the roster of a Negro club or association, he replied no, that no one had ever given him one. Both the Commissioners admitted that the bulk of their friends, social contacts, and acquaintances were white. <em>On the basis of this evidence we see no sufficient effort to solicit the names of qualified Negroes beyond the admittedly narrow circle of ordinary contacts of the Commissioners.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8J\">In Moore v. New York, 333 U.S. 565, 68 S.Ct. 705, 92 L.Ed. 881 (1948), the Court indicated that the record was devoid of proof of systematic, intentional and deliberate exclusion of Negroes from jury duty, and thus the conviction of Negro defendants was sustained. One jury commissioner testified that he must have interviewed at least 500 Negroes and accepted maybe two or three dozen. Obviously, therefore, there was a conscious effort to obtain members of the Negro race to serve on juries, and clearly, in the absence of this intentional inclusion of some Negroes, the Court surely would <em>have </em>found that there had been discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"A41\">Another plainly apparent mistake in the majority\u2019s ruling here is that it does not explain adequately how intentional inclusion of Negroes on a grand jury could discriminate against a Negro accused. What evidence there is on the point tends to indicate that inclusion of six Negroes on the list substantially exceeded the proportion of Negroes in the parish. I already have alluded to the quality of the six. It surely is an unwarranted affront to such high type citizens of the Negro race to assume that they would discriminate against other members of their own race when serving upon a Grand Jury, in secret session, and requiring at least nine members to vote for an indictment. LSA-Constitution 1921, Article 7, \u00a7 42.</p>\n<p id=\"AEIo\">There has been no proof, nor proffer of proof, that substantially would establish that the jury commissioners purposely limited the number of Negroes placed on the grand jury venire. In fact, the evidence definitely shows that each commissioner acted separately, not knowing how many persons of each race would be placed on the list by the other eommissioners. It is clear beyond dispute that in this case, if anything could be made clearer, this defendant was <em>benefited </em>by the intentional inclusion of Negroes, not discriminated against; and it must be remembered that he was indicted and convicted of a heinous crime \u2014 aggravated rape, which conviction was affirmed <em>h? </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court. Moreovfr\u2019 the Supreme Court never has sustained a defendant\u2019s objection to exelus^on a &amp;rouP from jury service except when the defendant was a member of excluded class, Fay v. New York, 332 L.S. 261, 287, 67 S.Ct. 1613, 91 L.Ed. 2043 (1947) ; and it <em>never </em>has voided an indictment or conviction for conscious \u00bfreelusion of members of the same race or ethnic group.</p>\n<p id=\"AQX\">The Court has directed States unequivocally not to exclude Negroes intention-any from grand jury lists, and now the majority here directs States not to <em>in</em>clude them intentionally. To me, this fundamentally cannot follow and is impossible of accomplishment. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court repeatedly has upheld the right of States to use selection procedures not based solely on chance but designed to select <em>intelligent </em>and <em>morally fit </em>jurors. LSA-R.S. 15:172 (1950), among other things, requires jurors to be literate and of good character. <em>Ergo, </em>jury commissioners here and in all States, not only must know these things, but in learning of them must know their race. This is a <em>sine qua non.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ayf-dedup-0\">This simple question may be posed\u2014 and j believe there is only one inescapable answer to it \u2014 how can a constitution-a] jury be formed in either a state or federal court if jury commissioners do not intentionally include members of various races ? This problem was recognized, at least partially, by Judge Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>in his concurring opinion in which he agrees with Judge Rives that \u201cit may be that \u2018the jury commissioners have an affirmative duty to include qualified Negroes in that list [the general venire list].\u2019\u201d But in the next sentence he seems to contradict himself when he states that \u201cit will be assumed that this is not to be done purposefully lest the Constitution be infringed.\u201d With all respect, to me this is a <em>non sequitur </em>in light of the unbroken line of Supreme Court decisions (and of this Court, see Wiman, supra), holding that jury commissioners have an <em>affirmative </em>duty to seek out, and place on such lists, qualified Negroes.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">I Gibson, in Racial Discrimination on Grand Juries, 3 Baylor Law Rev. 29, 38-39 (1950), referring to certain language in the Cassell case, quite appropriately stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u201c * * * the Court has disregarded the psychic nature of a prejudice \u2014 racial or otherwise. It is a sad fact, that notwithstanding the best and most noble efforts of all, our society discerns a difference between men on the basis of color. That prejudice can be rooted out only by stern combat within the minds of individual men. The rules of combat must be shaped by expanding and developing social institutions ; the approaches to battle must be through those institutions; the motivation to attain and secure the objective must come from within those institutions. This end cannot be accomplished by the court\u2019s requirement of a process of selection of jurors which will make any ascertainable racial representation completely dependent upon chance. How can there be chance until there is open-mindedness ? A prejudice exists. It will pass, men of good-will hope, with the passage of time, but there must be the conscious recognition of it, the regret for it, the desire to destroy it, and finally the taking of action to abolish it. The design will have to be there, but systematic approach has been outlawed. If the Negro is systematically excluded, the Court condemns; if he is systematically included, the Court condemns. But the prejudice that has pointed out the Negro in the social system since before the founding of the Republic still points him out. All that can be done now is wrongfully to exclude him absolutely, or genuinely strive to give him equal share of that which is rightfully his. But the direction taken, and each step thereon, must be a <em>conscious </em>one. Where human discretion is a factor in selection, a general prejudice cannot be purged immediately and completely. The only way to counteract a prejudice is through a purposeful effort, which inevitably must take on a design. A prejudice can not merely be forgotten. It is a psychic force that must be met with a psychic force.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">To know whether a prospective juror is qualified, a jury commissioner or the person recommending him to the commissioner must know who he is. To know a man requires that his race be known. If the commissioner knows he must <em>not exclude </em>Negroes, then he consciously will attempt to include them. To do so does not violate equal protection of the laws, because whites are also intentionally included. Each race is treated equally. How else can the Supreme Court\u2019s positive mandates for jury selection from a reasonable cross-section of the community be met ?</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">If the majority opinion held that there had been intentional inclusion of a token number of Negroes and that this discriminated against Collins, that would accord with the rationale of Cassell; but the facts here conclusively contra-indicate a mere token inclusion. This is a case where the Jury commissioners unquestionably made a good-faith effort to place a representative cross-section of the community on the general venire and grand jury list. To hold that their action is unconstitutional because they knew which of these selected were whites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and which were Negroes, is totally unfounded in law and absolutely opposed to the Supreme Court rulings in Akins and Brown v. Allen, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Upon original hearing, an erroneous interpretation was made by me of certain evidence in the transcript. Since that evidence was the basis of my special concurrence in the original opinion, it is appropriate to set forth the pertinent portions of the brief by the Louisiana Attorney General setting the record straight:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cNotwithstanding the fact that the Court expressly held that \u2018Even if the list of 20 had been selected from the general venire list, * * \u2019 this would not change the decision, the fact remains that from page 5 of the opinion through the first paragraph of page 11, the Court attempts to make out a case for a finding that the twenty names selected for the grand jury venire were in addition to the list of 300 names on the general venire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201cIn this connection, Your Honors will recall that no argument was ever made by anyone suggesting this interpretation of Mr. Arce-neaux\u2019s testimony. If you would but ask attorneys for appellant they will readily affirm that you are in error. Surely you do not want to perpetuate an erroneous finding which has not been suggested nor defended by any counsel in this ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cTo understand Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s testimony, you should consider the requirements of the Louisiana law which were carefully followed by this Jury Commission. In 1958 these Jury Commissioners were appointed. The jury venire which had been made up by the previous Jury Commission was purged. Therefore, the new Jury Commission started with an entirely new list of 300 names. On the same day that this Jury Commission made up the list of 300 names, they were ordered to select 20 names from this venire to make up the grand jury venire. In accordance with the further orders of the trial court, they proceeded that same day to draw by lot from the remaining 280 names a list of 40 names to serve for the criminal petit jury term of Court. Then they proceeded to draw by lot from the remaining 240 names a list of 35 names for the civil petit jury term of Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201cSix months later the Jury Commission was ordered to meet and add to the remaining names on their original list which now contained only 205 names, so that the general venire list would have 300 names on it. Then in accordance with the trial court\u2019s order they proceeded to select 20 names for the grand jury \u2022venire. Then they drew by lot an additional 40 names for the criminal petit jury venire and they drew by lot an additional 35 names for the civil petit jury venire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">\u201cThis procedure was carried out each of the five times that they met prior to the time that they drew the venire which has been declared discriminatory by the Court\u2019s March 11th opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">\u201cWith this brief summary of the Jury Commission\u2019s method of selecting jury venires, it is readily apparent that the testimony of Mr. Arce-neaux to the effect that the grand jury venire of 20 names was selected from \u2018the additions to the 300\u2019 means simply that the names selected for grand jury duty were not taken from the 1958 list. Instead the grand jury venire was taken from those names added to the 1958 list, which 1958 list had been depleted because of the removal of those names drawn or selected for the various juries drawn since 1958. The additions to the 1958 list had to be made so that each selection and drawing could be made, in accordance with the law, from a list of 300 names.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-14\">\u201cAt no point did Mr. Arceneaux or anyone else say that the list of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>20 names selected for the grand jury was \u2018in addition\u2019 to the list of 300 names which make up the general venire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">\u201cOn page 10 of the opinion of March 11, 1964, [329 F.2d 100 at page 104], the Court states \u2018Appel-lee concedes that Mr. Arceneaux so testified, * * *.\u2019 Our supplemental brief signed by us on January 3, 1964 is subject to this interpretation, for on page 4 of our brief at the outset of paragraph numbered \u2018V.\u2019 we stated \u2014 \u2018If the grand jury had actually been selected according to Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s version, * * * \u2019 etc. It was not our intention to so concede and what we meant to say was \u2014 -\u2018If the Grand Jury venire had actually been selected according to the Court\u2019s interpretation of Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s version, * * * \u2019 etc. The plain and obvious fact is that Mr. Arceneaux\u2019s testimony did not mean what the Court held that it meant. And we respectfully pray that the Court correct this error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">It should be noted also that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption that officers in charge of the selection of a jury panel have performed their duty lawfully. Tarrance v. Florida, 188 U.S. 519, 23 S.Ct. 402, 47 L.Ed. 572 (1903). See Anno. 1 A.L.R. 2d 1291, 1296 (1948). The <em>proces verbal, </em>an official record of the State Court, as to the procedure here employed by the jury commission, clearly refutes the incorrect inferences I drew, and the majority now draws, from the testimony of the Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">It is interesting to note that the Judicial Conference of the United States has suggested that the letter to key-men who suggest prospective jurors for federal jury service include the following statement: \u201cIn making up this list, <em>we ask that you make a conscious effort to include </em>both men and women <em>from a variety of backgrounds </em>and occupations so as to give us, as nearly as possible, <em>a representative cross-section of your community.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 267 F.R.D. 409, 514 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">For these reasons I hereby withdraw my former special concurrence in the original opinion, my concurrence in the second opinion, and I respectfully dissent from the denial of the second petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">I consider it my duty, notwithstanding my lesser official position, insofar as the majority is constituted, to \u201cstand up and be heard\u201d on this grave constitutional question. Hence I render this dissent with all the sincerity I possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">ADDENDUM TO DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">BENJAMIN C. DAWKINS, Jr., District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">Since the above dissenting opinion was written, and forwarded to Judge Rives for filing and printing, I have been advised that the Louisiana Legislature unanimously has passed its Act No. 161 of 1964, approved by the Governor, and, under the Constitution of this State, to become a part of its statutory laws on July 29, 1964, reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">\u201cLEGISLATURE OF LOUISIANA ACT NO. 161 OF 1964</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuEd\">\u201cTo amend and re-enact as amended Section 180 of Title 15 of the Louisiana Revised Statutes of 1950, and to repeal all laws in conflict therewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-15\">\u201cBE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF LOUISIANA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abe-dedup-0\">\u201cSection 1.

Moreover, it sets an optimum example of which both State and Federal courts throughout the nation might well take heed, in light of what I respectfully consider to be an impractical, impossible, indeed, wholly unjustifiable ruling by the majority, which flies directly into the teeth of the Supreme Court\u2019s prior mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">APPENDIX A.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">No. 20537</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">WOODMAN J. COLLINS,</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">Appellant,</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">versus</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">VICTOR Gr. WALKER, Warden, Louisiana State Penitentiary, Angola, Louisiana,</p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\">Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-27\">(December 6, 1963.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-21\">Before RIVES and JONES, Circuit Judges, and BENJAMIN C. DAWKINS, Jr., District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-22\">RIVES, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-23\">Collins, a Negro, was convicted and sentenced to death under an indictment charging him with aggravated rape upon a white woman. The conviction and death sentence were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. State v. Collins, 1962, 242 La. 704, 138 So.2d 546, 547. Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied, 371 U.S. 843, 83 S.Ct. 74, 9 L.Ed.2d 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-24\">His petition for habeas corpus to the United States District Court claimed that his conviction was violative of the Constitution of the United States in three respects: 1) He was discriminated against because of his race or color in the organization of the grand jury which indicted him; 2) he was mentally unable to stand trial, an imbecile not able to assist counsel in his defense; 3) his conviction was procured in part by an unconstitutionally coerced confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-25\">Each of these contentions had been raised and decided against him upon his trial and upon appeal to the State Supreme Court. It is therefore properly conceded that he has satisfied the requirement of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254, that state remedies be exhausted before a federal court may grant an application for habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254; Brown v. Allen, 1953, 344 U.S. 443, 447-450, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469; Fay v. Noia, 1963, 372 U.S. 391, 426 et seq., 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-26\">At the request of the district court, a copy of the record and transcript of proceedings in the State courts was presented and filed with the district court. Upon the basis of that record and transcript, and without taking additional evidence, the district court denied the application for habeas corpus. Collins v. Walker, E.D.La.1963, 215 F.Supp. 805. Thereafter, the district judge issued a certificate of probable cause in accordance with 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253, and per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>mitted the prosecution of this appeal in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">It is settled that a federal district court may, in its discretion, refuse the writ of habeas corpus without hearing additional evidence, if the court is satisfied, by an examination of the record and proceedings in the State court, that the issues have been adequately litigated, that the state process has given fair consideration to the issues and the evidence, and has resulted in a legally satisfactory conclusion, and that no unusual circumstances calling for a hearing are presented. Brown v. Allen, supra, 344 U.S. at 463, 73 S.Ct. 397. The Supreme Court has, however, recently emphasized that, \u201cEven if the state court adjudication turns wholly on primary, historical facts, the Federal District Court has a broad <em>power </em>on habeas to hold an evidentiary hearing and determine the facts.\u201d Fay v. Noia, supra, 372 U.S. at 422, 83 S.Ct. at 840. The Supreme Court in Townsend v. Sain, 1963, 372 U.S. 293, 313, 83 S.Ct. 745, 757, 9 L.Ed.2d 770, set forth the tests with more particularity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cWe hold that a federal court must grant an evidentiary hearing to a habeas applicant under the following circumstances: If (1) the merits of the factual dispute were not resolved in the state hearing; (2) the state factual determination is not fairly supported by the record as a whole; (3) the fact-finding procedure employed by the state court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing; (4) there is a substantial allegation of newly discovered evidence; (5) the material facts were not adequately developed at the state-court hearing; or (6) for any reason it appears that the state trier of fact did not afford the habeas applicant a full and fair fact hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">On the first question, that of racially discriminatory organization of the grand jury, we agree with the district court that the evidence introduced in the state court pi'oceedings was adequate, indeed undisputed, but we reach a conclusion opposite to that reached by the state courts and by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">1) Indictment is the only method provided by the law of Louisiana for the institution of the prosecution of a capital offense. LSA-R.S. Title 15, \u00a7 2. A jury commission for each parish is selected and appointed by the district judge. LSA-R.S. 15:175. At the time ordered by the district judge, the jury commission meets at the office of the clerk of the district court and selects from the persons qualified to serve as jurors for their parish three hundred persons as the \u201cgeneral venire list.\u201d LSA-R.S. 15:179. The next section provides the method of selecting a grand jury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">\u201c\u00a7 180. <em>Selection of grand jury</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACCL\">\u201cImmediately after completing the general venire list, the commission shall select <em>therefrom </em>the names of twenty citizens, possessing the qualifications of grand jurors, to be taken from different portions of the parish, as far as practicable, who shall be subject to duty as grand jurors during the term of six months after the grand jury is impaneled and until a succeeding grand jury shall have been impaneled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">\u201cThe names of the persons so selected shall be written on slips of paper, by the clerk, in the presence of the commissioners and they shall place the slips in an envelope, seal the same and indorse thereon the words: \u2018List of Grand Jurors.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Negroes constitute a substantial proportion of the population of Jefferson Davis Parish. Mr. Arceneaux, the member of the Jury Commission from Ward 2, testified that the population in that ward was about 75% white and 25% Negro, that being the \u201cheaviest concentration of colored people in Jefferson Davis Parish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Mr. Arceneaux had served on the Jury Commission since 1958. In that year the Jury Commission prepared the original \u201cgeneral venire list\u201d of 300 persons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>\u201cQ.

When we were appointed on the Committee we were given instructions as to who was eligible and ineligible for jury duty by written instructions from the Judge. We have been from time to time reminded by the Judge that in picking the jury to just be careful that there should be both white and colored members on the jury. Other than this I would say we\u2019ve had no instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Some Negroes were included in this original list of 300 but Mr. Arceneaux did not recall how many. \u201cWe have met twice annually for the choosing of additional names to add to the 1st (sic) to replace the juries that have been drawn out of that original list.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Mr. Arceneaux further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u201cQ. Now, have there been three grand and petit juries drawn from this list since it was prepared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u201cA. Prom that list, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">\u201cQ. How many have been drawn or do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">\u201cA. I think there would have been five grand juries drawn since we\u2019ve been on. It\u2019s either four or five.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">\u201cQ. Now, Mr. Arceneaux\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-13\">\u201cA. They are not taken from that list of three hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">\u201cQ. Sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-15\">\u201cA. That grand jury was not picked out of that original group of three hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-16\">\u201cQ. It was not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-17\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-18\">\u201cQ. How was that \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-19\">\u201cA. The grand jury is picked by names in the additions to the three hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-20\">\u201cQ. In additions to the three hundred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-21\">\u201cA. Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-22\">Again Mr. Arceneaux testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-23\">\u201cQ. Do you have any idea how many colored people are presently in the venire list of three hundred ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-24\">\u201cA. That would be a hard question to answer. I don\u2019t know I could even give an estimate because we have drawn a lot of the original names and it would be hard \u2014 well, it would be impossible for any individual member of the Commission to say, because the names when they are submitted are not submitted as colored or white, they\u2019re submitted as names and we know in our selection what they are but when they are put in the box there is no way in distinguishing between them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-25\">\u201cQ. But when you do draw the grand jury out you do know whether they are colored or white ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-26\">'\u2018A. The grand jury is named before the names are put in the box, yes, we do know whether they are colored or white.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-27\">\u201cQ. Now, as I understand it, when you prepare the grand jury you don\u2019t look in the box of three hundred and select out twenty names? You simply get together and you all select twenty names, period, and put them on there. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-28\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-29\">As each grand jury was selected, the Jury Commission was instructed by Mr. Charles A. Pitre, the Clerk of the District Court, that some Negroes should be included. As Mr. Arceneaux testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-30\">\u201cA. That instruction, each time that we had met, has come from Mr. Pitre that there should be some colored representation on each grand jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u201cQ. I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">\u201cA. But not any specific instructions other than that we should attempt to do that each time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">At the time of Collins\u2019 arrest on April 8, 1960, there had been recently empanel- \u2022 ed for Jefferson Davis Parish a regular grand jury for the six months commencing March 21, 1960. There was no Negro on that grand jury for the reason thus stated by Mr. Arceneaux:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cQ. Now do you know what reason why you did not put any on the grand jury immediately prior to the grand jury under which this man was indicted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aps\">\u201cA. I had put some on the previous and I was depending on some one else to put someone on the previous grand jury and in the course of events when we finished putting the names in it turned out that all of us had depended on someone else putting the names in and it so happened none of us did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Mr. Arceneaux further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201cQ. Now, Mr. Arceneaux, how many Negroes did you put on the grand jury panel or the twenty names prior to this particular one and prior to the one that you failed to put anyone on ? About how many had you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">\u201cA. I think that I had always put at least one on the grand jury panel on all of the grand juries that have been selected except the one immediately preceed-ing (sic) the present grand jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">Collins\u2019 case was not presented to the grand jury empaneled when he was arrested, but instead he was held in jail for six months until October 5, 1960, at which time six Negroes were purposely placed on the list of twenty names,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from which the district judge drew a grand jury composed of five Negroes and seven whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">It was this grand jury which indicted Collins for aggravated rape and also for aggravated kidnapping and attempted murder. No other case was presented to this grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-17\">The State\u2019s position was that, instead of systematic <em>exclusion </em>of Negroes from the grand jury which returned the indictment, there was a purposeful <em>inclusion </em>of Negroes. As said by the State trial judge: \u201cIt seems entirely reasonable to this Court that the Jury Commission in noting its error of failing to have any Negroes on a Grand Jury did attempt to remedy this error by placing more Negroes on the subsequent Grand Jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">The Louisiana Supreme Court held that this method of selecting a grand jury did not offend the Constitution of the United States, and quoted from its previous holding in State v. Green, 1952, 221 La. 713, 60 So.2d 208, 212, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-19\">\u201c \u2018It would be fallacious, we think, to hold that, because jury commissioners, being conscious of the necessity of giving consideration to mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>bers of the colored race, as well as those of other races, in the selection of all juries in order to comply with the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, have purposely included Negroes on a jury panel, their forthright action constitutes discrimination in the absence of a showing that there was a planned limitation upon the number of Negroes to be chosen.\u2019 (221 La. at 726, 60 So.2d at 212.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">State v. Collins, supra, 138 So.2d at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">We do not agree. In the Green case, the Louisiana Supreme Court attempted to distinguish the case of Cassell v. Texas, 1950, 339 U.S. 282, 70 S.Ct. 629, 94 L.Ed. 839 (see 60 So.2d at 212). In the instant case, the federal district judge held the Cassell case not applicable on its facts (215 F.Supp. at 809). While we would concede that the Cassell case is distinguishable on its facts, it is important to note that the Supreme Court, in its opinion, carefully stated the principle that: \u201cAn accused is entitled to have charges against him considered by a jury in the selection of which there has been neither inclusion nor exclusion because of race.\u201d 339 U.S. at 287, 70 S.Ct. at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">That the use of this language was deliberate and well studied is shown by the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">\u201cThe prohibition of the Constitution against discrimination because of color does not require in and of itself the presence of a Negro on a jury. But neither is it satisfied by Negro representation arbitrarily limited to one. It is not a question of presence on a grand jury nor absence from it. <em>The basis of selection cannot consciously take color into account.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">339 U.S. at 295, 70 S.Ct. at 635-636.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">On principle, we think that must be true. A Negro is entitled to the equal protection of the laws, no less and no more. He stands equal before the law, and is viewed by the law as a person, not as a Negro. In the historic language of the elder Mr. Justice Harlan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">\u201cThere is no caste here. Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896, 163 U.S. 537, 559, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 1146, 41 L.Ed. 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">An accused cannot demand a mixed grand jury, some of which shall be of his same race. What an acccused is entitled to demand under the Constitution is that in organizing the grand jury there shall be no discrimination against him because of his race or color. Martin v. Texas, 1906, 200 U.S. 316, 321, 26 S.Ct. 338, 50 L.Ed. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">The Supreme Court has frowned on the use of white tickets to indicate prospective white jurors and yellow tickets to indicate Negroes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-16\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s charge of discrimination in the jury selection in this case springs from the Jury Commissioners\u2019 use of white and yellow tickets. Obviously that practice makes it easier for those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">Avery v. Georgia, 1953, 345 U.S. 559, 562, 73 S.Ct. 891, 892, 97 L.Ed. 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">State courts and jury commissions may find somewhat contradictory or confusing the doctrine forbidding the consideration of color as a basis for selecting a venire of jurors and the rule which we stated in United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, 5 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 53, 67, that \u201cvery decided variations in proportions of Negroes and whites on jury lists from racial proportions in the population, which variations are not explained and are long continued, furnish sufficient evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>dence of systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service. Brown v. Allen, 1953, 344 U.S. 443, 471, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469.\u201d The reconciliation lies in the observance of the positive, affirmative duty resting upon jury commissioners and other public officials expressed in Avery v. Georgia, supra, 345 U.S. 559, 561, 73 S.Ct. 891:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\u201cThe Jury Commissioners, and the other officials responsible for the selection of this panel, were under a constitutional duty to follow a procedure \u2014 \u2018a course of conduct\u2019\u2014 which would not \u2018operate to discriminate in the selection of jurors on racial grounds.\u2019 Hill v. State of Texas, 1942, 316 U.S. 400, 404 [62 S.Ct. 1159, 1161, 86 L.Ed. 1559].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amf-dedup-1\">Also quoted in United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, supra, 304 F.2d at 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Compliance with that duty inevitably results in meeting the evidentiary test prescribed in United States ex rel. Seals v. Wiman, supra. The two rules may appear conflicting or confusing when attention is focused on the evidentiary test, but not when there is a good faith effort to comply with the constitutional mandate for which that test is prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The prohibition is often referred to as being against the systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service because of their race or color. Systematic \u00bfreclusion of any limited number of Negroes because of race means, however, a corresponding systematic exclusion of Negroes from the remaining number on the venire. For example, while improbable, it is by no means impossible that a grand jury drawn from the general venire list of 300, assuming that list to be prepared without racial discrimination, might have contained more Negroes than the five who sat on the grand jury which indicted Collins.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">An opposite and somewhat paradoxical consideration is that the conscious taking into account of race or color as a basis of jury selection may result in injury from the sometimes over-ready complaisance of members of the race of the accused. To paraphrase the language of Mr. Justice Jackson, concurring in the result in Shepherd v. State of Florida, 1951, 341 U.S. 50, 55, 71 S.Ct. 549, 551, 95 L.Ed. 740: \u201cI do not see, as a practical matter, how any Negro on the grand jury would have dared to vote against indicting Collins for a capital offense. The only chance Collins had may have been in the courage and decency of some sturdy and forthright white person of sufficient standing to face and live down the odium among his white neighbors that such a vote, if required, would have brought.\u201d Any effort to give to the accused more than the equal protection of the laws may thus well have the practical result of giving somewhat less than equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Moreover, it is important to note that the guarantee of the Constitution is to \u201cthe equal protection <em>of the laws.\" </em>In the four or five grand juries drawn for Jefferson Davis Parish since 1958, the jury commissioners had made no pretense of selecting the names of twenty citizens <em>from </em>the general venire list as required by law. LSA-R.S. 15:180, quoted supra [335 F.2d p. 430]. Instead, the commissioners each placed in the list of twenty the names of such Negroes from the Parish at large as \u201cI figured was fair to this man.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No matter how benevolent and well-intentioned the jury commissioners may have been, the accused cannot be required to accept their individual sense of fairness in the place of the equal protection <em>of the laws </em>to which he is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">We conclude that in the organization of the grand jury which indicted Collins, there was discrimination against him because of his race or color.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Since the judgment of the district court must be reversed and the cause remanded to await a possible reindictment and retrial of Collins, it is not absolutely necessary to decide the other two questions presented by this appeal. True, those questions will probably arise on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>any subsequent retrial of Collins. Hence, sound judicial administration would ordinarily require that they be considered on this appeal. The difficulty, however, is that, in our opinion, the record is not adequate for their determination. We think that, under the principles heretofore stated [335 F.2d p. 430], the district court erred in not affording Collins an evidentiary hearing on those two questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Perhaps the most important factual consideration upon which each of those questions must be determined is Collins\u2019 mental capacity. Dr. Charles E. Sturm, the psychiatrist in charge of the State Criminal Colony at the State Hospital in Jackson, Louisiana, when first introduced as a witness, testified that, accepting the three classifications of moron, imbecile and idiot, he would classify Collins as an imbecile with a mental age range in the vicinity of ten to twelve; that Collins had an I.Q. of 63 (R. p. 170); and that \u201cHis performance would seem to indicate a chronic brain syndrome\u201d (R. p. 176).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Dr. Sturm later testified that in stating Collins\u2019 I.Q. as 63, which would be feeble-minded (R. p. 347), he had relied on a report from a psychologist to whom he had sent Collins for an I.Q. test, a Mr. Lockridge, and that \u201cHe has said that that is not right. He\u2019s told me that today. He has said that it should be something in the vicinity of 80. Now, if that is true, your guess is just as good as mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Dr. Sturm further testified that a Dr. S. L. Pollock of New Orleans had made a neurological and psychological examination of Collins which \u201cruled out\u201d a chronic brain syndrome (R. ,p. 361). Based upon the reports of Dr. Pollock and Mr. Lockridge, Dr. Sturm changed his opinion, and testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">\u201cHe [Dr. Pollock] said that the neurological examination was completely within normal limits and he found no evidence of a chronic brain syndrome. Now, when we got that report, Mr. Lockridge changed his mind. Considering the changing of his mind the IQ went up. So where, in his opinion, it should be in the vicinity of 80 instead of 63. And because the IQ went up to 80 I\u2019ll say that he is not a mental defective case now. He\u2019s just an uneducated colored boy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Neither Mr. Lockridge nor Dr. Pollock testified on the trial in the State court. Their testimony appears only by way of hearsay. The State trial judge commented :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">\u201cDefense counsel did not object to this hearsay information. At the time of the trial Defense Counsel asked to have Mr. Lockridge subpoenaed for the trial of the case. Mr. Lockridge was subpoenaed and was sequestered for two days as a witness during the trial. However, it developed that Mr. Lockridge\u2019s reexamination disclosed that Woodman J. Collins had a substantially higher I.Q. that (sic) the first test indicated. It is perhaps for that reason that the defendant\u2019s counsel did not see fit to call Mr. Lockridge and he was released without testifying.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">The federal district court should not. have relied upon such a record, particularly in a case involving the ultimate issue of life or death. To hold Collins to the ordinary rules of an adversary trial in failing to call Mr. Lockridge as-a witness seems to us, in effect, to prejudge Collins\u2019 mental capacity to stand-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">The present record being so totally inadequate, we forego a decision on the other two questions presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">Notwithstanding our holding that the indictment against Collins is unconstitutional and void, Collins is now legally detained upon his commitment to await the action of another grand jury. Collins is,, of course, entitled to be tried within a reasonable time, and the district court, should retain jurisdiction to meet the-unlikely event that further orders andi judgments may be necessary or proper.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>This Court expresses its present opinion that a period of eight months from and after the entry of this judgment or its final test by certiorari, or otherwise, will be sufficient to afford the State of Louisiana an opportunity to take the necessary steps to reindict and retry Collins.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Any such reindictment must of course be by a grand jury from which Negroes have been neither systematically excluded nor included. For the guidance \u2022of the parties, the Court expresses the present opinion that if Collins is rein-dicted and retried and if any question should arise as to the legality or constitutionality of such indictment or trial, \u2022that should be decided not upon the present petition but in the regular course by the Courts of the State of Louisiana, .subject to possible review by the Supreme Court of the United States or upon other habeas corpus proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The judgment of the district court is reversed, judgment here rendered in accordance with the holdings of this opinion, and the cause remanded for any further proceedings which may be found necessary or proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Reversed, rendered, and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\">. Mr. Strohe, the member of the Jury Commission from Wards 6 and 7, testified that there were very few Negroes in Ward 7, but about 30% of the population of Ward 6 was colored. He further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">\u201cQ. * * * Now, do you recall how many Negroes were put on the grand jury venire of twenty names which is the present grand jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">\u201cA.

Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 553, 9 L.Ed. 773, in an unbroken line of cases, that Court has refused to consider constitutional questions when the record discloses other grounds for decision, whether \u2022or not they properly were raised by the parties. Some of the later cases reiterating this fundamental principle of judicial action are Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U.S. 549, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 91 L.Ed. 1666 (1947) (which at 331 U.S. 568-575, 67 S.Ct. 1419-1423 sets forth .all of the cogent reasons for this policy); Peters v. Hobby, 349 U.S. 331, at 338, 75 S.Ct. 790, 99 L.Ed. 1129 (1955); Neese v. So. Ry. Co., 350 U.S. 77, 76 S.Ct. 131, 100 L.Ed. 60 (1955); Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, 363 U.S. 207, 80 S.Ct. 1222, 4 L.Ed.2d 1170 (1960) vacating judgment at 265 F.2d 522 (5 Cir.); and, most recently, Bush v. Texas, 372 U.S. 586, at 590, 83 S.Ct. 922, 9 L.Ed.2d 958, (decided March 25,1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">In at least two decisions by this Court in recent years, this principle has been followed: Byers v. Byers, 5 Cir., 254 F.2d 205 (1958); and Lone Star Import, Inc. v. Citroen Cars Corp., 5 Cir., 288 F.2d 69 (1961), where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">\u201c * * * Whatever may be the temptations \u2014 or the inability to resist them \u2014 in adjudicating ordinary matters either of fact or statutory construction courts are especially cautioned against the determination of constitutional questions not inescapably presented where some other basis less profound is actually available as a ground of disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-13\">* * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">Here, although mentioned in passing, and not the basis for the majority opinion, reference has been made to a simple <em>legal </em>ground upon which I think we ought to decree the nullity of the indictment under which appellant was convicted, without reaching the constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-15\">LSA-R.S. 15:180 provides the method by which State grand juries shall be drawn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-16\">\u201cImmediately after completing the general venire list, the commission <em>shall </em>select <em>therefrom </em>the names of twenty citizens, possessing the qualifications of grand jurors, to be taken from different portions of the parish, as far as practicable, who shall be subject to duty as grand jurors during the term of six months after the grand jury is impaneled and until a succeeding grand jury shall have been impaneled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-17\">\u201cThe names of the persons so selected shall be written on slips of paper, by the clerk, in the presence of the commissioners and they shall place the slips in an envelope, seal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the same and indorse thereon the words: \u2018List of Grand Jurors.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">It is to he noted that this statute expressly provides that the jury commission \u201cshall\u201d select the twenty persons from which the grand jury is drawn from the \u201cgeneral venire list\u201d of 300 persons, provided for by LSA-R.S. 15:-179. The word \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory, as so used. The Louisiana Supreme Court lias held in two cases that where the Legislature, in establishing the method by which grand juries are to be drawn, uses \u201cthe word \u201cshall,\u201d such is mandatory, mot merely directory, language; and if mot followed literally, any indictments Teturned by such illegally constituted bodies are absolute nullities. State v. Kifer, 186 La. 674, 173 So. 169, 110 A.L.R. 1017 (1937) and State v. McLean, 211 La. 413, 30 So.2d 187 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">In this case, as pointed out by the majority opinion, the jury commissioners violated the express, mandatory requirement of the statute in <em>not </em>selecting the 20 names from the \u201cgeneral venire list.\u201d Instead they selected the names of 20 persons in addition to the three hundred on the general list. Therefore, having violated the State law, in my opinion, and according to the Louisiana jurisprudence, this indictment was a nullity. It is on that basis \u2014 -and that alone \u2014 that I respectfully, and with full deference to the majority, submit that we should base our ruling. It is a mistake, I feel, that the constitutional question is considered at all; and it is my further opinion, without elaborating,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that the majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>is basing its constitutional ruling upon dicta in Cassell, since that case involved systematic exclusion, not inclusion of Negroes.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Otherwise, I fully agree with what the majority has said, and hereby enter my special concurrence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-6\"><em> </em>It is difficult, indeed, to reconcile this Court\u2019s present holding that there constitutionally can he no \u201cconscious inclusion\u201d of Negroes on jury lists with earlier statements by the Supreme Court, <em>and by this Go-urt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In Hill v. Texas, 316 U.S. 400, 62 S. Ct. 1159, 86 L.Ed. 1559 (1942), then \u2022Chief Justice Stone, speaking for a unanimous Court, made the following statement at 316 U.S. 404, 62 S.Ct.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">\u201cWe think petitioner made out a prima facie case, which the state failed to meet, of racial discrimination in the selection of grand jurors which the equal protection clause forbids. As we pointed out in Smith v. Texas, supra, 311 U.S. 131 [61 S.Ct. 165, 85 L.Ed. 84], chance or accident could hardly have accounted for the continuous omission of negroes from the grand jury lists for so long a period as sixteen years or more. <em>The jury commissioners, although the matter was discussed by them, consciously \u25a0omitted to place the name of any negro on the jury list. They made no effort to ascertain whether there were within the county members of the colored race qualified to serve \u25a0as jurors, and if so who they were. They thus failed to perform their \u2022constitutional duty </em>\u2014 recognized <em>by </em>\u2022\u00a7 J <em>of the Givil Rights Act of March 1, 1875, 8 U.S.G. </em>\u00a7 <em>U, 8 U.S.G.A. </em>\u00a7 <em>and fully established \u25a0since the decision in 1881 of Neal v. Delaware, supra </em>\u2014 not <em>to pursue \u2022a course of conduct in the administration of their office which would operate to discriminate in the selection of jurors on racial grounds. Discrimination can arise from the action of commissioners who exclude all negroes whom they do not Jcnoio to be qualified and toho neither lenoto nor seelc to learn whether there are in fact any qualified to serve. In such a case discrimination necessarily results where there are qualified negroes available for jury service. * </em>* * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atl-dedup-0\">On May 30, 1962 (reh. den. June 29, 1962), in United States v. Wiman, 304 F.2d 53, at page 60, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a_e-dedup-0\">\u201cPrior to 1960, the Commissioners personally handed out the majority of the pink application cards (the remaining applicants came by the office), and they handed them out only one at a time to individuals whom they knew, although on one or two occasions Commissioner Allen thought he had asked a Negro minister for the names of qualified Negroes. The only sources of Negro applicants the Commissioners could name were the waiters at Morrison\u2019s Cafeteria, the Negroes working at the downtown hotels, those at the shoe shine parlors, mail carriers, and a few they came in contact with through business. Commissioner Allen noted that they often choose names from the rosters of various organizations such as the Junior Chamber of Commerce or the Kiwanis Club. When asked if he had ever used the roster of a Negro club or association, he replied no, that no one had ever given him one. Both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Commissioners admitted that the bulk of their friends, social contacts, and acquaintances were white. <em>On the basis of this evidence we see no sufficient effort to solicit the names of qualified Negroes beyond the admittedly narrow circle of ordinary contacts of the Commissioners.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AII\">To say the least, jury commissioners are being placed in a virtually insoluble dilemma, where a constitutional jury-list may be an impossibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
