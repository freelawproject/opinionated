The years 1956-1959 inclusive are involved. Ack-erman v. United States (D.C.N.D.Tex. 1963) 215 F.Supp. 867. The essential question is whether the taxpayer was holding certain real property, the proceeds from the sale of which are here involved, \u201cprimarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This oft-litigated question is complicated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the circuitous route which the title to the property involved has followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">On June 17, 1954, taxpayer purchased from Lee Ackerman Enterprises, an Arizona Corporation wholly owned by Lee Ackerman, taxpayer\u2019s brother who was an Arizona real estate developer, an undivided one-fourth interest in approximately 4,280 acres of desert land located about 16 miles north of Phoenix, Arizona, which was known as the Sam Joy Ranch. A one-fourth undivided interest was also conveyed by the same corporation to each of the following: (1) Acker-man &amp; Rich, Inc., Realty &amp; Development, owned by taxpayer\u2019s brother and another; (2) Lorenz and Joan Anderman; (3) Jessie, Mildred and Norman Alpert.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Two months after buying the property (August 17, 1954), taxpayer at the request of his brother, obtained a disclaimer deed from his wife \u201cto facilitate any transaction that might occur.\u201d Sometime prior to May 11, 1955, less than eleven months after purchasing the property, taxpayer and the \u2022 other owners-\u201cdecided to hold this property for sale to customers.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On May 11, 1955, Desert Hills Development Company, Inc. (Desert Hills) was formed for the purpose of improving and selling the property. Taxpayer and the other owners of the property owned 18 of the 24 shares <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of stock in Desert Hills, and the affairs of the corporation were handled largely by taxpayer\u2019s brother, who testified that he had developed over two million acres of property in his career.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">Taxpayer and the other owners of the property conveyed title to a trust company to hold as trustee. The record shows that the purpose of this trust was to expedite the subdivision of the property. On September 1, 1955, a one year option was then given to Desert Hills to purchase the land for $150.00 an acre. On October 7, 1955, slightly over one month later and approximately eleven months before the $150.00 option was to expire, a second option agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>which superseded the first one, was given to Desert Hills to purchase the same land for $200.00 per acre. The two option agreements mentioned were introduced in evidence by the Government. Except for the increase in price of $50.00 per acre, they are identical. Still a third option was executed on October 9, 1956, substantially the same as the other two, with the exception that the option price was increased again, this time from $200.00 to $400.00 per acre. A second trust was set up to facilitate the conveyancing under the option and the trustee was directed by taxpayer and the other owners to take instructions relative thereto from Lee Ackerman, taxpayer\u2019s brother. No lots were ever sold at the cheaper price of $150.00 per acre, although the first option ran for a year. Of the 3,150 acres sold during the three years 1955-57, 2,870 acres were sold at $200.00 per acre and 280 acres at $400.00 per acre. When asked why Desert Hills had so willingly given up $50.00 per acre, taxpayer answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that, * * * \u201d Desert Hills was capitalized with $2,400.00, but shortly thereafter obtained loans of $50,-000.00 and $25,000.00 from the trust company. The taxpayer and the other owners subordinated their rights as beneficiaries under the trust as security for these loans to Desert Hills.</p>\n<p id=\"AzgY\">Beginning in October of 1955, the property was divided into 10 acre lots, stakes were set out, lots were numbered and identified, bladed roads were constructed, and a gatehouse was built. Desert Hills notified brokers in Phoenix that all sales would be made through independent brokers working on a 10% commission basis. There is some evidence that selling activity began and sales were made during \u201cearly summer\u201d in 1955. At any rate, 330 acres were sold in 1955; 2,660 were sold in 1956; and 160 were sold in 1957. Desert Hills never took title to any of the property, but instead would direct the trustee, through taxpayer\u2019s brother, to convey directly to the ultimate purchaser. The record is silent as to the price received by Desert Hills, but no dividends were ever paid. The trustee would divide the receipts among taxpayer and the other owners. Against this record, the taxpayer argues that the trial court was clearly in error in finding that he held the property in question primarily for sale to customers, and in refusing to give credence to his self-serving declaration that he acquired the property as a long term investment with no expectation of selling it for twenty to twenty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\"> At the outset, we must answer taxpayer\u2019s contentions that since he is in the warehousing business, he cannot be subject to the statutory exclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Numerous cases have held that a taxpayer can be in several businesses for tax purposes at one time. Thompson v. C. I. R., (5 Cir. 1963) 322 F.2d 122; Mathews v. Commissioner, (6 Cir. 1963) 317 F.2d 360.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">We next consider taxpayer\u2019s contention that the property was bought to be held as an investment over a long period of years with no purpose to hold it for sale to customers. Even if it were undisputed and unquestioned that taxpayer <em>acquired </em>the property as an investment, the statute excludes from capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>gains treatment property <em>held </em>for sale to customers. In Bauschard v. C. I. R., (6 Cir. 1960) 279 F.2d 115, a case very close in point, the Sixth Circuit held that the lower court\u2019s finding of (1) <em>acquisition </em>of the property for the purpose of protecting the community and surrounding property; and (2) a subsequent <em>holding </em>of the property for sale to customers, was not inconsistent. In Bausehard, taxpayer acquired the property in order to prevent the erection of a project on the property which would have an undesirable influence on the surrounding area.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Title was taken in a trustee. A corporation was formed for the purpose of subdividing and selling the lots. Options were given with a specified price to be paid taxpayer on the sale of each lot. Title was transferred directly from the trustee to the purchaser. The Tax Court found that the property was <em>held </em>primarily for sale to customers and that the proceeds to taxpayer were ordinary income. The Sixth Circuit affirmed, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that the question of whether property sold by a taxpayer at a profit was property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business, within the meaning of the statute, is essentially a question of fact, [citing cases]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201cNecessarily, each case turns upon its own particular facts; no one circumstance or factor is controlling. Friend v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 198 F.2d 285, 287, 46 A.L.R.2d 761; Kal-treider v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 255 F.2d 833, 838; Gudgel v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 273 F.2d 206, 210; Winnick v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 199 F.2d 374. These cases give the major factors to which consideration is given, and it is unnecessary to restate them here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">See also Burgher v. Campbell, (5 Cir. 1957) 244 F.2d 863; and Kaltreider v. C. I. R., (3 Cir. 1959) 255 F.2d 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">More recently, we have recognized the same rule in our own Circuit in the case of Thompson v. C. I. R., (5 Cir. 1963), 322 F.2d 122, in which Judge Brown stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">\u201cBut what was once an investment, or what may start out as a liquidation of an investment, may become something else. The Tax Court was eminently justified in concluding that this took place here. It was a regular part of the trade or business of Taxpayer to sell these lots to any and all comers who would meet his price. From 1944 on when the sales commenced, there is no evidence that he thereafter held the lots for any purpose other than the sale to prospective purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">Several cases have been cited by the taxpayer as lending support to his argument. Rather than distinguish each of them, we reiterate what was said in Thompson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-13\">\u201cIn this prolific field, it would be bootless to attempt a case-by-case distinction. It would be foreboding and unrewarding. We described this process in these words. \u2018We are aware of the decisions holding that various factors here present did not require a determination that property was held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business. But each case must be decided on its own peculiar facts. * * * Specific factors, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>combinations of them are not necessarily controlling.\u2019 Wood v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1960, 276 F.2d 586, 590.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">\u201cWe think it fraught with less hazards for us to emphasize affirmatively the things we regard as significant. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The taxpayer himself testified that he and the other owners had decided to hold the property for sale to customers even prior to the creation of the Desert Hills Corporation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cQ. All right, Your Honor. Now, can you tell me when either your group or the corporation decided to hold this property for sale to customers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201cA. Exactly when ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">\u201cA. No, I don't believe I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">\u201cQ. Was it at the time the corporation was formed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">\u201cA. <em>I think it was prior to the time the corporation was formed, </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">\u201cQ. Prior to the time the corporation was formed, the land was to be held for sale to customers, as I interpret your interpretation of this, it was a corporation who was to do the selling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-13\">\u201cA. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">\u201cQ. Were they going to act at all in your behalf?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">\u201cA. Who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">\u201cQ. The corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-17\">\u201cA. The corporation was going to act in my behalf?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-18\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-19\">\u201cA. For the sale of property ? I don\u2019t understand the question exactly, but I know the corporation was planning to sell the property and this was to my interest as a stockholder, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-20\">The taxpayer further testified that Desert Hills was formed for the purpose of subdividing and selling the property for him and the other owners, (one of whom was admittedly a real estate developer) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-21\">\u201cQ. On this date, one after after (sic) you purchased this property, as I understand your testimony you were going to have the property sold off through or by Desert Hills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-22\">\u201cA. They were going to do the selling of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-23\">\u201cQ. It was still your property, wasn\u2019t it? Did you take title back to this property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-24\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-25\">\u201cQ. Were you the first beneficiaries of this property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-26\">\u201cA. That is what it says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-27\">\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t anybody explain to you the way this transaction would work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-28\">\u201cA. No, sir. That was Arizona law out there, and I didn\u2019t know anything about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-29\">\u201cQ. Let us find out what your purpose was. What were you going to do with this property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-30\">\u201cA. Desert Hills had been formed at that time, and we were planning on having them sell the property in addition to other property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-31\">\u201cQ. Eleven months after you purchased this property, you people formed a corporation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-32\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-33\">\u201cQ. The purpose of the corporation was to take some of this Sam Joy property and improve the property and sell it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-34\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-35\">* * * * * \u25a0*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-36\">\u201cQ. Now, the evidence in this case shows that the Desert Hills acquired an option on the Sam Joy Ranch from you and the other ownei-s on September 1st. Can you tell me why you gave that option? Why you participated in giving, that option on September 1st to Desert Hills Development Company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-37\">\u201cA. Because Desert Hills was going to develop the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-38\">The essential element in the receipt of a capital gain is a <em>sale </em>or <em>ex</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>change</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>of a capital asset. For there to be a sale or exchange there must be a receipt of something valuable. Without getting into the question of whether taxpayer received something valuable at the time Desert Hills purchased the option, or only at the later period when taxpayer received money from the trustee; that is to say, giving .taxpayer the benefit of whichever time would best serve his purpose, the record is clear that at either time taxpayer held the property for sale to customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">One of the chief controverted issues in this case concerns the relationship and dealings between Desert Hills and the owners of Sam Joy Ranch. The Government contends that the evidence convincingly establishes that the four owners of the ranch controlled Desert Hills. It points to the evidence that Lee Acker-man, the taxpayer\u2019s brother, was authorized to act for the four owners; that such owners controlled well over 50% of the stock in Desert Hills; that their interests were subordinated in connection with loans and mortgages; and that Desert Hills surrendered an option from such owners for $150.00 per acre in return for an option for $200.00 per acre. In these circumstances, asserts the Government, the contentions of the taxpayer that he sold the property in a single transaction to only one customer \u2014 Desert Hills \u2014 is without merit, because Desert Hills was acting in behalf of the taxpayer and his associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">The taxpayer relies heavily upon the corporate structure of Desert Hills, and the fact that it is a separate entity. He repeatedly asserts that at all times it was independent, free, disconnected, and not subject to domination or control by the owners of the Ranch.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>We find it impossible to accept the contentions of the taxpayer as to the relationship which existed between the owners of Sam Joy Ranch and Desert Hills. The manenverings which transpired between such owners and Desert Hills do not support the connotation of independence, or arm\u2019s length transactions. The record contains no explanation whatever as to why option No. 1 was superseded by option No. 2 at a time when the period of the first option had almost a year to run. The increase in the per acre price in option No. 2 was $50.00. Involved were over 4,200 acres. The net result of this single transaction, in which option No. 1 was replaced by option No. 2 within a period of about five weeks, was to give the owners of Sam Joy Ranch over $200,000 more for their land. On oral argument, this Court made pointed inquiry about the various options and sought an explanation of the facts relating to the first and second options. No satisfactory explanation has been given. Both options recite a valid and identical consideration. As a matter of fact, all three options state the same consideration. The first option\u2014 the low price \u2014 was never exercised although the other two were exercised. In considering all of the circumstances of this case, the controlling stock ownership in Desert Hills by the owners of Sam Joy Ranch, the facts surrounding the options, and all other factors involved, we cannot reach the conclusion, strongly urged by the taxpayer, that Desert Hills was a separate, independent, uncontrolled, and free entity in its relationship and dealings with the taxpayer and his associates.

That a different measure of taxation should apply to securities held for more than a six-months\u2019 period, and to real estate held for tire same length of time, may, in many cases, and especially in this case, seem unfair to taxpayers.

The following is from taxpayer\u2019s brief: \u201cDesert Hills was organized because there were a number of parcels of property in the particular area, including the Sam Joy Ranch and three or four other properties lying to the east of the Sam Joy Ranch, and Lee Ackerman and the other organizers of Desert Hills felt that if this group of land could be optioned or purchased by Desert Hills a development could be made out of the land. After Desert Hills was organized it offered to take over all of the properties in the area of the Sam Joy Ranch with the idea in mind that if Desert Hills could, by purchase or option, tie up the various parcels in and around the Sam Joy Ranch and if Desert Hills went into a development program it would not have any competition in the area.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b575-6\">.

If the \u2018gain source\u2019 received is money, the transaction is a sale; if something else, it is an exchange.

In Broughton, the court had occasion to assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">\u201c * * * The gain from the sale of property which is excluded from the definition of capital assets is taxable as ordinary income. Thus, the initial issue for determination is whether the Tax Court was correct in holding that the lots held respectively for Mr. Broughton and Mrs. Broughton were held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of their trade or business. This issue is essentially a factual one, the determination of which necessarily depends upon the facts and circumstances in eaeb particular case and no one fact or circumstance is controlling. Bauschard v. Commissioner, 279 F.2d 115 (C.C.A. 6, 1960). The factors wMch are usually applicable in making such a determination were summarized by this Court in Mathews v. Commissioner, 315 F.2d 101 (C.C.A.6, 1963). Among the factors there pointed out to be considered are (1) the purpose for which the property was acquired; (2)' the purpose for which the property was held; (3) the improvements and their extent, which were made to the property by the taxpayer; (4) the frequency, number, and continuity of sales; (5) the extent and substantiality of the transaction; (6) the nature and extent of the business of the taxpayers; (7) the extent of advertising to promote sales, or the lack of such advertising; (8) the listing, if any, of the property for sale directly or through brokers.

Commissioner, 279 F.2d 115 (C.C.A.6, 1960). \u201cA factual determination by the Tax Court upon the issue now before thisCoui\u2019t may not be set aside upon appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.
