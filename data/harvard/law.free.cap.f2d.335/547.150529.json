By motion filed under 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2255 he now seeks to attack the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction, asserts error in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury and claims error and prejudice from designated questions asked by the trial court during the course of the trial. He also contends he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at the trial. The trial court denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"AOAz\"> We affirm the judgment. Our review of the record indicates appellant received adequate representation from counsel. His remaining contentions pertain only to claimed trial errors and are not properly raised under section 2255. Carrillo v. United States, 10 Cir., 332 F. 2d 202; Johnston v. United States, 10 Cir., 331 F.2d 997; Fennell v. United States, 10 Cir., 313 F.2d 941.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
