We must decline the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The taxpayer, Otto C. Doering, Jr., had long owned stock, ultimately 20%, of Argosy Pictures Corporation, which was engaged in producing motion pictures. In 1950 Argosy contracted with Republic Pictures Corporation for the latter to distribute and exhibit three pictures which Argosy was to produce; Argosy was to receive a specified portion of Republic\u2019s profits from distribution and exhibition. Argosy completed the pictures by the end of 1952. A dispute as to the amount payable by Republic shortly ensued. Over a three-year period Argosy paid substantial fees and disbursements to the attorneys representing it in the dispute. An accounting firm thought Argosy was entitled to $1,000,000 more than Republic had remitted; Republic contended it had overpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In January, 1956, Argosy was dissolved. Each stockholder received his share of its cash, $12,822.05 in Doering\u2019s case, and of the claim against Republic. It is stipulated that the claim against Republic had no ascertainable market value when Argosy was dissolved. The former stockholders retained the same law firm that had represented Argosy to effect collection from Republic; in order to meet anticipated legal expenses, they deposited the cash they received with Bankers Trust Company, which was also to act as agent to receive and disburse any recovery. Negotiations conducted by the attorneys led to Republic\u2019s paying $540,000 in final settlement in December, 1956. Bankers Trust Company credited Doering, on his 20% share, with $108,-000, which it paid over to him after deducting $6,360 and $400 to cover his portion of the fees for legal and banking services.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Doering\u2019s 1956 return reported the excess of $120,822.05 over the basis of his stock as proceeds from the sale or exchange of a long-term capital asset, I.R. C., \u00a7\u00a7 331(a) (1), 1001, 1002, 1011, 1012, taxable at 25 % under the \u201calternative tax\u201d of \u00a7 1201 (b). He deducted the amounts he had paid the attorneys and the Trust Company as \u201cordinary and necessary expenses * * * for the production or collection of income\u201d under \u00a7 212(1). The Commissioner disallowed the deduction, asserting that because, under the rule of C. I. R. v. Carter, 170 F.2d 911 (2 Cir. 1948) and Westover v. Smith, 173 F.2d 90 (9 Cir. 1949), cf. Burnet v. Logan, 283 U.S. 404, 51 S.Ct. 550, 75 L.Ed. 1143 (1931), the amount collected by Doering from Republic was taxable at the rate applicable to long-term capital gains, the fees were capital in nature and should be subtracted from the gross amount received for the stock. The Tax Court sustained the taxpayer, four judges dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">\u201cCollection of income\u201d would seem to have been the precise purpose for which the fees were paid. Argosy\u2019s claim against Republic did not arise from the sale of a capital asset but from the grant of the right to distribute and exhibit its films. The Commissioner concedes that Argosy\u2019s receipts from Republic were taxable as ordinary income and that its legal expenses in effectuating collection were \u201cordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in carrying on its trade or business\u201d under \u00a7 162 and its predecessor. If Argosy had remained in business through 1956, the very legal fees here at issue would thus have been deductible under \u00a7 162. If at the outset Argosy had paid the attorneys a lump sum for all the work to be done in achieving a final disposition of the claim, that also would have been deductible under \u00a7 162, even though, as a result of the subsequent dissolution, the avails all went to the stockholders; assuming that Argosy had off-setting income, the economic impact of the legal fees here at issue thus would have been only 48% of the sum paid. More important, counsel for the Commissioner admitted at the argument that, had Doering\u2019s claim been susceptible of valuation at the time of liquidation, any excess subsequently realized by virtue of further negotiation or litigation would be taxable as ordinary income and the legal fees would be deductible under \u00a7 212(1). No different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>conclusion with respect to the tax status of the legal fees is warranted by the fact that in this case \u201cwhere the property distributed on liquidation has no ascertainable fair market value, the transaction is held open for tax purposes, and subsequent payments, being treated as part of the liquidation, are taxed as capital gains.\u201d Campagna v. United States, 290 F.2d 682, 684 (2 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">What is critical under the statute is what the stockholders were trying to get, not the rate at which Congress chose to tax what they got. Ticket Office Equipment Co. v. C. I. R., 20 T.C. 272, 280 (1953), aff\u2019d on other grounds, 213 F.2d 318 (2 Cir. 1954) ; United States v. Pate, 254 F.2d 480 (10 Cir. 1958) ; contra, Towanda Textiles, Inc. v. United States, 180 F.Supp. 373 (Ct.Cl.1960), Judge Littleton dissenting. To be sure, the Commissioner is right that the word \u201cincome\u201d in \u00a7 212(1) is not to be given a wholly literal reading. If a taxpayer sells securities or other capital assets, \u00a7 212(1) does not permit him to deduct expenses of sale even though the sale produces a gain which constitutes \u201cgross income,\u201d \u00a7 61(a) (3), Davis v. C. I. R., 151 F.2d 441 (8 Cir. 1945), cert. denied, 327 U.S. 783, 66 S.Ct. 682, 90 L.Ed. 1010 (1946) \u2014 any more than the provision for deduction of business expenses had permitted a similar deduction, Spreckels v. C. I. R., 315 U.S. 626, 62 S.Ct. 777, 86 L.Ed. 1073 (1942) ; Isaac G. Johnson &amp; Co. v. United States, 149 F.2d 851 (2 Cir. 1945). Similarly, the allowance in \u00a7 212(2) of a deduction for expenses paid or incurred \u201cfor the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income,\u201d did not oust the established rule requiring capitalization of expenditures in defense of the title to property. Bowers v. Lumpkin, 140 F.2d 927 (4 Cir.), cert. denied, 322 U.S. 755, 64 S.Ct. 1266, 88 L.Ed. 1585 (1944); see Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation (1960 revision), \u00a7 25A.16, and compare Danskin, Inc. v. C. I. R., 331 F.2d 360 (2 Cir. 1964). But neither of these principles carries the day for the Commissioner in this case. The only disposition of a capital asset here was the exchange of Doering\u2019s stock in Argosy for a share of the company\u2019s assets; the further payments from Republic were eligible for the alternative tax of \u00a7 1201 (b), not because they represented the sale or exchange of a capital asset but because their collection constituted part of the \u201cgain from the sale or other disposition,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 1001(a), of Doering\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">Munson v. McGinnes, 283 F.2d 333 (3 Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 880, 81 S.Ct. 171, 5 L.Ed.2d 103 (1960), followed in Spangler v. C. I. R., 323 F.2d 913, 921 (9 Cir. 1963), much relied on by the Commissioner, does not assist him. The Third Circuit there concluded that legal expenses incurred by a seller in avoiding a sale induced by the buyer\u2019s fraud and obtaining a higher price was \u201cthe kind of selling expense which must be capitalized,\u201d since the problem was still \u201cto reach mutually satisfactory or binding terms of sale.\u201d 283 F.2d at 335. Judge Hastie carefully differentiated true cases of \u201ccollection\u201d of income; on that basis he distinguished Naylor v. C. I. R., 203 F.2d 346 (5 Cir. 1953), which held that legal fees incurred in collecting the amount claimed to be due-under a contract of sale qualified for deduction under the predecessor of \u00a7 212\u2019 (1), even though the sale was of a capital asset. Doering naturally relies on Naylor but neither he nor we need go so far;. we leave open whether we would follow that decision on facts such as were there-presented. The decision of this Court, in Isaac G. Johnson &amp; Co. v. United States, supra, 149 F.2d 851, relied upon by our dissenting brother, went upon the ground that the expenses there in question were \u201cincident to a sale of a capital asset.\u201d See footnote 4, p. 852. Neither of these ingredients is present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">It is quite true that for taxpayers whose income attains brackets attracting rates considerably above 25%, the result reached by the Tax Court makes the economic bite of the expenses much softer than if these were required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>to be deducted from the receipts. But it is equally true that the position urged by the Commissioner could produce a seemingly unjustifiable difference in result between a case like the present and one where the corporation had paid the legal fees before the distribution; and concentration of attention on the tax benefit of deductions may sometimes obscure that what the taxpayer would truly have liked was not to have to make the payment at all.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In any event it is not appropriate for courts to deny benefits to which taxpayers are entitled under a normal reading of the words used by Congress in the absence of clear evidence of contrary Congressional purpose. Hanover Bank v. C. I. R., 369 U.S. 672, 687, 82 S.Ct. 1080 (1962). We find nothing to indicate that Congress meant to eliminate from \u00a7 212 expenses coming within the ordinary meaning of the language save those, such as expenses of purchasing and selling, in defense of title, and other capital expenditures (e. g., for improvements), which had long been banned under \u00a7 162 and its predecessors. In fact the legislative history is rather unfavorable to the Commissioner\u2019s position. The Committee Reports on the bill adding what has become \u00a7 212 stated that \u201cThe term \u2018income\u2019 * * * is not confined to recurring income but applies as well to gain from the disposition of property.\u201d 77th Cong.2d Sess., H. R.Rep.No.2333, 75, S.Rep.No.1631,</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">87 (1942). Consistent with this the Regulations, \u00a7 1.212-1 (b), say that when the section speaks of \u201cincome,\u201d it \u201cis not confined to recurring income but applies as well to gains from the disposition of property\u201d and gives as an example the purchase of defaulted bonds \u201cwith the expectation of realizing capital gain on their resale, even though no current yield thereon is anticipated.\u201d The Regulations do rule out \u201c(k) Expenses paid or incurred in defending title to property * * and \u201c(n) Capital expenditures * * but Doering\u2019s payments do not fall under these rubrics.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">. In large measure this is the answer to the hypothetical case put in the dissent in the Tax Court, to which our brother Hays refers \u2014 a set of facts that may seem a shade academic to lawyers who have had to collect fees for making collections. The hypothetical taxpayer would be out of pocket not only for the $27,000 tax for which (assuming a zero basis) he would have been liable even if he had collected the claim without expense, but also for a part of the legal fees; we fail to see why justice so palpably requires that he realize a net of only $28,500 rather than of $81,000 less whatever portion of the $70,000 legal fees was not saved by deduction from ordinary income that we should refuse to apply the language of the Internal Revenue Code in its ordinary and established sense. Unlike the taxpayers in Hanover Bank v. C. I. R., 369 U.S. 672, 82 S.Ct. 1080, 8 L.Ed. 2d 187 (1962), Doering did not initiate a capital transaction for the deliberate purpose of registering an ordinary loss; yet there the deduction was allowed, because Congress had said it should be. The statement that the majority view of the Tax Court would have the result in the hypothetical case that \u201ca transaction actually producing a net profit would appear on the return as a net loss\u201d overlooks that the issue concerns two transactions \u2014 the exchange of taxpayer\u2019s stock for a claim and the collection of the claim. The availability of the 25% tax rate stems from the first transaction; the deductibility of the legal expense from the second.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b790-11\">HAYS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AI45\">(dissenting);</p>\n<p id=\"b790-12\">The majority opinion rests on the language of the statute. \u201c \u2018Collection of income\u2019 would seem to have been the precise purpose for which the fees were paid.\u201d But the attitude of assurance conveyed by this resort to literalism is considerably shaken when we examine the authorities. The majority opinion itself concedes that \u201cincome\u201d \u201cis not to be given a wholly literal reading,\u201d citing cases in which \u00a7 212(1) was not applied to expenditures for the \u201ccollection of income.\u201d Davis v. C. I. R., 151 F.2d 441 (8th Cir. 1945), cert. denied, 327 U.S. 783, 66 S.Ct. 682 (1946) ; Spreckels v. C. I. R., 315 U.S. 626, 62 S.Ct. 777 (1942); Isaac G. Johnson &amp; Co. v. United States, 149 F.2d 851 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>1945). One might also refer to United States v. Gilmore, 372 U.S. 39, 44-46, 82 S.Ct. 623, 9 L.Ed.2d 570 (1963); Lewis v. C. I. R., 253 F.2d 821, 825 (2d Cir. 1958); General Bancshares Corp. v. C. I. R., 326 F.2d 712 (8th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">In fact the only authority cited for the majority\u2019s position is Naylor v. C. I. R., 203 F.2d 346 (5th Cir. 1953), a decision, the soundness of which is questioned in Spangler v. C. I. R., 323 F.2d 913, 919-20 n. 15 (9th Cir. 1963), which is characterized by Mertens as \u201cquestionable\u201d (4 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 25A.12 fn. 40 (1960 revision)), and about which the majority itself leaves open the question as to whether this court would follow it on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The majority is sure that the transaction here in question must be characterized for the purpose of \u00a7 212(1) as the collection of income because the amount collected would have been income if Argosy had not been liquidated and its assets distributed. But Argosy <em>was </em>liquidated and the payment to the taxpayer was in fact a part of the distribution of its assets. As the government says in its Brief \u201cnot only was the capital transaction open when the contested expenses were incurred, but they also had their origin in the liquidation exchange and were an essential incident to that transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The conclusion that the legal expenses must be capitalized is vividly emphasized by the hypothetical situation set forth by Judge Raum\u2019s dissent in the Tax Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">\u201cIf, for example, the expenses herein were $70,000, we would have the strange result that at most only $54,000 would be reportable as income (one-half of the $108,000 proceeds, by reason of the capital gains provisions) whereas a deduction of $70,000 would be allowable under the Court\u2019s decision. Thus, a transaction actually producing a net profit would appear on the return as a net loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">Surely we are not compelled to read the statute in a way that will produce so bizarre a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">If it were well established by judicial construction of Section 212(1) that an ordinary deduction could be taken for legal expenses incurred in factual circumstances such as those before this court, we should of course hesitate to introduce uncertainty into the tax law by reaching a contrary result. But the court is presented here with a unique situation and prior decisions dealing with similar circumstances are sharply in conflict. See, e. g., Naylor v. C. I. R., supra; Munson v. McGinnes, 283 F.2d 333 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 880, 81 S.Ct. 171 (1960); Spangler v. C. I. R., supra; United States v. Pate, 254 F.2d 480 (10th Cir. 1958); Towanda Textiles, Inc. v. United States, 180 F.Supp. 373 (Ct.Cl. 1960) (3-1).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">The decision of this circuit that is closest in point is Isaac G. Johnson &amp; Co. v. United States, 149 F.2d 851 (2d Cir. 1945), which held that legal expenses in a condemnation proceeding must be capitalized. Accord, Williams v. Burnet, 61 App.D.C. 181, 59 F.2d 357 (1932). Under state law title vested in the state upon the initiation of the condemnation proceedings; the subsequent litigation was concerned only with determining the amount of compensation required under the standard of fair market value.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This decision is patently antithetical to Naylor v. C. I. R., supra. In both the \u201csale\u201d had been consummated and all that remained was to settle a dispute concerning the \u201csales\u201d price \u2014 \u201cbook value\u201d in one case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>\u201cfair market value\u201d in the other. That is also the situation in the present case, the dispute being over what constitutes the \u201cprofits\u201d of Republic in which Argosy was to share.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The controlling principle in this case is that stated in Towanda Textiles, Inc. v. United States, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-5\">\u201cFor many years it has been recognized that fees incurred in realizing a capital gain must be deducted from the gross amount received to arrive at the net gain for tax purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">180 F.Supp. at 377. That principle, which was the foundation of this court\u2019s decision in Isaac G. Johnson &amp; Co. v. United States, supra, requires us to rule for the Commissioner in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">I would reverse the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-9\">. The taxpayer was also required to prove its prior title in order to be entitled to compensation. But, as the district court opinion pointed out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-10\">\u201cProduction of the recorded deed proved title prima facie and that required no lawyer and the litigation could not bave proceeded without such initial proof; so the expenses cannot be said to have gone to defend or fortify title * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbKy\">Isaac G. Johnson &amp; Co. v. United States, 55 F.Supp. 764, 765 (S.D.N.Y.1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
