At the time he was a pedestrian crossing U.S. No. 1 Highway, near the main entrance to the Quantieo, Virginia, Marine Schools, proceeding from the east to the west side. Defendant\u2019s ear was headed north in the inner lane of the four-track roadway. The District Court directed a verdict for the defendant, believing that the evidence indisputably showed the pedestrian contributorily negligent, in that he moved suddenly' and swiftly without warning into the path of the oncoming ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">On this appeal of the plaintiff, we think the question of contributory negligence was a jury issue. Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to him, it cannot be said that reasonable men could not disagree upon the determination of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">The judgment in review will be reversed and the action remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-19\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
