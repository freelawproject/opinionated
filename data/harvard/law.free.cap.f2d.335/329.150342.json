We think the court had no jurisdiction to enter the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-19\">The day following defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence, the district court, on defendant\u2019s motion, ordered the money turned over to him. We stayed enforcement of the order pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-20\">Admittedly the money was intended for use in violating the revenue laws and was therefore subject to forfeiture \u201cin accordance with * * * laws * * * relating to * * * forfeitures * * * of property * * * for violation of the internal revenue laws.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7302. United States v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 239 F.2d 102, 104 (5th Cir. 1956.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-24\">The Secretary of the Treasury, in accordance with the forfeiture procedure of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7325,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> gave notice of forfeiture. Defendant filed neither a timely claim nor bond with the Secretary within thirty days as required by \u00a7 7325 in order to have his claim tried by the district court in a <em>plenary </em>proceeding. New Hampshire Fire Ins. Co. v. Scanlon, 362 U.S. 404, 80 S.Ct. 843, 4 L.Ed.2d 826 (1960). The district court therefore had no jurisdiction to enter the turnover order. United States v. Grossman, 315 F.2d 94 (2d Cir. 1963), United States v. One 1958 Pontiac Coupe, 298 F.2d 421 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>(7th </em>Cir. 1962). And no consent of government counsel could give that court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">There is no merit in the points made by defendant which presuppose that the order was entered in a criminal case and that the appeal was pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731. A proceeding to determine right to property subject to forfeiture is a civil proceeding. Martin v. United States, 277 F.2d 785 (5th Cir. 1960), Note, <em>Forfeiture of Property Used in Illegal Acts, </em>38 Notre Dame Lawyer 727, 730 (1963). And we need not discuss the Government\u2019s motion in the district court to vacate the order under Rule 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The district court had no jurisdiction to enter the order, and the order is vacated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-15\">. Defendant was charged with wilfully and knowingly failing to pay the special occupational tax on wagering to the United States, and failing to register with and to file Internal Revenue Service Form 11 \u2014 0 to the District Director of Internal Revenue, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b378-16\">. \u00a7 7325 provides that where the goods subject to forfeiture are of the appraised value of $2,500 or less notice shall be published for three weeks in a newspaper \u201cof the district whore the seizure was made\u201d giving description of the \u201carticles and stating the time, place, and cause of their seizure\u201d requiring that a claimant appear and make claim within thirty days from the date of the first publication of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah2\">The claimant within that time may file a $250.00 bond which shall transmit the cause to the United States Attorney for the district for proceeding in the \u201cordinary manner prescribed by law.\u201d See also, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.26 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
