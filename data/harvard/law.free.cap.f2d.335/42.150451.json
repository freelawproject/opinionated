While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>resident in the United States Tibke was twice convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude. By reason of these convictions Tibke was deportable under Section 241(a) (4) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">During the pendency of deportation proceedings against him, Tibke married an American citizen. Although his prior convictions rendered him inadmissible to the United States \u201cfor permanent residence\u201d within the meaning of Section 245, Section 212(g) of the Act authorizes the Attorney General, in his discretion, to waive this ground of excludability for an alien who is the spouse of a United States citizen, if it is established that exclusion would l'esult in extreme hardship to the spouse and that admission of the alien would not be contrary to the national welfare and security of the United States. As a result of his marriage, therefore, Tibke became eligible for relief under Section 212(g), which, if granted, would satisfy the admissibility requirements of Section 245. By his marriage Tibke also acquired a non-quota status. To use the language of Section 245, if that Section is applicable to him, he became \u201celigible to receive an immigrant visa\u201d immediately upon approval of his application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Tibke applied in the pending deportation proceeding for a waiver of exclud-ability under Section 212(g) and an adjustment under Section 245 to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The Special Inquiry Officer denied Tibke\u2019s application, relying on Matter of Da Silva, Interim Dec. No. 1268 (1963), a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, which held that Section 245 afforded relief only to non-immigrants and not to immigrants. On Tibke\u2019s appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, that Board upheld the ruling of the Special Inquiry Officer. Tibke thereupon appealed to this court. Immigration and Nationality Act, \u00a7 106, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a (Supp. V, 1959-63); Foti v. I. N. S., 375 U.S. 217, 84 S.Ct. 306, 11 L.Ed.2d 281 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">On its face the statute seems clear. \u201cAn alien\u201d includes both a non-immigrant and an immigrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless the Board of Immigration Appeals in Matter of Da Silva, supra, held that the statutory development of Section 245 and the relationship of Section 245 to other portions of the statutory framework indicated that Congress did not intend \u201ca change so radical as to make Section 245 apply to aliens lawfully admitted as immigrants as well as non-immigrants.\u201d Substantially the same analysis is urged here by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">We are not persuaded by the material referred to by respondent and the Board of Immigration Appeals that Congress meant anything other than what it said, and we hold that Section 245 applies to all aliens, with the expressly stated exception of alien crewmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">Section 245 was first enacted in 1952 to supplant the administrative procedure known as \u201cpre-examination.\u201d Pre-examination relieved certain aliens, whose status would otherwise not entitle them to remain in the United States, from the hardship and expenses of going abroad for a long wait until an immigration visa was processed. Aliens qualifying for pre-examination \u201chad their eligibility to enter as immigrants determined in this country prior to sending them to Canada where they briefly appeared before a United States consular officer, and then returned to this country with an immigrant visa.\u201d Sen.Rep.No.2133, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 1958, 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News, p. 3698. Section 245 eliminates the perfunctory and needless trip to Canada by permitting eligible aliens to adjust their status while remaining in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the United States throughout the administrative process. The rights conferred by Section 245 are thus wholly procedural; the alien must still satisfy applicable substantive standards and persuade the Attorney General to exercise his discretion favorably.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In the basic 1952 Act, Section 245 provided that the applicant must be \u201can alien who was lawfully admitted to the United States as a bona fide nonimmi-grant and who is continuing to maintain that status.\u201d 66 Stat. 217 (1952). In 1958 the provision was amended to permit as an applicant \u201can alien who was admitted to the United States as a bona fide nonimmigrant,\u201d 72 Stat. 699 (1958), thus deleting the requirement of continuance of the original bona fide non-immigrant status. The present provision, which extends coverage to \u201can alien, other than an alien crewman, who was inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States,\u201d was adopted in 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Board of Immigration Appeals concluded that this statutory history evidenced a concern with the plight of non-immigrants and that the purpose of the 1960 amendment was to eliminate the necessity for the applicant\u2019s original status as a nonimmigrant to have been bona fide \u2014 a requirement that has caused some administrative difficulty, see Matter of B-, 8 I. &amp; N. Dec. 621 (1960) ; Matter of G-, 8 I. &amp; N. Dec. 636 (1960); Matter of A-, 8 I. &amp; N. Dec. 655 (1960); Matter of F-, 8 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 680 (1960) \u2014 rather than to expand coverage to all aliens. Support for this interpretation was found in the heading under which Section 245 continues to be found in the codified statutes, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 (Supp. V, 1959-63), \u201cAdjustment of status of <em>nonimmigrant </em>to that of person admitted for permanent residence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">We think that, on the contrary, the statutory history demonstrates that when Congress intended to limit Section 245 to nonimmigrants it did so without ambiguity and that the change in the statute by the use of the general term \u201can alien\u201d must be given full effect. Had Congress meant to make only the limited change suggested by respondent, it would have been sufficient merely to eliminate the words \u201cbona fide\u201d from the phrase \u201cbona fide nonimmigrant.\u201d Instead the inclusive term \u201can alien\u201d was left unmodified in the statute. In view of the repeated attention given Section 245 by Congress, we can only conclude that it was fully aware of the significance of the language it selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\"> Section headings cannot control the meaning of an enactment that is otherwise clear. United States v. Minker, 350 U.S. 179, 185, 76 S.Ct. 281, 100 L.Ed. 185 (1956) ; Lapina v. Williams, 232 U.S. 78, 92, 34 S.Ct. 196, 58 L.Ed. 515 (1914) (use of word \u201cimmigration\u201d in title of act cannot limit to alien immigrants application of provision respecting \u201caliens\u201d). The consideration to be given a section heading is particularly slight when, as here, it is included in a codification that has not been enacted as positive law and does not appear in the amending statute, 74 Stat. 505 (1960). See Osborn v. United States, 322 F.2d 835, 839 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-14\">We have not been cited to anything in the legislative history of the 1960 amendment which would support the position of respondent. If anything, the legislative history compels a contrary conclusion. The Senate Report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-15\">\u201cSection 10 of the joint resolution, as amended, would amend section 245(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act which authorizes the Attorney General under certain circumstances to adjust the status of an alien who was admitted into the United States as a <em>bona fide nonim-migrant </em>to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Under the proposed amendment to section 245(a) the procedure for the adjustment of the immigration status of aliens to that of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence would be broadened so as to include <em>all aliens </em>(other than alien crewmen) who have been inspected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>and admitted or who have been paroled into the United States, thereby providing considerably more flexibility in the administration of the law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQW\">Sen.Rep.No.1651, 86th Cong., 2d Sess., 1960, 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News, pp. 3146-3147. A substantially identical statement was contained in a letter from Lawrence E. Walsh, Deputy Attorney General, reprinted in id. at page 3142.</p>\n<p id=\"A_X\">The point most vigorously pressed by respondent is the contention that an interpretation that would extend relief under Section 245 to immigrants as well as nonimmigrants would disrupt the statutory scheme by \u201cmak[ing] a dead letter, in most cases, of the suspension of deportation statute,\u201d Section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 54 (Supp. V, 1959 63), which affords a remedy similar to that obtain-a e under See 245.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7x\">In many respects the requirements imposed by Section 244 are more stringent than those prescribed by Section 245. For example, an alien in Tibke\u2019s situation seeking relief under Section 244 would have to show that he had been physically present in the United States and had been a person of good moral character for a continuous period of not less than ten years immediately following the commission of the crimes constituting the ground of deportation and that deportation would \u201cresult in exeeptional and extremely unusual hardship to [himself] or to his spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d Even so, the alien wouId ultimately still be deported ^ Congress, upon receiving a report of the Attorney General\u2019s decision, did not. Pass a concurrent resolution favoring suspension of deportation. Tibke cannot satisfy the requirement of ten years continuous residence and thus is not. eligible for relief under Section 244.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Z\">ReSp0ndent argues that it would be anomaious to permit immigrants to apply under Section 245 and thereby to sidestep the restrictions so carefully embodied in Section 244. Since Tibke\u2019s case is specifically covered by Section 244, the argument continues, that provision should prevail over Section 245 under the principle that \u201c[g]eneral language of a statutory revision, although broad enough to include it, will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.\u201d D. Ginsburg &amp; Sons v. Popkin, 285 U.S. 204, 208, 52 S.Ct. 322, 323, 76 L.Ed. 704 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The difficulty with respondent\u2019s argument is that it proves too much. Section 244, which, like Section 245, identifies an eligible applicant as \u201can alien,\u201d provides a remedy for nonimmigrants as well as immigrants. Fong v. I. N. S., 308 F.2d 191 (9th Cir. 1962). Yet under present administrative practice a nonimmigrant deportable for the same reason as Tibke \u2014 conviction of two ci\u2019imes involving moral turpitude \u2014 is eligible to seek relief under Section 245. Matter of M-, 8 I. &amp; N. Dec. 285 (1959); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.1 (1964 Supp.). If the construction adopted by this court would create an anomaly in the future with regard to immigrants, such an anomaly presently exists as to nonimmigrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Moreover it is by no means self-evident that it would be anomalous for aliens to be eligible for relief under both sections. While Section 244 is in some respects more restrictive than Section 245, in others it is more liberal. For example, eligibility for suspension of deportation under Section 244 can be established by a showing of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien himself; Section 245 relief is available to an alien deportable on grounds of criminality only if deportation would cause extreme hardship to the alien\u2019s lawfully resident or citizen spouse, parent, or child. Section 244 does not require, as does Section 245, that \u201c[an] immigrant visa [be] immediately available to [the alien] at the time his application is approved.\u201d Thus Section 244 may permit an alien present in the United States, perhaps through an illegal entry, to obtain a preference over his countrymen who have patiently awaited the granting of a visa from an oversubscribed quota. That Congress was concerned with this possibility and retained a veto power under Section 244, see H.R.Rep.No.1365, 1952, 2 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News, p. 1718, does not mean it would be anomalous to interpret Section 245 so that the two provisions overlap to some extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">In enacting the 1960 amendment to Section 245, Congress had the objective of \u201cproviding considerably more flexibility in the administration of the law.\u201d Sen.Rep.No.1651, 1960, 2 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News, p. 3147. Such a remedial provision should not be construed strictly. Cf. Costello v. I. N. S., 376 U.S. 120, 128, 84 S.Ct. 580, 11 L.Ed. 2d 559 (1964). Whether we read Section 245 separately or together with Section 244, on its face or in the context of the legislative and statutory history, we are impelled to the conclusion that Section 245 affords relief to immigrants as well as nonimmigrants. Accordingly, the judgment of the Board of Immigration Appeals must be reversed and the cause remanded to the Special Inquiry Officer for the exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\">.
