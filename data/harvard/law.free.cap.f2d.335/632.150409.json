The District Courtconcluded as a matter of law that the judgment of the State District Court was void and subject to collateral attack. Falsetti v. Indiana Oil Purchasing Co., 215 F.Supp. 420 (D.C.N.D.Tex.1963). The controversy concerns the title to certain land situated in Brazoria County, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">This suit was filed by plaintiffs Fal-setti, et al. against Stella Marie Lowman et vir., Indiana Oil Purchasing Company, Pan American Petroleum Corporation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and John (Johnnie) Frank, Trustee, to recover royalty payments held in suspense by defendant oil companies. The controlling issue is whether the state court judgment was rendered in violation of Article 1982, Vernon\u2019s Civil Statutes Annotated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree with the District Court and hold the state court judgment valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">The following statement of facts, although somewhat lengthy, is requisite to a complete understanding of the various technical questions involved. On July 31, 1929, Dora Frank Guido and B. F. Guido were legally married and remained husband and wife until her death in 1949. By warranty deed dated February 27, 1934, B. F. Guido conveyed to his wife, Dora Frank Guido, an undivided one-half interest in and to the land involved, located in Brazoria County, Texas. This land and the mentioned royalty payments are the chief if not the only remaining assets of either of the Estates of Dora Frank Guido or B. F. Guido. The other one-half interest is owned by certain other persons and is not here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">On May 1, 1934, Dora Frank Guido, joined by her husband, B. F. Guido, et al., executed an Oil, Gas and Mineral Lease covering the Brazoria County property, which lease has been at all times from the date of its execution until the present time and is now a valid and subsisting lease owned and held by defendant Pan American Petroleum Corporation under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>and by virtue of mesne assignments. Since about 1937 there has been production of oil or gas from the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">On September 16, 1949, Dora Frank Guido died testate survived by her husband, B. F. Guido, and by her only child and sole heir, defendant Stella Marie Lowman. Insofar as here material, Dora Frank Guido\u2019s Last Will and Testament, dated December 3, 1942, devised the residue of her estate to her husband, B. F. Guido, but in the event he predeceased her or in the event of their contemporaneous deaths, it devised her entire estate in trust with directions to the trustees to pay the entire income therefrom to her daughter, Stella Marie Lowman, for her life, and thereafter, under certain circumstances, to Lawrence Gilbert Low-man, the daughter\u2019s husband, for his life, with one-half of the remainder to her collateral heirs and the other one-half to B. F. Guido\u2019s collateral heirs. The will contained this further provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">\u201c(8) This WILL is made in consideration of the making on this same day, by my husband, B. F. Guido, of a will with the same terms and provisions, and it is our intention to create a TRUST ESTATE as herein provided for the benefit of Mrs. Stella Marie Lowman and her husband, after her death, and for the distribution of the Trust Estate after termination of the Trust in the manner and terms herein set forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdXx\">The application of B. F. Guido to probate the said will was granted, and on January 11, 1950, the will was admitted to probate. B. F. Guido was appointed independent executor without bond. He took possession of the entire estate and appropriated it to his own use and benefit. He did not account to anyone for any of the said estate, but received and accepted the benefits under the will during his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">B. F. Guido subsequently married Doris C. M. Guido (now Doris C. M. Falsetti, and one of the plaintiffs herein) in April, 1951. In June 1957, B. F. Guido died testate while a resident of California. A will of B. F. Guido, dated July 3, 1951, referred to as the \u201csubsequent will\u201d was admitted to probate in California, and the plaintiff Doris C. M. Falsetti was appointed ad-ministratrix with the will annexed. This subsequent will in effect devised forty-nine percent (49%) of his estate to plaintiff Doris C. M. Guido Falsetti, forty-nine percent (49%) to the defendant Stella Marie Lowman, and one percent (1%) to each of two Roman Catholic Parish Churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">Plaintiff Doris C. M. Falsetti filed exemplified copies of B. F. Guido\u2019s subsequent will and the foreign order of probate and letters of administration in Brazoria County, Texas. In December 1958, orders in the ancillary proceeding in B. F. Guido\u2019s estate were entered which admitted the will to probate and appointed plaintiff Doris C. M. Falsetti, Administratrix with will annexed. Mrs. Falsetti was removed as Ancillary Administratrix upon <em>motion by </em>Stella Marie Low-man in February 1960. The action in the Texas State Court which led ultimately to the judgment now under scrutiny was filed in September 1958, by Stella Marie Lowman et vir. against Doris C. M. Guido, et al. A final judgment was rendered by the District Court of Brazoria County, Texas, dated September 16, 1960, and entered on October 18, 1960.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>In November 1360, plaintiffs Louie A. Falsetti and Doris C. M. Guido were married, subsequent to the entry of the state court judgment now under attack. In May 1961, immediately prior to the filing of this Federal Court suit and <em>after </em>the state court judgment had become final,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the County Court of Brazoria County entered an order appointing plaintiff Louie A. Falsetti successor anciliary administrator for certain limited purposes set forth in the order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>The foregoing material facts led the court below to conclude, as previously stated, that the judgment of the Texas State Court was void because, (1) it was rendered in violation of Article 1982 Vernon\u2019s Civil Statutes Annotated; and (2) the judgment on its face reveals the necessity of administration in the Estate of B. F. Guido, and because plaintiff Doris C. M. Guido Falsetti, Administra-trix, and a necessary party was dismissed prior to the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The defendants assert five theories in support of their contention that the State Court judgment is valid. First, Article 1982, V.C.S.A. was literally complied with; second, the judgment was regular on its face and contained absolute jurisdictional recitals; third, the state court had complete jurisdiction of the Brazoria County land and all interested parties; fourth, <em>res </em>judicata; and fifth, estoppel. Close scrutiny of Article 1982 is requisite to any decision upon the merits of the defendants\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The general rule regarding this section is that its provisions are mandatory, and that in every action against the estate of a decedent which involves title to land, the administrator, <em>if any, </em>and the heirs shall be made parties defendant. Jones v. Gibbs, 133 Tex. 645, 130 S.W.2d 274 (1939); Allen v. Matthews, Tex.Civ.App., 210 S.W.2d 849, 851 (1948). A failure to comply with Article 1982 will subject the proceedings to subsequent attack. East v. Dugan, 79 Tex. 329,15 S.W. 273; French v. French, 148 S.W.2d 930, writ dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Prior to the entry of the state court judgment, the Probate Court had dismissed the Administratrix (plaintiff Doris C. M. Guido Falsetti) and had refused to act on three successive applications seeking the appointment of a successor administrator. \u2018 The Federal District Court had before it an affidavit of the Probate Judge (admitted in evidence over objection) stating that he had refused to appoint an administrator because he felt none was necessary. The plaintiffs urge that the actual necessity of an administrator is immaterial. They argue that the judgment remains void unless it shows on its face that no administrator was necessary. We are unable to agree with this position, although we do agree with the holding of the District Court that the requirements of Article 1982 are mandatory. The reasons for our conclusion follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\"> It is necessary for us to examine the purpose or objective sought to be accomplished by Article 1982. We are of the opinion that this statute is primarily devoted to the meritorious objective of providing adequate <em>notice </em>to all parties who have an interest in, or may have an interest in, title to or ownership of real property comprising a decedent\u2019s estate. Compliance with the requirements of this Article will afford such interested parties an opportunity to present properly their claims against the estate in an expeditious, orderly manner. The administrator could then adequately represent the estate and defend against such claims when appropriate. The Article applies to real property. The law has always favored prompt, decisive vesting of title to real property, and the statute in question was apparently enacted with such objective in mind. Its purpose was accomplished when Mrs. Doris C. M. Guido Falsetti, <em>as ancillary administratrix, </em>was made a party defendant. We do not feel the statute requires that an administrator remain a party defendant throughout the entire course of the litigation, including final judgment, unless circumstances reasonably warrant it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the instant case, the administratrix was made a party to and participated in the suit in one capacity or another for approximately two years.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">It is interesting to note that in O\u2019Connor v. O\u2019Connor, (5 Cir. 1963), 315 F.2d 420, this Court refused to review the judgment of a Texas State Court which held in effect that it was not necessary under Texas law that a party be sued in his representative capacity as executor for an accounting and for the appointment of a receiver where he had refused to account when called upon to do so. The District Court in its opinion reported in 215 F.Supp. 420, cited no case to the effect that the dismissal of the administrator (trix) renders a judgment against a decedent\u2019s estate void. Nor have we been cited any case law to that effect by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\"> The rule in the law of judgments is that a judgment of a domestic court of general jurisdiction, rendered in the exercise of its usual powers, and regular on its face, imports absolute verity. 34 Tex.Jur.2d \u00a7 325. When such a judgment is collaterally attacked, every reasonable presumption that may be necessary to uphold it will be indulged, the existence of the necessary jurisdictional facts will be presumed, and it will be presumed also that in rendering the judgment, the court complied with all the mandatory provisions regulating its exercise of power. 34 Tex.Jur.2d id., Menifee v. Hamilton, 32 Tex. 495; Houston Oil Co. v. Bayne, (C.A.) 141 S.W. 544 err. ref. A collateral attack <em>may </em>fail even though the record affirmatively discloses a positive defect in a jurisdictional matter; some presumption may be applicable that will overcome the defect. 34 Tex.Jur.2d \u00a7 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">The Texas case of Williams v. Tooke, 116 S.W.2d 1114 (Ct.Civ.Apps.Texar-kana 1938) held that the absence of an allegation in the complaint that no administration was pending or necessary does not overcome the presumption of verity attaching to the judgment of every court of competent jurisdiction. The Texas Court there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-11\">\u201cIn Freeman on Judgments (5th Ed.) vol. 1, p. 819, \u00a7 383, it is said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aie-dedup-1\">\u201c \u2018To conclude from a mere want or insufficiency of jurisdiction recitals in the record of a court of general jurisdiction that jurisdiction was not actually acquired would be, in effect, to presume against the record, whereas it is a rule of general application that every intendment consistent with the record of such courts will be indulged to sustain their proceedings and judgments. The rule is that upon collateral attack of a domestic court of general jurisdiction the want of jurisdiction or invalidity of the judgment must affirmatively appear upon the record itself, and until the contrary appears it will be presumed that the court had jurisdiction. Nothing will be intended to be out of the jurisdiction of a court of general juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>diction but that which expressly appears to be so. The absence from the record of the necessary jurisdictional facts, will not overcome the presumption of jui\u2019isdietion, and that papers which ought to have been included in the judgment-roll \u2022are missing therefrom is not enough to make it affirmatively appear that the court had no jurisdiction. In the absence, therefore, of any showing in the record either one way or the other, a presumption arises in favor of the validity of the judgment of a court of general jurisdiction, and the existence of all matters going to the power of the court or tribunal to render the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">\u201c <em>\u2018Every fact will be presumed to have existed that was necessary to jurisdiction, over the subject matter or the parties.\u2019 \u201d </em>(emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">An application to the Supreme Court of 'Texas for a writ of error was denied. 'The parties attacking the judgment then filed a suit in the Federal District Court \u2022contending that the refusal to declare the earlier judgment void amounted to a \u2022denial of due process. The Federal District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, and this Court affirmed in 108 F.2d 758, 759 (1940) stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">\u201cThe purpose of the suit is clearly to seek a review of the decisions of the Texas courts and the reversal of those decisions for error. The jurisdiction of the District Court is strictly original. It has no jurisdiction to reverse or modify the judgment of a state court. The errors complained of could be reviewed only by the Supreme Court. Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362. It was the duty of the District Court to dismiss the suit. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 80.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">We are unable to detect any injury to plaintiff Doris C. M. Guido Falsetti resulting from her dismissal as ancillary administratrix. She was at all times a party to the proceedings in <em>some </em>capacity. She was represented by counsel, and was the real party in interest throughout the proceedings. It would be extremely difficult to maintain that she did not have adequate notice and an opportunity to protect her interests. It is true that Mr. Falsetti was appointed successor administrator after the rendition of the state court judgment, and after it became final. Mr. Falsetti was, by court order, limited in his administrative capacity in certain respects, but he was also empowered to take any legal action necessary to \u201cbring or defend any suit involving the assets of this estate, or the effect, if any, of the said judgment in Cause No. 39247 [Stella Marie Lowman, et vir, vs. Doris C. M. Guido, et al.] upon this estate.\u201d Such action would also include the filing of a Bill of Review by an administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">We are unable to agree with the learned District Court that the state court judgment \u201cshows on its face\u201d that it is void for want of an indispensable party, is subject to collateral attack in the U. S. Courts, and that it \u201chas no effect whatsoever.\u201d We feel that the state court judge was entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the conduct of Mrs. Falsetti when she was serving as Administratrix ; the appearance in court of the real parties in interest; the fact that Mrs. Falsetti, in her capacity as Administratrix, was a party during much of the state court litigation; and the several assertions in the record by Mrs. Falsetti to the effect that the probate proceedings in California had been completed and no debts were left unpaid. The state court judgment was subject to attack in Texas state courts by a Bill of Review, or by appeal to higher state courts. Neither remedy has been sought in the state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">Having thus determined that the state court judgment was valid, it is unnecessary to pass upon the existence of a contractual will executed by B. F. Guido, or an agreement by him to execute a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-12\">In reaching our conclusion in this case, we have not suggested the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the doctrine of abstention. Although mindful of the myriad decisions and law review articles on the subject of abstention,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we have given full consideration to the contentions of the parties in this case. A substantial argument might support the application of the doctrine in consideration of the recognized public policy of maintaining a proper balance in the delicate field of Federal-State relations. We are cognizant of the duty of Federal Courts in proper jurisdictional circumstances, to pass upon questions of state law when necessary to the rendition of an appropriate judgment. Even so, Federal Courts should be extremely reluctant to declare null and void the solemn judgments of state courts of record when the record reflects mature and careful consideration by state courts of the legal problems presented. Indeed, all courts \u2014 state and federal \u2014 should proceed with caution and respectful restraint when requested to declare as a matter of law, that the judgments of another court of record are void on their face. The law supplies strong presumptions in support of the validity of such judgments and they should not be set aside on purely hyperteehnical grounds, or for light and trivial reasons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">We are, therefore, of the opinion that the District Court was in error and the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-13\">.

The national courts have jurisdiction only of those things conferred upon them by law. And at the time of the creation of the national courts and at time of writing the Constitution itself the State courts were kept as a separate and distinct judicial institution. As <em>a result all eases that originate in the State court must he appealed to an appellate court of the State and thence to the Supreme Court of the State. </em>All cases originating in the United States court must be appealed to the Circuit Court of the United States or to the Supreme Court of the United States.
