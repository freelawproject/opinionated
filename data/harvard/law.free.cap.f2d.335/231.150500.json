BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"arm-dedup-0\">The question in this case is whether each of the three Taxpayers was a \u201cbona fide resident of a foreign country or countries,\u201d 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 911(a) (1), during the pertinent tax years running from 1956 through 1958. The Tax Court held that each was. 38 T.C. 417. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-20\">Taxpayers <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2during the years concerned were employees of Pan Am<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> at various United States Auxiliary Air Force Bases situated on British Islands in the Atlantic Ocean.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pan Am, under a yearly contract, was a civilian contractor of the United States Air Force Missile Test Center at Patrick Air Force .Base, some 18 miles from Cape Kennedy, Florida, the Atlantic Long Range Guided Missile launching station. These operations, now eclipsed by the spectacular orbital launchings of manned spacecraft from the Cape, were part of the post-World War II legislation to develop and test military missiles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Construction at Down-Range Missile Tracking Stations began early in 1951. For all practical purposes, the operation and management of these down-range tracking stations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>though nominally commanded by an Air Force officer, were committed to Pan Am through its civilian employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The Government attacks the Tax Court decision primarily on the ground that the nature of this employment at remote, sometimes almost uninhabited or uninhabitable islands, demonstrated that apart from this governmentally initiated, controlled, and operated military project, none of the Taxpayers would have ever sought out employment there.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">On the basis of this, the Government then contends that this Taxpayer does not meet the person Congress described as a \u201cbona fide resident.\u201d This is because, so the argument runs, Congress enacted the tax exemption in order to encourage, promote and stimulate the foreign trade of our country. In support of this thesis, it emphasizes what we and others have said. Thus in Swenson v. Thomas, 5 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 783, in discussing the predecessor of \u00a7 911(a) (1), we commented: <em>\u201cIt is </em>demonstrable from the history of that legislation that the exemption was made in the interest of foreign trade, to induce Americans to accept employment abroad and put American business on an equality with foreign competitors. * * * [T]he change was made not because of a reversal [in 1942] of the original purpose to encourage foreign employment of Americans, but to so tighten the law as to require bona fide residence * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Akm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Of course this thesis rests on the unquestioned and universally recognized purpose of Congress in enacting the 1942 forerunner of \u00a7 911(a) (1) to eliminate the many abuses which had arisen under the former law which required, not presence <em>in </em>a foreign country, so much as absence <em>from </em>the United States.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Downs v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 1948, 166 F.2d 504, 508, cert. denied, 1948, 334 U.S. 832, 68 S.Ct. 1346, 92 L.Ed. 1759; Souza v. Commissioner, 1960, 33 T.C. 817, 824; S.Rep. No. 781 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 52, U. S. Code Congressional and Administrative News 1951 p. 1969; Meals v. United States, 1953 N.D.Calif 1953, 110 F.Supp. 658, <em>660-661; and </em>Sweson v. Thomas, 5 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 783, 784.</p>\n<p id=\"AoZZ\">This argument, in our view, is neither persuasive nor sufficient. Despite the difficulties in applying the term \u201cbona fide residence, characterized by some as slippery <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and as being as variable as Josephs coat of many colors<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and by others as elusive, <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we think the promotmg-foreign-trade-test offers no real \u2022 i -\u00ab/r i , . . guide or help. Modern business is complex and the activities which companies or individuals regard as commercially feasible or profitable are varied. Consequently, we think it would be a very rare case indeed in which a Court asare we here could be urged to hold as a matter of law that neither Pan Am nor its civilian employees could have considered this a corporate or individual vocation pursued as American traders wi a pro mo ive.</p>\n<p id=\"A56-\">In similar vein, we would have to conclude that if the detailed circumstances concerning the activities of these Taxpayers, their efforts to assimilate themselves into whatever community life was available in these primitive societies, the indefinite extent and duration of their service and employment, and like factors were significant, we could not displace the fact findings of the Tax Court. They are certainly not clearly erroneous, F.R. Civ.P. 52(a); Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7 7482(a), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7482(a), whatever might have been our evaluation of them were we the trier of this mixed question of fact and law.</p>\n<p id=\"AYn\">0ur revergal of tMg case rests on Qur condusion that&gt; as a matter of law\u2019 the treaties between the two governments kept the presence of these ci_ vilian employees from ever ripening into residence</p>\n<p id=\"A_s\">There was, first, a virtual cession o<em>f </em>to the United States during the life of the treaty. The United Kingdom, in eolIaboration with Island authorities, obligated itself to \u201cprovide * * * , <em>^ </em>e .t such Sites for the purpose of the operation of the Long R Proying Gromd ag may * , * be necessary.\u201d By a provis\u00a1on that \u00abaceess to the Siteg ghall not be permitted to ns not official3y connected with\u201e the Missile Testing Pro_ gram t by joint congent of the senior Britigh and American representat\u00ed the territory; comprising a site wag effectually witbdrawn from the i^ai government. This wag in no genge con. fined to the geographical boundary of tbe sites, since extensive rights were granted for activities within the \u201cRange Area\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Likewise accorded was the vicarious right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of condemnation of entering upon, inspecting and \u201ctaking any necessary measures\u201d on off-site land if required \u201cto improve sanitation and protect health\u201d on the Sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The full sweep of such extraterritorial rights was reflected by treaty provisions concerning personnel. These provisions also revealed a purpose to treat Pan Am\u2019s civilian employees as something other than (a) local residents subject to local authorities or (b) immigrant-aliens subject to local law. Thus, the treaties expressly provided that \u201cthe immigration laws of [the named] island shall not operate or apply so as to prevent admission * * * of any person * * * employed by, or under a contract with, either the Government of the United States * * * or a contractor, in connection with the establishment, maintenance, or use of the * * * Proving Ground.\u201d This extraordinary privilege was coextensive with employment by Pan Am on the Missile project since the United States bound itself to notify the local authorities of any change of status for deportation of such persons by the United States if required. Likewise, such employees were exempt from import, excise, consumption or other tax, duties or imposts of the local governments with respect to personal belongings imported by United States citizens or purchased by them at Post Exchange or Commissary Stores at the site. Perhaps more important, in this day and world of high taxes,\" the employees were exempted from income tax imposed upon alien residents of the islands or citizens of the islands with respect to income earned in \u201cconnection with the establishment, maintenance, or use of the Long Range Proving Ground.\u201d The tax exemption also covered the \u201cownership or use of property which is within a Site, or situated outside [the named] island.\u201d These privileges were likewise extended to the contractors, subcontractors, or beneficial owners thereof and included specifically any \u201cincome tax * * in respect of any profits derived under a contract * * * with * * * the United States\u201d or any \u201clicense [tax] in respect of any service or work for the * * * United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">Even more vital, these civilian employees had a complete or partial immunity from the operation of local laws and local governmental authorities. Classified as \u201ca person * * * who is * * subject to the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice,\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the treaty exempted such employees from arrest, service of process, civil or criminal, while within the Site, \u201cexcept with the permission of the Commanding Officer in charge of the United States Forces in such Sites.\u201d More important, under this classification, the United States was granted \u201cthe right to exercise * * * exclusive jurisdiction over security offenses\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> on or off the site. The treaty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>prescribed \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction over all other offenses <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> wherever committed.\u201d Specific machinery was also established to enable the United States to exert or waive its right to exclusive jurisdiction and for mutual determination as to the trial of cases of concurrent jurisdiction,</p>\n<p id=\"AVR\">These employees are in these islands solely because of the terms of the treaties. Under this basic arrangement, these civilian employees have rights and privileges which set them apart from the general community. They bear none of the usual obligations of a local resident, whether citizen or alien resident, They are exempt from all of the affirmative obligations and responsibilities of a resident citizen or alien. And as to the universal negative obligation imposed on all inhabitants not to violate established law, they are above the community and beyond the reach of its judicial power unless a reasonable official of the United States Government purposefully waives the right to exert exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. They are in no real sense then a part of the local community. They are free from all of the ordinary, traditional and essential burdens of the people who work, live, own property and pay taxes there. They are merely present and presence alone, since the amendment of 1942, has not been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"axf-dedup-0\">Conceding that the Taxpayers in good faith intended to work in one or more of these islands wherever Pan Am would send them for an indefinite period of time for employment which might extend over many years<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and each did his best to enter into the life of the community to the fullest extent of this primitive society, the existence of each, except for Physical environment imposed by presence, was for all practical purposes same as within the United States, Extraterritorial rights, privileges, and immunities of the fundamental kind accorded here keep this physical^ presence ^rom ripening into actual residence in f forei&amp;n country. We emphasize this inescapable consequence of the basic relationship created by the treaties to make c^ear that while the result here is the same as in Downs v. Commissioner, 9 1948, 166 F.2d 504, cert. denied, 1948, 334 U.S. 832, 68 S.Ct. 1346, 92 L.Ed. 1759, and Jones v. Kyle, 10 Cir., 1951, 190 F.2d 353, cert. denied, 1951, 342 U.S. 886, 72 S.Ct. 175, 96 L.Ed. 664, we re^y&gt; ap did such decisions, on limited, restricted nature of the employment in terms of time and nature wor^ ke accomplished,</p>\n<p id=\"aom-dedup-0\">Whether for 20 days or for 20 years, employment under the arrangement authorized by such a treaty could not amount to residence <em>in </em>a foreign country, no matter how bona fide the <em>presence </em>ndght be-</p>\n<p id=\"aqqj-dedup-0\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-12\">. In our approach to the case, the eviden-tiary details as to each individual are unimportant. Consequently, we refer indiscriminately to them as Taxpayer or Taxpayers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-13\">.

Ascension Island, 4401 nautical miles from Patrick Air Force Base, is a volcanic, hilly island, roughly about seven miles in diameter, with little vegetation or industry. It has no local commercial transportation and no commercial air service. There are no hotels. Of the 200 residents, 50 are Britishers, the balance of Indian descent. One Taxpayer described it as \u201cmore isolated than anything you ever want to be on. * * * There is no place to go, no where to come back from.\u201d The 339 Pan Am American civilian employees lived in barracks and quonset huts on the Base. Mayaguana Island, 544 nautical miles from Patrick, formed of coral sandstone, seven miles wide and 28 miles long, has a population of 700, all natives, with farming and fishing as its major occupations. It is without commercial transportation, housing or hotels. The 9 Pan Am civilian employees lived in barracks on the base. San Salvador, 414 miles from Patrick, formed of coral limestone, 12 miles long, has a population of less than 900 with all but one being natives. No products are manufactured for export. It is without commercial transportation, hotels, and private housing facilities. The 213 Pan Am civilian employees lived in barracks on the base which was fenced in and guarded. Grand Bahama, 152 miles from Patrick, is bigger (83 miles long) and more heavily populated (5800), but there was little farming, commercial activity with \u201cunskilled labor * * * available at three shillings per hour,\u201d and all but about 1% of the population are natives. The 315 Pan Am civilian employees lived in barracks on a base fenced in and guarded. For about a month the wife and children of one of the Taxpayers lived in \u201ca small shack which had no running water. And with no glass windows * * * no electric lights * * * [it had] an outside toilet some 75 to 100 feet from the house.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b281-15\">.
