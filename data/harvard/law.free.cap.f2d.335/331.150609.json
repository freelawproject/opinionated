Locklin, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in June, 1952. Radiant there succeeded in its counterclaim charging antitrust violation with respect to daylight fluorescent patents of Switzer not involved here. This court affirmed, 297 F.2d 39 (7th Cir. 1961), and the Supreme Court denied certiorari to both parties. 369 U.S. 851, 82 S.Ct. 934, 8 L.Ed.2d 9 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">While Switzer Bros., Inc. v. Locklin was pending in this circuit, Radiant sued Switzer in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for a declaration that Kazenas patent No. 2,809,954, issued October 15, 1957, was invalid and not infringed. Switzer, assignee of that patent, counterclaimed for infringement. The California district court filed a memorandum, finding the Kazenas patent valid and infringed. 125 U.S.P.Q. 515 (N.D.Cal. 1959). Radiant moved, supported by affidavits, to dismiss Switzer\u2019s counterclaim on grounds of unclean hands, but the court entered judgment in conformity with its memorandum, restraining Radiant from infringing Switzer\u2019s patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-18\">Radiant then filed a motion for a new trial, based on newly discovered evidence and alleged fraud of Switzer in obtaining the patent and judgment. The grounds for new trial centered around \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d i. e., \u201cthe present physical condition of Exhibit N,\u201d and the deposition of Kazenas taken in another action. The motion was denied after hearing, and Radiant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-19\">Radiant\u2019s motion in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to remand the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>to the district court with directions to try the issue of unclean hands on the merits was denied without prejudice to renew it on oral argument. Radiant subsequently moved in the district court for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., on grounds of newly discovered evidence, i. e., Anas patent No. 2,852,480, which, it claimed, would invalidate the Kazenas patent. The motion was denied after hearing. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment in the main action, 299 F.2d 160 (9th Cir. 1961), and upheld the trial court\u2019s denials of the several motions to re-open the case. Cer-tiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court. 369 U.S. 861, 82 S.Ct. 950, 8 L.Ed.2d 18 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Radiant then came to the Northern District of Illinois and filed the two proceedings before us.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Radiant admits that both are based on the same factual allegations. Both seek damages, and pray that Switzer be enjoined from representing Kazenas patent No. 2,809,954 as valid and infringed and from enforcing the California judgment. The allegations are of fraud upon the Patent Office and upon the California courts, and that Switzer has used the \u201ctainted\u201d judgment of the California courts to further its monopoly in violation of the anti-trust laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Radiant conceded, in the California district court, that it could not show diligence in its motion for a new trial but could show an excuse for lack of diligence. The court saw no aspect of \u201cfraud or chicanery\u201d on the patent application by Switzer; thought that on the issue of the alleged counterfeit exhibit a new trial would merely result in parties seeking to present \u201csome additional experts to expound their views\u201d and \u201cwe would be back where we were;\u201d and said, in response to Radiant\u2019s request for an opportunity to prove fraud, on the court and the Patent Office, \u201cyou had an opportunity to do that * * * at the trial.\u201d And the court, in passing on the 60(b) motion observed that \u201cThe invention disclosed in the Anas patent is sufficiently similar to the invention claimed * * * to warrant the prima facie conclusion that the Anas patent would be anticipatory if it were entitled to priority,\u201d but found, from the uncon-troverted affidavit filed by Switzer,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the invention claimed in the Kazenas patent was reduced to practice prior to the invention claimed in the Anas patent, and concluded that, therefore, \u201cit does not appear that the evidence which might be adduced upon a new trial would alter the decision heretofore made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed: the district court did not abuse its discretion \u201cbearing in mind both lack of diligence and the showing made with respect to fraud and the public welfare\u201d in denying \u201ca new trial upon the ground of unclean hands or to refuse to delay judgment in order that hearing might be had on the newly tendered issues.\u201d 299 F.2d at 170. These are the issues which Radiant claims were not passed on in the California courts. There is no merit in the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">There is no merit either in Radiant\u2019s contention that neither California court passed on the truth of the grounds urged for a new trial. Once the California district court decided there were no grounds shown for granting a new trial, there was no need for it to go further and decide upon the merits of the grounds urged. Since the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decided the district court did not abuse its discretion, that ended the matter. Heiser v. Woodruff, 327 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>726, 736, 66 S.Ct. 853, 857, 90 L.Ed. 970 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">We think Rule 60(b),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> under the circumstances before us, provides for alternative, and not cumulative, methods of relief, and we do not think the rule should be construed to preclude as Radiant argues, the bar of res judicata. Heiser v. Woodruff, 327 U.S. 726, 733, 66 S.Ct. 853, 856, 90 L.Ed. 970 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The Heiser case is close to the situation before us. There the Supreme Court reversed a judgment of the Tenth Circuit and held that a previous adjudication, that the judgment against a bankrupt was not procured by fraud, may not be disregarded, even though in the previous litigation the allegations of fraud were not supported by tender of evidence or other proof. 327 U.S. at 736, 66 S.Ct. 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Neither Hazel-Atlas Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944), nor Shawkee Mfg. Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 271, 64 S.Ct. 1014, 88 L.Ed. 1269 (1944), has relevance to the situation before us. The question of res judicata was not at issue in either ease, and the uncontradicted facts of fraud differentiate both cases from that before us. And we do not think that footnote 5<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Hazel-Atlas opinion compels our decision that in the circumstances of this case the California court was required to hear evidence in order to render res judicata denial of the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">We need not \u2014 because Rule 60(b), as adopted in 1938, was patterned after a California rule \u2014 construe, as California courts have done,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a denial of post-trial motions as not res judicata of a later independent action to set aside judgment on the same grounds. Although California decisions may guide us as to the scope of relief under Rule 60(b), Fiske v. Buder, 125 F.2d 841 (8th Cir. 1942), 7 Moore, Federal Practice, \u00a7\u00a7 60.10 [5]\u2014 [9] (2d ed. 1955), we are compelled by Heiser v. Woodruff, 327 U.S. 726, 66 S.Ct. 853 (1945), not to extend the California construction of the rule to the question of whether a ruling on a motion is res judicata of a later independent equitable action.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">The independent equitable action may be maintained in any court exercising equitable jurisdiction,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Bros, Inc. v. W. E. Grace Mfg. Co., 320 F.2d 594, 607 (5th Cir. 1963), and \u201cmay or may not be begun in the court which rendered the judgment.\u201d Notes of Advisory Committee on Rules, Rule 60(b), Fed.R. Civ.P., 28 U.S.C. at p. 123 (1960). However, a \u201cforeign\u201d federal court will not set aside a judgment, in an independent equitable action, unless the judgment would be set aside on those same grounds by the \u201chome\u201d federal court. Bros, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>v. W. E. Grace Mfg. Co., 320 F.2d 594, 607 (5th Cir. 1963). And here the California district court has already decided not to set aside the judgment on \u201csubstantially most\u201d of the same issues as raised here.4 *****<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The ruling by the California district court was within the court\u2019s discretion and the court gave these reasons for exercising its discretionary ruling: accepting as true the charges with respect to the Patent Office, no \u201caspect of fraud\u201d was shown, and no excuse for lack of diligence; and with respect to fraud on the court, the substance of the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d could have been discovered and used at the trial. Radiant, making no further showing in the actions before us, failed to meet the substantive requirements which it must meet to seek relief from judgment. Failed for the same reason that the court said movant did in Philippine National Bank v. Kennedy, 295 F.2d 544, 545 (D.C.Cir.1961) : \u201cthe judge who tried the ease, and who was fully familiar with the evidence formerly offered, decided that plaintiff-appellant was not entitled to relief,\u201d 295 F.2d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Bros, Inc. v. W. E. Grace Mfg. Co., 320 F.2d 594 (5th Cir. 1963), can be distinguished <em>from </em>the present case because in Bros there was \u201ca sufficient probable showing of circumstances which, if finally sustained after proof and hearing, would justify some character of equitable relief.\u201d 320 F.2d at 607. In Bros, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment, upholding the validity of the patent, Gibson-Stewart Co. v. Wm. Bros Boiler <em>&amp; </em>Mfg. Co., 264 F.2d 776 (6th Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 360 U.S. 929, 79 S.Ct. 1448, 3 L.Ed.2d 1544 (1959), was attacked first in the Sixth Circuit on grounds of alleged prior public use, \u201cmost important\u201d that an advertising folder describing the invention was distributed more than one year prior to the filing of the patent application. Patentee\u2019s officer most familiar with the invention, in an affidavit opposing the motion, denied that the brochure was prepared and distributed at the date specified. However, in a subsequent suit involving the validity of the same patent in the District of Minnesota, he testified that he did not know when the brochure was published, and the court found the patent \u201cinvalid because it was described in a printed publication * * * more than one year prior\u201d to the application. Browning Mfg. Co. v. Bros, Inc., 134 U.S.P.Q. 231 (D.Minn.1962). This was affirmed on appeal, 317 F.2d 413 (8th Cir. 1963), and certiorari denied, 375 U. S. 825, 84 S.Ct. 67, 11 L.Ed.2d 58 (1963). The Fifth Circuit was then faced with the question whether, in view of these changed circumstances after the time of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s denial of the 60(b) motion, it should enforce the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment on grounds of res judicata, without looking into the question of prior use itself. We have no showing of changed circumstances here after the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">Radiant presented its charges three times before the California district court (the settlement of findings, motions for new trial and to vacate judgment) and again before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. It was denied relief, on the same grounds it presents here.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">We conclude that the district court did not err in deciding that the judgment of the California district court, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, is res judicata of the issues presented in these suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">For the reasons given, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-10\">.

We do not pass on the propriety of Radiant seeking to file a supplemental counterclaim in No. 52-C \u2014 1198 in the district court without seeking leave of this court, although the original judgment had been affirmed by this court and the mandate issued. See Geuder, Paeshke &amp; Frey Co. v. Clark, 288 F.2d 1, 85 A.L.R.2d 766 (7th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 826, 82 S.Ct. 47, 7 L.Ed.2d 30 (1911).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b381-14\">.
