The District Court granted the Librarian\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-26\">Appellant makes two principal claims. First, he asserts that he was denied certain procedural safeguards which, he says, are required by Library regulations even for probationary employees (now called \u201cconditional\u201d employees). Second, he contends that he was entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>additional safeguards governing charge of permanent employees,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because he was entitled to conversion from probationary to permanent status under the Library\u2019s regulations. dis-</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"> In considering these questions, we emphasize the duty imposed on the trial court on a motion for summary judgment, and on this court upon review of such a motion, of requiring that the movant meet the burden of clearly demonstrating that there is no material issue of fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly <em>\u201c </em>* * * a party opposing summary judgment is entitled to the benefit of all favorable inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence for the purpose of defeating summary judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">Even under these standards appellant\u2019s first claim is meritless. It is clear from both of the applicable regulations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that a probationary employee is not entitled to appeal his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\"> As to appellant\u2019s second point, the Library asserts that its regulations do not compel it to convert any employees to permanent status. In any event, it says that appellant was not qualified for conversion since his superiors were dissatisfied with his performance throughout his employment. Se-maan contends, however, that after he had served his one-year qualifying period \u2014 without any complaints and indeed with praise at one point \u2014 he was notified personally by a member of the personnel office that he had satisfactorily completed that period. Thereafter he was given privileges and responsibilities which by rule or custom were not given to probationary employees. He asserts that \u201cin all respects, save written notification of personnel conversion which was arbitrarily withheld, plaintiff\u2019s appointment was converted to permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">The record does not reveal matters which should have caused appellant to believe that written notification was required. Nor is it shown that he had any other indication that he had not been converted.. Moreover, it does not appear that written notification was, in fact, a required step in the conversion procedure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>In short, as far as Semaan knew, there was no reason for him to invoke the Library\u2019s grievance procedures<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to request conversion, as he might have done had he not been led into thinking conversion had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We need not decide whether the facts alleged by appellant establish that his conversion was mandatory, because we think it is plain that his affidavits and exhibits encompass facts which, if true, estopped the Library from denying him the rights of a permanent employee upon his dismissal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He offered to prove facts which would establish that he was led by the Library to believe he was permanent, that he relied on this course of conduct to his detriment, and that the Library, by refusing to afford him the safeguards of a permanent employee, sought to adopt a position inconsistent with its prior conduct. Since these facts would constitute an estoppel, it was error to deny him the opportunity of proving them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The case is reversed and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-6\">. Such safeguards include the right to receive notice of an impending disciplinary action and to appeal the recommendation of the Director of Personnel to a board of appeal comprised of fellow employees, or to receive a hearing and an opportunity to present witnesses on a direct appeal to the Librarian.

But in proper circumstances it does apply.\u201d Vestal v. C. I. R., 80 U.S.App.D.C. 264, 268, 152 F.2d 132, 136 (1945). For a discussion of the case law delineating the proper circumstances, see Smale &amp; Robinson, Inc. v. United States, 123 F.Supp. 457, 46L466 (S.D.Cal.1954) ; United States v. Certain Parcels of Land, 131 F.Supp. 65, 73-75 (S.D.Cal.1955). Since the Government agency to be estopped here possessed the authority to do what it appeared to be doing, was not depriving the public of the protection of any statute, and was acting in a proprietary capacity <em>qua </em>employer, there is no reason to bar an estoppel here. See generally 2 Davis, Admiuistbative Law Teeatise \u00a7\u00a7 17.01, 17.02, 17.03, 17.09 (1958, Supp.1963). Of. Crawford v. Board of Education, 20 Cal.

Although the estoppel theory was not explicitly argued below, it was plainly encompassed by the pleadings and was clearly a \u201cdiscernible circumstance\u201d from the record before the court.

Fountain, 84 U.S.App.D.C. 46, 171 F.2d 999 (1948), reversed in part, 336 U.S. 681, 69 S.Ct. 754, 93 L.Ed. 971, rehearing denied, 337 U.S. 921, 69 S.Ct. 1153, 93 L.Ed. 1730 (1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b754-6\">BURGER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"adkh-dedup-0\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"alp-dedup-1\">Although I agree with the majority that the pleadings of the party opposing summary judgment should be liberally construed and given the benefit of all reasonable inferences of fact, the estoppel theory relied upon by the majority was not presented by appellee Semaan in either the District Court or this court and there is nothing in the record to support a holding on that basis. I see no basis for disturbing the action of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
