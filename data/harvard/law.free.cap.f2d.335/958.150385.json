We will dispose of them in one opinion. On June 7, 1961, a final judgment, following a jury verdict, was entered in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky in favor of Sunfire Coal Company and Ashlo Coal Company, and against appellant, United Mine Workers of America, in the total sum of $264,000.-00. Such judgment was affirmed by this Court on February 16, 1963. Sunfire Coal Company v. United Mine Workers, 313 F.2d 108 (CA 6, 1963). On October 10, 1961, a final judgment, following a jury verdict, was entered in the same District Court in favor of R. P. Price, C. H. Kelly and Follace Fields, partners, d/b/a Elkhorn Coal Company, and against the appellant, United Mine Workers of America, in the total sum of $250,000.00. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>An appeal from the latter judgment is pending in this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Each of the aforesaid judgments included awards for compensatory and punitive damages. The actions arose out of alleged depredations committed by members of the defendant United Mine Workers upon the properties and business of the respective plaintiffs during the Mine Workers\u2019 massive campaign to obtain contracts from various coal operators in southeastern Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee. This activity occurred during 1959. The recitations of the facts in our decisions of Gilchrist v. United Mine Workers of America, 290 F.2d 36 (CA 6, 1960) ; Flame Coal Company v. United Mine Workers of America, 303 F.2d 39 (CA 6, 1962); United Mine Workers of America v. Osborne Mining Co., 279 F.2d 716 (CA 6, 1960); and Sunfire Coal Company v. United Mine Workers of America, 313 F.2d 108 (CA 6, 1963), provide a fair description of the character and extent of the activity, violence and destruction that was claimed to characterize the organization methods of the United Mine Workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">In the Price and Sunfire cases, now before us on appeal from denial of the motions for new trial, evidence was admitted of shootings, burning, dynamiting and other violence without specifically identifying the perpetrators as being members of the United Mine Workers. Violence at the premises of operators other than the plaintiffs in the particular cases was also admitted as evidence of the grand scale of the entire operation. This was true also in the other cases which have been before us and the reasons for holding such evidence admissible are set forth in the cases as reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">On April 22, 1963, in the Price case and on May 16, 1963, in the Sunfire case, defendant United Mine Workers filed motions each entitled, \u201cMotion to Vacate Final Judgment and Order and Award Defendant United Mine Workers of America a New Trial <em>Because of Newly Discovered Evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) In Price, the motion was filed about five months after the expiration of one year from the entry of final judgment and in Sunfire, about one year and eleven months after final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">These motions were heard together before District Judges H. Church Ford and Mac Swinford, the trial judges in the respective cases. The motions were denied and in a joint memorandum the judges gave as the reason for such denial the provision of Rule 60(b) (2), F.R.Civ.P., which requires that motions for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must be filed <em>\u201cnot more than one year after the judgment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">Defendant asserts that the newly discovered evidence would consist of testimony that certain of the acts of violence, arson and destruction were actually committed by persons in no way connected with the United Mine Workers; that they were committed by police officers, mine operators and others. In support of these motions defendant attached an affidavit of an attorney, H. B. Noble,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who deposed that on August 10, 1962, one Ira Kilburn, a member of the police force of Hazard, Kentucky, told Noble that he had information as to the identity of persons who had committed numerous crimes connected with the violence at the Kentucky mines. Kilburn\u2019s information was composed into an affidavit, sworn to before attorney Noble. Except for confession of his own participation in some of the events, all of which were criminal activities, it is not clear whether Ira Kilburn had any personal knowledge of the events which he detailed in his affidavit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Noble\u2019s affidavit stated that Ira Kilburn\u2019s information was given to him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>\u2018\u201con a professional basis, as attorney and \u2022client,\u201d and was to be kept secret by him because Kilburn had said that his life had been threatened and that he, Kilburn, \u201cwanted the affidavit made in the event that anything should happen to him that the affidavit could be presented to the grand jury for its consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_Ns\">The motions for new trial alleged that Kilburn\u2019s affidavit was kept secret until on or about March 22,1963, when it came to light at a hearing of Hazard city offi\u25a0cials while investigating charges filed against the deponent Ira Kilburn as a member of the Hazard City Police Force. 'The record does not disclose how the affi\u2022davit went from its confidential and professional custody in the hands of attorney Noble to the Board of Commissioners \u25a0of the City of Hazard. A further affidavit in support of the motion for new trial set forth that none of the people identified in the Kilburn affidavit were agents, officers or members of the United Mine Workers, but that \u201cPaul Tayloe and Dick Johnson were engaged in the mining business; that R. D. Cisco, George Smith and Tommy Kilburn were members of the Hazard police force during the year of 1959; that C. C. Begley was a member of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company\u2019s police force and that Ira Kil-burn was a member of the Hazard police force during the year of 1959.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">It should be observed that Ira Kilburn did not make his affidavit for use as support for defendant\u2019s motions, nor is it claimed that he would or could give testimony at a new trial of the \u201cinformation\u201d contained in his affidavit. The defendant\u2019s position is that if given a new trial, \u201cUnited Mine Workers intends to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>subpoena the said Ira Kilburn as a witness in a new trial for the purpose of examining him concerning the statements contained in the said \u2018Kilburn affidavit.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">It should be further noted that there is no claim made that any of the plaintiffs in Sunfire and Price, or any of their agents, or employees, knew of or in any way participated in bringing about the spectacular behavior which Kilburn described. The only occurrence referred to in Kilbum\u2019s affidavit which became part of the testimony in either Sunfire or Price related to the burning of the coal tipple of Marian Ritchie. The latter testified that his tipples at Sassafras, Viper and Ulvah, Kentucky, were burned in July and August, 1959. He was unable to directly identify the arsonists. No fraud upon the court by the plaintiffs is charged or intimated. Notwithstanding the voluminous evidence of the 1959 reign of terror in the Kentucky coal fields, and defendant\u2019s awareness that it was charged with responsibility therefor, the motions for new trial are silent as to any efforts made or diligence employed before, during or after the trials to find evidence, if any there was, that others than those connected with defendant were the perpetrators of the violence visited upon the mine owners. Kilburn\u2019s secret was kept by one of the defendant\u2019s attorneys, who averred that he was commanded to do so by Kentucky\u2019s Revised Statutes, \u00a7 421.210 (4).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Not until the fortuitous disclosures of the investigation into the affairs of the Hazard Police Department did defendant claim that evidence was available that others than their own people were responsible for what happened in 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Relying on Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 266, defendant asserts that its motion for new trial should not be viewed as subject to the limitations of Rule 60(b) (2) which requires that motions for new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence be presented within one year after judgment, but rather as coming within subdivision (b) (6) of that rule. That subsection relates to motions bottomed upon \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d The latter ground is not subject to the limitation applicable to motions made under Rule 60(b) (2) \u2014 \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d \u2014 nor to any specific period of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">We do not read Klapprott as supporting defendant\u2019s position here. Klapprott there sought to vacate a default judgment cancelling his certificate of naturalization. He was given notice of the petition seeking such judgment, but within the time for his answer he was arrested and convicted of crime and was thereafter held in jail for several years. His motion to vacate the default judgment set forth facts which, if true, would prove that his efforts to defend the denaturali-zation proceedings were wrongfully thwarted by agents of the United States government. The majority opinion found first that the denaturalization judgment was void for failure of the government to prove the allegations of its petition therefor, and second, that the cause of Klapprott\u2019s failure to defend the denaturalization proceedings did not constitute \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect\u201d which, if asserted as ground for relief, would have required his motion to be made within one year after the judgment. Rule 60(b) (1). The court found that Klapprott\u2019s motion should be held to be grounded on Rule 60 (b) (6), \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d The Supreme Court said, \u201c[a]nd of course, the one year limitation would control if no more than \u2018neglect\u2019 was disclosed by the petition,\u201d (335 U.S. 613, 69 S.Ct. 389) \u2014 emphasizing that the limitation must be applied if a motion is grounded on any one of reasons (1) (2) or (3), which are governed by the one year limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>The motions here involved state in their captions that they ask for a new trial \u201cbecause of newly discovered evidence,\u201d and in the body of each motion they ask for \u201ca new trial upon newly discovered evidence.\u201d If, however, the substance of the motions made them something different than the formal label placed on them, defendant should not be denied relief because of such technicality. But the content of the motions and their supporting affidavits disclose that they are nothing more than what their titles proclaim them to be \u2014 motions for a new trial on the ground of \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d To get relief under subsection (b) (6) they must assert some \u201cother\u201d reason, for such section is limited to \u201cany <em>other </em>reason justifying relief * * All that defendant\u2019s motions seek is the opportunity to put Kilburn on the stand at a retrial, or to examine him to discover new evidence to be used on a retrial. There is no claim that the Sunfire or the Price judgments are void or that plaintiffs committed any fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">We emphasize two facts. Nowhere in defendant\u2019s motions and supporting affidavits is it asserted that any of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses swore falsely, much less that plaintiffs committed fraud on the trial court by suing for injuries of their own doing or by knowingly using false testimony. Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses gave evidence of circumstances from which the jury in each case could, and did, conclude that defendant\u2019s people were responsible for the spectacular violence that characterized the 1959 affair. In Gilchrist, Flame, Osborne and Sunfire, supra, we held that such evidence was sufficient to permit the juries to reach such conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Since the original draft of this opinion was prepared, we have received Judge Edwards\u2019 dissent. Therein it is said that \u201cThe courts of this land are not without power to deal with allegations like these <em>which really charge fraud upon the court,\u201d </em>and the present motion is therein characterized as one \u201cwhich represents such a fundamental <em>charge of fraud upon the court </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.) Because of this language, we have again scrutinized defendant\u2019s motions and their supporting affidavits and fail to find therein the basis for such observations. We do not believe that we should gratuitously supply defendant\u2019s motions with allegations which counsel quite obviously avoided making. We further observe that even if the allegations of Kilburn\u2019s affidavit be accepted as true, they wholly fail to charge that the plaintiffs, or anyone connected with them, conspired with, cooperated with, or in any way participated in the conduct described by Kilburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">However much our curiosity might tempt us to find out something more about Kilburn\u2019s interesting affidavit, and however much we might desire to allay our wonder as to what notice police authorities may have taken of it, the law denies us such an excursion. Neither the District Judges nor ourselves are at liberty to do violence to the clear language of Rule 60(b) (2) which forbids entertainment of the motions made after the limitation has run.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">.

The factual allegations they contain stand before us (as they did before the District Judges) undenied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">If we assume, and the terms of the affidavit are broad enough for such an alternative assumption, that the astonishing allegations contained in the Kilburn Affidavit fall within the personal knowledge of the affiant, then, indeed, we have the suggestion of a major conspiracy between mine operators and agents of law enforcement to perpetrate violence themselves, conceal the source of the perpetration, and ultimately throw the blame for that violence upon the defendants in this case. Such an allegation is bound to represent either malicious perjury or suppressed truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-13\">The courts of this land are not without power to deal with allegations like these, which really charge fraud upon the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">Rule 43(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows for the taking of testimony and the holding of a hearing on motions when the motion contains allegations of facts not appearing in the record of the trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 43(e), Evidence on Motion, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-15\">\u201cWhen a motion is based on facts not appearing of record the court may hear the matter on affidavits presented by the respective parties, but the court may direct that the matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or depositions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">Rule 60(b) (6) gives power to the court to grant a new trial for any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment. It contains no time-limitation. Fraud upon the court would indeed be an \u201cother reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-17\">The leading case dealing with motions-made under Rule 60(b) is Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 266 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-18\">The final order in Klapprott is reported at 336 U.S. 942, 69 S.Ct. 384, 93 L.Ed. 1099 (1949) wherein the court ordered that the case be remanded to the District Court with a direction to <em>\u201creceive evidence on the truth or falsity of the allegations contained in petitioner\u2019s petition to-vacate\u201d </em>the judgment. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-19\">I do not believe that a motion which represents such a fundamental charge of' fraud upon the court should be disposed of by a disposition based upon a technical time limitation. In my view these motions should be remanded to the District Judges, with instructions to take oral testimony on the motions and to determine whether or not there was probable-cause to believe the charges contained therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">.
