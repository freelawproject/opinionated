She now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-24\">The whiskey was found in an unoccupied house owned by her, two doors\u2014 about 100 to 150 feet \u2014 from her home. While the Government agents had her residence under surveillance, an automobile drove up to the vacant house on February 12, 1963, just after midnight. From the car a man walked to the home of the accused, rapped on the door \u201cquite hard several times\u201d and called out, \u201cThelma, I need the key.\u201d With the knock and exclamation, the lights went on; a conversation ensued, too low to be heard by the agents. In the darkness a man moved from appellant\u2019s home to the vacant house, from which then came the sound of the handling of fruit jars and cardboard cases. A few minutes, and a man emerging from the untenanted building was arrested. Search of the place disclosed 27% gallons of illicit spirits. At home was appellant Portee, the lights still burning, well after midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-25\">The point of this appeal is the introduction in evidence of the exclamation\u2014 \u201cThelma, I need the key.\u201d While of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>course these words were damaging to the accused, we think in the circumstances receipt of this evidence did not vitiate the conviction. The record teems with other proof of the appellant\u2019s guilt, and it is unnecessary to elaborate upon the precise grounds warranting the acceptance of the statement in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">As we find no error in the judgment of the District Court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-26\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5604(a) (1) (Supp.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
