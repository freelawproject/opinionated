C., and Clinton G. Brown, Jr., San Antonio, Tex., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b120-24\">Before HUTCHESON and RIVES, Circuit Judges, and GROOMS, District Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b120-25\">GROOMS, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b120-26\">Appellant, Aloe Creme Laboratories, Inc., filed this action below under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 146 and 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1071 seeking a reversal of a ruling of the United States Patent Office denying its claim to the right to the trademark registration of \u201cALO-CREME\u201d and \u201cALO-CREME AFTER TAN.\u201d Appel-lee, The Texas Pharmacal Company, filed a counterclaim under Section 1338(b) of Title 28 U.S.C.A. and Section 1116 et seq. of Title 15 U.S.C.A. to enjoin the use of those names and \u201cALOE CREME\u201d, as trademarks, tradenames or parts thereof on the ground that each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>infringes its trademark, \u201cALLER-CREME,\u201d and \u201cALLERCREME SAF-TAN,\u201d and that their use constitutes unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Upon the evidence presented at the trial and upon that before the Patent Office, the trial court affirmed the Patent Office ruling that its action was supported by susbtantial evidence and was not clearly erroneous. The court also ruled that because of the evidence of actual deception and confusion, and the further likelihood of confusion, appellee was entitled to an injunction prohibiting the use of \u201cALO-CREME,\u201d \u201cALO-CREME AFTER TAN,\u201d and \u201cALOE CREME\u201d as trademarks on the ground that each infringed appellee\u2019s prior registered trademark, \u201cALLERCREME,\u201d and that their use amounted to unfair competition in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The name \u201cALLERCREME\u201d was registered on May 30, 1944, and \u201cALLER-CREME SAF-TAN\u201d on January 19, 1954. Appellant\u2019s mark, \u201cALO-CREME\u201d was registered on June 1, 1954, and on January 31, 1955, appellant filed its application for registration of \u201cALO-CREME AFTER TAN.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5W\">Appellant contends that its mark \u201cALO-CREME\u201d was chosen because \u201cALO\u201d suggests the Aloe Veraplant,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the main active ingredient of its preparations; that it has emphasized the use of the Aloe Vera gel in the use, sale and advertising of its products so that they are characterized by that plant; that there has been no actual confusion between its products and those of appellee, and that there is such a substantial difference between its goods and those of appellee and between their marks and packages that there is no likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-17\">Appellee contends that the presence or lack of ingredients has no bearing on the registration of appellant\u2019s marks or their infringement of appellee\u2019s mark and tradename.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It points to the record to sustain the finding of actual confusion as well as the likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">Appellant is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business at Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. It has been in business for more than ten years. It does not manufacture its products, but under the name, \u201cALO-CREME\u201d advertises and sells through substantially the same trade channels and in the same common market as appellee, a body lotion, hands, face and legs lotion, shampoo, skin cleanser and other preparations. It also advertises and sells a sun tan cream under the name, \u201cALO-CREME AFTER TAN.\u201d Since 1939 appellee, a Texas corporation with its principal place of business at San Antonio, Texas, has manufactured, advertised and sold under the name \u201cAL-LERCREME,\u201d cosmetic preparations for the same use, and also a sun tan cream under the name \u201cALLERCREME SAF-TAN.\u201d It has about 3400 accounts throughout the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>and appellee sell some of the same customers (R 245).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">On January 13, 1955 (R 288,289), ap-pellee wrote appellant asserting that the names were entirely too similar, making complaint of the likelihood of confusion, and inviting an adjustment without litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The parties advance a number of well established principles of law. We adhere to those applicable, but so much has been written in this area that a restatement would be a work of supererogation rather than utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">First we must inquire whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact in this case were \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d under Rule 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The rule that a finding of fact by the District Court, sitting without a jury, may be set aside on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous, Rule 52(a), 28 U.S.C.A., applies to patent and trademark cases under 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 146.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Esso Standard Oil Company v. Sun Oil Company, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 154, 229 F.2d 37, Cert. denied, 351 U.S. 973, 76 S.Ct. 1027, 100 L.Ed. 1491. In patent and trademark cases \u201ca finding of fact by the Patent Office as to priority of invention or confusing similarity of marks must be accepted as controlling, unless the contrary is established by evidence \u2018which, in character and amount carries thorough conviction.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Esso Standard Oil Company v. Sun Oil Company, supra. This rule applies though the case is heard <em>de novo </em>in the District Court. Radio Corporation of America v. International Standard Electric Corporation, 3 Cir., 232 F.2d 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">The Examiner of Interferences in his findings and opinion of February 21, 1958, ruled that there was likelihood of confusion,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and found two instances of actual confusion, but held that two instances over the years were not conclusive as showing actual confusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commissioner, speaking through his Assistant in affirming the Examiner, also ruled that there was a likelihood of confusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-20\">The record made on the trial before the court reveals thirteen instances of actual confusion occurring between January 13, 1959, and February 19, 1962.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-22\">The trial court concluded that there was not only a likelihood of confusion,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but that actual confusion had resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The record supports the court\u2019s findings of fact. Such findings are not clearly erroneous either in law or fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Although proof of actual deception is not needed to justify an injunction against the use of a trademark, Abramson v. Coro, Inc., 5 Cir., 240 F.2d 854, such proof emphasizes the need for that relief, both as to the infringing mark and as to unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">There was no error in the court\u2019s af-firmance of the decision of the Patent Office, or in granting injunctive relief to appellee under its counterclaim, and its decision is</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-7\">. Appellee instituted timely Cancellation Proceedings to the former and Opposition Proceedings to the latter. These proceedings were consolidated. The Examiner of Interferences sustained both proceedings. The Commissioner of Patents affirmed the decision of the Examiner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\">. Appellant represented to the Patent Office (R 286) that \u201cthe word \u2018ALO\u2019 appearing in applicant\u2019s mark has no meaning.\u201d Upon the pre-trial (R 84) it stated that the name \u201cALO-CREME\u201d was not descriptive and that it was an arbitrary mark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">. In Nashville Syrup Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 6 Cir. 215 P. 527, the court said: \u201cClosely connected with wliat has been said, but separately urged by defendant, is the claim that because in compounding its product defendant lias used coca leaves in considerable quantity and lias used real cola nuts to furnish the caffeine, it must be permitted to call its article \u2018Coca Cola.\u2019 * * * Assuming that \u2018Grape Nuts\u2019 had been exclusively used for a long period as the distinct name of a particular maker\u2019s compound food, could a newcomer rightfully take away a part of the established trade by using the same name for his new compound, just because it contained some nuts and was flavored with grape juice? To us, a negative answer seems imperative, and no less so in the instant case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\">. This section contains the following provision :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201cThe testimony and exhibits of the record in the Patent Office when admitted shall have the same effect as if originally taken and produced in the suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\">. Morgan v. Daniels, 153 U.S. 120, 125, 14 S.Ct. 772, 38 L.Ed. 657.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b122-12\">. The Examiner concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">\u201cSince the parties\u2019 cosmetic products move through the same trade channels, some in the same localities, and are advertised to the same purchasers, it is believed that contemporaneous use of the parties\u2019 marks on their identical goods would lead purchasers to attribute to Texas the source of Aloe\u2019s goods. Aloe is the newcomer in the field by a good many years so that it was incumbent upon Aloe to select marks that were not the same or substantially the same as those of Texas.\u201d (R 280)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b122-14\">. In his further opinion on application for reconsideration he qualified the latter holding, and ruled in effect that the absence of actual confusion over a reasonable period of time created no presumption against the likelihood of confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b122-24\">. The Commissioner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-25\">\u201cThe record leads to the inescapable conclusion that applicant\u2019s \u201cAlo-Creme\u201d and \u201cAlo-Creme After Tan\u201d so resemble opposer\u2019s previously registered marks \u201cAllercreme\u201d and \u201cSaf-Tan\u201d as to be likely, when applied to the goods, to cause confusion, mistake, or deception of purchaser. Applicant\u2019s arguments to the effect that since its product contains extx-actives of the aloe plant, this fact would be recognized by the public is not supported by the record, but even if it were, there is nothing in the record which indicates that such recognition would be sufficient to avoid the likelihood of confusion.\u201d (R 285)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b122-26\">. See R 190-197 and Exhibits 16(a) to 16(n) R 290-328.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b122-27\">. Only likelihood of confusion is required. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1052(d) and 1114(1). See American Foods, Inc. v. Golden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Flake, Inc., 5 Cir., 312 F.2d 619, 624, where this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-16\">\u201c[I]t is the accepted rule that infringement may be established by showing only that confusion is likely, and there need be no showing of actual confusion or deception if the mark is of such character or is used in such a way as to likely confuse a prospective purchaser. Abramson v. Coro, Inc., 5 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 854.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
