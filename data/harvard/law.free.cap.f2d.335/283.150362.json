He was eharged with shooting another with a shotgun foUow-\u00a1ng a fight in which he and geveral others had engaged. The victim testified he saw appellant shoot him. There was addi_ tional evidence, aside from confessions, that appellant was guilty, including testimony of a disinterested witness who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>lived nearby and saw a good deal of what was going on. Appellant, however, testified at his trial and denied he fired the shot. The question on appeal is whether the confession evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"A2iH\">On ample probable cause and shortly after the shooting Spriggs was arrested in the 600 block of Eastern Avenue near the Maryland line, placed in a patrol wagon and taken to the 14th Precinct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Bailey remained at the scene of the shooting and conducted an investigation there to determine whether it occurred in the District of Columbia. He also interviewed the disinterested witness above mentioned. This investigation necessarily consumed some time before the officer reached the Precinct where Spriggs had been taken after his arrest. The officer said only about fifteen minutes elapsed after he saw Spriggs leave the scene until he, the officer, arrived at the station, or \u201cmaybe twenty minutes.\u201d He testified he took Spriggs upstairs from the cell block to the detective\u2019s office, where he proceeded to fill out certain forms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During this process he conversed with Spriggs. Exactly what relationship, if any, the forms have to booking a prisoner is not clear. In any event during the form-filling process the officer asked Spriggs if he wanted to tell what happened. Spriggs responded: \u201cI am not going to tell you anything.\u201d The officer said he went ahead working on the papers. He asked Spriggs again if he wanted to tell what happened, and Spriggs said \u201che didn\u2019t want to tell me anything.\u201d The officer then said to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9d\">\u201c[T] he hell with it * * * If you don\u2019t want to tell me anything, you don\u2019t have to. The man you shot knows who shot him; the man that was with him knows who shot him; and I have a completely disinterested witness who also knows who shot him, and she is the one who told me your name. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">It was then that he said Spriggs said \u201cAll right, I shot the man,\u201d followed by \u201cmore conversation filling out this form\u201d during which, the officer continued, Spriggs gave some details, and \u201clater on in the evening\u201d he and Spriggs were joined by Officer Bell, to whom Spriggs also admitted the shooting. This officer testified he arrived at the station at approximately 10:00 p. m. and found Spriggs with Officer Bailey, who was still filling out forms. He said \u201cI think, if I am not mistaken, he had already been placed on the book prior to the statement of facts and the line-up sheet being made, and then after the line-up sheet and statements of facts were made, he was taken back downstairs and placed in the cell block to be taken to the Court the next morning.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">Spriggs himself, at the hearing on the admissibility of his statements,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> testified he was arrested between 7:30 and 8:00 p. m., and was taken to the 14th Precinct and placed in a cell. He asked if he could make a phone call and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>told that he could make no call until he was ready to talk about shooting Shaw. He said he did not shoot Shaw. He was left in the cell until about 2:30 or 3:00 o\u2019clock when he was taken upstairs. He was told he did not have to tell anything, \u201cWe got a man [who] can testify that you actually shot Shaw.\u201d He asked who it was and was told that his name was Joseph Washington. Spriggs then asked to be taken to confront Washington and was told they did not have to do that: \u201cWe already have a statement.\u201d Spriggs said he did not admit he had shot Shaw, the only thing he said was \u201cIf Washington said I shot him, well, I shot him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We do not agree that the admissions were \u201cthreshold.\u201d Just what occurred at the station, and its sequence, cannot be determined with accuracy. It is clear, however, that Spriggs was booked and then taken \u201cupstairs\u201d for questioning during a process of form-filling, instead, as required, being taken \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d to a magistrate after being booked. Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957). Spriggs twice responded to the officer he did not wish to say anything. This much appears from the officer\u2019s own evidence. He was then told, \u201cTo hell with it\u201d etc., as above set forth, as also appears from the officer\u2019s own evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The <em>McNabb-Mallory </em>exclusionary rule does not permit the use at trial of evidence of a repudiated confession obtained by secret interrogation during a form-filling process such as here occurred after arrest on probable cause and prior to arraignment. It is of little consequence that the officer says he advised Spriggs he need make no statement and if he did it would be used against him. Under the law Spriggs was entitled to be taken to a magistrate for public advice by the magistrate as to his rights, including his right to counsel with an opportunity to obtain counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the varying circumstances affecting different persons, with differences in their experience, education and other individual attributes, it is impossible to measure accurately the pressures in a Police Station upon prisoners under secret interrogation without counsel, relative or friend. The unreliability of evidence of statements then said to have been made, as well as the need to obtain compliance with Rule 5(a), <em>note 5, supra, </em>is one of the reasons the Supreme Court adopted the rule of evidence regarding confessions which no longer turns upon the issue of their voluntariness. The rule is found in the following language of the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">\u201cThe arrested person may, of course, be \u2018booked\u2019 by the police. But he is not to be taken to police headquarters in order to carry out a process of inquiry that lends itself, even if not so designed, to eliciting damaging statements to support * * * his guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Mallory v. United States, supra 354 U.S. at 454, 77 S.Ct. at 1359. To enlarge the time consumed in the usual booking process by the filling out of a number of forms prior to taking the prisoner to a magistrate, and to contend that the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>thus consumed is not \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d and therefore available for secret interrogation to elicit a confession is to ask the court to erode the <em>McNabb-Mallory </em>rule. If these forms are to be filled out prior to the prisoner\u2019s appearance before a magistrate, which may well be, it does not follow that a self-ineriminating statement elicited by police interrogation during the process is admissible. The inquiries of Officer Bailey in this case were designed, as appears from his own testimony, to elicit the \u201cdamaging statements\u201d referred to in <em>Mallory, </em>and such statements are not rendered admissible because elicited during the form-filling process. We bear in mind that <em>Mallory </em>is a reaffirmation and clarification of McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 344, 63 S.Ct. 608, 614, 87 L.Ed. 819, where the Court in 1943 had said that the statutory predecessor of Rule 5(a) \u201caims to avoid all the evil implications of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime.\u201d S.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The <em>Mallory </em>rule does not exclude a spontaneous confession after arrest. As the Court said in United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65, 69, 64 S. Ct. 896, 898, 88 L.Ed. 1140 (1944), the mere fact that a confession is made while in the custody of the police does not render it inadmissible. But this was said in a case where the prisoner\u2019s action was described by the Court as \u201cspontaneous cooperation and concession of guilt.\u201d The admission of spontaneous or threshold confessions has been upheld by this court in Perry v. United States, 102 U.S. App.D.C. 315, 253 F.2d 337 (1957), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 941, 78 S.Ct. 785, 2 L. Ed.2d 816 (1958), and in other cases where there was deemed to be no \u201cunnecessary delay.\u201d See, <em>e. g., </em>Muschette v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 241, 322 F.2d 989, 991 (1963), in which the total delay between arrest and arraignment was less than two hours and in which the oral confession appears to have been given within twenty-five minutes after arrest, and was then reduced to writing and signed within an hour. Critical to the decision is the court\u2019s statement, \u201cThe problem is not to be solved by watching the clock\u201d; it is in determining \u201cwhether the delay which occurred was in fact unnecessary.\u201d And see Bailey v. United States, 117 U.S.App. D.C.-, 328 F.2d 542 (1964), and cases there reviewed. In these cases the time between the arrest and the obtaining of the questioned evidence may have been longer than in Spriggs\u2019 case, so that if the clock alone were to be watched these decisions would require admission of the evidence of Spriggs\u2019 confession; but we have held and we now hold that time is but one factor. There always remains the question whether the time was utilized to obtain a confession by secret police interrogation after arrest and prior to a magistrate\u2019s hearing. For a confession so obtained is not \u201cspontaneous\u201d within the <em>Mitchell </em>decision, and it is not admissible under <em>Mallory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">The <em>McNabb-Mallory </em>rule, as it seems to me, takes into account not only the obtaining of compliance with Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As we have said it takes into account also the unreliability of evidence obtained by secret interrogation. We add that the rule is related also to the constitutional protection of the Fifth Amendment against compelled self-incrimination, and to the guaranty of the Sixth Amendment of the right to counsel and to a public trial, though the rule has not been explicitly based upon these constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">As we pointed out in Killough v. United States, <em>suyra, </em>the status of a person changes when he is arrested. The law attaches specific rights to this changed status, spelled out in Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>governmental machinery available to aid the investigation and prosecution of crime is to be used consistently with these rights. The result is to preclude the use at trial of self-incriminating statements said to have been made during secret police interrogation in the interval after arrest and prior to compliance with the rights granted \u2014 statements which are not \u201cspontaneous\u201d as in <em>Mitchell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">It would be a disservice to the exclusionary rule reaffirmed in <em>Mallory </em>were we to hold that the means here used to enlarge the period of delay between arrest and magisterial proceedings served to render admissible confessions said to have been elicited during that period. For us so to hold would sanction an erosion of an important rule of evidence. It was the erosion of <em>McNabb </em>that led the Supreme Court in <em>Mallory </em>to reaffirm <em>McNabb.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-5\">. This Precinct is located at 4135 Bonning Road, Northeast.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">. Being asked how many forms have to be made out in the normal police procedure, when booking an arrested defendant, he said, \u201cWe have to make a statement of facts for the Court, a line-up sheet, at that time an investigation sheet and the report that goes on the OCR book at the precinct \u2014 four forms.\u201d OCR is a ledger book \u2014 Central Communications and Records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\">. Although an overnight delay is commonly unnecessary where, as in the District of Columbia, a magistrate is available at all hours, Coleman v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 191, 317 F.2d 891 (1963) ; Jones v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 256, 307 F.2d 397 (1962), the trial court admitted the confessions on the theory they were \u201cthreshold confessions.\u201d See Mitchell v. United States, 322 U.S. 65, 64 S.Ct. 896, 88 L.Ed. 1140 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-16\">. The testimony as to the confessions followed a hearing at which the jury was excluded. At the conclusion of the hearing the court decided the admissions should be received. When the case was first briefed in this court this was not relied upon as error. However, members of the court were concerned as to admissibility of the evidence and memoranda were requested and filed after argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\">. Rule 5(a) and (b), Fed.R.Crim.P.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201c(a) Appearance before the Commissioner. An officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner or before any other nearby officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States. When a person arrested without a warrant is brought before a commissioner or other officer, a con-plaint shall be filed forthwith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">\u201c(b) Statement by the Commissioner. The commissioner shall inform the defendant of the complaint against him, of his right to retain counsel and of his right to have a preliminary examination. He shall also inform the defendant that he is not required to make a statement and that any statement made by him may be used against him. The commissioner shall allow the defendant reasonable time and opportunity to consult counsel and shall admit the defendant to bail as provided in these rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b334-5\">. In the present ease the statement to Officer Bell was inadmissible under Killough v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 315 F.2d 241 (1962), once it is held the statements to Officer Bailey were inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b334-14\">. <em>Mallory </em>points out that time may be taken to verify a claim of the arrestee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>that would show his arrest to be a mistake. We have no such situation here. Similarly, the questions asked by the police cannot be justified as \u201cappropriate inquiry to make sure that the police were not charging the wrong persons,\u201d as in Heideman v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 128, 130, 259 F.2d 943, 945 (1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 959, 79 S.Ct. 800, 3 L.Ed.2d 767 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b335-7\">BURGER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"al0-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"A2x\">Appellant\u2019s admission that he shot the complaining witness came within 30 minutes after his arrest. There is no evidence in this record, and we have no basis for noticing judicially, what length of time was reasonably required in this case to complete the formalities described as \u201cbooking.\u201d These are not idle formalities; nothing could be more dangerous than to have people taken into custody without promptly making a complete record of the fact of detention, the name and address of the person, his nearest relatives, his employment and some statement of why he is in custody. This may take more time in some circumstances than in others, depending upon variable factors. I agree that \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d cannot be measured solely by the-clock, but I also insist that these steps' before preliminary hearing are essential and cannot be dispensed with or truncated.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">The maj'ority seems to conclude, as I read the opinion, that any time lapse is-bad if, during that time, an arrested-person makes damaging admissions; it is not time but talking which is considered wrong. But to me a twenty to-thirty minute time lapse, in which an admission is made, does not seem per se-inordinate or unreasonable, and on this record we have no way of knowing that the \u201cdelay\u201d was in fact unnecessary. For' this reason I would not reverse but remand so that a record can be made as to precisely what was done, what was \u201cnecessary\u201d and what, if anything, was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d On such a record the District Judge could separately evaluate the-admissibility of both the oral and the-written statement. We would then have-an adequate basis for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">It should be clear that under the-relevant holdings of the Supreme Court and this court the interrogation of a-person in custody by police, however desirable and logical it may seem for the-solving of crimes, is now drastically limited. It should be equally clear that under the relevant decisions it is impermissible to prolong the formalities or \u201cbooking\u201d process or form filling for the purpose of engaging in questioning on the substantive facts of a real or suspected criminal act, once it is clear that there is probable cause to charge a crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-15\">But we cannot assume, as I suggest the court often does, that the evaluation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>probable cause is a simple matter like measuring the length of the suspect\u2019s shoe or the caliber of a pistol cartridge. This is especially so when the courts frequently change and raise the standards. It is no simple process in every case for a police officer to be absolutely sure at a given point that he indeed has adequate grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The matter of processing a detained person for presentment to a magistrate has been unnecessarily confused by such irrelevancies as loose talk about \u201cmidnight hearings\u201d and \u201c24-hour magistrate service.\u201d The heart of the problem, as I see it, is that once it can fairly be said that there is probable cause to charge a detained person, he is not to be interrogated. He may be held to await the reasonable availability of a judicial officer. If the arrest occurs at midnight, it is absurd to talk of calling a Judge or Commissioner out of his bed to conduct a hearing which may take only 10 minutes and can as readily be held in regular business hours the following morning. Moreover, police officers or other witnesses may not be available outside regular business hours. But during the interval while the detained person is awaiting presentment before a judicial officer, substantive interrogation must, under the controlling authorities, be suspended. It is not delay per se which is prohibited by Mallory; it is the interrogation process which is restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Once probable cause is established, as it may have been by the time officer Hall returned to the Precinct Station 20 or 30 minutes after the arrest, formalities of booking should be disposed of promptly and the suspect taken to the judicial officer for his warning and hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Police precinct stations, on a July Sunday evening, are often very busy places. People and officers come and go; officers are likely to be interrupted by a multiplicity of demands on their attention. The process of securing information for \u201cbooking\u201d cannot be as formal and orderly as a housewife, interviewing a much sought after cook who, because of her preferred position, is able to command the exclusive attention of the interviewer. We ought to act on facts, not conjecture and surmise. Since we know that Judges and Justices of the United States Courts often labor in study and conferences for days, weeks and even months in an appraisal of probable cause or reasonable grounds for an arrest, a warrant or a charge, it hardly seems rational to me to deny police officers, who are not profoundly trained in law, a period of 45 minutes, more or less, for the combined process of evaluating and articulating the grounds for charging a criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">There may or may not be some explanation which would satisfy us either that the delay and police activities during the interim were unnecessary or that they were not. I would not act without an adequate record developing all the facts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-16\">. When a spontaneous threshold confession is made or when admissions follow from appropriate limited inquiry, see Heideman v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 128, 259 F.2d 943 (1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 959, 79 S.Ct. 800, 3 L.Ed.2d 767 (1959), it is not merely proper but highly desirable to reduce such statements to writing promptly. See Metoyer v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 62, 64-65, 250 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>F.2d 30, 32-33 (1957).
