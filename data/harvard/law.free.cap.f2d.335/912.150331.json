Before pleading to the indictment appellant requested that counsel be appointed to assist him and the court appointed Mr. Joe A. Duran of the New Mexico Bar in that capacity. After entering pleas of not guilty to the charges, appellant in due time proceeded to trial before a jury, which trial resulted in verdicts of guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>upon each count. From the judgments of conviction entered he now appeals, contending that (a) he did not receive the effective assistance of counsel in fact and (b) he did not receive the assistance of competent counsel as a matter of law because Mr. Duran was then engaged as a Special Assistant Attorney General of New Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\"> A careful review of the record clearly indicates that, in fact, Mr. Duran\u2019s representation of appellant, both in pretrial proceedings and during the trial, was entirely adequate and professionally competent. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that he was denied his constitutional right in such regard. Effective representation does not guarantee a subjectively satisfactory result for those accused of crime. Frand v. United States, 10 Cir., 301 F.2d 102; Criser v. United States, 10 Cir., 319 F.2d 849; Hester v. United States, 10 Cir., 303 F.2d 47, cert. den., 371 U.S. 847, 83 S.Ct. 80, 9 L.Ed.2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Appellant\u2019s second contention is more troublesome. At the time of Mr. Duran\u2019s appointment as appellant\u2019s trial counsel the court was not aware that Mr. Duran was, by contract, rendering part-time legal service to the New Mexico State Planning Office and held the title of Special Assistant Attorney General. Nor was Mr. Duran aware of Rule 3(g) of the Rules for the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-7\">\u201cNeither the Attorney General of the State of New Mexico, nor any of his assistants; no District Attorney in the State of New Mexico or any of his assistants, nor any United States Commissioner, shall appear in this court and defend any person charged with an offense against the laws of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">And appellant was aware of neither the rule nor Mr. Duran\u2019s service to the State of New Mexico. It was only after a motion for new trial had been denied and appellant had been sentenced that the court learned of Mr. Duran\u2019s official state service. The Court then promptly and properly, upon its own motion, conducted a hearing upon the matter, concluded that appellant was in no way prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s outside employment and denied a renewed motion for new trial. We hold that under all the circumstances the ruling violated no right of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Local Rule 3(g) is a rule of general application intended as a procedural safeguard to the integrity of the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts of New Mexico. The rule has no&gt; special application to appointed counsel and may be modified \u201cin special cases * * * to avoid injustice. * * * \u201d under Local Rule 18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the case at bar Mr. Duran\u2019s professional service to the state was limited to \u201clooking through the New Mexico Statutes and taking out the statutes that would be pertinent to cities or counties within the state as to planning zoning laws and other such laws\u201d and \u201cdoing work on emergency planning in case of national disaster.\u201d The trial court found that Mr. Duran had no conflict of interest in his professional duties, had no authority or special responsibility in the enforcement of criminal law in the State of New Mexico, and that appellant was not prejudiced by the coincidence of Mr. Duran\u2019s position as a special assistant attorney general. It was well within the trial court\u2019s discretion to refuse strict application of its Rule 3(g) and to treat the rule as having been modified to \u201cavoid injustice.\u201d Injustice to the United States, though seldom so termed, is not a phrase without real meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-12\">. Rule 18 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ami-dedup-0\">\u201cAny of tie foregoing rules shall, in special cases, be subject to such modification as may be necessary to meet emergencies or avoid injustice and great hardship.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
