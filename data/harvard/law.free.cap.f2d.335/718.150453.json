All appellants have their principal offices in Patchogue, New York. Appellee Saxon is Comptroller of the Currency. Appellee Tinker National Bank, intervenor in the District Court, is a national banking association with its principal office in East Setauket, Long Island, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-22\">On March 15, 1962, Tinker National Bank applied to the Comptroller of the Currency to open a branch office at 307 East Main Street in an unincorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>area immediately contiguous to the incorporated village of Patchogue. Notice of the application was given to the appellant banks by the Superintendent of Banks of New York and by the representative of the Comptroller of the Currency. Each of the three appellant banks filed its protest and stated its grounds for opposition to the application. Investigation of the application for the Tinker branch was duly made and, after intermediate reports,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *approval for the establishment of the branch was given by the Comptroller. Protests again were made by appellant banks, but ultimately approval of the branch application was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">After receiving notice of the approval, counsel for appellant banks requested that a hearing be held on the application prior to the actual issuance of the certificate establishing the branch. The hearing was denied by the Comptroller, final permission to open was given, and the branch office was in fact opened July 5, 1962, at a location close to the originally proposed site.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Subsequently, on August 2,1962, appellants instituted this suit in the District Court, seeking declaratory judgment and injunctive relief from the Comptroller\u2019s granting of Tinker\u2019s application. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted the motions of appellees and denied the motion of appellants. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Appellants raise essentially two questions: (1) whether appellee Saxon violated \u00a7 36(c) of the National Bank Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in granting Tinker\u2019s application; and (2) whether appellee Saxon denied appellants due process of law, and violated accepted standards of administrative fairness by basing his approval of Tinker\u2019s application in whole or in part on representations made to him at an <em>ex parte </em>meeting requested by Tinker. While the second issue raises a substantial problem in this case, we do- not, reach that question, in view of our disposition of appellants\u2019 first contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">Appellants argue that the Comptroller-violated \u00a7 36(c) of the National Bank. Act in granting Tinker\u2019s application.. That statute provides, in pertinent part::</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-12\">\u201cThe conditions upon which a national banking association may retain or establish and operate a branch or branches are the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-13\">*#-*** -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-14\">\u201c(c) A national banking association may, with the approval of the-Comptroller of the Currency, establish and operate new branches * * (2) at any point within the State in-which said association is situated, if such establishment and operation are-at the time authorized to State banks-by the statute law of the State in question <em>by language specifically granting such authority affirmatively and not merely by implication or recognition, </em>and subject to the restrictions as to location imposed by the law of the State on State banks. * * * \u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">Thus, under this statute the Comptroller may, in his discretion, permit the establishment of a national bank branch if the statutory law of the particular state would permit a state bank to branch in the same location. On the other hand, in the absence of affirmative state legislation required by \u00a7 36(c) no branch may be established, even with the approval of the Comptroller, for \u201cthere is no discretion in the Comptroller to approve the establishment of a branch office at a location prohibited by law.\u201d Commercial State Bank of Roseville v. Gidney, 174 F.Supp. 770, 778 (D.D.C.1959), aff\u2019d, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 37, 278 F.2d 871 (1960). Cf. National Bank of Detroit v. Wayne Oakland Bank, 252 F.2d 537, 541 (6th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Section 105 of the New York Banking Law, the effect of which is in dispute here, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\">\u201c1. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">\u201c(b) A bank or trust company may open and occupy a branch office or branch offices in any city or village located in the banking district in which is located its principal office * * * provided in no event shall a branch be opened and occupied pursuant to this paragraph (b) in a city or village * * * in which is already located the principal office of another bank, trust company or national banking association. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">\u201c4. The term 'village\u2019 as used in this section shall mean either an incorporated or an unincorporated village.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The ultimate issue, of course, is whether this statute would authorize the establishment of a state branch bank at the proposed location of the Tinker branch. Specifically, the disagreement between the parties here centers about the meaning of the words \u201cunincorporated village.\u201d The statutory language is critical, for nowhere else in the New York statutory provisions is the phrase \u201cunincorporated village\u201d defined.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Appellants argue that the phrase indicates an area possessed of some of the characteristics of a community, \u201csuch as a post office, shopping center, business district, school, churches, or even a separate identity recognized in local custom.\u201d The unincorporated area in which the Tinker branch is located, appellants contend, is not a \u201cvillage\u201d in such a sense, and on brief insist, in effect, that the area was here artificially taken to be a \u201cvillage\u201d in a \u201ctransparent attempt to evade and nullify the intent of the New York statute.\u201d Thus, it is argued, the establishment of the branch was not authorized by state legislation, as required by \u00a7 36 (c) of the National Bank Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">In granting Tinker\u2019s application, however, the Comptroller interpreted the words to mean any unincorporated area that might theoretically qualify for incorporation as a village under \u00a7 2 of the New York Village Law. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-14\">\u201cA territory not exceeding three square miles or conforming to the entire boundaries of a water district, lighting, fire or school district, or an entire town, or two entire school districts, containing in each case a population not less than five hundred, and not including a part of a city or village, may be incorporated as a village under this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">Having determined that the area delineated in the application was not more than three square miles in area and was populated by more than five hundred persons, which facts appellants do not dispute, the Comptroller decided that Tinker properly qualified as a branch applicant, and \u201cin the exercise of his discretion\u201d issued the certificate granting the application. Appellants argue that the Comptroller\u2019s interpretation in effect writes the word \u201cvillage\u201d out of \u00a7 105 of the Banking Law. We find ourselves in agreement with appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">Traditionally, the word \u201cvillage\u201d has connoted an area possessed of some attributes of a community. As observed by the Michigan Supreme Court in Wyandotte Savings Bank v. State Bank Comm\u2019r, 347 Mich. 33, 41, 78 N.W.2d 612, 617 (1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-17\">\u201cThe word \u2018village\u2019 is not a technical word, or one having a peculiar meaning, but is a common word in general usage with an ancient lineage. It is merely an assemblage or community of people, a nucleus or cluster for residential and business purposes, a collective body of inhabi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>tants, gathered together in one group.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"a4s-dedup-0\">Inasmuch as the New York Banking Law does not specifically define the word \u201cvillage,\u201d it must be presumed that the New York Legislature intended it to be given its natural meaning.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A50\">We are of the opinion that the Comptroller, in choosing to define \u201cunincorporated village\u201d as any unincorporated area possessed merely of the minimum geographic and population requirements for incorporation under \u00a7 2 of the Village Law, has ignored entirely the usual and customary meaning of the word \u201cvillage.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the absurd extreme, a boundary could be drawn around a sufficiently large apartment house and meet the not-more - than - three - square - miles - nor-less - than - 500 - people prerequisite for incorporation. Moreover, adoption of the Comptroller\u2019s interpretation would permit, if not promote, the gerrymandering of boundaries for purposes of branch bank applications. For example, an applicant for a national bank branch could arbitrarily delineate boundaries within a larger unincorporated area which in-eluded the requisite three square miles or less and having more than a 500 population. Following a grant of that application the boundaries delineated would have no further significance. Consequently, a subsequent applicant for a branch could likewise draw another arbitrary boundary in the same general area, perhaps greatly overlapping what had been the area used by the earlier appliCant, and so on.</p>\n<p id=\"amb-dedup-0\">dn State Bank of Kenmore v. Bell, 197 Misc. 97, 96 N.Y.S.2d 851, aff\u2019d, 277 App. Div. 924, 98 N.Y.S.2d 493 (1950), cited by both parties here, the petitioner, a state bank, challenged the approval of a branch application by the New York Banking Board. It was argued, among other things, that the Board had violated \u00a7 105 of the Banking Law in granting an application for the opening of a branch bank outside a city or village; \u201cthat it was not the intention of the Legislature to include within the provisions of the section any area which had not been incorporated as one of the statutory municipalities therein named.\u201d 96 N.Y.S.2d at 855. The court brushed aside the argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ment, noting that \u201cvillage\u201d was defined in the statute as either an incorporated or an unincorporated village, and that the petitioner\u2019s construction \u201cwould defy the plain words of the statute.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Thus, the question decided in that case was simply whether the statute authorized the opening of a branch bank outside the limits of an incorporated municipality. The court had no need to, and did not, construe the words \u201cunincorporated village.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor did the court determine whether there was any differentiation between \u201cunincorporated <em>area\u201d </em>and \u201cunincorporated <em>village\u201d </em>as appellants here suggest. However, the court did observe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALU\">\u201cTo adopt the petitioner\u2019s view would be to deny banking facilities to residents of the state who live in populated but unincorporated areas <em>wherein every other facility for modern living exists </em>on the basis that the areas involved although eligible to do so had not been formally incorporated. The Legislature did not intend such and has expressly said so. * * * \u201d Ibid. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0xh\">We feel that if the court\u2019s opinion indicates anything on the point, it suggests that an \u201cunincorporated village\u201d would be an area possessed of some attributes of community life or interests. The opinion does not support appellees\u2019 interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> In appellees\u2019 brief, it is contended that the Comptroller\u2019s interpretation \u201caccords with the provisions of the New York statute, <em>as interpreted by the New York banking authorities\u201d </em>and that \u201cthe Comptroller observed the provisions of the New York statute <em>as applied administratively </em>and judicially.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] The references made are to the New York Banking Department\u2019s use of the incorporation prerequisites in the Village Law, \u00a7 2 as guidelines in its administration of \u00a7 105 of the Banking Law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 36(c) of the National Bank Act, however, is clear and specific that a national bank may branch only where a state bank branch would be authorized \u201cby the <em>statute law </em>of the State in question <em>by language specifically granting such authority affirmatively and not merely by implication or recognition </em>* * [Emphasis supplied.] Since we are of the opinion that the- \u00a7 36(c) reference to \u201cthe statute law of the State\u201d includes legislative enactments and not administrative interpretations of those enactments, the New York Banking Department\u2019s view of \u00a7 105 of the New York Banking Law would not be authority for the establishment of the Tinker branch. Cf. State v. National Bank of South Dakota, 219 F.Supp. 842, 848-51 (D.S.D.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">In view of the foregoing, the judgment of the District Court granting the motions by appellees for summary judgment is vacated. The case will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\">.
