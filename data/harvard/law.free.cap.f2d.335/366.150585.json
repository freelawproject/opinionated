We think the record shows the court did not have jurisdiction. <em>tt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">The Complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as amended, was based upon claim of a \u201cfederal question,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arising under the Fourth <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Fifth <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Amendments to the United States Constitution; and a civil rights violation under \u00a7 1343(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss which challenged the complaint on jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">The district court, on the \u201csworn amended complaint, affidavits and evidence of the plaintiff,\u201d found that plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights to privacy, personal liberty and freedom were violated by the surveillance; and that unless defendant was restrained plaintiff would suffer irreparable injury. The court granted a preliminary injunction. We stayed the effect of the injunction, pending appeal. Giancana v. Hoover, 322 F. 2d 789 (7th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">District courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, possessing only the jurisdiction that Congress has conferred upon them by statute. Klein v. Lee, 254 F.2d 188, 190 (7th Cir. 1958), citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Lockerty v. Phillips, 319 U.S. 182, 63 S. Ct. 1019, 87 L.Ed. 1339 (1943). And the jurisdiction conferred upon federal courts to entertain suits arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States has been \u201cnarrowly limited.\u201d Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U.S. 496, 507, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939). Furthermore, this court has the duty to satisfy itself of the jurisdiction of the district court. Jackson v. Kuhn, 254 F.2d 555, 560 (8th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The vital question depends on whether the record shows that \u201cthe matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,-000 * * * \u201d so as to give the district court jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In Jackson v. Kuhn, 254 F.2d 555, 556, 560 (8th Cir. 1958), the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of a diversity suit to restrain United States Army officers \u201cfrom * * * policing, occupying or interfering with the property or the students of Little Rock Central High School * * * \u201d because there was \u201cno allegation in the complaint that the value of the matter in controversy exceeds $3,000,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and no facts stated from which the requisite pecuniary value could be inferred. And the Fifth Circuit in Walton v. City of Atlanta, 180 F. 2d 143, 144 (5th Cir. 1950), on its own motion in a \u201cfederal question\u201d suit found federal jurisdiction lacking because \u201c[f]rom the allegations of the complaint, it does not appear that the amount in controversy exceeds three thousand dollars\u201d so as to confer jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Courts may not treat as a mere technicality the jurisdictional amount essential to the \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction, even in this ease where there is an allegedly unwarranted invasion of plaintiff\u2019s privacy. The showing of that essential is not a mere matter of form, but is a necessary element. Congress in \u00a7 1331 expressed the \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction in plain words. The district courts and suitors are bound by the words expressed. Congress could have withheld the jurisdiction entirely, as it did from 1789 to 1875. Or it could have given jurisdiction over suits arising \u201cunder the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States\u201d simply. But it limited the jurisdiction by including the element of the sum or value of the matter in controversy, and the Congressional will is that unless that sum or value is shown there is no \u201cfederal question\u201d presented and no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Neither may a party invoke the district court\u2019s jurisdiction by treating that element as though not essential; nor choose not to amend his complaint or otherwise show, as plaintiff did here, that the jurisdictional sum or value is in controversy, thus opposing his will to the Congressional will.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Plaintiff concedes that Jackson v. Kuhn, 254 F.2d 555 (8th Cir. 1958), and Van Buskirk v. Wilkinson, 216 F.2d 735 (9th Cir. 1954), support defendant\u2019s contention that the district court did not have jurisdiction because the jurisdictional amount is not expressly alleged in the complaint. Here the complaint makes no express allegation of the essential jurisdictional sum or value. Plaintiff argues, however, that the jurisdictional sum or value should be inferred from the allegations, supported by unimpeached affidavits. But there are no facts from which that necessary element can be inferred. If, as plaintiff contends, the sum or value cannot be alleged because of the priceless rights involved, how can this court infer that essential element? And there is no finding of the essential sum or value and no evidence on which to base a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">Congress had a reason for setting the minimum jurisdictional sum or value in limiting the jurisdiction of the district court.6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (It surely knew of the priceless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>nature of liberty and privacy when it required a showing of that element.) And placing the burden of estimating the value of one\u2019s claim upon him who sues is not unusual. If, for instance, plaintiff had chosen to sue for damages under \u00a7 1331, as plaintiff did in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946), for alleged violation of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment right of privacy \u2014 the basic claim here \u2014 he would have had to estimate the value of his claim. \u201cPlaintiff is master of his claim,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and it is no answer to failure to bring his claim within the 'jurisdictional prerequisite that the value is inestimable.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Finally plaintiff contends that the subject matter \u201cin controversy\u201d \u2014 the use of his home, his personal liberty and freedom, the tortious conduct of defendant and invasion of plaintiff\u2019s private rights \u2014 is admitted by defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, and that the substantive issue of the amount of damage awaits ultimate resolution in the trial court upon hearing of the cause on the merits. We disagree. The validity of the court\u2019s ruling must be determined as of the time it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">To support his argument about deferring resolution of the jurisdictional question plaintiff relies upon McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 56 S.Ct. 780, 80 L.Ed. 1135 (1936). That ease does not require, in the circumstances before us, that determination of the jurisdictional issue be deferred until plaintiff has an opportunity to furnish proof of his charges. We read McNutt, involving Indiana law regulating purchase of installment sales contracts, so far as pertinent here, to decide that if the requisite jurisdictional facts are alleged, and challenged, the plaintiff must support them by competent proof, and that in such a case an inquiry might be necessary to determine whether the facts support the allegations of jurisdiction; but that if the plaintiff fails to allege the facts prerequisite to show jurisdiction he has no standing. 298 U.S. at 189, 56 S.Ct. 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The district court erred in entertaining the suit before us because, having only the jurisdiction conferred by Congress, its jurisdiction was limited, so far as it is based upon \u00a7 1331, to controversies involving a sum or value in excess of $10,000, and plaintiff failed to allege, or otherwise show, his damage accordingly, or to allege, or otherwise show facts from which that essential jurisdictional element may be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">The court had no jurisdiction either, of the claims under \u00a7 1343(4), the \u201cCivil rights and elective franchises\u201d section: \u201cTo recover damages or to secure equitable or other relief under any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights * * Plaintiff does not allege nor show us otherwise \u201cany Act of Congress\u201d of whose violation he complains.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>There is no merit in the contention that defendant cannot raise the question of lack of jurisdiction because he did not comply with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That section does not apply because the order is \u201cotherwise appealable\u201d under \u00a7 1292 (a) (l),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and this court can itself note a jurisdictional defect. McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.S. 178, 187, 56 S.Ct. 780 (1936). * * '</p>\n<p id=\"AOs6\">Since there was no jurisdiction, we do mot reach the other points raised.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">Judgment vacated and the cause remanded for proceeding not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-18\">.

This court holds, however, that the complaint was fatally defective because there was no express allegation that the amount in controversy exceeded $10,000 and that this amount could not be inferred from the facts in-the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"ANz\">,, . . It is incongruous to hold that a formal allegation of the amount in controversy is necessary when personal liberties of the magnitude alleged in the complaint and found by the district court are involved.

The complaint alleged that defendant and his agents deprived plaintiff of the use of his home and that they violated his right of privacy and persona! liberty. From these allegations the district court could infer, contrary to what, the majority indicates, that the amount in controversy exceeded $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"AqRK\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AclE\">.
