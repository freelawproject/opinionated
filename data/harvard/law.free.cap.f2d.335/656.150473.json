Wong Hing Fun arrived on June 30, 1962; Ng Sui Sang arrived on December 20, 1962. Both sought shore leave under section 252 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1282. The immigrant inspector denied leave, because of appellants\u2019 failure to possess passports or other valid travel documents. However, pursuant to the discretionary authority granted the Attorney General by section 212(d) of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1182(d), and delegated to the inspector by applicable regulations, he paroled them temporarily into the United States. Both appellants absconded and failed to depart on their vessels. They were apprehended, and, when their vessels returned in May 1963, their paroles were revoked. Instead of departing on the vessels, they brought an action in the District Court against the District Director of Immigration pursuant to section 279 of the Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1329, seeking a declaratory judgment that the order revoking parole was illegal because it was entered without a full hearing. Summary judgment was granted the defendant, and the aliens appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">There is no basis for appellants\u2019 contention that due process requires a hearing on revocation of parole, even though Congress did not provide one. See Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 73 S.Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953); Tom We Shung v. Murff, 176 F.Supp. 253 (S.D.N.Y.1959),. affirmed sub nom. U. S. ex rel. Tom We Shung v. Esperdy, 274 F.2d 667 (2 Cir. 1960), United States ex rel. Paktorovics. v. Murff, 260 F.2d 610 (2 Cir. 1958) is confined to its special facts, as the opinion in that case recognized. For purposes of the Act, appellants never made\u2019 entries into the United States, and are subject to the exclusion rather than the expulsion provisions of the statute. Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 78. S.Ct. 1072, 2 L.Ed.2d 1246 (1958); Rogers v. Quan, 357 U.S. 193, 78 S.Ct. 1076, 2 L.Ed.2d 1252 (1958); Kaplan v. Tod, 267 U.S. 228, 45 S.Ct. 257, 69 L.Ed. 585 (1925). The Fifth Amendment does not affect, in any degree, Congress\u2019 plenary power over exclusion procedures. As no hearing is provided by statute in cases of this type, appellants, were entitled to none.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
