Judge Croake found the taxpayer entitled to an injunction but conditioned this on his not raising the statute of limitations in any subsequent proceedings concerning the tax. The taxpayer appealed from the insertion of the condition. The Govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>ment did not attempt to support this but sought affirmance on the ground that the finding of failure to send the notice of deficiency to the taxpayer\u2019s last known address was clearly erroneous. Since no appeal by the District Director was before us, the Director having been satisfied with the judgment as it stood and not having reacted to the taxpayer\u2019s appeal with sufficient promptness,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we held that \u201cUnder these circumstances we may not review these findings of the district court.\u201d After adding the dictum that \u201cWere the question open for review we would be inclined to conclude that the district court\u2019s finding lacked support in the record * * we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_HB\">\u201cThe judgment is modified to eliminate the condition and as so modified it is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Believing that the dictum might afford a springboard for rectifying his failure to take a timely appeal, the Director, on July 18, 1963, gave notice of a motion under F.R.Civ.Proc. 60(b) (5) to vacate the injunction on the ground that it was no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application. Reexamining the minutes, Judge Croake decided that his previous factual conclusion was wrong and vacated the injunction. From this the taxpayer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> The Director\u2019s motion misconceived the scope of the provision in F.R. Civ.Proc. 60(b) (5) authorizing relief when \u201cit is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\u201d The rule is not to be read without emphasis on the important words \u201cno longer\u201d; assuming that the propriety of the injunction as issued has passed beyond debate, it refers to some change in conditions that makes continued enforcement inequitable. \u201cThe injunction, whether right or wrong, is not subject to impeachment in its application to the conditions that existed at its making. We are not at liberty to reverse under the guise of readjusting.\u201d United States v. Swift &amp; Co., 286 U.S. 106, 119, 52 S.Ct. 460, 464, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932). Here the facts of record as to the mailing of notice and the applicable rules of law were no different in the fall of 1963 than when the judge had made his initial determination a year earlier or when we affirmed it in July; the quoted clause in Rule 60(b) is \u201cno invitation to relitigation of matter adjudged by the original judgment.\u201d 7 Moore, Federal Practice ft 60.26 [4], p. 288 (1955).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The Director contends also that the order was within F.R.Civ.Proc. 60(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>(1) permitting relief for \u201cmistake.\u201d Whether relief may be sought under Rule 60(b) for what is merely an error by the court and, if so, for how long beyond the expiration of the ten-day limit set by Rule 59(e) for motions to \u201calter or amend a judgment\u201d are not altogether clear. See 7 Moore, supra, If 60.23 [3-4], pp. 236-39. We allowed this to be done in Tarkington v. United States Lines Co., 222 F.2d 358 (2 Cir. 1955), but on very special facts. Eleven days after the entry of a defendant\u2019s judgment in that case, correct under the law laid down by this Court, the Supreme Court rendered a decision which showed the judgment to be erroneous; the plaintiff moved under Rule 60(b) ten days thereafter, within the 30-day period allowed for appeal. Under such circumstances there is indeed good sense in permitting the trial court to correct its own error and, if it refuses, in allowing a timely appeal from the refusal; no good purpose is served by requiring the parties to appeal to a higher court, often requiring remand for further trial proceedings, when the trial court is equally able to correct its decision in the light of new authority on application made within the time permitted for appeal, cf. McDowell v. Celebrezze, 310 F.2d 43 (5 Cir. 1962). But nothing in the Rule, the eases, or the treatises suggests that a motion for relief from judicial error more than eight months after the entry of judgment is made \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d as the Rule requires. \u201cRule 60(b) was not intended as a substitute for a direct appeal from an erroneous judgment.\u201d Hartman v. Lauchli, 304 F.2d 431, 432 (8 Cir. 1962); Wagner v. United States, 316 F.2d 871 (2 Cir. 1963). Professor Moore says that a reasonable time for making a motion under Rule 60(b) on the basis of judicial error should not exceed that allowed for an appeal. Ibid, at 239. Cf. Sleek v. J. C. Penney Co., 292 F.2d 256 (3 Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-17\">Since the motion thus presented no proper basis for action under F.R.Civ. Proc. 60(b), we find it unnecessary to consider appellant\u2019s further contention</p>\n<p id=\"A_IX\">that our affirmance of the judgment precluded the District Court from taking action under that Rule without first obtaining leave from this Court. Compare Judge Clark\u2019s views as to the lack of need for such leave, expressed in Perlman v. 322 West 72nd Street Co., 127 F.2d 716, 719 (2 Cir. 1942) and in S. C. Johnson 6 Son v. Johnson, 175 F.2d 176, 183-184, (2 Cir.) (dissenting opinion), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 860, 70 S.Ct. 103, 94 L.Ed. 527 (1949), with the contrary decisions; in Butcher &amp; Sherrerd v. Welsh, 206 F.2d 259, 262 (3 Cir. 1953), cert. denied, 346. U.S. 925, 74 S.Ct. 312, 98 L.Ed. 418; (1954) ; Tribble v. Bruin, 279 F.2d 424, 427 (4 Cir. 1960); Gender, Paeschke &amp;. Frey Co. v. Clark, 288 F.2d (7 Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 826 (1961); and Hartman v. Lauchli, supra, 304 F.2d, at. 432-433. See also In re Potts, 166 U.S. 263, 17 S.Ct. 520, 41 L.Ed. 994 (1897) <em>% </em>7 Moore, Federal Practice, 60.30 [2], pp. 339-40; Wright, Federal Courts, 385 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-5\">. The 60 days for filing notices of appeal limited by F.R.Civ.Proc. 73(a) expired Saturday, January 12, 1963. Plaintiff\u2019s notice was filed Friday, January 11, but, because it bore a wrong docket number, was not docketed until January 14. The Director\u2019s notice was not filed until January 14 which was untimely under the Rule then in force, although if the amendment of July 1, 1963, to Rule 6(a), which takes account of the modern status of Saturday, had then been in effect, it would have been timely. The Director did not seek relief under the remarkably expansive reading given the \u201cexcusable neglect based on a failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment\u201d clause of Rule 73(a), in Harris Truck Lines, Inc. v. Cherry Meat Packers, Inc., 371 U.S. 215, 83 S.Ct. 283, 9 L.Ed.2d 261 (1962), and, responsive to that decision, in Lieberman v. Gulf Oil Corp., 315 F.2d 403 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 823, 84 S.Ct. 62, 11 L.Ed.2d 56 (1963), see also Thompson v. I. N. S., 375 U.S. 384, 387, 84 S.Ct. 397, 11 L.Ed.2d 404 (1964) ; instead be bad bis appeal dismissed as untimely. The episode illustrates the desirability of the liberalization of the excusable neglect clause as to the time for taking an appeal in Rule 4(a) of the Proposed Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and of <em>the </em>provision in the same proposed rule that if a timely notice of appeal is filed by a party, any other party may file within 7 days thereafter even though the time otherwise limited has expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-10\">. The Government suggests that the <em>\u201cno </em>longer\u201d requirement is satisfied by the elimination of the condition unlawfully included in the <em>original </em>order. But this change was not the judge\u2019s reason for vacating the injunction. The factual conclusion which he now reversed had been found against the Director independent of the existence of the illegal condition, and the order based on that finding was affirmed by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
