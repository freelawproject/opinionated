In January, 1993, the defendant, who was twenty-one, resided in Meriden with his girlfriend, who was sixteen, and her two children, a boy, two years old, and a girl, four months old (baby). Although the defendant had been living with his girlfriend and her children for almost one year, he was not the biological father of either child. The trial court concluded, however, that the defendant had established a family-like relationship with the two children and their mother because he, along with his girlfriend, assumed responsibility for the care and welfare of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">On the night of January 27, 1993, the defendant telephoned 911 seeking emergency medical assistance because the baby was allegedly choking on milk. Steven Cushing, an emergency medical technician who responded, observed that the baby was seriously ill and her condition was not consistent with the reason for the emergency call, i.e., choking on milk. The baby was taken by ambulance to Veterans\u2019 Memorial Hospital in Meriden and from there by Life Star helicopter to Hartford Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The medical personnel at Hartford Hospital found that the baby had multiple rib and skull fractures, soft tissue bruises in unusual places, a brachial plexus injury, a rectal tear and bilateral subconjunctival nasal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>hemorrhages. None of the injuries was the result of falling, accident, birth, efforts to resuscitate, blocked air passages or choking on milk. The baby had no clotting or platelet system pathology. According to expert medical testimony, the baby was suffering a textbook case of battered child syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The defendant and his girlfriend were interviewed by investigators from the department of children and families and the Meriden police. The defendant subsequently was arrested* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and charged in a twenty-six count information. The information on the six counts of first degree assault charged the defendant with acts of omission, not commission. The trial court found the defendant guilty of assault in the first degree under the second, third, fifth, seventh, eighth and tenth counts,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child under the twenty-sixth count of the information. The trial court found the defendant not guilty as to the remaining counts of the information. The defendant was sentenced to forty years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The defendant appealed his conviction to this court. We upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction on the risk of injury to a child charge due to inadequate briefing, but reversed the conviction on the first degree assault charges because we concluded that \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) did not impose a duty on the defendant to act under the circumstances of this case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>41 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Conn. App. 333, 341, 675 A.2d 925 (1996), rev\u2019d, 245 Conn. 209, 715 A.2d 680 (1998). The state appealed. A divided Supreme Court reversed, holding that under the circumstances of this case, the defendant had a duty to protect the baby and to prevent further harm, and that by breaching that duty he could be found guilty of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 230. The Supreme Court remanded the case to us to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims and his constitutional claims arising from his breach of the duty the Supreme Court concluded existed under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). Id., 231-32 n.25.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that, as applied to him, the newly stated duty requiring any person living in a family-like situation to protect a child from parental abuse or to risk conviction of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) violates his right to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Specifically, the defendant claims that no person of ordinaiy intelligence could have foreseen (1) that <em>conduct </em>within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) includes the failure to act, (2) that \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) imposes a duty on parents to act affirmatively to protect their children from abuse and (3) that this duty extends to a person who assumes a familial, although not a legal, relationship to the children. We agree with the last of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The Supreme Court concluded that the defendant had a duty under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) and that the trial court concluded correctly that he breached that duty. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>question is whether it is a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to due process to uphold his conviction if, at the time of his alleged conduct, he could not have known that such a duty existed. The defendant claims that \u201c \u2018[w]hen a[n] . . . unforeseeable state-court construction of a criminal statute is applied retroactively to subject a person to criminal liability for past conduct, the effect is to deprive him of due process of law in the sense of fair warning that his contemplated conduct constitutes a crime.\u2019 <em>Bouie </em>v. <em>Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 354-55, 84 S. Ct. 1697, 12 L. Ed. 2d 894 (1964); see <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Buder, </em>412 U.S. 430, 432, 93 S. Ct. 2199, 37 L. Ed. 2d 52 (1973).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 177, 506 A.2d 109 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u201c \u2018The constitutional requirement of definiteness is violated by a criminal statute that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute. The underlying principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bouie </em>v. <em>Columbia, </em>supra, 378 U.S. 351, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harriss, </em>347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S. Ct. 808, 98 L. Ed. 989 (1954). \u201c \u2018[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law\u2019 . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Bouie </em>v. <em>Columbia, </em>supra, 351, quoting <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926). \u201cThere can be no doubt that a deprivation of the right of fair warning can result not only from vague statutory language but also from an unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of narrow and precise statutory language.\u201d <em>Bouie </em>v. <em>Columbia, </em>supra, 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u201c \u2018[T]he objection of vagueness is twofold: inadequate guidance to the individual whose conduct is regulated, and inadequate guidance to the triers of fact. The former objection could not be cured retrospectively by a ruling either of the trial court or the appellate court, though it might be cured for the future by an authoritative judicial gloss. . . .\u2019 [P.] Freund, The Supreme Court and Civil Liberties, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 533, 541 (1951). See [A.] Amsterdam, Note, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 67, 73-74, n.34. If this view is valid in the case of a judicial construction which adds a \u2018clarifying gloss\u2019 to a vague statute, id., at 73, making it narrower or more definite than its language indicates, it must be a fortiori so where the construction unexpectedly broadens a statute which on its face has been definite and precise. Indeed, an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an ex post facto law, such as Art. I, \u00a7 10, of the Constitution forbids. An ex post facto law has been defined by this Court as one \u2018that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action,\u2019 or \u2018that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed.\u2019 <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>3 Dall. 386, 390 [1798]. If a state legislature is barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause from passing such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction.\u201d <em>Bouie </em>v. Columbia, supra, 378 U.S. 353-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The question we must determine is whether applying our Supreme Court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), which held that any person living in a family-like situation has a duty to protect a child from parental abuse, violates the defendant\u2019s due process rights because the defendant did not have fair warning of the prohibited conduct. See id., 350. More specifically, we must determine whether a person of ordinary intelligence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>defendant\u2019s place would have known that he had a duty to help the baby in the circumstances of this case. We conclude that he would not have known.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">When this case was initially appealed to this court, a panel of three judges were of the opinion that, as a matter of law, a person who is not the biological or legal parent of a child did not owe that child a duty such that the failure to act would sustain a criminal conviction of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On appeal to our Supreme Court, in a concurrence, Justice Palmer noted that the legal duty the Supreme Court recognized in this case had never been expressly recognized in this state before. \u201cIn such circumstances, it is by no means clear that the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions permit such a duty to be imposed on this defendant for purposes of criminal liability under the assault statute.\u201d <em>State v. Miranda, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 232 <em>(Palmer, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Likewise, then Justice McDonald,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in the dissenting portion of his opinion wrote, \u201cWhether one who does not personally inflict the physical injury may be held liable under the assault statute for failure to seek medical treatment and whether a worsening of the victim\u2019s condition because of that failure is required, whether a failure to report continuing abuse may support liability for assault, and whether this doctrine should be restricted to cases of child abuse are questions I believe we must address.\u201d Id., 235 <em>(McDonald, J., </em>concurring in part, dissenting in part).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>In an emotional dissent, Justice Berdon railed against the horrendous facts presented by this case, but stated, \u201cThe rule of law must be upheld even when confronted with alarming allegations of improper acts, indeed allegations of loathsome conduct on the part of the defendant.\u201d Id., 236 <em>(.Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). Justice Berdon agreed with this court\u2019s holding that \u201c\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) does not include the \u2018omission to act.\u2019 \u201d Id., 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u201c \u2018Duty is a legal conclusion about relationships between individuals, made after the fact .... The nature of the duty, and the specific persons to whom it is owned, are determined by the circumstances surrounding the conduct of the individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clohessy </em>v. <em>Bachelor, </em>237 Conn. 31, 45, 675 A.2d 852 (1996). \u201cAlthough one generally has no legal duty to aid another in peril . . . there are four widely recognized situations in which the failure to act may constitute breach of a legal duty: (1) where one stands in a certain relationship to another; (2) where a statute imposes a duty to help another; (3) where one has assumed a contractual duty; and (4) where one voluntarily has assumed the care of another.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 221. Our Supreme Court recognized that the facts of this case as applied to the statute involved was an issue of first impression in this jurisdiction. Id., 220 n.13. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court created a common-law duty to act under the circumstances of this case based on a combination of factors one and four, after reviewing the case law from this jurisdiction and in several other jurisdictions concerning statutes other than \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). Id., 224-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Using the test enunciated in <em>Bouie </em>v. <em>Columbia, </em>supra, 378 U.S. 347, we conclude that no person of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ordinary intelligence in the defendant\u2019s place would have had fair notice that \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) imposed a duty on him to protect the baby from abuse, to secure medical help for her or to report the abuse to the authorities. Three judges of this court and one justice of our Supreme Court agree that under the facts of this case, the defendant had no duty to act and could not be subject to conviction under that statute. Two other justices of the Supreme Court had serious doubts as to whether the new duty could be applied to the defendant \u25a0without violating his constitutional right to due process. The defendant was, at the time the baby suffered serious, deplorable and life-threatening injuries, a twenty-one year old high school dropout, who had no biological or legal relationship to the baby. If the judges and justices of our Appellate and Supreme Courts cannot agree as to whether the statute put the defendant on notice that he had a duty to protect the baby, we cannot conclude that the defendant would have known that he was committing assault in the first degree when he failed to protect the baby, to secure medical treatment for her or to report the situation to the authorities. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment convicting the defendant of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court had insufficient evidence to convict him of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21. In view of our resolution of the defendant\u2019s constitutional due process claim in part I, we need address the sufficiency question only with respect to the risk of injury to a child conviction. Specifically, the defendant claims that the state failed to prove he had the requisite mental state. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The following additional facts as set forth in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The trial court concluded that some of the injuries the baby sustained were serious physical injuries within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specifically, the baby had two skull fractures that were caused by great force and created a risk of death due to the risk of a lethal brain injury. The baby\u2019s skull fractures, which were seven to ten days old when the baby was admitted to Hartford Hospital, were caused by two separate forces of severe magnitude. The baby also sustained serious physical injuries within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-3 (4) due to multiple rib fractures. The baby\u2019s fractured ribs were caused by severe force and created a risk of death due to the risk of heart and lung perforations and death by asphyxiation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Her rib fractures were approximately three weeks old when the baby was admitted to Hartford Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The baby also suffered a rectal tear, which was oozing blood at the time of the Hartford Hospital examination and was, therefore, of recent origin. The tear, caused by the forceful insertion of a foreign body into the baby\u2019s rectum, was a serious physical injury because it created a risk of death due to an intestinal perforation and overwhelming infection. The baby suffered a brachial plexus injury that affected the mobility of her left arm, which is a serious physical injury within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-3 (4). The age of the brachial plexus injury was unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The trial court also found, on the basis of expert medical testimony, that as a result of these injuries, at the time they were sustained and subsequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>baby would cry and scream. She would have noticeable physical deformities of swelling, bruising and poor mobility. Her ability to take food would be reduced, and at times, the baby\u2019s pain would be so great that she could not be consoled. A person seeing the baby would notice her injuries, reactions and deformities.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The various bruises on the baby\u2019s right cheek and the subconjunctival hemorrhages could be seen by anyone. The defendant knew of the rectal tear, and he observed swellings on the baby\u2019s skull, which he knew should feel hard rather than like jelly. Although he told his girlfriend to take the baby to the hospital, he did nothing to ensure that the baby actually received proper medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>246 Conn. 665, 670, 718 A.2d 925 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1125, 119 S. Ct. 911, 142 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1999). On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [trier of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty. ... <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>242 Conn. 485, 490, 698 A.2d 898 (1997).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolli, </em>53 Conn. App. 269, 271-72, 729 A.2d 245, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 926, 733 A.2d 850 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u201cWe note that the probative force of the evidence is not diminished because it consists, in whole or in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>of circumstantial evidence rather than direct evidence. ... It has been repeatedly stated that there is no legal distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence so far as probative force is concerned. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. . . . [T]he inquiry into whether the record evidence would support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not require a court to ask itself whether it believes that the evidence . . . established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>43 Conn. App. 801, 810, 687 A.2d 1279 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 908, 689 A.2d 472 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u201cWhile the [trier of fact] must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be [proven] beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . If it is reasonable and logical for the [trier] to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the [trier] is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Moreover, [i]n evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the [trier of fact] is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>248 Conn. 132, 177-78, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S.

Finally, in determining whether the [trier of fact] reasonably could have found guilt, we ask if any rational [fact finder] could have done so. <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>[219 Conn. 16, 20, 592 A.2d 149 (1991)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra [601].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jupin, </em>26 Conn.

Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 250, 188 A.2d 65 (1963). The former proscribed conduct applies to the indictment against the defendant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Unlike \u00a7 53a-59, the proscribed behavior is not limited to behavior that creates a risk of death or serious physical injury to another person. The language of \u00a7 53-21 applies to behavior that is merely likely to injure the health of the child. \u201cThe statute in so far as it applies here prohibits certain <em>behavior likely to physically injure </em>a minor .... The behavior which is prohibited is the creation of a situation <em>inimical or harmful to the minor\u2019s physical welfare. . . . </em>The first element is that the defendant\u2019s conduct was <em>wilful. </em>The word wil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ful means doing a forbidden act <em>purposefully </em>in violation of the law. It means that the defendant acted <em>intentionally </em>in the sense that his conduct was <em>voluntary </em>and not inadvertent and that he <em>intended the resulting injury </em>to the victim. Thus, wilful misconduct is <em>intentional </em>misconduct, which is <em>conduct done purposefully and with knowledge of [its] likely consequences. . . . </em>The second element is that the defendant <em>created a situation that was likely to be harmful to the victim\u2019s health. </em>Health means the state of being hale, sound or whole in body, mind or well being. The focus is on whether the situation was such that <em>harm to [the victim\u2019s] health [was] likely to occur.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>40 Conn. App. 805, 824, 673 A.2d 1158, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 925, 677 A.2d 949 (1996) (trial court jury instruction held adequate).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In this case, the trial court heard evidence, which demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knew the baby had suffered injuries. The bruises on her face and subconjunctival hemorrhages were visible to anyone looking at her. The defendant saw and felt the swollen areas of the baby\u2019s head. Such injuries endangered the baby\u2019s health. Although he knew of those obvious injuries as well as the rectal tear, the defendant made the deliberate choice not to seek medical help for the baby prior to his 911 call or to report her injuries to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the requisite intent to cause injury to the baby or, by failing to protect her, manifested a reckless disregard of the consequences, and to convict him of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The judgment is affirmed as to the conviction under \u00a7 53-21. The judgment is reversed as to the conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>on the six counts under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty as to those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>245 Conn. 209, 715 A.2d 680 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when ...
