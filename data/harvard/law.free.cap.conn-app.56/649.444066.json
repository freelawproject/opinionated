We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In late 1992, the defendant and two other individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>als founded American Investment Company, Inc. (corporation), pursuant to the laws of the state of Connecticut. The defendant, in addition to being the majority shareholder, was the president of the corporation and was responsible for its day-to-day operation. He also was responsible for the hiring and firing of personnel, and for signing and distributing paychecks. He told the corporation\u2019s employees that he owned the business and was the person in charge. The corporation\u2019s business was to help eastern European businesses obtain financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Between May and the end of September, 1995, six individuals employed to perform services for the corporation failed to receive compensation. In some instances, the defendant gave the employees paychecks that were returned for insufficient funds. In other instances, the defendant gave employees paychecks but asked them not to present the checks for payment until he advised them to do so. In yet other instances, the defendant did not give employees paychecks. The defendant made representations to the employees that they would be paid when funds were received from clients. Eventually, the employees left the corporation and never were paid for some or all of the services they rendered during the relevant period. They were owed $18,150. The employees, therefore, filed complaints with the department of labor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged with failure to pay wages in violation of \u00a7 31-71 c. Following his conviction, he was given a total effective sentence of ten years imprisonment, suspended after three years, and five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that \u00a7 31-71a et seq. is unconstitutional<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as applied to him because the increased penalty for conviction imposed by the legislature in its 1993 amendments to General Statutes \u00a7 31-71g;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see Public Acts 1993, No. 93-392, \u00a7 4; requires that an inference of intent be read into \u00a7 31-71c, specifically, that one cannot be convicted of a crime without an element of mens rea. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">\u201cBefore we begin our analysis, we note that [a] party who challenges the constitutionality of a statute bears the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and we indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality. . . . <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Voll, </em>38 Conn. App. 198, 203, 660 A.2d 358 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Merdinger, </em>37 Conn. App. 379, 382, 655 A.2d 1167 [cert. denied, 233 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Conn. 914, 659 A.2d 187] (1995). In addition to showing that [the statute] is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant must show that its effect or impact on him adversely affects a constitutionally protected right which he has. <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 569, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979). Finally, [w]hile the courts may declare a statute to be unconstitutional, our power to do this should be exercised with caution, and in no doubtful case. <em>Fair Cadillac-Oldsmobile Isuzu Partnership </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>229 Conn. 312, 316, 640 A.2d 101 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giordano </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>39 Conn. App. 183, 188-89, 664 A.2d 1136 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The constitutionality of \u00a7 31-71 c was first challenged in <em>State </em>v. <em>Merdinger, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 382, in which the defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional because it did \u201cnot prescribe a requisite mens rea, specifically, intent not to pay wages is not an element of the crime.\u201d This court upheld the constitutionality of the statute, citing the seminal United States Supreme Court case on the issue, <em>Morissette </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952). In both <em>Merdinger </em>and this case, the defendants rely on the common-law rule that the commission of a crime always encompasses the notion of an evil will or intention to do wrong.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant in the case before us acknowledges that there is a different class of laws that came into existence during the nineteenth century, primarily due to the Industrial Revolution, to protect the public health, welfare and safety. Violation of these regulatory laws became known as \u201cpublic welfare offenses.\u201d Id., 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\u201cWhile many of these duties axe sanctioned by a more strict civil liability, lawmakers . . . have sought to make such regulations more effective by invoking criminal sanctions to be applied by the familiar technique of criminal prosecutions and convictions. This has confronted the courts with a multitude of prosecutions, based on statutes or administrative regulations .... These cases do not fit neatly into any of such accepted classifications of common-law offenses, such as those against the state, the person, property, or public morals. Many of these offenses are not in the nature of positive aggressions or invasions, with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the nature of neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty. Many violations of such regulations result in no direct or immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger or probability of it which the law seeks to minimize. While such offenses do not threaten the security of the state in the manner of treason, they may be regarded as offenses against its authority, for their occurrence impairs the efficiency of controls deemed essential to the social order as presently constituted. In this respect, whatever the intent of the violator, the injury is the same, and the consequences are injurious or not according to fortuity. Hence, legislation applicable to such offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary element.\u201d Id., 254-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\u201cIt is well established that a criminal statute is not necessarily unconstitutional because it imposes strict liability. [P]ublic policy may require that in the prohibition or punishment of particular acts it may be provided that he who shall do them shall do them at his peril and will not be heard to plead in defense good faith or ignorance. <em>Shevlin-Carpenter Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>218 U.S. 57, 70, 30 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 930 (1910). The constitutional requirement of due process is not vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>lated merely because mens rea is not a required element of a prescribed crime. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Greenbaum, </em>138 F.2d 437, 438 (3d Cir. 1943).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Merdinger, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 382-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Although the defendant notes the legal philosophy and tenets explained in <em>Morissette </em>and <em>Merdinger, </em>he argues that his case is somehow different because the penalty imposed on him is more severe. \u201cWhile the general rule at common law was that the scienter was a necessary element in the indictment and proof of every crime, and this was followed in regard to statutory cilmes, even where the statutory definition did not in terms include it . . . [t]he legislature may, if it so chooses, ignore the common-law concept that criminal acts require the coupling of the evil-meaning mind with the evil-doing hand and may define crimes which depend on no mental element, but consist only of forbidden acts or omissions. . . . Whether or not a statutory crime requires mens rea or scienter as an element of the offense is largely a question of legislative intent to be determined from the general scope of the act and from the nature of the evils to be avoided.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>245 Conn. 442, 454, 718 A.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The defendant acknowledges the public policy purpose of \u00a7 31-71a et seq. The \u201cstatute is one of strict criminal liability designed to eradicate the evil of nonpayment of wages even though those without an evil purpose might end up ensnared in its net.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Merdinger, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 385. The defendant\u2019s position, however, is that the 1993 amendments to \u00a7 31-71g are unconstitutional because the legislation changed the character of the penalties prescribed for failure to pay wages from misdemeanor to felony. This change, the defendant argues, is contrary to dicta in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>Morissette.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant believes, therefore, that the greater penalty now imposed by \u00a7 31-71g requires the inference of a mens rea in \u00a7 31-71c.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Neither the United States Supreme Court nor our Supreme Court has held that the magnitude of the penalty determines the constitutionality of strict liability statutes. \u201cThere is a suggestion in some of the early cases dealing with police regulatory legislation not requiring any criminal intent that the penalties must be petty and not involve imprisonment. . . . The question left undecided in those cases, whether a provision for imprisonment necessarily implied a requirement of mens rea, has long been resolved in favor of the view that the abandonment of the element of intent depends upon the peculiar nature and quality of the offense and whether the penalty serves as an effective means of regulation. . . . <em>[State </em>v. <em>Kreminski, </em>178 Conn. 145, 152, 422 A.2d 294 (1979)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 456; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 607-10, 91 S. Ct. 1112, 28 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1971) (possession of unregistered firearm, crime punishable by ten years in prison, fine or both, strict liability offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Section 31-71g provides a regimen of increasingly severe fines and imprisonment, depending on the magnitude of the defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 31-71c. Here, the defendant was charged with six counts of failing to pay his employees. He owed six individuals compensation in amounts ranging from $1200 to $6500. The total owed was in excess of $18,000. The jury convicted the defendant on all six counts. The severity of his sentence was determined by the number and magnitude of the crimes he committed, not by the amendment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>the statute. In its wisdom, our legislature enacted laws that regulate the payment of an employee\u2019s wages and prescribe the penalties for failing to do so. The defendant has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u00a7 31-71a et seq. is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that if \u00a7\u00a7 31-71c (a) and 31-71g are constitutional on their face, the court improperly (1) struck his mistake of law defense and (2) failed to instruct the jury that the state was required to prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly struck his mistake of law defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The substance of the defendant\u2019s mistake of law defense is that he thought he personally was protected from prosecution under \u00a7 31-71c by the corporate structure of his business. The court struck the defense, reasoning that the defense was flawed because the defendant knew that it was illegal not to pay his employees. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">The defendant\u2019s brief on this issue consists of one paragraph in which he simply restates his position that \u00a7 31-71 c requires a mens rea element and that the court improperly relied on <em>State </em>v. <em>Merdinger, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 379. There is no additional analysis of his claim. The defendant\u2019s claim is \u201cnot amenable to appellate review. In order for this court judiciously and efficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>to consider claims of error raised on appeal; <em>Karanian </em>v. <em>Maulucci, </em>185 Conn. 320, 321, 440 A.2d 959 (1981); the parties must clearly and fully set forth their arguments in their briefs. We do not reverse the judgment of a trial court on the basis of challenges to its rulings that have not been adequately briefed. . . . <em>Krondes </em>v. <em>O\u2019Boy, </em>37 Conn. App. 430, 436, 656 A.2d 692 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New London Federal Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Tucciarone, </em>48 Conn. App. 89, 100, 709 A.2d 14 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court failed to instruct the jury that the state was required to prove criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt, we note that the defendant submitted to the court a request. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant did not object to the court\u2019s instruction and now seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the charge of which the defendant now complains was in almost all respects exactly what he himself requested.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The court\u2019s charge was not inconsistent with the law and was not, therefore, improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he, not the corporation, was responsible under \u00a7 31-71c. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">\u201cThe two part test for evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence in a jury trial is well established. First, the reviewing court construes the evidence presented at trial in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. . . . The reviewing court then determines whether the jury could have reasonably found, on the basis of the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn from them, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In conducting this review, the probative force of the evidence is not diminished where the evidence, in whole or in part, is circumstantial rather than direct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>56 Conn. App. 108, 111, 741 A.2d 331 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The substance of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the state charged him as an individual, not as a director or officer of the corporation. He claims that the evidence was insufficient because the state failed to pierce the corporate veil; see <em>Saphir </em>v. <em>Neusladt, </em>177 Conn. 191, 210, 413 A.2d 843 (1979); to find him liable individually. The defendant does not claim that there was no evidence presented at trial that he was the majority shareholder, director and president of the corporation. The defendant also acknowledges that he oversaw the day-to-day management of the corporation, including the signing and issuing of paychecks. The essence of his claim is that there was evidence that the six individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>who were not paid were employed by the corporation, not by him individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument overlooks the plain language of the statutes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 31-71a (1) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Employer\u2019 includes any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, corporation . . . employing any person, including the state and any political subdivision thereof . . . .\u201d Section 31-71g provides in relevant part: \u201cAny employer or any officer or agent of an employer or any other person authorized by an employer to pay wages who violates any provision of this part may be: (1) Fined ... or imprisoned . . . .\u201d The defendant does not deny that the six individuals who filed complaints were employed by the corporation or that he is an officer of the corporation who signed and distributed the corporate paychecks. Thus, pursuant to the statute, the defendant individually may be found liable for failing to pay the wages owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Furthermore, the corporate veil theory protects officers, directors and shareholders from civil, not criminal, liability. \u201c[Wjhen the corporation is the mere alter ego, or business conduit of a person, it may be disregarded. 1W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations (1990) \u00a7 41.10, [p. 614] citing, inter alia, <em>DeSantis </em>v. <em>Piccadilly Land Corp., </em>3 Conn. App. 310, 487 A.2d 1110 (1985). . . . The alter ego theory is applicable in contract actions as well as in tort actions. [1W. Fletcher, supra], \u00a7 41.85.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>De Leonardis </em>v. <em>Subway Sandwich Shops, Inc., </em>35 Conn. App. 353, 358, 646 A.2d 230, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 925, 648 A.2d 162 (1994). The state, therefore, did not have to pierce the corporate veil to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>prove that the defendant failed to pay wages. Thus, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-71c provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Whenever an employee voluntarily terminates his employment, the employer shall pay the employee\u2019s wages in full not later than the next regular pay day, as designated under section 31-71b, either through the regular payment channels or by mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">\u201c(b) Whenever an employer discharges an employee, the employer shall pay the employee\u2019s wages in full not later than the business day next succeeding the date of such discharge. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-71a et seq. concerns the general provisions regarding the payment of wages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\"> When the defendant failed to respond to requests from a labor department investigator, the investigator prepared a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest, which was presented to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> The defendant makes reference to the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.
