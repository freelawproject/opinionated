Best, appeals from the judgment of conviction of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant had been charged with the crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of capital felony for the murder of a person under sixteen years of age in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (9).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant had pleaded not guilty and elected a trial by a three judge court, which found the defendant not guilty of the charges of murder and capital felony, but did find her guilty of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s evidence and at the time of sentencing. Thereafter, the court sentenced the defendant to twenty years incarceration. This appeal followed. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court acted improperly in denying her motions for judgment of acquittal because there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction of manslaughter in the first degree. In doing so, she asserts that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she acted either \u201cunder circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life\u201d or \u201crecklessly engage[d] in conduct which create[d] a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>grave risk of death to another person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). Although she does not challenge the state\u2019s contention that the evidence established a homicide, she claims that the evidence established only her culpability of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in that she \u201crecklessly\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> caused the death of another person. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The trial court reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim, Mahkeva Best, was born on February 23, 1995, and was approximately twenty months old at the time of her death on October 31, 1996. At that time, she weighed twenty-two pounds and measured two feet, eight inches in height. On October 30, 1996, the defendant, who was Mahkeva\u2019s mother, was twenty-four years of age and resided with her boyfriend, Daryl Walker,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the victim in an apartment in Waterbury. The defendant had worked as a certified nurse\u2019s aide since 1992. She had recently lost her job as a result of the loss of her car, however, and was very frustrated over that, as she had been unable to find another job.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">From October 31 to November 2,1996, the defendant gave four separate written statements to the Waterbury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>police.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the relevant portions of the fourth statement on November 2, 1996, the defendant stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u201cI want to say that I did hit Mahkeva with my hands on Wednesday, October 30, 1996. It was really actually my fists when I hit Mahkeva and how it happened is this: It was after 3:30 in the afternoon and as I mentioned in the last statement Mahkeva was laying on the couch on her back. As I had said earlier, Mahkeva was scratching at her [diaper] rash and whining most of the day. I went over to the couch to try to get her comfortable, and that is when she kicked me with her foot in my nose. When she did this, I said, \u2018Mama, why you did that,\u2019 and that is when I bit on her leg. (I always call Mahkeva Mama or Mommy.) After I bit her, she looked at me and I sat at the other end of the couch. A minute or two later she called out, \u2018Mama,\u2019 to me and started to come towards me, and I picked her up and laid her on my chest for a few more minutes. Then I laid her back down on the couch on her back and I was going to get up to make something to eat. As I was getting off of the couch, Mahkeva started whining again. I put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the bottle next to her but she did not want the bottle. Mahkeva kept whining and I went over to her and I grabbed at my hair and I sat next to her on the couch. I stopped grabbing my hair and I clenched my hands into fists and hit Mahkeva with both my hands, saying out loud, \u2018Why is this happening to me, why is this happening to me.\u2019 I really don\u2019t know how many times I hit Mahkeva with my fists because \u2018I really lost it,\u2019 meaning that I lost my mind for that moment. I think that while all this happened [Walker] was in the shower. Right after I stopped hitting Mahkeva she began crying, I also started crying and I laid my head on Mahkeva\u2019s stomach. ... I am very sorry for what I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Later that evening, Walker called a cab because he thought that Mahkeva did not look well and thought that she needed to go to the hospital. WTiile waiting for the cab, the defendant changed Mahkeva\u2019s diaper and clothing, at which point Walker pointed out some bruising on Mahkeva\u2019s stomach area and asked the defendant what had happened. The defendant responded that she did not know what had happened, but that maybe the bruising was due to the child\u2019s diaper being too tight.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">When Mahkeva was brought to the emergency room of Waterbury Hospital at about 3:15 a.m. the next morning, October 31,1996, by the defendant and Walker, she was examined by Genevieve O\u2019Connell, an attending physician. Mahkeva\u2019s heart had a very slow agonal beat.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> O\u2019Connell observed two bruises on Mahkeva\u2019s forehead, a relatively \u201cfresh\u201d bruise on the left forehead temple area and an older one on the right forehead side \u201cabout a week old\u201d\u2014all of which were \u201cvery visible\u201d to the naked eye. There were four separate bruises in her abdominal area.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> O\u2019Connell\u2019s opinion was that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>four injuries to the abdominal area were due to blunt trauma with the force applied \u201cmultiple times.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The blunt force was of a size \u201cabout four inches in diameter\u201d and was \u201cconsistent with a fist punch.\u201d A cardiac arrest team became involved, but was unsuccessful. None of the injuries about which O\u2019Connell testified could have been caused by the medical intervention at the hospital on October 31, 1996. Mahkeva was pronounced dead at 5:15 a.m. O\u2019Connell opined that the cause of Mahkeva\u2019s death was blunt trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Later that day, Malka Shah, the associate medical examiner at the office of the chief medical examiner, performed the autopsy<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in Farmington. She specializes in forensic pathology, which deals mostly with sudden death caused by trauma, why the trauma took place, what inflicted it and the extent of the trauma. Shah noted external injuries on Mahkeva\u2019s face, abdomen, left lower arm and left upper leg. Internally, the eighth and ninth ribs were fractured. There was extensive hemorrhaging throughout her entire abdominal area. The hemorrhaging extended to the entire abdominal wall at the right and left side. The cause of the injuries on this abdominal wall, opined Shah, was due to blunt force applied to the anterior abdominal wall causing ruptures of the capillaries and vessels and hemorrhage into the posterior wall itself. At least three blows were administered, as the abdomen was injured not only in the center, but also on the right and left sides. The injuries for the abdominal area were all inflicted at the same time. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>blunt trauma also injured major organs. Blunt trauma to Mahkeva\u2019s abdomen caused a laceration in her right renal vein, hemorrhage in her pancreas, liver and lungs, extensive hemorrhages in the large intestine and ascending colon, and a macerating<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> injury to her spleen. There was also bleeding on her posterior abdominal wall that came from the force applied to the anterior abdominal wall, which then passed through the organs to the posterior abdominal wall. The bleeding in her abdominal area was extensive. The cause of her bleeding<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was the blunt trauma, which, according to Shah, \u201cled her to bleed to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The injuries to Mahkeva\u2019s forehead were older than the injuries to her abdominal area. The one on the right side of her head was older than the one on the left. Both, however, were older than the abdominal injuries. According to Shah, the blunt force trauma to the abdomen and the bite mark were \u201cof the same duration\u201d or were inflicted on Mahkeva at about the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Ira Titunik, a forensic odontologist,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> became involved as a result of being contacted by Harold Wayne Carver, the state\u2019s chief medical examiner. Upon arriving in Waterbury in the evening of October 31, 1996, he met separately with the defendant and Walker, explained to them what he proposed to do in taking dental impressions of their upper and lower teeth as well as photographing that area. Thereafter, he went to the chief state medical examiner\u2019s office in Farmington, where he examined and photographed the tissue of the bite area excised from Mahkeva\u2019s left thigh. At the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>after explaining in detail how he had proceeded, Titunik gave his opinion that the bite mark had been made by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">At the time of her fourth statement, in telling Neil O\u2019Leary, a detective lieutenant with the Waterbury police,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> about Mahkeva\u2019s abdominal injuries, she demonstrated by pounding on his desk how she had struck the victim with both fists together. She could not remember how many times she had struck her daughter, but O\u2019Leary said he counted her pounding five times on the desk. When O\u2019Leary asked her to hit the desk as hard as she had hit Mahkeva, she looked at him and said, \u201cWhat do you want me to do, break my hands?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court improperly denied her motions for judgment of acquittal because tirere was insufficient, evidence to sustain the conviction of manslaughter in the first degree. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cansler, </em>54 Conn. App. 819, 836, 738 A.2d 1095 (1999), we stated that \u201c[t]he standard of review for a sufficiency of evidence claim is well settled. Our Supreme Court has stated: In reviewing [a] sufficiency [of evidence] claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 126, 646 A.2d 169 (1994), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 76, 634 A.2d 879 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 609, 595 A.2d 306 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>218 Conn. 766, 770-71, 591 A.2d 1225 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>253, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>43 Conn. App. 801, 809, 687 A.2d 1279 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 908, 689 A.2d 472 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In <em>Ingram, </em>this court stated: \u201cWe note that the probative force of the evidence is not diminished because it consists, in whole or in part, of circumstantial evidence rather than direct evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>213 Conn. 243, 254, 567 A.2d 1173 (1989). <em>State </em>v. <em>Lago, </em>28 Conn. App. 9, 30, 611 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 919, 614 A.2d 828 (1992). It has been repeatedly stated that there is no legal distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence so far as probative force is concerned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Haddad, </em>189 Conn. 383, 390, 456 A.2d 316 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>183 Conn. 225, 227, 439 A.2d 305 (1981). It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 227 .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>[196 Conn. 685, 691, 495 A.2d 273 (1985)]. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>216 Conn. 585, 602, 583 A.2d 896 (1990); State v. <em>Cimino, </em>194 Conn. 210, 211, 478 A.2d 1005 (1984). [T]he inquiry into whether the record evidence would support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not require a court to ask itself whether it believes that the evidence . . . established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Boykin, </em>27 Conn. App. 558, 563-64, 609 A.2d 242, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 905, 610 A.2d 179 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>supra, 43 Conn. App. 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">\u201cIt bears emphasis that [i]n evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the [trier of fact] is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 195, 672 A.2d 488 (1996). As we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 693, 646 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>[229 Conn. 328, 332, 641 A.2d 123 (1994)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Little, </em>194 Conn. 665, 671-72, 485 A.2d 913 (1984); nor does proof beyond a reasonable doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the [trier of fact], would have resulted in an acquittal. . . . On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>supra, 196; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>[supra, 231 Conn. 134]. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>242 Conn. 485, 490, 698 A.2d 898 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cansler, </em>supra, 54 Conn. App. 837-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Furthermore, as an appellate court, we must determine whether the totality of the evidence, including reasonable inferences therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s verdict, supports the trial court\u2019s verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, where a three judge court is the judge of the facts as well as the law, as is the case here, the court, as the triers of fact, is not to be expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own obseivations and experiences of the affairs of life. Rather, they may apply them to the evidence or facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct in the ultimate verdict that they may render. See id., 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">As already noted, the statute on manslaughter in the first degree, insofar as pertinent to this case, General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAperson is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when . . . (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.\u201d For the defendant to have been found guilty of this offense, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following: (1) that the defendant engaged in conduct that created a grave risk of death; (2) that in doing so the defendant acted recklessly; (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life; and (4) the defendant caused the death of the victim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>193 Conn. 632, 643, 479 A.2d 218 (1984); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>5 Conn. App. 571, 576, 501 A.2d 764 (1985) , cert. denied, 198 Conn. 804, 503 A.2d 1186 (1986) . Additionally, the state had to prove that the defendant had the general intent<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to engage in conduct that created a grave risk of death to another person under circumstances evincing extreme indifference to human life.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>supra, 639; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>supra, 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>\u201cNo definition of \u2018extreme indifference to human life\u2019 is found in the [P]enal [C]ode, title 53a of the General Statutes . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>28 Conn. App. 825, 830, 612 A.2d 60, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 907, 615 A.2d 1049 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>27 Conn. App. 322, 326, 606 A.2d 30 (1992). We have pointed out in <em>Bunker, </em>drawing on <em>State </em>v. <em>Spates, </em>176 Conn. 227, 236-37, 405 A.2d 656 (1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 922, 99 S. Ct. 1248, 59 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1979), that the trial court in <em>Spates </em>\u201cwas upheld when it defined the term for the jury by stating that it meant more than \u2018mere carelessness\u2019 or \u2018ordinary recklessness\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>supra, 326. It must be recognized that an \u201caggravated form of recklessness\u201d is required to support a conviction under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). <em>State </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>supra, 830; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunker, </em>supra, 327. In any event, the lack of a specific definition of \u201cextreme indifference to human life\u201d is not of significance, \u201cespecially when the defendant has not shown that the phrase was used in anything other than its ordinary meaning. <em>State v. Spates, </em>supra, 237.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>supra, 831. Some guidance, as to the level of \u201cindifference\u201d the legislature fairly perceived is gleaned by its designating the \u201cindifference\u201d in \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) by the adjective \u201cextreme.\u201d That adjective has been defined to mean \u201cexisting in the highest or greatest possible degree.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. It is synonymous with \u201cexcessive.\u201d Id. What evinces an extreme indifference to human life is really a question of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>supra, 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">It is also true that there is no specific definition of the term \u201cgrave risk of death.\u201d The defendant has given us no analysis or argument that that term is used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>anything other than its ordinary meaning. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Maresca, </em>173 Conn. 450, 460-61, 377 A.2d 1330 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wall, </em>40 Conn. App. 643, 670, 673 A.2d 530, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 924, 677 A.2d 950 (1991). We do note, however, that Webster defines the adjective \u201cgrave\u201d as meaning \u201cvery serious; dangerous to life.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. \u201cRecklessly,\u201d as already pointed out, is defined in the Penal Code, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13), and is an important component of the context of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). The defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time she assaulted her daughter may be proven from her conduct before, during and after the attack. Such conduct yields facts and inferences that demonstrate a pattern of behavior and attitude toward the victim by the defendant that is probative of the defendant\u2019s mental state. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>181 Conn. 406, 415, 435 A.2d 986 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 77. To be guilty of violating \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), it must be established that the defendant must have had the general intent to engage in the proscribed conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 639; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Alston, </em>supra, 5 Conn. App. 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">David Best, the estranged husband of the defendant, returned Mahkeva to the defendant\u2019s home on Monday, October 28, 1996, at which time she was \u201cfine.\u201d From that time until the early morning hours of Thursday, October 31,1996, when Mahkeva was taken to the hospital, no one except the defendant and Walker had any contact with Mahkeva. Although the defendant, in her first statement to the police, opined that Walker beat Mahkeva, it was not until several days later that she admitted that it was she, not Walker, who had beaten her child. That leaves her as the sole cause<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>injuries, external and internal, to Mahkeva that resulted ultimately in the child\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">On October 30, 1996, the defendant maintained that Mahkeva was \u201cfine,\u201d although she acknowledges that on the previous day Mahkeva had fallen off the couch and hit her head on the coffee table. O\u2019Connell, the attending physician who examined Mahkeva on October 31, 1996, said that the bruise on her left forehead was suffered within two days of October 31, 1996. On the morning of October 30, 1996, the defendant \u201crealized\u201d that the child was not well because she was \u201cmoaning, groaning and cranky\u201d and she had a very bad diaper rash, which the child was scratching. There is no indication of what the defendant did to alleviate Mahkeva\u2019s diaper rash. When the defendant gave Mahkeva Tylenol and later, Nyquil, the child was \u201ctussling\u201d with her. The defendant had \u201cto be strong\u201d with her to administer the medication and to do so she held the child down \u201cso she couldn\u2019t fight [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">On October 30, 1996, the defendant was stressed and frustrated because she could not find a job and the child was getting on her nerves as she would not keep still. That afternoon the child, who was lying on the couch, lifted up her leg and kicked the defendant in the nose. Thereupon, the defendant actually bit the child on her left thigh. Such shocking retaliatory action by a mother against her totally vulnerable child is inexplicable and adduces an especially culpable mental state. Her stress or frustration cannot legitimate this biting of her own twenty month old daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">It is, however, the defendant\u2019s beating of her daughter on the afternoon of October 30,1996, shortly after biting her, together with its consequences, that starkly demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>strates her extreme indifference to human life by engaging in conduct that created a grave risk of death to the child and did, in fact, cause her death. The nature, the scope and the severity of the injuries caused by the application, with great force, of the defendant\u2019s clenched fists to the child\u2019s abdominal area devastated Mahkeva\u2019s ability to live for more than one day. The number of blows that the defendant admitted to having inflicted to the abdominal area varied. The defendant, according to O\u2019Leary, struck the desk five times when O\u2019Leary asked her to demonstrate the number and force of the blows. O\u2019Connell said there was a minimum of three blows. The defendant said four blows. The most stunning description of the amount of force with which the defendant struck her daughter came from the defendant when she finally admitted to O\u2019Leary on November 2, 1996, that she had beat her daughter. At that time, O\u2019Leary asked the defendant to hit the desk in the police interview room with that force with which she struck her daughter on October 30, 1996. She answered him by asking, \u201cWhat do you want me to do, break my hands?\u201d The force used by the defendant was so strong that it went through the anterior abdominal wall, through the area of a number of internal organs, all the way to the posterior abdominal wall.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Massive blood loss caused the child to bleed to death. Further evidence of the extreme indifference displayed by the defendant\u2019s inexplicable conduct was her failure, despite the obvious distress of the child and even her experience not only as a mother but also as a certified nurse\u2019s aide to seek any medical aid until Walker took that initiative. That, unfortunately for Mahkeva, took place many hours after the defendant beat her child. Throughout, her conduct was not \u201cordinary recklessness,\u201d but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>enhanced recklessness of the nature required to convict under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pitt, </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Beyond all that we have pointed out, there is the consciousness of guilt reflected in the defendant\u2019s misstatements and changes in her statements to the police. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>196 Conn. 36, 48, 490 A.2d 1000 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 702, 443 A.2d 915 (1982); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Durrani, </em>835 F.2d 410, 425 (2d Cir. 1983) (\u201c[fjalse exculpatory statements made to law enforcement officers are circumstantial evidence and have independent probative force\u201d). \u201cFalse exculpatory statements have independent probative value [as consciousness of guilt] regardless of whether a defendant testifies on his behalf.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Strother, </em>49 F.3d 869, 877 (2d Cir. 1995). These principles apply to the misstatements and charges the defendant made as to her role in this sad matter and as to her early attempt to implicate Walker as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">From the cumulative effect of the evidence, together with reasonable inferences, the trial court could reasonably have concluded that the defendant was guilty of manslaughter in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). The evidence of the defendant\u2019s behavior in this case was sufficient for the court to find beyond a reasonable doubt that, under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, the defendant recklessly engaged in conduct that created a grave risk of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b767-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ...

David Best was Mahkeva\u2019s father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b770-6\"> The defendant did not testify at her trial. She did, however, voluntarily give the Waterbury police four written statements from October 31 to November 2, 1996. All four statements were made at the Waterbury police department. She made the first statement on October 31, starting it at 6 am. and finishing it at 7 a.m. She made her second statement on October 31, starting it at 2:20 p.m. and finishing it at 3:55 p.m. She made her third statement on October 31, starting it at 7:50 p.m. and finishing it at 8:45 p.m. She made her fourth statement on November 2 starting at 6 p.m. and finishing it at 7:35 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The statements of the defendant varied, with the significant points as follows. In her first statement, the defendant stated: \u201cOn Tuesday the 29th, my daughter fell off the couch while she was playing and she hit her head on the coffee table.\u201d She continued and inculpated her boyfriend, Daryl Walker, stating, \u201cwhen I undressed her and removed her diaper I saw bruises below her belly button near her stomach area and [Walker] pointed out the bruises and said to me \u2018what happened, how did those marks get there.\u2019 I told him that I did not know and I pressed her stomach and thought maybe it came from her diaper being too tight . . . The only thing that I can figure out that happened is that [Walker] beat my daughter up. [Walker] is a violent person. . . .\u201d In addition, the defendant stated that her daughter was \u201cfine\u201d when her estranged husband had returned her on Monday, October 28,1996, and she had changed her \u201cseveral times since then.\u201d Moreover, since her husband had returned Mahkeva, no one, except the defendant and Walker, had been with Mahkeva.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">In her second statement, the defendant made no reference to Walker\u2019s beating the child, but stated rather, \u201cI am now giving the police this second statement of my own free will at 2:20 p.m. I would just like to add some things that I do now remember. On Wednesday, 10-30-96 at about 1:00 p.m. I did give my daughter Mahkeva some Tylenol medicine because I thought she had a slight fever. I laid Mahkeva on the couch to give her this medicine .... While attempting to give Mahkeva this medicine I held her hands across her body both together and was also holding her face. While holding Mahkeva down she would be tussling with me and I would have to put pressure on her to make her stop. I would lean on her with my body putting pressure on her stomach to stop her from moving around. While doing this Mahkeva was tussling with me moving her head about and I had to hold her down with pressure from my arm. After doing this Mahkeva threw up the Tylenol .... I waited until about 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, 10-30-96 to give her . . . Nyquil. In giving Mahkeva the Nyquil I went through the same routine as I did the first time. Mahkeva was again tussling with me and moving all around and once again I would put pressure on her stomach until she would stop and take the medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">At about 7:50 p.m. on the same evening, the defendant gave her third statement of that day, again making no reference to Walker beating the child and stating: \u201cBecause I have no job, I have no money, and I have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>unable to find another job. Because of this I have been under a lot of stress and I have been very frustrated. My daughter Mahkeva had a very bad diaper rash and she was also sick when we woke up on Wednesday morning. She was whining a lot and I was having trouble making her comfortable during the morning. . . . Mahkeva was getting on my nerves because she wouldn\u2019t keep still. . . . She was irritable all day and I went over to her to try to comfort her when she lifted her leg up and kicked me in the nose. I got upset because she kicked me and I then bit her on her left leg. I was upset with her because my nose hurt as it has been broken twice. ... I was also frustrated with Mahkeva earlier that day both times I was giving her the medicine. I had to be strong with her to get the medicine in her and when she threw up the Tylenol ... I was very frustrated. I then got a phone call at approximately 2:30 p.m. from a Certified Nurses Agency telling me that a job I had hoped for was only available part-time. This call got me very upset and it was at this time I went to give Mahkeva the Nyquil medicine to try to make her go to sleep as she was still fussing. As I was giving her the Nyquil . . . she was fighting me and kept spitting out the medicine. I had to be strong with her again holding her down and trying to get the medicine in her mouth. As I tried to explain earlier, being strong with her means holding her down so she can\u2019t fight me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">These three statements, as well as the fourth statement, were admitted into evidence as full exhibits without objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\"> An agonal heartbeat is usually the last few beatings of the heart before it stops.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\"> One centered right around the \u201cbelly button,\u201d another on the left lower ribs, a third over the right hip pelvic area and a fourth over the left pelvic area.

Officer David Sheehan arrived there about 3:50 a.m. While there, Sheehan spoke to the defendant. She asked him wha,t was going to happen to her and whether he would be contacting the department of children and families. She never asked him about Mahkeva\u2019s condition, and he stated that she \u201cseemed more concerned for her own [well-]being not for that of the child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b773-8\"> During her medical career, Shah has performed \u201cclose to four thousand autopsies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\"> A \u201cmacerating injury\u201d is like a crushing injury, where the organ becomes \u201clike a pulp.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b774-9\"> All of Mahkeva\u2019s bleeding was internal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b774-10\"> Forensic odontology encompasses bite mark recognition.
