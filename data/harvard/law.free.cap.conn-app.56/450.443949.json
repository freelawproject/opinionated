The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) precluded defense evidence contesting the whereabouts of an eyewitness, (2) barred him from offering proof regarding evidence of the location of one of the state\u2019s two eyewitnesses and (3) allowed evidence against him with respect to coconspirators. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On August 13, 1996, the victim, Aubrey Rodney, was talking with Lama Woodtke and Kirk McKenzie outside Woodtke\u2019s apartment at 60 Farren Avenue in New Haven. Shortly after 9:20 p.m., they were approached by Robert Spearman, whom Woodtke had seen before and recognized. Spearman was armed and stated to the three individuals, \u201c[You have] ten minutes to vacate the premises or we\u2019re going to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Almost immediately following this warning, four individuals approached from 69 Farren Avenue, a residence across the street that was a reputed drug house. Among this group were the defendant, to whom Woodtke referred as \u201cHead Honcho,\u201d and Kyle Baines and Tyrone Kindred. The defendant reiterated Spearman\u2019s threat and stated that the three were on his turf. At the same time, the defendant told the four men who were with him to draw their guns. Woodtke turned and ran toward her apartment. While she was running with her back to the men, Woodtke heard multiple gunshots. The victim, who was running behind Woodtke, fell on top of her. The victim rose to his feet, stumbled a few feet and fell to the ground. Woodtke looked back at the group of men and saw the defendant standing with his right arm extended as if he had just shot the victim. The other men still had their weapons at their sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">While Woodtke ran inside and called the police, the five men fled. McKenzie also fled. Within a few minutes of being shot, the victim died from internal bleeding. When the police arrived, Woodtke gave them a detailed description of the suspects and subsequently identified the defendant, Baines, Kindred and Spearman from two arrays of photographs. Woodtke also made in-court identifications of the defendant and codefendant Baines.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Joy Terry saw the shooting from a second floor window in her apartment. She heard the defendant ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Woodtke to leave and witnessed the defendant shoot the victim in the back as the victim was fleeing. She heard five or six gunshots and recognized the defendant because she had purchased drugs from him at a near by street. Terry gave a statement to police on the day following the shooting. She also picked the defendant and some of his accomplices out of a photographic array.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The police did not recover the weapons from the crime scene, but they did recover four nine millimeter cartridge casings and one nine millimeter bullet at the scene of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court wrongfully excluded defense evidence concerning the whereabouts of Terry. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">After the state rested, the defendant sought to recall Woodtke to question her as to whether she had seen Terry outside, at a location from which she could not have seen the shooting, immediately prior to the shooting. The court allowed Woodtke to be recalled outside the presence of the jury, finding that evidence of Terry\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the shooting was relevant. Woodtke testified that she had not seen \u201cJoy Terry,\u201d a black woman, around the time of the shooting but had seen a white woman named \u201cTerry.\u201d The defense then requested permission to call defense investigator T.W. O\u2019Donnell to testify about Woodtke\u2019s statements to him concerning Terry. O\u2019Donnell had taken statements from Woodtke in the course of his investigation. The trial court refused to allow O\u2019Donnell to testify, finding that his testimony about Woodtke\u2019s references to Terry would be confusing to the jury and was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">The court acted within its discretion in denying the admission of the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>admission of evidence is highly discretionary, and the court\u2019s decision is entitled to great deference. <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 229, 733 A.2d 156 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>51 Conn. App. 824, 826, 725 A.2d 367, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 916, 734 A.2d 568 (1999). \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has a tendency to establish the existence of a material fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 376, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988). Furthermore, the proffered evidence about Woodtke\u2019s testimony was not sufficient to contradict the testimony of Terry that she saw the shooting from inside her apartment. This evidence was offered to impeach Terry and was found by the court to lack relevance. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>49 Conn. App. 252, 258-59, 714 A.2d 1243, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 914, 722 A.2d 809 (1998) (witness may be impeached by introduction of contradictory evidence from other witnesses if evidence is contradictory and does not relate to collateral matter). Since the court found that the defendant did not meet his burden of demonstrating that the evidence was relevant, it properly excluded the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The defendant next claims that by excluding the proffered evidence, the court prevented him from exercising his constitutional right to present a defense. We are not persuaded by this argument. The defendant seeks <em>Golding </em>review as to this issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim fails the second prong of review pursuant to <em>Golding. </em>The claim is not reviewable under <em>Golding </em>because it is not of constitutional magnitude. The defendant was not prohibited from offering a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>defense. Rather, the defendant\u2019s evidence was not allowed pursuant to the court\u2019s discretion and the rules of evidence and procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The constitution does not require that a defendant be permitted to present every piece of evidence he wants. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shabazz, </em>246 Conn. 746, 752-53 n.4, 719 A.2d 440 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1179, 119 S. Ct. 1116, 143 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1999). The court retains the power to rule on the admissibility of the proffered evidence pursuant to evidentiary standards; hence, the question is evidentiary and not constitutional. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">It is well settled that a party \u201cmust comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 376. The court allowed the defendant to recall Woodtke outside the presence of the jury to determine whether her testimony would contain any information that could impeach Terry\u2019s eyewitness testimony. The court\u2019s ruling as to admissibility of evidence is not one of constitutional magnitude. \u201cRelevancy is an evidentiary question and \u2018[e]very evidentiary ruling which denies a defendant a line of inquiry to which he thinks he is entitled is not constitutional error.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>48 Conn. App. 717, 726 n.12, 711 A.2d 769, cert. denied, 245 Conn. 922, 717 A.2d 238 (1998). The defendant claims that this evidence was central to his case, yet his trial counsel admitted that she forgot to raise this issue when Woodtke originally testified. Additionally, the defendant was permitted to present other evidence relating to the reliability of Terry\u2019s identifications. The defendant\u2019s claim is not of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right and we, therefore, decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The defendant claims next that the trial court wrongfully precluded him from presenting an offer of proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>regarding evidence of the location of Terry, one of the state\u2019s eyewitnesses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The state was given a copy of the report of the interview with Woodtke by the investigator, O\u2019Donnell. After reviewing the report, the state argued that it was identical to Woodtke\u2019s testimony. A portion of the report was marked for identification, and the court stated that the exhibit was \u201ca report, or a portion of the report that the defense inspector would testify to.\u201d Although the defendant wanted the investigator to testify as to whether Woodtke had said \u201cJoy Terry\u201d even though the report stated that she had said \u201cTerry,\u201d the court did not allow that inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">A proper offer of proof serves three purposes. First, it informs the court of the legal theory under which the evidence is admissible. Second, it should inform the trial judge of the specific nature of the evidence so that the court can judge its admissibility. Third, it creates a record for appellate review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zoravali, </em>34 Conn. App. 428, 433, 641 A.2d 796, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 906, 644 A.2d 921 (1994). The decision not to allow the investigator to testify was proper because the three purposes behind the defendant\u2019s offer of proof had been met. First, the defendant was permitted to argue that Woodtke\u2019s testimony concerning the presence of another \u201cTerry\u201d during the shooting was admissible on the issue of Terry\u2019s location at that time. Second, Woodtke\u2019s testimony, along with O\u2019Donnell\u2019s report, sufficiently informed the court of the specific nature of the proffered evidence so that it could rule on its admissibility. Third, an adequate record had been created because the specific nature and the relevance of the evidence was readily discernible. The court properly refused to allow O\u2019Donnell to testify as part of the defendant\u2019s offer of proof because the purposes behind making the offer of proof already had been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Even if we held that the investigator\u2019s testimony was improperly excluded, its exclusion was harmless because the testimony would have been cumulative. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wearing, </em>46 Conn. App. 741, 756, 701 A.2d 41, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 937, 702 A.2d 645 (1997) (factor to be considered in determining whether improper ruling on evidence harmless is whether testimony was cumulative). Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the court\u2019s ruling that the defendant could not present an offer of proof regarding evidence was harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly allowed evidence against the defendant with respect to coconspirators. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The state elicited testimony from several New Haven police officers concerning their contact with codefendant Baines and with Kindred and Spearman, whose trials had been severed from that of the defendant and Baines. The purpose of this evidence was to link the defendant with the various members of the group involved in the shooting and to support the eyewitnesses\u2019 statements that the defendant and his coconspirators \u201chung out\u201d at 69 Farren Avenue. At trial, the state presented the proposed testimony of each officer outside the presence of the jury. The defendant\u2019s objection to this evidence was overruled by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The defendant was charged with the crime of conspiracy to commit murder in addition to the other offenses. Therefore, it was incumbent upon the state to establish a connection between the defendant and his alleged coconspirators. This court has permitted the introduction of evidence of acts of prior misconduct to establish a relationship between a defendant and his alleged coconspirators where one of the charges against the defendant was a conspiracy charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>44 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Conn. App. 338, 345-46, 689 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 929, 693 A.2d 301 (1997) (evidence of drug dealing permitted to show relationship among alleged coconspirators where defendant charged with conspiracy to commit murder); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>43 Conn. App. 830, 832-37, 687 A.2d 544 (1996) (evidence of existence of drug operation permitted to show relationship among various individuals where charge is conspiracy to commit murder). The evidence in this case was relevant because it showed various instances of contact between the alleged coconspirators and supported the identification testimony of the eyewitnesses. It is not enough for the defendant to claim that the events in testimony did not all directly involve him. A trial court is not required to find, as a prerequisite to admissibility, that evidence is conclusively linked to other evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 283, 533 A.2d 553 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court did not weigh the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect. We find this claim to be without merit. The trial court heard the proposed evidence outside the presence of the jury and restricted the testimony to limit any unnecessary prejudice. A specific reference to prejudice is not necessary where the conduct of the court demonstrates that it considered this factor. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>49 Conn. App. 13, 22 n.8, 713 A.2d 859 (1998). The trial court clearly acted to eliminate any unnecessary prejudice in its consideration of the coconspirator evidence. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court properly admitted the coconspirator evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\"> Under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error only if all of the following requirements are satisfied: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
