Fuller, was charged in a substitute information in five counts. The first and second counts charged the defendant with attempted murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 53a-54a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The alleged victims in the first and second counts were Robert C. Leuba and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Hope Leuba, respectively. The third and fourth counts charged the defendant with attempted assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-59 (a) (5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The alleged victims in the third and fourth counts were Robert C. Leuba and Hope Leuba, respectively. The fifth count charged the defendant with carrying a pistol or revolver on her person without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a trial to a jury, the defendant was found not guilty on the first and second counts but guilty on the third, fourth and fifth counts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) refused to instruct the jury on certain requested lesser included offenses, (2) refused to grant her motion for judgment of acquittal on the fifth count, (3) admitted chemical evidence of gunshot residue collected from the steering wheel of her car, (4) admitted opinion evidence on the question of whether she committed the alleged crimes and (5) admitted nonexpert opinion about her psychiatric condition. In addition, the defendant claims that the trial judge, <em>Parker, J., </em>was improperly influenced by his professional relationship with Robert C. Leuba.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Robert C. Leuba and his wife, Hope Leuba, resided in the Mystic section of Groton since 1960. The defendant\u2019s parents lived in that same general neighborhood since 1960. The Leubas had known the defendant since she was young.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">On June 29,1995, the Leubas were awakened at about 4 a.m. by some \u201cthuds\u201d caused by something hitting their house while they were asleep in the second floor bedroom, which is located toward the front of the house. Robert C. Leuba went to the telephone and called 911. Hope Leuba looked out of one of the two bedroom windows and saw \u201cflashes\u201d and heard \u201cpopping sounds\u201d coming from the driveway. She saw a \u201cshape\u201d of someone walking down the driveway toward the street. Four spent .32 caliber Smith and Wesson<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> shell casings later were found by the police near the end of the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Members of the Groton police department arrived within five to ten minutes. The police and Robert C. Leuba found what appeared to be two bullet holes in the front of the Leubas\u2019 freshly painted house. One hole was in a clapboard of the front wall over the front porch area adjoining the living room. The other hole was in the exterior front wall of the second floor bedroom and, as Robert C. Leuba described it, \u201cActually, I think the pillow [that he was sleeping on] is right on the other side of that wall from that hole.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The two bullets were removed from the holes. A third bullet hole was found on the sill of the window out of which Hope Leuba had looked when she saw the flashes and heard the gunfire. This bullet completely penetrated the clapboard at an angle, and also penetrated the copper flashing and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>embedded in what was believed to be a wood surface. Certain marks or \u201cdefects\u201d were caused to the recently reshingled roof of the front porch by the bullets as they ricocheted off the roof. Police and forensic personnel, using the two bullet holes near the second floor windows and the \u201cdefects,\u201d established trajectories of the bullets, which were consistent with the area from which Hope Leuba saw \u201cflashes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">On the morning of June 28, 1995, the defendant attended a pretrial conference on an unrelated criminal matter at the geographical area number ten courthouse in New London. Early that evening, she went to her father\u2019s house, accompanied by Robert Rocco and Bennie Leonardi. Thereafter, Leonardi drove the defendant and Rocco to the defendant\u2019s and Rocco\u2019s West Street apartment in New London, which they shared.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">After supper, the defendant went out, having told Rocco that she was going to her father\u2019s house to check the mail. She did not go to her father\u2019s house, but returned to the apartment between 9 and 9:30 p.m. and went to bed. At approximately 3:30 a.m. the next morning, the defendant told Rocco that she was going out for coffee. Rocco went back to sleep and woke up at about 6 a.m., at which time he checked her room and found her sleeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">On the afternoon of June 29,1995, after having interviewed Rocco, Lieutenant Joseph Illinger and Detective Walter Conley of the Groton police located the defendant sitting in her parked car in the parking lot of the New London public library on Huntington Street. Before Conley could say anything to her, she said: \u201cYou\u2019re here because of the Leubas, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Conley said, \u201cYes.\u201d When Conley and Illinger confronted her in the parking lot, information concerning the shooting had not been \u201cout to the media at all.\u201d Conley testified that \u201cshe immediately went into a tirade of comments about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Leubas, negative comments, that the Leubas had been persecuting her for twenty years, that Mr. Leuba had hired two men in Providence to break her.\u201d Conley further testified that she \u201cappeared very tense, shaking . . . very angry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">After the police officers removed two empty gun holsters from the defendant\u2019s car, Conley placed her under arrest. A towing company towed her car to the police department lot, where the steering wheel was swabbed for possible gunshot residue with swabs from an atomic absorption kit. Later, at about 8 p.m. on June 29, 1995, a warrant was executed on the West Street apartment occupied by Rocco and the defendant. While neither a firearm nor ammunition were found in the apartment, a gun cleaning kit was found in a container on the floor underneath the kitchen table.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The defendant claims first that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury on her two requested lesser included offense charges of reckless endangerment in the second degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-64 and attempted assault in the third degree pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-61 (a) (3), which she claims are lesser included offenses of attempted assault in the first degree. Furthermore, she argues that these lesser offenses would have afforded the jury a continuum of subjective culpability within which to view the alleged criminal act and the shooter\u2019s intent in relation thereto. Specifically, she claims that the requested lesser included offenses met the second prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), which requires that it not be possible to commit the greater offense, as described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser offense. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>We note that the state charged the defendant with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of attempted assault in the first degree, with one count of each charge referring to Robert C. Leuba and the other count of each charge referring to Hope Leuba. As pertains to the attempted murder counts, the long form information alleges that the defendant, \u201cwith the intent to cause the death\u201d of the Leubas, did attempt to cause death \u201cby means of the discharge of a firearm.\u201d With reference to the assault counts, the information alleged that the defendant, \u201cwith the intent to cause physical injury to\u201d the Leubas, \u201cdid attempt to cause such injury\u201d to them \u201cby means of the discharge of a firearm.\u201d She was found not guilty on the attempted murder counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We first take up the defendant\u2019s claim that attempted assault in the third degree is a lesser included offense of attempted assault in the first degree. We do not agree and no discussion of <em>Whistnant </em>is necessary to dispose of this part of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We agree with the state\u2019s analysis. Our criminal attempt statute, \u00a7 53a-49 (a), requires that a defendant act \u201cwith the kind of mental state required for commission of the [particular] crime . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) provides in relevant part that a person is guilty of assault in the third degree when, \u201cwith criminal negligence, he causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon . . . [or] a dangerous instrument . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person acts with \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. . . .\u201d Applying these statutes, it can be seen that attempted assault in the third degree is not a cognizable offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>because a person cannot, in an attempt to commit assault in the third degree, intend that an unintended injury occur. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 528-29, 522 A.2d 277 (1987), our Supreme Court reasoned that \u201cto be guilty of attempt, a defendant\u2019s conscious objective must be to cause the result which would constitute the substantive crime. A person cannot attempt to commit a crime which requires that an unintended result occur . . . because it is logically impossible for one to intend to bring about an unintended result.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>189 Conn. 303, 309, 455 A.2d 1326 (1983), on appeal after remand, 196 Conn. 507, 493 A.2d 890 (1985) (logically impossible to commit crime of attempted involuntary manslaughter because actor would have to intend that unintended death result). Attempted assault in the third degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) is not a cognizable offense and is, therefore, not a lesser included offense of attempted assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The defendant also requested that the trial court instruct the jury that reckless endangerment in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-64 (a) was a lesser included crime of assault in the first degree. That statute provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the second degree when he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of physical injury to another person.\u201d The trial court denied this request. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Our Supreme Court has \u201carticulated a four-pronged test for determining whether a defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>248 Conn. 472, 476, 728 A.2d 1087 (1999). \u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if ... (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>(2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Manley, 195 Conn. 567, 574, 489 A.2d 1024 (1985); <em>State </em>v. Whistnant, supra, 179 Conn. 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">\u201cIn considering whether the defendant has satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser included offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 260-61, 681 A.2d 922 (1996). \u201c[T]he jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 68, 621 A.2d 728 (1993). \u201cOn appeal, an appellate court must reverse a trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction if we cannot as a matter of law exclude [the] possibility that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>235 Conn. 67, 74, 663 A.2d 972 (1995). \u201cOtherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 575; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Conn. 63, 78, 441 A.2d 84 (1981). \u201cThese principles do not mean, however, that the evidence must be unrealistically parsed in contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>vention of how it was presented to and reasonably could have been perceived by the jury. \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 476-77. \u201cAlthough there is no constitutional right to have a jury consider possible lesser included offenses, Connecticut law entitles a defendant to a lesser included offense charge if his request satisfies the four requirements set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant </em>[supra, 588].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>226 Conn. 237, 250, 627 A.2d 877 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>35 Conn. App. 138, 151, 644 A.2d 386, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 913, 648 A.2d 157 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim is not persuasive because it does not satisfy the second prong of <em>Whistnant.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That prong requires that it not be possible to commit the greater offense without first having committed the lesser offense. In considering whether that prong is satisfied, \u201c \u2018[t]he court may look only to the information and bill of particulars* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\u2014as opposed to the evidence presented at trial\u2014to determine what constitutes a lesser included offense . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Troynack, </em>174 Conn. 89, 96-97, 384 A.2d 326 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rozmyslowicz, 52 </em>Conn. App. 149, 156, 726 A.2d 142 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The defendant argues that a narrow reading of the test handed down in <em>Whistnant, </em>the seminal decision on this issue, might support the view that the court\u2019s refusal to charge on her requested lesser included offenses was proper because it may be possible to attempt to commit murder or assault in the first degree without also being reckless; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>8 Conn. App. 496, 504, 513 A.2d 738, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 808, 515 A.2d 380 (1986); or because a criminal act may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>be both intended and unintended. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barletta, </em>238 Conn. 313, 333-36, 680 A.2d 1284 (1996). Such a construction, she claims, would be at odds not only with a common sense view of the evidence contained in this record but with a line of authorities stemming from <em>State </em>v. <em>Monte, </em>131 Conn. 134, 38 A.2d 434 (1944). She also argues that \u201c[f|ortunately, there is a line of authorities, spawned by <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382 [429 A.2d 919 (1980)], which supports a construction of <em>Whistnant </em>[that] permits a finding of such entitlement [to an instruction on her requested lesser included offense].\u201d She argues in her brief that <em>\u201cRodriguez </em>stands for the proposition that \u2018an offense that would be a lesser included offense . . . .\u2019<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 407; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 63.\u201d In addition, the defendant also claims that the \u201csubstantial attempt\u201d argument made by her trial counsel rendered <em>Palmer </em>and <em>Barletta </em>inapplicable. Finally, she claims that the \u201cpersuasive\u201d nature of her trial counsel's position makes applicable the so-called \u201cfairness\u201d doctrine \u201cenunciated\u201d in <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>236 Conn. 31, 55, 671 A.2d 323 (1996), where that case refers to <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>35 Cal. 3d 510, 674 P.2d 1303, 199 Cal. Rptr. 45 (1984).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by any of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">To satisfy the second condition of <em>Whistnant, </em>the defendant must show that \u201cit is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588. \u201cIn other words, to require an instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>on a lesser included offense, the lesser offense must not require any element which is not needed to commit the greater offense in the manner alleged in the information or the bill of particulars.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 52, 62, 301 A.2d 547 (1972). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra, 8 Conn. App. 503-504, this court stated that reckless endangerment in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-63<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is not a lesser included crime of attempted murder because it is possible to commit the crime of attempted murder without first committing the crime of reckless endangerment in the first degree. Thus, in <em>Palmer, </em>the latter crime \u201cwas not a necessary step in the progression to the crime of attempted murder as charged in the information.\u201d Id., 504. Accordingly, it did not satisfy the second prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>Later, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Barletta, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 335, our Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe Appellate Court correctly stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>[supra, 504], [that] it is possible to commit the crime of attempted murder without also committing the offense of reckless endangerment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">In this case, the defendant requested an instruction on reckless endangerment in the second degree.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We believe that the reasoning of <em>Palmer </em>and <em>Barletta </em>controls, even though in this case we are concerned with reckless endangerment in the second degree rather than reckless endangerment in the first degree, which was at issue in <em>Palmer </em>and <em>Barletta. </em>We agree with the state\u2019s argument that just as it is possible to commit attempted murder without creating a risk of <em>serious </em>physical injury to another person,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it is possible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>commit attempted murder without creating a risk of <em>any </em>physical injury to another person.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The defendant maintains that <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Smith </em>render <em>Palmer </em>and <em>Barletta </em>inapplicable. She argues that <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Smith </em>support her claim that she is entitled to an instruction on reckless endangerment in the second degree under the second prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>She refers to that part of <em>Rodriguez </em>that states that \u201c[f]or purposes of the second condition of <em>Whistnant, </em>[the Supreme Court] conclude [s] . . . that an offense that would be a lesser included offense but for its requirement of a less culpable state of mind than that required for the greater, will be deemed a lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 407; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 77. <em>Smith </em>also iterates that <em>Rodriguez </em>\u201cestablished that in prosecutions for homicides despite the differences between acting intentionally, acting recklessly, and acting with criminal negligence, [the Supreme Court] will deem the more culpable of those mental states to include the less culpable <em>when both apply to actions with respect to an identical result or circumstance.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 75-76. We agree with the state that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Smith </em>is misplaced because although those cases hold what the defendant claims they hold, the crimes charged in those cases differ from reckless endangerment in the second degree not only as to mental state, but also in terms of a result or circumstance attending the reckless conduct.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although the attempted murder and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>attempted assault counts in the substitute information required the circumstance that the defendant discharge a firearm, reckless endangerment has a required result that those offenses do not\u2014the creation of a risk of injury to another person. This amounts to a difference in the elements required and, thus, <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Smith </em>do not support her claim that she was entitled to a charge on reckless endangerment in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In this case, reckless endangerment in the second degree is not a necessary step in the progression to the crime of assault in the first degree as charged in the substitute information. As recently as 1996, our Supreme Court stated: \u201cNotwithstanding our limited liberalization of <em>Whistnanl </em>in <em>Rodriguez </em>and <em>Smith, </em>we have never abandoned the general rule that one crime is not a lesser included offense of another if the greater can be committed <em>without a simultaneous commission of the lesser. </em>See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 494, 508 A.2d 22 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>MacFarlane, </em>188 Conn. 542, 548, 450 A.2d 374 (1982).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Barletta, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 335; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 53-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">During the trial, the defendant\u2019s counsel filed a memorandum of law in which he argued that <em>Palmer </em>and <em>Barletta </em>\u201crely on the rather narrow and artificial idea that it is hypothetically possible to attempt murder without actually creating a risk to the victim, based on the doctrine of factual impossibility. Since the present case is alleged as a \u2018substantial step\u2019 attempt rather than a \u2018factual impossibility\u2019 attempt, the second condition in <em>Whistnanl </em>cannot be reconciled with [the] application of <em>Barletta </em>and <em>Palmer </em>to the facts of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In that memorandum, the defendant\u2019s counsel neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>cited any authority nor provided any analysis for this distinction, nor did the pro se defendant in her appellate brief. Neither trial counsel nor the defendant on appeal point to anything in <em>Palmer </em>or <em>Barletta </em>that serves as a basis for the distinction apparently sought to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Although this \u201csubstantial step-factual impossibility\u201d theory is presented as an abstract theory, it seems to us that the defendant concedes that when attempt liability is predicated on factual impossibility, reckless endangerment in the second degree is not a lesser included offense. This is so because the defendant\u2019s conduct does not create a risk to another person. When attempt liability is predicated on the taking of a substantial step, however, a risk is <em>necessarily </em>taken, and then it becomes a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">A person may take a substantial step toward the attempt to murder or injure someone without actually creating a risk of injury to that person even where, as the state argues, there is no factual impossibility. The underlying premise of the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial step\u201d argument is flawed because the taking of a substantial step by means of discharging a firearm did not necessarily create a risk of injury to the Leubas. The jury, as the state correctly argues, could have concluded that there was actually no risk of injury to the Leubas because of the nature of the construction of the Leubas\u2019 house, and the nature of the firearm and its ammunition. The jury could find that there was no risk that the bullets could have penetrated the interior of the house to cause injury to either of the Leubas. Under this scenario, there would be a substantial step, but the creation of the risk required would not be present. It seems to us that the statutes defining reckless endangerment try to prevent the risk created by the actor\u2019s conduct, not a particular outcome. It is the risk of injury that sustains the prosecution. In this case, it is the discharge of a firearm that must be assessed in determining if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>defendant thereby created a risk of physical injury to another person. The defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial step\u201d argument does not avail her.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Whether her claimed conduct was a substantial step does not change the analysis, which discloses that reckless endangerment in the second degree includes an element that is not included in assault in the first degree, and, therefore, cannot be a lesser included offense. Moreover, to conclude that reckless endangerment in the second degree is a lesser included offense, which, of course, is not possible under the second condition of <em>Whislnant, </em>would have thrust upon the state the additional burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s conduct created a risk of injury, an element not included in the greater offense of attempted assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Finally, we look at the defendant\u2019s claim under the so-called \u201cfairness doctrine\u201d referred to in <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 55, which in turn refers to <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>supra, 35 Cal. 3d 510. <em>Geiger </em>held that \u201cfairness\u201d to a defendant, absent \u201csubstantial countervailing considerations\u201d for using the conventional rule; id., 526; \u201crequires . . . instructions on <em>related </em>but not necessarily included offenses.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 530. Therefore, the defendant claims under <em>Geiger </em>that she was entitled to an instruction on reckless endangerment in the second degree as a lesser included offense. We do not agree for two separate and distinct reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">First, the <em>Geiger </em>fairness doctrine requires an instruction \u201con related but not necessarily included offenses . . . when ... [1] the lesser offense is closely related to the offense charged; [2] [the] defendant\u2019s theory of defense is consistent with a conviction for a related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>offense; and [3] evidence of the lesser offense exists . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 55. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s plea of not guilty put in issue every essential element of the [crimes] charged, thus requiring the state to prove every such element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 763, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>175 Conn. 155, 162, 397 A.2d 89 (1978). This included the issue of her identity as the shooter, which was crucial, if not the core of her defense posture at trial. On appeal, she chose to include in the appendix to her brief, over her name and under the date of \u201c2-4-98,\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a document entitled \u201cStatement of Facts.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is apparent from this \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d that her theory of defense is inconsistent with a conviction for the related offense under the second prong of the <em>Geiger </em>analysis in that now, on appeal, she admits that she was at the scene at the time of the shooting although some unidentified male with her was the shooter. She, thus, does not even qualify to invoke <em>Geiger, </em>as she does not satisfy its second condition. We want to make clear that our reference to this \u201c2-4-98 Statement of Facts\u201d is only for the purpose of discussing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>her claim under <em>Geiger </em>and does not trespass on any right she had by virtue of exercising her constitutional right not to testify at her trial. Even if the law in Connecticut permitted us to decide her claim under a <em>Geiger </em>analysis, it would be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Second, and more significantly, the defendant\u2019s <em>Geiger </em>claim requires a \u201cliberalization\u201d of the second condition of <em>Whistnant. </em>This we cannot do. It is not within our function as an intermediate appellate court to overrule Supreme Court authority. <em>D\u2019Arcy </em>v. <em>Shugrue, </em>5 Conn. App. 12, 29, 496 A.2d 967, cert. dismissed, 197 Conn. 812, 499 A.2d 56, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 817, 500 A.2d 1336 (1985). Recently, our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[hjaving previously addressed and rejected claims substantially similar to that raised [here] by the defendant; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 493-95; <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 426-29, 493 A.2d 223 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>MacFarlane, </em>[supra, 188 Conn. 548]; we are not inclined to reconsider <em>Whistnant.'\u2019'\u2019 State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The defendant claims next that the trial court improperly refused to grant her motion for judgment of acquittal on the fifth count, which charged her with carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35 (a). She claims that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the essential element that the barrel of the firearm involved was less than twelve inches in length. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">\u201cIn reviewing a claim of insufficiency of the evidence, this court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict and will affirm that verdict if it is reasonably supported by the evidence and the logical inferences drawn therefrom. . . . The issue is whether the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruscoe, </em>212 Conn. 223, 245, 563 A.2d 267 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1084, 110 S. Ct. 1144, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1990). \u201cWhile the jury must find every element proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find the defendant guilty of the charged offense, each of the basic and inferred facts underlying those conclusions need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 507, 590 A.2d 901 (1991). If it is reasonable and logical for the jury to conclude that a basic fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is permitted to consider the fact proven and may consider it in combination with other proven facts in determining whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence proves the defendant guilty of all the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>219 Conn. 596, 604-605, 594 A.2d 459 (1991). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>220 Conn. 765, 770-71, 601 A.2d 521 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 678, 613 A.2d 788 (1992). \u201cIn this process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Avis, </em>209 Conn. 290, 309, 551 A.2d 26 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1097, 109 S. Ct. 1570, 103 L. Ed. 2d 937 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 277, 623 A.2d 42 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>36 Conn. App. 805, 820, 654 A.2d 371, cert. denied, 232 Conn. 921, 656 A.2d 669 (1995). In addition, the jury may use its common sense in assessing the circumstantial evidence to resolve the issue of the gun barrel length. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 252, 645 A.2d 999 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crump, </em>43 Conn. App. 252, 259-61, 683 A.2d 402, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 941, 684 A.2d 712 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>36 Conn. App. 805, 821, 654 A.2d 371 (1985). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 251-52, our Supreme Court overruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>173 Conn. 254, 377 A.2d 268 (1977), to the extent that it required the state to introduce \u201cdirect numerical evidence\u201d of the length of a barrel of a handgun to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">It is true that the gun involved was not offered into evidence. This court, however, has upheld a conviction where the requisite gun barrel length was based solely on circumstantial evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>supra, 36 Conn. App. 821 (testimony that gun barrel was not as long as twelve inch piece of paper shown to witness). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 197-98, this court reversed a conviction of carrying a pistol without a permit because of insufficient evidence in that there was a lack of evidence concerning the gun and the length of its barrel. In doing so, the court said that \u201c[w]hile circumstantial evidence concerning the length of the gun barrel may sustain a conviction under the statute, we are persuaded that some measure of descriptive evidence from which the jury may properly infer the barrel length is necessary in order for the state to satisfy its burden of proof.\u201d Id., 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">We conclude that the evidence on this issue, viewed most favorably to the state, demonstrates that the gun used by the defendant on June 29, 1995, had a barrel that was less than twelve inches in length. The state offered evidence to prove that on May 27, 1983, the defendant purchased a .32 caliber Smith and Wesson Model 31 at a gun shop in Old Lyme. The gun had a three inch barrel. Through the owner of that gun shop, the state offered not only the foregoing evidence, but also the serial number of the specific revolver purchased, which had never been reported as lost or stolen by the defendant since the purchase date. No pistol permit, however, had ever been issued to the defendant by the state of Connecticut, the city of New London or the town of Groton. There was no evidence that the defendant ever owned or had access to any other fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>arm. The bullets removed from the Leuba house, the rifling characteristics or markings found on these bullets and the shell casings found at the crime scene were all consistent with the particular make and model of the firearm that the defendant had purchased in 1983. These rifling characteristics were consistent with revolvers made by at least six different manufacturers of firearms.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> One of those firearms was a Model 31.32 caliber revolver. The holster taken from the defendant\u2019s car on June 29, 1995, had impressions and markings, including barrel markings, cylinder markings and trigger guard markings that were consistent with the model of the Smith and Wesson revolver purchased by the defendant in 1983. The brushes from the gun cleaning kit seized from the kitchen of the apartment she shared with Rocco<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201ccould be\u201d used for cleaning the type of firearm she owned. Reasonably viewed, the evidence was sufficient to establish that the firearm used by the defendant had a gun barrel less than twelve inches in lepgth. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the fifth count.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Next, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted the results of the chemical testing of residue collected from the steering wheel of her car. She argues that John Collins, the tow truck operator who transported her car from the New London library parking lot to the Groton police department lot, touched and thereby contaminated the residue on the steering wheel prior to its being swabbed by the police. In addition, she maintains that the opinion of the state\u2019s expert witness as to the substance on the steering wheel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cinconclusive and not given pursuant to our law.\u201d We are not persuaded by these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Our discussion and analysis of this issue requires the recital of additional facts. On the afternoon of June 29, 1995, shortly after finding the defendant in her car in the library parking lot, the police summoned a tow truck operator to that location for the purpose of transporting it to the police department lot. Collins responded and came to the scene. He was told not to touch anything in the car and testified that he was careful not to touch the steering wheel. Collins could not recall whether the car had an automatic or standard transmission, although he did recall that the \u201cshifter was in the middle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">On the night of June 29,1995, Groton police Detective Donald LaBonte was assigned to do a gunshot residue test on the steering wheel of the defendant\u2019s car. The state produced expert testimony to the effect that a person holding and shooting a firearm tends to get gunpowder residue on her hand. The residue resembles \u201cchalk dust\u201d and is a gas cloud formed as the result of discharging the firearm. If a person has this residue on her hand, it can be transferred \u201cto other objects,\u201d to \u201cother areas that you are touching.\u201d Such residue contains the chemical elements of lead, barium and antimony. LaBonte swabbed the steering wheel with swabs from an atomic absorption kit and sent the swabs in a sealed container to the state police forensic laboratory for testing. Although the elements of lead, barium and antimony are found in the environment, it is \u201csomewhat unique\u201d when all three are found together. According to the state\u2019s criminalist expert, Robert O\u2019Brien, finding all three elements together results in a firmer opinion that the substance contains gunshot residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">With reference to the claim that Collins, the tow truck operator, contaminated the steering wheel, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Supreme Court has stated that \u201c \u2018[t]here is no hard and fast rule that the prosecution must exclude or disprove all possibility that the article . . . has been tampered with . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>162 Conn. 215, 232, 292 A.2d 903 (1972).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>220 Conn. 698, 706, 601 A.2d 993 (1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1224, 112 S. Ct. 3041, 120 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1992). \u201cIn each case the trial court must satisfy itself that the evidence offered probably has not been changed in important respects.\u201d Id. Collins testified that he was careful to obey the orders not to touch the steering wheel. Even though he could not recall exactly what he did, he testified as to what he customarily did, which did not include touching the steering wheel. Such evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s ruling that the steering wheel had probably not been contaminated. Because there was no evidence that the steering wheel probably had been contaminated, if at all, certainly not in any significant manner, there was no abuse of discretion in this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly allowed O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion that the substance swabbed from the steering wheel was gunshot residue. She argues that O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion was \u201cinconclusive and not given pursuant to our law.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The evidence on this issue was not \u201cinconclusive,\u201d as the defendant claims. Simply put, \u201cinconclusive\u201d evidence is evidence \u201cleading to no conclusion or definite result . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986). The jury reasonably could have found, on the basis of the state\u2019s evidence, that the substance from the steering wheel was gunshot residue. The defendant seems to argue that O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion was not admissible because he testified that he could not say, with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that it was gunshot residue. He did testify that the presence of lead, barium and antimony, as he found it in testing that substance, was \u201cconsistent\u201d with its being gunshot residue. Because this trial took place before our Supreme Court handed down its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998), we are governed by the <em>pre-Porter </em>law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Although our Supreme Court has never expressly adopted the <em>Frye </em>standard that includes reference to the reliability of the scientific test or procedure involved, it has in effect affirmed that relationship. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan, </em>205 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>485, 490, 534 A.2d 877 (1987), our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he fact that a technique or method has gained general acceptance in the scientific community to which it belongs tends to ensure that the jury will not accord undue weight to the theories whose validity have not been adequately tested.\u201d A majority of American jurisdictions has held the results of such tests to be admissible evidence in criminal proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Keith </em>v. State, 612 P.2d 977 (Alaska 1980); <em>Mills </em>v. <em>State, </em>476 So. 2d 172 (Fla. 1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>100 Idaho 21, 592 P.2d 836 (1979); <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>170 Ill.

Super. 35, 383 A.2d 440, cert. denied, 79 N.J. 467, 401 A.2d 224 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowder, </em>285 N.C. 42, 203 S.E.2d 38 (1974), vacated in part on other grounds, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S.

App. 1985); <em>Cordova </em>v. <em>State, </em>754 S.W.2d 502 (Tex. App. 1988). The weight of authority enhances the reliability of this testimony; it is generally accepted: General acceptance does not require scientific unanimity. <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>People, </em>892 P.2d 281, 289 (Colo. 1995); <em>People </em>v. <em>Dalcollo, </em>282 Ill. App. 3d 944, 957, 669 N.E.2d 378, cert. denied, 169 Ill. 2d 575, 675 N.E.2d 635 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Although O\u2019Brien testified that he could not state his opinion with a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, he did say that the result of his testing was \u201cconsistent\u201d with the substance\u2019s being gunshot residue. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cconsistent\u201d to mean \u201c[hjaving agreement with itself or something else; accordant; harmonious; congruous; compatible; comp\u00fcable; not contradictory.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). \u201cThe test of whether an expert\u2019s testimony expresses a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>sonable probability is not based upon the semantics of the expert or his or her use of any particular term or phrase, but rather, is determined by looking at the entire substance of the expert\u2019s testimony.\u201d 31A Am. Jur. 2d 90, Expert and Opinion Evidence \u00a7 87 (1989); see <em>Aspiazu </em>v. <em>Orgera, </em>205 Conn. 623, 632, 535 A.2d 338 (1987); <em>Ralph </em>v. <em>Mr. Paul\u2019s Shoes, Inc., </em>572 S.W.2d 812, 814 (Tex. Civ. App. 1978). A review of all of O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony on this issue, including the wide-ranging cross-examination, leads us to conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his wide discretion in permitting the admission of O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion. In doing so, a fair view of his testimony demonstrates that his opinion was given and admitted with the requisite degree of proof. His opinion was admissible and its weight was for the jury to decide. We therefore cannot accept the defendant\u2019s argument on the gunshot residue issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Next, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly overruled her trial counsel\u2019s objection to a question by the state on its second redirect<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> of her father, Harvey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Fuller (Fuller), in which he \u201cgave an opinion that indicated that he believed that [the defendant] had committed the alleged shooting crime\u201d for which she was being tried. The defendant claims that the trial court violated Connecticut law in allowing the state to ask Fuller to express an opinion on the question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. The state, in arguing the rejection of this claim, maintains that her father\u2019s testimony was admitted on redirect examination for the purpose of rehabilitating Fuller after he was impeached. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The state argues that Fuller\u2019s answer to the question was not an opinion of guilt, but rather one of a suspicion that was expressly based on previously admitted evidence and that, in its ruling on its admission, the trial court properly exercised its wide discretion. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Certain additional facts should be set out to afford a full understanding of this issue. The state called Fuller, who testified about the length and nature of the defendant\u2019s hostility toward the Leubas, including her anger and conduct on the night before the shooting when she came to his house with Rocco and Leonardi. Fuller, who lived alone, was still grieving over the death of his wife. He found it \u201cvery difficult\u201d to testify because he did not want the defendant \u201cto be in any kind of trouble at all.\u201d A portion of the statement he gave to the Groton police on the morning of June 29,1995, after the shooting, was admitted into evidence under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986). The portion admitted under <em>Whelan </em>stated: \u201cDuring the past year, [the defendant] made many threats toward the Leubas. For instance, wishing them dead. As far as I know, she has never attempted to carry out any of these threats. [The defendant] left the house with [Rocco] and [Leonardi] between 6:15 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>On cross-examination and later recross-examination, the defendant tried to impeach Fuller\u2019s testimony by bringing out certain circumstances about his health, his medication and his conduct. This included that Fuller was suffering from depression in June, 1995, for which he took anti-depressants and that he also suffered from insomnia. Although he did not usually drink a large amount of hard liquor, he did so to help him sleep on the night of June 28, 1995, after the defendant left his house. On cross-examination, Fuller testified that he probably told his son that the defendant had urged Rocco and Leonardi \u201cto go to the Leubas\u2019 home and try to shake them up and get them to leave her alone\u201d on the evening of June 28,1995. He testified on recross-examination that he was upset at the time that he gave his written statement, saying that \u201cit was probably one of the worst days of my life.\u201d On redirect examination, the state asked Fuller about what he described as \u201cone of the worst days of [his] life.\u201d Fuller stated that he first learned about the shooting when he awoke on the morning of June 29, 1995, and police cars were at his home. It was then that the state asked him the question and he gave the answer, over objection, that is in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\u201cNo witness, lay or expert, may testify to his opinion as to the guilt of a defendant, whether by direct statement or inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Black, </em>109 Wash. 2d 336, 348, 745 P.2d 12 (1987); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>193 Conn. 612, 627, 480 A.2d 452 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>141 Conn. 656, 667, 109 A.2d 364 (1954), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 349 U.S. 926, 75 S.

Ed. 2d 312 (1989). \u201cWhether a statement of a witness is one of fact or of conclusion or opinion within the rule excluding opinion evidence is to be determined by the substance of the statement rather than its form. The use of phraseology appropriate to the expression of an inference, such as \u2018believe,\u2019 \u2018think,\u2019 etc., may in fact signify an opinion which renders the statement inadmissible; but the use of such terms is not conclusive that the witness is stating his opinion, for the language may be used merely to indicate that he is not speaking with entire certainty, in which case the evidence may be received for what it is worth.\u201d 32 C. J.S. 303, Evidence \u00a7 510 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201copinion evidence or testimony\u201d to mean \u201c[e]vidence of what the witness thinks, believes, or infers in regard to facts in dispute, as distinguished from his personal knowledge of the facts themselves . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). \u201cAs a matter of language, the word \u2018knowing\u2019 literally imports something pretty close to 100 [percent] certainty; \u2018believing,\u2019 something less than certainty; and \u2018suspecting,\u2019 something less certain than \u2018believing.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> 2 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) \u00a7 8.10, p. 427. Black\u2019s defines \u201csuspicion\u201d to mean \u201c[t]he apprehension of something without proof or upon slight evidence. Suspicion implies a belief or opinion based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). Webster\u2019s states that \u201csuspicion\u201d means \u201cimagination or apprehension of something wrong or hurtful without proof or on slight evidence.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>national Dictionary (1986). \u201cSuspicion\u201d then does not rise to the level of \u201cbelief,\u201d let alone \u201cknowledge.\u201d In context, the word that resonates in Fuller\u2019s answer and characterizes that answer is the word \u201csuspicion.\u201d That marks the level of his perception of the circumstances and significantly, his \u201csuspicion\u201d was based on matters clearly before the jury in evidence that it could, as the trier of fact, accept or reject in whole or in part. It seems fair to say that when a person only <em>suspects </em>that a fact exists, here, that the defendant was the shooter, that person is doing nothing more than recognizing a \u201cpossibility\u201d of the existence of that fact, but he has not concluded that it actually exists. It therefore cannot be said to be an opinion on the ultimate issue before the jury, i.e., guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">In further support of that position, it cannot be overlooked that this answer came in on a second redirect examination while the state was endeavoring to rehabilitate Fuller after the defense had sought vigorously to impeach not only his prior testimony, but also his written statements. The defense had opened the door in light of its cross-examinations. The state used redirect examination of Fuller for its basic purpose to enable him \u201cto explain and clarify relevant matters in his testimony which [may] have been weakened or obscured by his cross-examination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>186 Conn. 437, 448, 441 A.2d 857 (1982). Moreover, \u201c \u2018[generally, a party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later questions the witness on the same subject. <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>173 Conn. 35, 50, 376 A.2d 391 (1977); [C.] McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7\u00a7 32,57 [pp. 69-71, 146-49]. The party who initiates discussion on the issue is said to have \u201copened the door\u201d to rebuttal by the opposing party. Even though the rebuttal evidence would ordinarily be inadmissible on other grounds, the court may, in its discretion, allow it where the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>initiating inquiry has made unfair use of the evidence.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 13, 509 A.2d 493 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>220 Conn. 385, 393, 599 A.2d 1053 (1991). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in its ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Next, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted \u201cJudge McMahon\u2019s nonexpert opinion of [her] psychiatric condition\u201d inasmuch as he was not a psychiatric expert. This claim arises out of the circumstances occurring during a criminal pretrial conducted by the the court, <em>McMahon, J., </em>on the morning of June 28, 1995, at the geographical area number ten courthouse in New London on an unrelated charge. The state claims that Judge McMahon\u2019s evidence was not admitted as expert opinion evidence that she needed psychiatric treatment, but as circumstantial evidence of her motive for attempting to shoot the Leubas the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Certain additional facts must be set out to put our discussion and analysis of this issue in proper focus. On the morning of June 28, 1995, the defendant went to court, unrepresented by counsel, for a criminal pretrial on an unrelated charge. Present at this pretrial in chambers were the defendant, Judge McMahon, an assistant state\u2019s attorney and a deputy sheriff. Consistently at the pretrial, Judge McMahon encountered difficulty in focusing on the matter at hand because the defendant \u201cwanted to talk about being persecuted all her life\u201d or, as Judge McMahon remembered the phrase, for the last twenty years. She told him of a recent incident in which she said that her car tires had been slashed and that she had gone to the police, apparently with no action resulting.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Judge McMahon advised her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>to go to the police and then to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. She responded, \u201cI\u2019m going to handle this my own way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">At the pretrial, the subject of an apparent anonymous letter that was in the state\u2019s file came up, and the defendant wanted to see it.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The judge instructed the assistant state\u2019s attorney to give her a copy of it and this was done. The judge had previously read this letter. The defendant objected to the context and veracity of the letter. She took exception to the letter characterizing her as being \u201cinsane\u201d and stating that she had certain criminal involvement. Her attitude and demeanor fluctuated during the pretrial. Judge McMahon testified that \u201cby and large [by] the latter part of the pretrial she was agitated and was clearly trying to maintain self-control. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">After a full discussion about a possible disposition, Judge McMahon indicated that she would receive \u201ca suspended sentence if she agreed to go to psychiatric treatment.\u201d He testified that his decision to go along with the condition of psychiatric treatment was based, in part, on his observations of her attitude and demeanor during the pretrial. Upon learning of her options, the defendant asked the judge if he would continue the matter for one week and he agreed. The defendant was upset after the pretrial conference with Judge McMahon; she was not \u201ckeen\u201d about any of the choices given to her as the result of that conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Initially, we note that calling a judge as a witness is not encouraged unless there is a compelling need for his testimony, but a judge is not automatically disqualified by virtue of his office and is competent to testify concerning facts that he observed at a prior or collateral proceeding. <em>Gold </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>222 Conn. 312, 320, 610 A.2d 1153 (1992). It also should be pointed out that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\u201c \u2018[sentencing is an individualized procedure in which the court has the grave responsibility to determine and impose, within applicable statutory limits, the appropriate punishment for a particular defendant. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 246-49, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Candito, </em>[4 Conn. App. 154, 158, 493 A.2d 250 (1985)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>43 Conn. App. 142, 151, 682 A.2d 562 (1996), aff'd, 242 Conn. 296, 699 A.2d 921 (1997). Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[a] sentencing judge has very broad discretion in imposing any sentence within the statutory limits and in exercising that discretion he may and should consider matters that would not be admissible at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Huey, </em>199 Conn. 121, 126, 505 A.2d 1242 (1986); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Colette, </em>199 Conn. 308, 320, 507 A.2d 99 (1986). There can be no real question but that Judge McMahon could appropriately order psychiatric treatment as a condition of probation on the suspended sentence option he discussed with the defendant. In doing so, he was hardly deciding, as an expert, that she <em>actually had </em>a psychiatric problem.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">We agree that Judge McMahon\u2019s testimony concerning the psychiatric option of the proposed sentencing discussion was not admitted for the purpose of showing that the defendant <em>needed </em>such treatment but rather as circumstantial evidence of her motive for attempting to shoot the Leubas on the following morning. \u201cCourts have described the concept of motive as \u2018the reason that nudges the will and prods the mind to indulge the criminal intent.\u2019 <em>[United States] </em>v. <em>Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, [911-12 n.15] (5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 920, 99 S. Ct. 1244, 59 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1979), and as an inducement or state of feeling that impels and tempts the mind to indulge in a criminal act. 2 Wigmore, Evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>dence [(3d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 396, 397]; <em>[United </em>States] v. <em>Beechum, </em>supra [911-12 n.15]. The motive is a cause which comes into play before the criminal act and of which the act is the effect.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>610 F. Sup. 568, 576 (D.P.R. 1985). \u201cMotive is not an element of the crime charged, and the state is under no obligation to show a motive of the accused to commit the crime charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rathbun, </em>74 Conn. 524, 529, 51 A. 540 [1902].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Annunziato, </em>169 Conn. 517, 530, 363 A.2d 1011 (1975). \u201cEvidence tending to show the existence or nonexistence of motive often forms an important factor in the inquiry as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. . . . This factor is to be weighed by the jury along with the other evidence in the case.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gunning, </em>183 Conn. 299, 311-12, 439 A.2d 339 (1981). \u201cAn inquiry as to motive is often of great importance, particularly in a case resting upon circumstantial evidence.\u201d 1F. Wharton, Criminal Evidence (14th Ed. Torcia 1985) \u00a7 109, p. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">During direct examination, Judge McMahon was asked whether making a psychiatric evaluation a condition of the recommendation of a suspended sentence with probation was based on his observations of the defendant and her demeanor during the pretrial conference. The defendant objected stating that the state was \u201cessentially\u201d asking the witness to give an opinion that she was \u201cpsychologically unstable\u201d and \u201cwarranted psychiatric treatment.\u201d The court said that it did not \u201cread [the state\u2019s] question that way,\u201d but rather that the state was asking the witness, on the basis of his \u201cobservations of how she was conducting herself or her conduct and comments during the pretrial, whether it was . . . the predicate for his, Judge McMahon\u2019s, suggesting as a condition of any disposition that she have [a] psychiatric evaluation.\u201d The state claimed that \u201cthe reason for the question is the evidence, is that, at the least the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>state claims the evidence that\u2019s been set forth so far, and will be set forth in the future, is that one of the things that triggered her emotional outrage at that time was being told that a part of this disposition was that she had to get psychiatric counseling.\u201d Judge McMahon, upon being permitted to answer the question, said that was part of the reason he agreed with the condition of such counseling. It is clear that the state\u2019s claim went to motive and was not in the nature of expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Moreover, during final arguments, both the state and the defendant treated Judge McMahon\u2019s evidence as going to motive. In its opening argument, the state stressed the defendant\u2019s anger and agitation about the counseling option, her talk of continuing to be persecuted at that time, her frustration with the inaction of the police as to her complaints and her intention to take care of the matter herself. The state also argued that \u201ceverything came to a head\u201d at that pretrial conference. The defense argued that it was simply wrong for the state to argue that \u201cthe precipitory event\u201d of the shooting was the defendant\u2019s \u201ctake care of it herself\u2019 remark to Judge McMahon at that conference because there were other plausible interpretations of that part of her conduct. The point made is that portion of Judge McMahon\u2019s testimony went to motive and both parties treated it in that maimer. In short, the trial court\u2019s ruling was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that Judge Parker, the trial judge, was \u201cimproperly influenced\u201d by his professional relationship with Robert C. Leuba. The defendant has a number of arguments concerning this claim, including her claim that Robert C. Leuba was at all relevant times the deputy chief court administrator of this state\u2019s trial courts and, in that capacity, exercised authority over Connecticut Superior Court trial judges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>including Judge Parker. Because of that professional relationship, the defendant claims, Judge Parker should have disqualified himself but refused to do so. The defendant suggests, without any analysis, that her request for disqualification was grounded \u201cupon constitutional guarantees of due process<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and upon General Statutes \u00a7 51-39a,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> which required disqualification when a judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Further, the defendant argues that the question of Judge Parker\u2019s \u201cactual [partiality]\u201d became evident when certain of his \u201csubsequent [to the filing of her formal motion to disqualify] on the record statements and acts\u201d are viewed together. Continuing, she maintains that \u201c[a]lmost all of Judge Parker\u2019s evidentiary rulings were materially prejudicial to [her] and constituted grounds for a mistrial.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In addition, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>dant argues that the trial judge \u201cscorned\u201d case law decisions and rules of evidence in finding the evidence sufficient on the fifth count<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> (carrying a pistol without a permit) and in admitting the \u201copinion\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> of the defendant\u2019s father on her guilt or innocence, as well as denying her counsel\u2019s request to charge the jury on lesser included offenses.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The defendant also maintains that Judge Parker\u2019s \u201cextraordinary announcement,\u201d prior to imposing sentence, that the defendant had \u201cbenefited\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> from the jury\u2019s verdict was prejudicial. She claims that \u201cit was apparent from his statement that, had he been the trier of fact, he would also have convicted her on the attempt to commit murder counts.\u201d She further claims that his statement was a violation of Canon 3 (B) (9) of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct of the American Bar Association. Further, she maintains that the sentence imposed was \u201cdraconian\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> in nature and was imposed in the context of improper remarks by the trial judge. She claims, in an obvious, though not explicit, reference to Robert C. Leuba, that the acts of the trial judge of which she complains \u201cwhen viewed as a whole . . . [were] designed to gratify just one member of the pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>lie, an individual with the power to exert significant influence over Judge Parker\u2019s life and livelihood\u2014by ensuring that this innocent defendant, who never should have been arrested for this fictional crime, would be held behind bars for the remainder of [Robert C. Leuba\u2019s] life.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We do not agree with any of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Prior to the trial, the defendant filed her \u201cMotion for Disqualification of Judicial Authority,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> which sought to disqualify Judge Parker. It alleged in part that Judge Parker \u201cis subject to the managerial discretion within the scope of the deputy chief court administrator [Robert C. Leuba], creating not just the potential for an appearance of impropriety or an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceedings but, most importantly, whether the court can in fact be completely impartial.\u201d Judge Parker wrote a comprehensive decision on that motion, which he denied. In that decision, he noted the following colloquy between the court and defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\u201cThe Court: It is your claim that there\u2019s a basis for a finding of ... a lack of impartiality on my part that is different than that which would be applicable to all the other judges?</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Absolutely not, Your Honor, and if Your Honor is inferring that from my motion\u2014and I\u2019d submit it\u2019s badly written. Your Honor was merely the judge who was sitting on the case after, I believe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Judge Purtill recused himself and so you are the instant court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In Judge Parker\u2019s decision, he noted the importance<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> of this concession by defense counsel that the grounds for disqualification asserted against him would apply equally to all other Superior Court judges. Judge Parker then appropriately pointed that our Supreme Court \u201cfaced a like situation\u201d in <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>170 Conn. 520, 368 A.2d 125 (1976), and referred to the United States Supreme Court and other federal precedent, which in effect stands for the \u201cmaxim of law to the effect that where all [judges] are disqualified, none are disqualified.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pilla </em>v. <em>American Bar Assn., </em>542 F.2d 56, 59 (8th Cir. 1976); see <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>253 U.S. 245, 247-48, 40 S. Ct. 550, 64 L. Ed. 887 (1920). We agree with the reasoning and result reached by Judge Parker on the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to disqualify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Insofar as the defendant claims that there was not only an issue of the appearance of impropriety, but also one of actual partiality on the part of the trial judge, the record clearly does not give any support to such a claim. Specifically, the defendant claims that because of what she calls the \u201cinstitutional relationship\u201d and \u201cprofessional relationship\u201d between the trial judge and Robert C. Leuba as deputy chief court administrator, such partiality existed on the part of the trial judge. We disagree, and the short answer to any such claim is that there is no evidence before this court to that effect. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>reaching this conclusion, we recognize not only that the chief court administrator has extensive authority over the judicial branch and all of the Superior Court judges; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-5a, 51-9, 51-11, 51-45a, 51-45b, 51-164t and 51-183a; but that he also appoints the deputy chief court administrator and together, they decide the assignments of each Superior Court judge. In addition, we find that there is no evidence in this record to indicate that Robert C. Leuba, directly or indirectly, exercised any of his authority to affect the objectivity of the trial judge throughout this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .

He fired two shots at the far left wall of the front first floor of the house. He fired a third shot at the porch railing and the bullet ricocheted off it. A light went on in the far right second floor window right after the third shot. No one was visible in that or any other window of the house at any time while we were there. After the light went on we immediately turned and quickly walked away. I looked back as we were walking away and still did not see anyone in any window of the house and I have 20/15 vision. As we walked down the driveway, the shooter fired one more shot in the direction we were walking. No one saw us leave the area. . . .\u201d The balance of the \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d does not contain any more of the facts of the actual episode. It does, however, maintain that the wrong person, i.e., the defendant, was arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b636-8\"> The six manufacturers were Smith and Wesson, Harrington and Richardson, Iver Johnson, INA, Merwyn and Hubert and Eastern Arms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\"> Rocco testified that he never owned a gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b638-7\"> The defendant\u2019s brief is not helpful here. The only legal authority she cites pertains to the trial court\u2019s having sustained an objection to her counsel\u2019s question to O\u2019Brien as to whether he believed the substance tested had more than or less than a fifty-fifty chance of being gunshot residue. It is true that our law permits experts to testily as to percentages; <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>173 Conn. 438, 443-44, 378 A.2d 540 (1977); where it can fairly be said to be cast in terms of probability. It is not, however, appropriate for any expert to give an opinion in terms of a \u201cfifty-fifty chance\u201d because such an opinion relates to possibilities rather than probabilities. See, e.g., <em>Davis </em>v. <em>P. Gambardella &amp; Son Cheese Corp., </em>147 Conn. 365, 373, 161 A.2d 583 (1960), distinguished in <em>Healy </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 444. O\u2019Brien said that he could not answer defense counsel\u2019s question as asked, i.e., in terms of the a fifty-fifty chance. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the state\u2019s objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b639-4\"> The defendant\u2019s brief does not contain any legal authority for this standard of admissibility for O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion. Despite that, we recognize that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 66-68, \u201cour Supreme Court adopted the more liberal approach of <em>Daubert </em>v. <em>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), for the admissibility of scientific evidence. ... As a result, the . . . general acceptance test [of <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923)] is no longer the sole prerequisite to admissibility but, instead, part of a broader conceptual approach. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>supra, 75-77].\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>51 Conn. App. 126, 135 n.9, 721 A.2d 903 (1998), cert. denied, 247 Conn. 958, 723 A.2d 814 (1999). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>235 Conn. 802, 670 A.2d 301 (1996), our Supreme Court noted that it had earlier \u201cacknowledged that the \u2018general acceptance\u2019 test set forth in <em>[Frye] . . . </em>constituted the prevailing standard for evaluating the admissibility of scientific evidence\u201d; id., 831; but it took care to say, \u201c[w]e did not, however, expressly adopt the <em>Frye </em>test as the sole standard . . . and we decline to do so today.\u201d Id., 832. Expert testimony, however, need not always have its admissibility determined by the <em>Frye </em>standard. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>227 Conn. 153, 164-65, 629 A.2d 1105 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hasan, </em>205 Conn. 485, 490, 534 A.2d 877 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\"> Harvey Fuller had been presented as a witness by the state.
