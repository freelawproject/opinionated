See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 189, 640 A.2d 601 (1994); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>38 Conn. App. 99, 100, 659 A.2d 195, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 100 (1995); see also <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s writ was predicated on a factual review of the petitioner\u2019s claim and a determination that the petitioner had failed to rebut the \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct f[ell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance . . . .\u201d <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>223 Conn. 180, 193, 612 A.2d 1161 (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We conclude that the habeas court had before it sufficient evidence to find as it did and that it did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\"> The habeas court also found as a fact that counsel had effectively attacked the only eyewitnesses who had identified the petitioner and that counsel\u2019s decision not to present any witnesses was reasonable trial court strategy in light of all the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
