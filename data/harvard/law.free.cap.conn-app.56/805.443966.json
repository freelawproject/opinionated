Gundel, appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his pleas of nolo contendere. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (3),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant claims that the sentence ultimately imposed exceeded that which he reasonably believed had been previously accepted by the court as a result of a plea agreement with the state. The defendant further claims that the court improperly denied him an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. The defendant resided at 57 Park Street in Stratford. He was accused of sexual assault on several members of a neighbor\u2019s family. On February 26,1998, pursuant to a plea bargain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>reached with the state,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant entered pleas of nolo contendere<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to a substitute information charging him with two counts of unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and two counts of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The sentence imposed pursuant to the plea agreement, and as recommended by the state, was to be five years incarceration, execution suspended after ninety days, with three years probation. This appeal relates to one of the two conditions of probation imposed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">At the start of the plea proceeding on February 26, 1998, the prosecutor recommended a sentence of five years incarceration, execution suspended after ninety days, with three years probation. The prosecutor also set forth the conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation as follows: (1) \u201cHe is to have no initiated contact whatsoever with . . . any member of the [victims\u2019] family residing at 35 Park Street in Stratford,\u201d and (2) \u201conce his probation commences and once he is sentenced, he is to leave his residence at 57 Park Street in Stratford, Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The defendant did not object to or seek correction of any of the terms or conditions of the plea bargain as recited by the prosecutor. The court inquired whether the defendant was to receive any psychological treatment or evaluation to which the state responded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>\u201cNo, Your Honor. One of the reasons for the pleas to these charges was to avoid those types of conditions.\u201d Defense counsel then informed the court that the state\u2019s description was \u201can accurate statement regarding the proposed disposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">After the court had concluded the standard line of questioning for a plea canvass,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Mr. Gundel, when you appear before me for sentencing, which will be on April 30th, your sentence will be five years in the state\u2019s penitentiary, suspended after ninety days. You\u2019ll be placed under the supervision of the office of adult probation for a period of three years. Special conditions of probation: (1) No initiated contact with any members of the [victims\u2019] family. You heard the names before, but at the time of sentencing I\u2019ll outline them each individually, (2) And that you leave your\u2014and <em>not live or be present at </em>. . . [your] residence located at 57 Park Street, Stratford, Connecticut. That\u2019s the plea negotiation; is that the way you understood it, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-4\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: May I have just one second, Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">\u201cThe Court: Yes. [A sidebar conference took place between the court, defense counsel and the state.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Sorry, Your Honor. We are prepared to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right. . . . Mr. Gundel, I think that really covered all the questions that I had for you. Do you have any questions of me now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: No, Your Honor. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">\u201cThe Court: And that\u2019s the plea negotiation as you <em>understood </em>it; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-11\">\u201cThe Court: Then I\u2019ll see you on April 30th for sentencing.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Thereafter, by a motion filed March 19, 1998, the defendant moved to withdraw his pleas pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 (3). At sentencing,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> defense counsel raised his concerns with the court regarding the second condition of probation and requested a continuance so that counsel could file a brief or memorandum of law in support of the motion to withdraw the defendant\u2019s pleas.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The state objected to any continuance because the present disposition, that of pleading to offenses that were not sex crimes to avoid sex offender treatment in exchange for jail time, was the suggestion of the defendant and because he had no constitutional or other basis for claiming that he did not understand the plea disposition. Defense counsel conceded that what the state claimed was not in dispute, but argued that the court\u2019s interpretation of the provision \u201cto leave,\u201d as including never being present at the defendant\u2019s residence, was different from what the defendant had agreed to and offered to present evidence in that regard. Defense counsel argued that the defendant always had understood that the condition of probation would include that he not reside at his former residence, but that the defendant was not aware that the condition also required that he not be present there. Defense counsel then suggested that the court might need to go \u201cbeyond the transcript\u201d of the February 26, 1998 proceeding to take into account the discussion at the sidebar conference that took place immediately after the court stated the second condition of probation. The state suggested that if the defendant sought any modification of the condition of probation he could address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>that particular issue in the future. The court agreed with the state and proceeded with the sentencing, noting that the victims\u2019 family members were all present in court. After reviewing the transcript, which the court had ordered relating to the initial canvassing, the court determined that there was no reason for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The court\u2019s interpretation of the second condition of probation, that the defendant <em>not live or be present at </em>his residence on Park Street, is the crux of this appeal. According to the court, the defendant, after serving his three month sentence, was not only required, as a condition of probation, to move out of his residence at 57 Park Street but was prohibited from even visiting his wife and stepdaughter at that same address. The defendant claims that when he signed the plea agreement he believed he was able to visit the house either to see his wife and stepdaughter or to \u201cfix a leak\u201d if one happened to occur. The court, however, had explained that the condition of probation was that the defendant \u201cleave . . . and not live or be present at 57 Park Street.\u201d The court then asked the defendant if \u201cthat\u2019s the plea negotiation as [he] . . . understood it,\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201cYes, sir. \u201d The defendant argues that he believed that the sidebar conference, which was held immediately after the explanation of the second condition but before he agreed to the terms, clarified that condition of probation in his favor. The defendant claims that when the court asked if \u201cthat\u2019s the plea negotiation as [he] . . . <em>understood </em>it\u201d; (emphasis added); he answered yes because he interpreted the word understood to be referring to how he had understood the agreement throughout plea negotiations, namely, that he was to leave and <em>no longer reside at 57 Park Street.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion to withdraw his pleas. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>he claims that the sentence ultimately imposed exceeded that which previously had been agreed to and accepted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">\u201cA guilty plea, once accepted, may be withdrawn only with the permission of the court. . . . The court is required to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea upon proof of any ground set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 [39-27]. ... Whether such proof is made is a question for the court in its sound discretion, and a denial of permission to withdraw is reversible only if that discretion has been abused.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>55 Conn. App. 95, 104, 738 A.2d 1125, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 922, 742 A.2d 360 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The essence of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the ambiguity created by the court\u2019s use of the past tense (understood), rather than the present tense (understand), along with the defendant\u2019s alleged understanding of the condition of probation throughout negotiations, should have constituted an adequate basis for the court to permit the defendant to withdraw his pleas. The defendant claims, therefore, that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The defendant claims that the word understood in the court\u2019s inquiry, \u201cAnd that\u2019s the plea negotiation as you understood it,\u201d was referring to the condition as he claims to have interpreted it throughout the negotiations, namely, that he is not to <em>reside </em>at 57 Park Street. After the proceeding ended, however, the defendant became aware that the court\u2019s use of the past tense (understood) referred to the condition as the court had just stated it and, therefore, claimed that the sentence ultimately imposed by the court exceeded that which had been agreed to previously. Although the defendant places great importance on the difference in tense, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>\u201cIn considering the evidence introduced in a case, [triers of fact] are not required to leave common sense at the courtroom door . . . nor are they expected to lay aside matters of common knowledge or their own observations and experience of the affairs of life, but, on the contrary, to apply them to the facts in hand, to the end that their action may be intelligent and their conclusions correct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>L &amp; R Realty </em>v. <em>Connecticut National Bank, </em>53 Conn. App. 524, 535-36, 732 A.2d 181, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 901, 734 A.2d 984 (1999). It is apparent from the transcript that the court reasonably could have found that the defendant knew that the court\u2019s inquiry, \u201cAnd that\u2019s the plea negotiation as you understood it,\u201d referred to the court\u2019s explanation of the second condition as it had just stated it; hence, when the defendant responded, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he was agreeing to leave and not be present at 57 Park Street. Furthermore, under the circumstances, the court\u2019s findings make common sense. It is reasonable to believe that the court could draw the inference that when the defendant was told he must <em>leave, </em>at the beginning of the proceeding, he understood that he was not to be physically present at his former residence; his residence was in the vicinity of the victims\u2019 residence, and the defendant was a threat to the children in his neighborhood. It makes no common sense to interpret the phrase \u201cto leave\u201d the way the defendant claims he did; it would be impossible for the office of adult probation to enforce this condition if the defendant were allowed to visit the house at his pleasure.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Moreover, this condition, as stated by the court, neither prevented the defendant from seeing his family, which could visit him at his new residence, nor did it prevent him from seeing to repairs of his former residence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It does, however, prevent him from initiat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>ing contact with the victims\u2019 family, which, by applying the principles of common sense to the phrase \u201cto leave,\u201d given the circumstances of the crime, is consistent with the rehabilitative purpose of the probation under which the defendant\u2019s conduct would be governed. Furthermore, despite his protestations, the defendant agreed to those conditions of probation in exchange for what amounted to an extremely lenient sentence with a short time of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence ultimately imposed exceeded that which had been accepted. The court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Assuming the evidence is insufficient to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas, the defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court abused its discretion in denying him an evidentiary hearing to determine if his plea was knowing and voluntary. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">\u201cIn considering whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea the court may disregard any allegations of fact, whether contained in the motion or made in an offer of proof, which are either conclusory, vague or oblique. For the purpose of determining whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, the court should ordinarily assume any specific allegations of fact to be true.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 185, 438 A.2d 46 (1980). \u201cAn evidentiary hearing is not required if the record of the plea proceeding and other information in the court file conclusively [establish] that the motion is without merit.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">As discussed previously, the record conclusively establishes that there was no basis for the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his pleas. Hence, based on the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>and the law addressed previously, we conclude that the court reasonably could have found that the defendant was fully aware of his pleas. The court therefore did not abuse its sound discretion in denying the defendant an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-11\"> Practice Book \u00a7 39-27 provides in relevant part that one of the \u201cgrounds for allowing the defendant to withdraw his or her plea of guilty after acceptance [is that] ... (3) The sentence exceeds that specified in a plea agreement which had been previously accepted . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-12\"> The defendant appealed to this court initially raising three issues: (1) that his pleas were entered without adequate knowledge of the nature of the charges to which the nolo contendere pleas were entered; (2) that the sentence ultimately imposed by the court exceeded that which he reasonably believed had been previously accepted by the court in a plea agreement; and (3) his pleas resulted from the denial of effective assistance of counsel. In his argument before this court, the defendant withdrew the first and third issues. This appeal, therefore, only relates to the second issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\"> Prior to the defendant accepting the plea bargain, the state fully discussed the disposition with the victims\u2019 paren! s.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\"> The defendant stipulated that there was a factual basis for the pleas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b831-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of unlawful restraint in the first degree when he restrains another person under circumstances which expose such other person to a substantial risk of physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b831-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the third degree when: (1) With intent to cause physical injury to another person, he causes such iiyury to such person or to a third person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b832-7\"> Following the defendant\u2019s approval of the prosecutor\u2019s stated conditions, the trial court continued its canvass of the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-8\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Gundel, did you plead nolo contendere freely and voluntarily today and not as a result of any threats or promises in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-9\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-10\">\u201cThe Court: You are satisfied with the advice you received from your lawyer and you\u2019ve had adequate opportunity to review this file with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-12\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Gundel, do you understand that by your pleas today you gave up certain rights that you have, such as your right to a trial by a corut or a jury, your right to remain silent, not to incriminate yourself, your right to present evidence on your own behalf, your right to confront your accusers and require the state to prove the charges against you beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict you, and your right to take an appeal at [the] end of the case if you had been found guilty?
