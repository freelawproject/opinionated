We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On September 25, 1995, at approximately 9:20 p.m., John Goad, an officer with the New Haven police department, responded to gunshots he heard coming from the vicinity of Rossette and DeWitt Streets. As he approached the area, he found the victim, Andre Barnes, lying in the middle of the street, bleeding from his forehead and chest. An eyewitness saw the defendant shoot the victim and fire the initial shot. This was corroborated by forensic evidence found at the scene. The victim died as a result of his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>After the shooting, the defendant went to his sister\u2019s house, subsequently threw the gun into a river and took a bus to South Carolina, where he remained until November, 1995. On November 15, 1995, the police located the defendant in West Haven and took him into custody. After waiving his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights, the defendant gave a statement to the police that he shot the victim but that he acted in self-defense. He claimed further that the victim had fired the first shot. At trial, the defendant\u2019s testimony was consistent with the statement he had given to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Prior to the defendant\u2019s testimony, he called Stacy Thomas to testify that she had seen the victim and another man pistol whip the defendant earlier in September, 1995. Although the trial court refused to allow the state to question Thomas on cross-examination whether she had talked to the defendant on the night of the shooting, the state was allowed, for the convenience of the witness, to call Thomas as its own rebuttal witness after it completed its cross-examination of her. Thomas then testified that the defendant had told her that he was at the movies at the time of the shooting, a statement that he later admitted was a he.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the state, on cross-examination, to question Thomas beyond the scope of direct examination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Review of the record indicates that the trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the proffered testimony on cross-examination. The testimony, to which the defendant\u2019s further objection was overruled, was admitted on direct examination when Thomas was subsequently called as a rebuttal witness by the state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim of improper cross-examination is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state to call Thomas as its own witness in the middle of the defendant\u2019s presentation of evidence. He relies on <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>109 Conn. 616, 145 A. 31 (1929), conceding, however, that the trial court has considerable discretion over the order of proceedings. \u201c[T]he discretion must be exercised with due regard to the substantial rights involved and in accord with that which is just and proper under the circumstances. Departure from the regular order should not be permitted where it will work injustice to either party. 6 Jones Commentaries on Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 2511.\u201d <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra, 618-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Finch </em>is misplaced. In <em>Finch, </em>the claim on appeal involved the questioning of a witness on cross-examination that was beyond the scope of direct examination. The departure in <em>Finch, </em>which caused the reversal, was the ability to examine another party\u2019s witness on issues that were not raised on direct examination. Our Supreme Court held that this was prejudicial and reversed the trial court. Id., 620. In the present case, however, there has been no showing of prejudice, since the state recalled the witness as its own and was, therefore, permitted to examine her directly. \u201cObviously the more prudent and better procedure is for the court to determine in the absence of the jury questions as to the admissibility of evidence if for no other reason than that such a procedure obviates any risk that the jury may hear evidence which the court ultimately determines to be inadmissible. See <em>Pinto </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>389 U.S. 31, 32, 88 S. Ct. 192, 19 L. Ed. 2d 31 [1967].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Panella, </em>168 Conn. 532, 540, 362 A.2d 953 (1975). The trial court properly allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>state to call Thomas as its own witness in the middle of the defense\u2019s presentation of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is also rejected by this court. The defendant claims that it was improper for the trial court to permit the interjection of consciousness of guilt evidence because it had not been addressed previously by the state during its case-in-chief. Again, the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Finch </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra, 109 Conn. 619, is misplaced. Here, the examination of the witness as to consciousness of guilt was permitted only when the witness was presented as the state\u2019s witness, and the trial court properly instructed the jury. Thomas was presented as a rebuttal witness even though the defendant had not, as yet, testified. The court has discretion to admit, in rebuttal, evidence that might have been properly offered in the state\u2019s case-in-chief. See Practice Book \u00a7 42-35 (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court has stated that if the trial court were to allow a party to introduce evidence in rebuttal that was more properly presented in the case-in-chief, the opposing party would have the right to meet it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Buonomo, </em>88 Conn. 177, 183, 90 A. 225 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The defendant testified after Thomas and, therefore, had an opportunity to rebut Thomas\u2019 testimony. The admission of rebuttal testimony is ordinarily within the sound discretion of the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>223 Conn. 703, 715-16, 613 A.2d 1287 (1992). \u201cThe trial court has wide discretion in determining the order of proof.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Menzies, </em>26 Conn. App. 674, 692, 603 A.2d 419, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 924, 608 A.2d 690 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>(1992). Every reasonable presumption will be given in favor of upholding the court\u2019s ruling when ascertaining whether the ruling amounted to an abuse of discretion. The court had just cause to permit Thomas\u2019 testimony since the defendant had not yet testified and would be given the opportunity to address Thomas\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly charged the jury by unfairly marshaling the evidence and giving a prejudicial instruction on consciousness of guilt, which deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s unfair marshaling of evidence claim. \u201cA trial court has broad discretion to comment on the evidence adduced in a criminal trial. ... A trial court often has not only the right, but also the duty to comment on the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>52 Conn. App. 643, 648, 727 A.2d 780 (1999); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>218 Conn. 458, 461-62, 590 A.2d 112 (1991). \u201cThe purpose of marshalling the evidence, a more elaborate manner of judicial commentary, is to provide a fair summary of the evidence, and nothing more; to attain that purpose, the [trial] judge must show strict impartiality. ... To avoid the danger of improper influence on the jury, a recitation of the evidence should not be so drawn as to direct the attention of the jury too prominently to the facts in the testimony on one side of the case, while sinking out of view, or passing lightly over, portions of the testimony on the other side, which deserve equal attention.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>supra, 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions in this case as to this claim were not so egregious as to have deprived the defendant of a constitutional right to a fair trial. We therefore conclude that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>did not improperly marshal the evidence and abuse its discretion in a way that was prejudicially unfair to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The defendant claims further that the trial court gave a prejudicial instruction of consciousness of guilt. Because this claim was not raised before the trial court, we must determine whether the defendant can prevail under the four-prong test articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>248 Conn. 64, 79, 726 A.2d 520 (1999). In <em>Golding, </em>the first two prongs consider whether the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, the last two prongs address the merits of the claim. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 275, 717 A.2d 168 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>55 Conn. App. 34, 38, 739 A.2d 274 (1999). \u201cIn the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim fails the second prong of <em>Golding. </em>\u201cIt has . . . been stated numerous times that consciousness of guilt issues are not constitutional and, therefore, are not subject to review under the <em>Evans-Golding </em>standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 732, 631 A.2d 288 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>36 Conn. App. 76, 96, 647 A.2d 1021 (1994), appeal dismissed, 233 Conn. 302, 659 A.2d 706 (1995).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Snead, </em>41 Conn. App. 584, 591, 677 A.2d 446 (1996). It is well settled that \u201cthe trial court can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>expected to rule only on those matters that are put before it. See <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>174 Conn. 5, 7, 381 A.2d 529 (1977). With only a few exceptions ... we will not decide an appeal on an issue that was not raised before the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>[supra, 213 Conn. 239]. To review claims articulated for the first time on appeal and not raised before the trial court would be nothing more than a trial by ambuscade of the trial judge. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Cordisco, </em>37 Conn. App. 515, 522, 657 A.2d 230, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 907, 659 A.2d 1207 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mack </em>v. <em>LaValley, </em>55 Conn. App. 150, 157, 738 A.2d 718, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 928, 742 A.2d 363 (1999); <em>Flewellyn </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>47 Conn. App. 348, 353, 703 A.2d 1177 (1997). We, therefore, decline to review this unpreserved claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall carry any pistol or revolver upon his person, except when such person is within his dwelling house or place of business, without a permit to carry the same . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\"><em> Miranda v.
