The respondent claims that the trial court failed to adhere to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in finding that she failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, she could assume a responsible position in the lives of her children. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The respondent has an extensive history of drug abuse. In March, 1992, the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>of the department of children and families (commissioner) petitioned the court, alleging that the respondent\u2019s two children were neglected. The petition alleged that the two children, one of whom was one month old, were found on the street with the intoxicated respondent at 4 a.m. The temperature was just below freezing and the children were nearly hypothermic. The two children were eventually adjudicated to be neglected. The younger child was committed to the commissioner\u2019s custody, and the older child was allowed to return to the respondent under protective supervision at an in-patient drug rehabilitation program. The respondent relapsed after the six month treatment program and the older child was once again brought before the court, subsequently adjudicated neglected and committed to the custody of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Thereafter, the respondent gave birth to a third child, who was also committed to the commissioner\u2019s care within six weeks of his birth because the respondent returned to her shelter intoxicated and unable to care for the child. The child was returned to the respondent under protective supervision, but was later removed once again because the respondent was still using drugs, had an unsanitary apartment and an abusive boyfriend and was not properly caring for her child.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The respondent was in another drug rehabilitation program when her fourth child was bom. Shortly thereafter, the child was committed to the care of the commissioner when the respondent left the child with someone and failed to return. The respondent began another drug treatment program and left against clinical advice one month later. The following month, she entered yet another substance abuse program, which she completed in March, 1996. During the lives of her children, the respondent had entered five drug abuse programs and relapsed after completing each of them. In April, 1996, the commissioner filed petitions for ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>mination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights in all four children. Since that time, the respondent completed another substance abuse program and has since remained drug free. She has also married and secured employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The court found that despite the efforts of the department of children and families to reunify the respondent with her children, the respondent failed to attend some visits with her children and did not go to scheduled classes to help her with her deficits. In addition, she has a high risk of relapse into her drug problem, as she has been in and out of numerous drug programs without success. The trial court also found that the respondent failed to achieve such a degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the needs and age of the children, she could assume a responsible position in the lives of these children pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B). In addition, the trial court found that it was in the best interests of the children to have the respondent\u2019s parental rights terminated. The respondent appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u201c \u2018The hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposition. See Practice Book \u00a7 1042.1 et seq. [now \u00a7 33-1 et seq.]. In the adjudicatory phase, the trial court determines whether the statutory ground for termination of parental rights exists by clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Pascacio R., </em>52 Conn. App. 106, 109, 726 A.2d 114 (1999). \u201cIn making the adjudicatory determination, the court is limited to considering events preceding the filing of the termination petition or the latest amendment.\u201d <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>39 Conn. App. 353, 367, 664 A.2d 1168 (1995); see Practice Book \u00a7 33-3 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\u201cIf the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, it proceeds to the dispositional phase. In the dispositional phase, the trial court deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>mines whether the termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child. <em>In re Maximina V., </em>44 Conn. App. 80, 82-83, 686 A.2d 1005 (1997). <em>In re Drew R., </em>47 Conn. App. 124, 127, 702 A.2d 647 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Pascacio R., </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 109. \u201cIn making this determination, the trial court <em>can </em>consider all events occurring prior to the date of the dispositional hearing, including those occurring after the filing of the termination petition.\u201d <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u201cThe standard for review on appeal [from a termination of parental rights] is whether the challenged findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Luis C., </em>[210 Conn. 157, 166, 554 A.2d 722 (1989)]; <em>In re Christina V., </em>38 Conn. App. 214, 223, 660 A.2d 863 (1995). ... On appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was legally correct and factually supported. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached .... Rather, on review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Pascado R., </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 109-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The respondent claims that the court failed to adhere to the statutory criteria of \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B). Specifically, she claims that the court (1) found that she did, in fact, achieve rehabilitation, (2) improperly considered an \u201call encompassing\u201d best interest standard and (3) improperly relied on publications in reaching its finding of failure to achieve personal rehabilitation pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">\u201cPersonal rehabilitation as used in the statute refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent.\u201d (Internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>tion marks omitted.) <em>In re Christina </em>V., supra, 38 Conn. App. 220. \u201c[Section 17a-112 (c) (3) (B)] requires parental rights to be terminated if by clear and convincing evidence it is established that the respondent\u2019s level of rehabilitation falls short of the level which would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, the parent could assume a responsible position [in the life of the child]. . . . Thus, the statute requires the trial court to analyze the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Hector L., </em>53 Conn. App. 359, 366-67, 730 A.2d 106 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The court found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation as required by the statute. After hearing testimony from the respondent\u2019s own psychologist, a court-appointed psychiatrist and the children\u2019s therapists, the court found that even with all the progress the respondent had made since the petition for termination was filed, the respondent is still not presently able to care for her children. Namely, the respondent\u2019s sobriety is too fragile and the risk of relapse is too great. Her whole support system would be enormously taxed if the children were returned to her, thereby adding to the risk of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The respondent claims that the court did in fact find that she had achieved rehabilitation. Specifically, the respondent posits that because the court noted her \u201crecovery\u201d in the seventeen months between the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights and the termination hearing, it found that she had achieved rehabilitation. Contrary to the respondent\u2019s claim, in its memorandum of decision, the court states specifically that the respondent had <em>not </em>achieved sufficient rehabilitation. The court did note that after the petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>termination was filed, the respondent obtained a job and became drug free. In considering whether the respondent had achieved rehabilitation, however, the court properly considered only the events that occurred prior to the filing of the termination petition. <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 367 (\u201c[i]n making the adjudicatory determination, the court is limited to considering events preceding the filing of the termination petition or the latest amendment\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of the evidence of the respondent\u2019s extensive history of drug abuse, the resulting neglect of her children and her history of relapse, the court\u2019s decision that the respondent had not achieved rehabilitation was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The respondent also claims that the court improperly used an \u201call encompassing best interest standard\u201d in reaching the decision to terminate her parental rights. In the dispositional phase of a termination hearing, the court determines whether termination is in the best interests of the children. <em>In re Pascacio R., </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 106. \u201cIn arriving at this decision, the court is mandated to consider and make 'written findings regarding seven factors delineated in [General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 17a-112 (e), now \u00a7 17a-112 (d)].\u201d <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The court found that the termination was in the best interests of the children. Relying on the testimony of expert witnesses, the court determined that the respondent\u2019s sobriety was fragile and that the risk of relapse, particularly in the event of reunification with the children, was great. In addition, the court found that the children had suffered significant neglect at the hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>of the respondent. They are extremely fearful of being removed from their present homes and have formed primary attachments with the foster parents they have been with for most of their lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The respondent claims that the court improperly considered the fact that the children have lost parental attachments with the respondent and instead formed reciprocal, quality relationships with the foster parents. To the contrary, one of the factors that the court was required to consider was the \u201cfeelings and emotional ties of the child with respect to his parents . . . and any person who has exercised physical care, custody or control of the child for at least one year and with whom the child has developed significant emotional ties . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 17a-112 (e) (4), now \u00a7 17a-112 (d) (4). Because the court found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is unable to care for her children and has a high risk of relapse of substance abuse, and because the children have strong emotional ties with their foster families, we hold that the court\u2019s decision that termination was in the best interests of the children is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The respondent makes much of the fact that the court cited scholarly works in its memorandum of decision to support the finding that it is in the best interests of the children to terminate her par ental rights. In its decision, the court cited literature in footnotes to explain the psychological effects of a child bonding with a foster parent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>In re Angellica </em>W., 49 Conn. App. 541, 552-53, 714 A.2d 1265 (1998), this court held that it was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>to make reference in its opinion to the same literature cited by the trial court here. In addition, we noted that our Supreme Court has cited the same literature as secondary authority in its opinions. Id. We note that the trial court merely made reference to the scholarly works and did, in fact, make its own findings as to the best interests of the children. We hold, therefore, that the respondent\u2019s claim that the court improperly cited the literature in question has no merit. Accordingly, we conclude that the court\u2019s decision to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\"> The parental rights of the children\u2019s respondent fathers were also terminated. Only the respondent mother has appealed. We refer to her in this opinion as the respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 17a-112 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Superior Court, upon hearing and notice . . . may grant a [termination] petition filed pursuant to this section if it finds by clear and convincing evidence (1) that the Department of Children and Families has made reasonable efforts to locate the parent and to reunify the child with the parent ...
