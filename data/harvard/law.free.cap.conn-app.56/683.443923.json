Wildin, was not entitled to certain records that he requested from the defendants. The defendants claim that the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the commission. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On September 23,1996, the plaintiff requested that the defendants provide him with numerous records, including \u201c[a]ll correspondence/communications to or from the Mayor (and the Mayor\u2019s office including staff and Town Council) to or from the Town Attorney (including the Town Attorney\u2019s legal firm), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>from January 1, 1996 to the present.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants complied with most of the plaintiffs requests but did not furnish all of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The plaintiff appealed to the commission to obtain the unfurnished records, alleging that the defendants violated the Freedom of Information Act (act), General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 1-19.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commission found that the records that the plaintiff had requested were \u201clocated in at least fifty, and perhaps over a hundred, different files organized on a subject matter basis.\u201d The commission then concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to the unfurnished records because providing those records would require the defendants to conduct research, which it is not obligated to do under the act. The plaintiff appealed from the commission\u2019s decision to the trial court and the court sustained the appeal. The defendants have appealed from the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The defendants contend that the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the commission. Specifically, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly overruled the commission\u2019s decision when the court determined that the plaintiffs records request, made pursuant to \u00a7 1-19, does not require the defendants to conduct research. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">We first note our standard of review of the defendants\u2019 claim on appeal. We review the question as one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of law because the trial court was required to determine whether the request, on its face, requires the defendants to conduct research.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">\u201cCases that present pure questions of law . . . invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Furthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference. . . . [I]t is for the courts, and not administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law. . . . <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio Power, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 635, 642-43, 708 A.2d 202 (1998). . . . <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 389, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bezzini </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>49 Conn. App. 432, 436, 715 A.2d 791 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">We now turn to the issue of whether the plaintiffs request for records requires the defendants to conduct research. We conclude that it does not. The trial court noted that \u201cresearch\u201d is not defined by the commission in its decisions. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, however, defines research as a \u201ccareful or diligent search: a close searching . . . studious inquiry or examination . . . .\u201d Here, the plaintiff had specifically identified the records he sought and there was no analysis required to search for the records. More importantly, the plaintiffs request did not require the defendants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>exercise discretion as to whether the records fell within the plaintiffs request.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The defendants further claim that because the requested records were contained in so many files, the plaintiffs request requires research. We disagree. A record request that is simply burdensome does not make that request one requiring research. Further, as the trial court noted, while the plaintiffs request imposed a burden on the defendants, the commission \u201cdid not disallow the request on the ground that it was unreasonably burdensome. . . . Instead, it characterized this request as one requiring research and dismissed the complaint on that basis.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The defendants finally claim that reviewing the records to determine if they are exempt from disclosure constitutes research. We are unpersuaded. As the trial court correctly stated, \u201c[a]ny request for public records would require the agency to review those documents to determine if they fall within an exemption from disclosure.\u201d We, therefore, conclude that the trial court properly determined that the plaintiffs request did not require the defendants to conduct research for them to comply with the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-12\"> The defendants are the mayor of the town of New Milford, Arthur J. Peitler; the administrative aide to the mayor, Patrick Maguire; the town attorney, Thomas Beecher; and the freedom of information commission. The freedom of information commission did not join in this appeal. We refer in this opinion to the municipal officials as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"> The plaintiff also requested that the defendants provide him with (1) \u201cAll legal opinions received from the Town Attorney and/or his legal firm from January 1, 1996 to the present\" and (2) \u201cAll invoices . . . received from the Town Attorney and his legal firm from January 1, 1996 to the present.\u201d The defendants complied with those requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 1-19 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A]ll records maintained or kept on file by any public agency . . . shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect such records . . . or to receive a copy of such records . . . .\u201d Section 1-19 was transferred to General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 in 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\"> The trial court did not address the propriety of the commission\u2019s determination that there is no right under the act to make a request requiring research because none of the parties challenged that aspect of the commission\u2019s decision. For purposes of this case we assume, without deciding, that the commission\u2019s determination in this respect is correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\"> The defendants could determine whether a record came within the plaintiffs request by determining the date of the document, the recipient and the author.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
