After a jury trial, the defendant was found not guilty under the first count, but guilty under the second count of the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly refused his request to charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the jury on the lesser included offense of criminally negligent assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. The defendant filed his brief in this court on January 13, 1998. Thereafter, on December 11, 1998, the state filed a motion for permission to file a motion for rectification with respect to three issues. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-5, formerly \u00a7 4051. Subsequent to briefs being filed, this court denied the state\u2019s motion as to the first issue, but granted it as to the second and third issues.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>5,1999, the state filed a revised motion for rectification on the two issues granted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Subsequently, the trial court filed its decision granting the state rectification on the two issues involved. Of the two issues on which the trial court granted rectification, only the first issue is relevant to the disposition of this appeal. See footnote 5. In its rectification on this issue, the trial court stated, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he basis of the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request to charge on assault in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) was the defendant\u2019s failure to disclose, in advance of closing arguments, that he would be filing a written request to charge on that subject. He was ordered by the court to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Before proceeding further, it is necessary to set out additional circumstances that are germane to our dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>cussion and analysis of the defendant\u2019s appeal. On the morning of May 14, 1997, the state rested its case-in-chief prior to the lunch break. The defendant then made his motion for judgment of acquittal on both counts of the substitute information. The trial court denied the motion. Thereafter, the defendant presented Kevin Wilson as a witness. After Wilson had completed his testimony, the jury was excused for lunch and left the courtroom. Immediately thereafter, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cThe Court: Are we having evidence at 2 o\u2019clock, or are we having argument at 2 o\u2019clock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, I think we have to discuss the charge first, you know. Are we going to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">\u201cThe Court: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: You\u2019re going to have to discuss the charge first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if you\u2014I\u2019ll say it again. If you have any charges you want, you have to give them to me. Or if you want any charges for me not to give, you\u2019ve got to tell me that. I\u2019m not going to have a charging conference on this case that\u2019s going to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I\u2019m asking for a charge on assault in the second degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">\u201cThe Court: Well, you get it to me; you give me what you want.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-13\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: You want me to give it to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-14\">\u201cThe Court: Yep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-15\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-16\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019ve got time now over the lunch hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I would probably be presenting [Thomas] Nalband<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at 2 o\u2019clock if he\u2019s available, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201cThe Court: At 2 o\u2019clock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Two o\u2019clock, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">\u201cThe Court: He\u2019s the public defender?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes, across the street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">\u201cThe Court: All right, we\u2019ll continue with evidence at 2:10 p.m. I\u2019m going to request both of you to give me for tomorrow morning full charges, full requests to charge tomorrow morning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">After the recess and in the absence of the jury, the defendant renewed his motion for acquittal and the court again denied it. The following colloquy then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-12\">\u201cThe Court: All right. We note that you\u2019ve rested, and same ruling on the motions for judgment of acquittal. The state have anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-13\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: No, Judge. I just wanted to put on the record . . . what we discussed in chambers, that I am going to be arguing in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods </em>[25 Conn. App. 275, 280-81, 594 A.2d 481, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 923, 598 A.2d 365 (1991)], just so the defense can\u2019t claim surprise, that you\u2019ve agreed to give a charge in accordance with that case, which says that the skin on a human being constitutes a bodily organ in terms of proving assault in the first degree. And also that we discussed self-defense, and there is going to be a self-defense charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-14\">\u201cThe Court: Are you going to argue self-defense, [defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: It\u2019s going to be one of my many arguments, yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. I just want to make sure you\u2019re arguing it so we don\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">\u201cThe Court:\u2014we don\u2019t bring that in if we\u2019re not going to\u2014you are?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes. ifc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Are you entertaining the thought of giving the charge today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">\u201cThe Court: No. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">The jury then returned to the courtroom and the defense rested. Both the state and the defense presented their final arguments. The court then excused the jury, telling them to report at 10 a.m. the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">After the jury left, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-15\">\u201c [Defense Counsel]: What time are we meeting tomorrow, Your Honor, for the charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-16\">\u201cThe Court: Nine o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-17\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Nine o\u2019clock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-18\">\u201cThe Court: Nine o\u2019clock, ten after, five after nine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-19\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Yeah, I thought it was pretty much settled. I mean there\u2019s nothing to go over, right? We\u2019re going to get the assault under the one subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-20\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Well, if we have any requests to charge they should be submitted by tomorrow morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Yeah, they should be there by 9 o\u2019clock so that I can get a chance to look at them and evaluate them, all right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Sure. But I mean there\u2019s nothing new that\u2019s coming up that I know of, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. But I just want\u2014I don\u2019t want to charge the jury and then come out and say, oh, really what I wanted you to say was this, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">\u201cThe Court: So if there\u2019s anything special, get [it] to me. Anything you don\u2019t want said, get it to me. You\u2019ve had a peek at\u2014you know what I\u2019m going to say. Okay. We\u2019ll adjourn court, then, until 10 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning. Thank you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">On the next day, May 15,1997, the state filed a request to charge on assault in the second degree, \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (1), as a lesser included offense of assault in the first degree, \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1). The defendant filed several requests to charge, including one on assault in the third degree, \u00a7 53a-61. The court\u2019s instructions included one on assault in the second degree but did not include one on assault in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">After the court\u2019s instructions, the defendant took exception to the failure of the court to instruct on assault in the third degree. At that time, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: . . . Finally, number ten, I requested the court charge on criminally negligent assault in the third degree ... as a lesser offense, which the court did not give. I take exception to the court\u2019s failure to charge on criminally negligent assault in the third degree as a lesser offense under the circumstances of this case as indicated in the request to charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>And by the law under <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith </em>[185 Conn. 63, 76-79, 441 A.2d 84 (1981)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\u201cThe Court: All right. The exceptions are noted. I\u2019ll just comment on one of them, and that was the request regarding the prior incarceration of the defendant. . . . Okay. You want to take a look\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Can I respond to that, or is that inappropriate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">\u201cThe Court: If you\u2019d like to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: . . . And as to the lesser included offenses, the court made it clear to myself and to defense counsel on a number of occasions that if we wanted charges on lesser included offenses, we should have requested those yesterday. At least that was my understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor gave us till this morning to file official requests to charge. I would not agree to going to argument yesterday if the court had not given us that position. I note that [the prosecutor] got a charge on assault in the second degree wherein ... he did not make an offer under the proper form of the Practice Book. He did not cite facts, and he did not lay out the charge for the court. I laid out the charge for the court, and I recited what facts distinguished the mental state between intent to cause serious physical injury and criminally negligent mental state, if the court pleases, for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">\u201cThe Court: Did you argue assault [in the second degree] to the juiy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: No, I didn\u2019t argue assault [in the second degree],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Well, I made the decision and got the court\u2019s approval on getting the charge on assault in the second degree prior to my argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\u201cThe Court: To argument, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201c [Prosecutor]: And one of the problems the state feels it would have been prejudiced by allowing the charge on assault in the third degree because I never even had an opportunity to address that in my closing argument; and I don\u2019t recall specifically whether or not I even brought up the assault [in the second degree]. But at least I knew and defense counsel knew prior to the closing argument and prior to us having a chance to talk to the jury that that charge was at least going to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">\u201c [Defense Counsel]: But there\u2019s no harm to the [state]. He didn\u2019t\u2014he didn\u2019t argue assault [in the second degree], Your Honor. If he\u2019s entitled to [an] assault [in the second degree] charge on an improper form, I\u2019m entitled to an assault [in the third degree] charge, and I would take serious exception to that, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. All right, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And I\u2019ll never again allow arguments before filing written requests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Take a look at the exhibits, please, gentlemen, and see if we can agree upon them going in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Ultimately, the jury found the defendant not guilty under the first count but guilty under the second count of the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which alleged the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with the rules of practice, the failure to charge on assault in the third degree and the result of these failures.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In denying this motion the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>court said in part: \u201cSubsection D, the court\u2014I don\u2019t know what that means\u2014counsel for the state and the defense provide final arguments. Prior to the filing, official, written requests for jury instructions, that would be on assault [in the] second [degree], the crime for which the defendant had been convicted, that it\u2019s true that final\u2014that written requests were not placed in the file before that event, but these matter[s] were discussed in chambers. There is no objection. The court considered this to be waived. As a matter of fact, this was argued to the jury by counsel. No prejudice is found to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\u201cThe court I think properly refused to charge on assault in the third degree although I don\u2019t recall if I had a request on that, but even if I did, assault in the third degree is not a lesser offense in this particular charge. The claim here is that he was cut by a razor and the fact is, was he or wasn\u2019t he.\u201d Thereafter, as already noted, the court filed its rectification of the record, which sets out its reasoning for denying the defendant\u2019s request to charge on assault in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court acted improperly in failing to instruct the jury on assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) as a lesser included offense of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1). In doing so, he claims that he acted not only timely but also consistent with the trial court\u2019s order to provide the court with \u201cfull requests to charge tomorrow morning [May 15, 1997]\u201d after closing arguments. He argues also that in doing so, the trial court \u201cauthorized the violation of \u00a7 853 of the Practice Book by both the state and the defendant. \u201d He maintains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>that any violation of Practice Book \u00a7 853,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> now \u00a7 42-17, was, in effect, induced by the court. He contends, therefore, that his request to charge on the lesser included offense should have been given because it satisfied all four prongs of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">\u201cThere is no fundamental constitutional right to a jury instruction on every lesser included offense\u201d; id., 583; rather, the right to such an instruction is purely a matter of our common law. \u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser [included] offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d Id., 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Under the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>we must determine whether the request to charge constituted an appropriate instruction. \u201cA proposed instruction on a lesser included offense constitutes an appropriate instruction for purposes of the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>if it complies with Practice Book \u00a7 854. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>213 Conn. 579, 591, 569 A.2d 534 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>[201 Conn. 534, 556-58, 518 A.2d 915 (1986)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntosh, </em>[199 Conn. 155, 158-61, 506 A.2d 104 (1986)]. Section 854 provides in relevant part: \u2018When there are several requests, they shall be in separate and numbered paragraphs, each containing a single proposition of law clearly and concisely stated with the citation of authority upon which it is based, and the evidence to which the proposition would apply ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>235 Conn. 67, 75, 663 A.2d 972 (1995). \u201cWe have held that, in the context of a written request to charge on a lesser included offense, this requirement of \u00a7 854<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is met only if the proposed request contains such a complete statement of the essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>supra, 591; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 261-62, 681 A.2d 922 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>48 Conn. App. 178, 183, 709 A.2d 28 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The defendant\u2019s arguments gloss over the circumstance that his request to charge on \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) was filed in violation of the trial court\u2019s order that directed both the state and the defendant to disclose, in advance of closing arguments, any lesser included offense on which they would be filing a written request to charge. The defendant\u2019s failure to obey that order was the trial court\u2019s basis for its refusal to give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>defendant\u2019s requested charge. As the court noted in its rectification, its preargument discussions with both counsel made it \u201cabundantly clear\u201d to the court that the only requested lesser included offense was that of the state. The record before us bears that out. That record fairly makes evident that on the morning of May 14,1997, after the sole defense witness testified, a recess was taken during which counsel met with the court in chambers and that possible requests to charge were discussed. To underscore that, the record indicates that after the recess, counsel for the state said that he \u201cjust wanted to put on the record that what we discussed in chambers, that I am going to be arguing in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>[supra, 25 Conn. App. 275], just so the defense can\u2019t claim surprise, that you\u2019ve agreed to give a charge in accordance with that case .... And also that we discussed self-defense, and there is going to be a self-defense charge.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Other than to state that he intended to argue self-defense, defense counsel said nothing in response, or in addition to, what the prosecutor said of what occurred in chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The trial court, in ordering the disclosure of the subject areas of the requests to be disclosed before the final arguments, while at the same time permitting the formal filing of the written requests on the following morning, in effect, sua sponte, ordered a partial waiver of Practice Book \u00a7 853.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Neither party objected to the arrangement. In fact, it advantaged the defendant in that he knew prior to the final arguments that the state, which had followed the court\u2019s disclosure order, would be filing a formal request to charge on the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree the following morning. That gave the defendant an opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>nity, had he decided to do so, to respond to that during final arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On the other hand, the defense posture disadvantaged both the court and the state. First, in keeping with the substance and the spirit of the court\u2019s disclosure order, it deprived both the court and the state of adequate time to consider the subject area disclosed and to investigate the relevant case law. Second, it disadvantaged the state by foreclosing it from responding to it during the final arguments as well as to question its applicability in the first instance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We agree, therefore, with the state that the timing of the defendant\u2019s disclosure violated the implicit notice requirement of Practice Book \u00a7 854 and went beyond the limits of the court\u2019s waiver of Practice Book \u00a7 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Nevertheless, the defendant argues that his failure to comply with the requirement of Practice Book \u00a7 853 that requests to charge should be filed before final arguments should be excused here because that violation<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was induced by the trial court. We do not agree. There was no \u201cviolation\u201d as claimed because the trial court exercised properly its discretion in ordering the partial waiver of Practice Book \u00a7 853. See <em>McKesson &amp; Rob</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number><em>bins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shushkiewich, </em>10 Conn. Sup. 237, 239-40 (1941). In any event, the defendant\u2019s claim here is wide of the mark. The court\u2019s refusal of his request was not because of any violation by him of Practice Book \u00a7 853, but rather was clearly based on his failure to disclose, as ordered on the previous day, the subject areas of his requests prior to final arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">While the court was taking the exceptions to its jury instructions and after the defendant had excepted to the court\u2019s failure to give its request on third degree assault, the state said that, as to the lesser included offenses, the court had made it \u201cclear to myself and to defense counsel . . . that if we wanted charges on lesser included offenses, we should have requested those yesterday. At least that was my understanding.\u201d Defense counsel replied that the court \u201cgave us [until] this morning to file <em>official </em>requests to charge. I would not agree to going to argument yesterday if the court had not given us that position.\u201d (Emphasis added.) He continued, noting that the state had received an instruction on second degree assault where its request was not \u201cunder the proper form of the Practice Book,\u201d that it did not cite facts and \u201cdid not lay out the charge for the court\u201d whereas his request did lay out the charge for the court and recited the required facts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Disputing the-state\u2019s claim that it had been harmed by the manner in which the defense had proceeded in this regard, defense counsel maintains that \u201cif [the state was] entitled to [an] assault [in the second degree] charge on an improper form, [the defendant is] entitled to an assault [in the third degree] charge . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>As to what defense counsel indicated the court had said on the previous day, the short answer to that claim is what the court\u2019s rectification had stated as well as the trial transcript itself. Both indicate that defense counsel was silent when the prosecutor reiterated on the record what he understood after the chambers conference on May 14, 1997. While it is correct that the court gave both the state and the defendant until the morning of May 15, 1997, to file \u201cofficial requests,\u201d any fair assessment of the context of the proceedings demonstrates that \u201cofficial requests\u201d means the formal written requests as to those subject areas the court ordered both counsel to disclose on the previous day. Any other interpretation wholly overlooks the court-ordered waiver of Practice Book \u00a7 853 on May 14,1997. It is apparent, from what we have stated previously, that the defendant\u2019s request to charge was not \u201can appropriate instruction\u201d under that first prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588. The defendant\u2019s decision to file his request in violation of the disclosure order of the trial court, which included that court\u2019s partial waiver of the time filing requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 853, also involved a violation of the notice requirements implicit in Practice Book \u00a7 854, thereby rendering it \u201cinappropriate\u201d under the first prong of <em>Whistnant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We should point out that the defendant, in seeking to support his claim of induced error, refers to two Supreme Court cases both of which are clearly distinguishable from the circumstances of this case, <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 105 n.25, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989), and <em>State v. Ray, </em>228 Conn. 147, 153 n. 7, 635 A.2d 777 (1993). In both <em>Herring </em>and <em>Ray, </em>the defendant\u2019s dilemma involved conduct induced by the trial court. In <em>Herring, </em>the Supreme Court excused the defendant\u2019s failure to file a written request where \u201cdefense counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>upon inquiry to the trial court, had been reassured that he need not file a formal, written request to charge and that his oral request sufficed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>supra, 105 n.25. The <em>Herring </em>court did not, therefore, find the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction \u201cinappropriate\u201d under the first prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>Id. In <em>Ray, </em>the trial court required the defendant\u2019s request for a lesser offense that did not contain any supporting evidence to be filed <em>prior </em>to the conclusion of the evidence. The court, in <em>Ray, </em>therefore, excused the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the first prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>The case before us, unlike both <em>Herring </em>and <em>Ray, </em>is not one of court-induced error.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Turning to the defendant\u2019s argument concerning the state\u2019s written request to charge, we determine that while not as artful as possible, it did not mislead or prejudice the court or the defendant. The state\u2019s intention to request a charge on the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>supra, 25 Conn. App. 275, had been timely disclosed. The request disclosed the proposition of law for which <em>Woods, </em>properly cited, was being requested. The request also disclosed that the state claimed that assault in the second degree was claimed as a lesser included offense of the crime charged in count two of the substitute information. Insofar as the defendant attacks the state\u2019s request as to its factual content when he suggests that it violated Practice Book \u00a7 854, we point out that Practice Book \u00a7 854, as it existed at the time of this trial, required a recitation of the evidence to which the proposition of law applied only \u201cif requested by the judicial authority.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See L.

Borden, 4 Connecticut Practice Series: Practice Book Annotated, Criminal Procedure (3d Ed. 1999) \u00a7 42-18, p. 427; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>supra, 48 Conn. 183 n.5. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Neither the court nor the defendant was misled by the state\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b656-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the second degree when ...

Bather, we will set out in this opinion those factual circumstances relevant to the sole issue of the trial court\u2019s rectification, which issue is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Moreover, the state claims that the defendant\u2019s request to charge did not satisfy the first, third and fourth prongs of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).

Whether the jury received a charge on assault in the second degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2) as a lesser included offense as requested by the state, was reinstructed on that charge after giving the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>court a note, and convicted the defendant under \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2), despite the fact that the clerk\u2019s docket entry and the judgment mittimus refer to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3) and the transcription of the trial court\u2019s request for the jury verdict further confuses the issue by referring to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b658-13\"> The trial court\u2019s entire statement in the rectification of the record on the first issue states: \u201cThe basis of the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s request to charge on assault in the third degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (3) was the defendant\u2019s failure to disclose, in advance of closing arguments, that he would be filing a written request to charge on that subject. He was ordered by the court to do so. Having had a prior experience with defendant\u2019s counsel handing this court a request to charge while seated on the bench and about to begin its charge, this court was particularly concerned about a repeat occurrence. The preargument discussions with both counsel made it abundantly clear to me that the only requested lesser included offense would be the state\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">\u201cThe court also gratuitously added its belief that the facts also did not warrant such an instruction. However, the basis for the denial was the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to follow the court\u2019s direction to apprise it of any requests that would be in addition to the boilerplate instruction, specifically, lesser included offenses. The defendant\u2019s counsel was mute on the subject. He thereafter tried his \u2018surprise\u2019 which he knew full well was in derogation of our charge discussions in fact and in spirit. The colloquy on the record after the closing argument had nothing to do with the subject of lesser included offenses. It only had to do with any variations on the boilerplate charge or matters that they might not want charged.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b660-15\"> Nalband never testified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b664-12\"> In his motion for a new trial, the defendant made the following claims, inter alia: \u201c(d) [T]he Court [ordered] counsel for the State and the defendant to present final arguments to the jury prior to filing official requests for jury instructions in violation of Sections 853 and 854 [now \u00a7\u00a7 42-17 and 42-18] of the Connecticut Practice Book.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">\u201c(e) [T]he Court gave the State\u2019s request on the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree even though the request was not in proper form and was not timely.</p>\n<p id=\"ArT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>\u201c(f) [T]he Court compounded the unfairness of paragraph (e) above by refusing to charge on assault in the third degree as a lesser offense even though the defendant\u2019s request was in proper form but late because of the action in paragraph (d) above.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 853 provides: \u201cWritten requests to charge the jury must be filed in triplicate with the clerk before the beginning of the arguments or at such earlier time during the trial as the court directs, and the clerk shall file them and forthwith hand one copy to the judicial authority and one to opposing counsel.
