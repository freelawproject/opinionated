In her appeal, the respondent mother relies solely on fact bound issues. The trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence and the inferences that may reasonably be drawn therefrom. Having applied the appropriate standard of review; see <em>In re Roshawn R., </em>51 Conn. App. 44, 51, 720 A.2d 1112 (1998); we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that its decision conforms to the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-12\"> The parental rights of the children\u2019s respondent fathers were also terminated in the consolidated termination proceedings in the trial court. Only the respondent mother has appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
