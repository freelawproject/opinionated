On the overruling of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial thirty days after the adjournment of the court was allowed in which to file bills of exception and statement of facts. Thereafter on May 37 thirty days additional was allowed in which to file statement of facts and bills of exception. This time was to begin with the expiration of the first thirty days allowed by the court. On June 35, 1910, the following order was entered by the Hon. L. B. Hightower, Judge of the 9th Judicial District: \u201cFor good cause shown the time for filing the statement of facts and bills of exception is hereby extended until July 15, 1910.\u201d The statement of facts, as same comes to us, purports to have been filed on July 35, 1910, ten days after the longest time authorized by law or by any order of the trial court. It is apparent that in this condition of the record the statement of facts can not be considered. An inspection of the record further discloses the fact that there is no question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>raised on the appeal which, in the absence of a statement of facts, we are authorized to review. It, therefore, follows that the judgment of conviction must be and the same is hereby in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
