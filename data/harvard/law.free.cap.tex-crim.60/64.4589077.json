The affidavit was made by H. G. Musick, and was sworn to on the 3d day of January, 1910, and as before stated it charges the offense as having been committed on February 3d, 1910, or about thirty days after the complaint was made. It is contended for this reason the judgment must be reversed; that the complaint charges a violation of the law subsequent to making the complaint. This point is well taken. Tire complaint must charge that the violation of the law occurred prior to making the affidavit. Lanham v. State, 9 Texas Crim. App., 232; Jennings v. State; 30 Texas Crim. App., 428; Womack v.
