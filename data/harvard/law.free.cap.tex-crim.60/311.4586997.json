On March 15, 1910, appellant filed a motion for rehearing, and urges the ground before this court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the indictment is defective. The bill of indictment alleges that the grand jurors of Galveston County at the February term, 1909, presented in the Criminal District Court of Galveston County an indictment charging \u201cThat D. Celli, in the county of Galveston, and State of Texas, was then and there a retail liquor dealer, having a license as authorized by the Act of the Thirtieth Legislature of the State of Texas, page 258, and was then and there engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquors to be drunk on his premises in a locality in the State of Texas other than where local option was in force, did then and there open and permit to be opened his place of business for the purpose of traffic and did then and there barter and sell intoxicating liquor, to wit: whisky and beer in quantities of less than one quart, after twelve o\u2019clock midnight on Saturday, February 2, 1909, and before five o\u2019clock a. m. of the following Monday, February 4, 1909.\u201d The ground of objection to this indictment was that it charged that the defendant did then and there sell and barter and was then and there engaged in the sale of liquors and has no date preceding it to show what \u201cthen and there\u201d referred to and that the date subsequently alleged in the indictment could not be construed as preceding the words \u201cthen and there\u201d and that there must be some date preceding \u201cthen and there\u201d to which it has reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In support of this contention counsel for appellant have cited us to the case of State v. Slack, 30 Texas, 355.. We are of opinion that this case is distinguishable from that case, and the rule there announced will not apply to this case. It will be noted that the indictment alleges in general terms the fact that appellant was a liquor dealer, having a license, and was engaged in the sale of intoxicating liquors to be drunk on the premises in a locality in this State other than where local option was in force. These allegations are preliminary and are on a par with the allegations usually contained in indictments for violation of the local option law, which allege, without giving the date, the adoption of local option in such counties. When the pleader comes to aver the sale, he does so in this language, after having charged the venue: \u201cDid then and there open and permit to be opened his place of business for <em>the </em>purpose of traffic and did then and there barter and sell intoxicating liquor, to wit: whisky and beer in quantities of less than one quart, after twelve o\u2019clock midnight on Saturday, February 2, 1909, and before five o\u2019clock a. m. of the following Monday, February 4, 1909.\u201d How, it can not be important if by the terms of the language the date is given just where the date is spelled out. The only question is, does it sufficiently appear from this allegation when the offense was committed ? Suppose we transpose the sentence without the change of a single word and make it read thus: \u201cDid then and there after twelve o\u2019clock midnight on Saturday, February 2, 1909, and before five o\u2019clock a. in. of the following Monday, February 4, 1909, open and permit to be opened his place of business for the purpose of traffic, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and did then and there barter and sell intoxicating liquor, to wit: whisky and beer in quantities of less than one quart.\u201d No one could question or doubt that the indictment would be sufficient. We do not think that, fairly considered, the case of State v. Slack, 30 Texas, 355, supra, is an authority in point. From an inspection of that case it will be noted that the indictment is not set out. It appears, however, in the statement of the case, that \u201cThe indictment alleged no date on which the offense was committed.\u201d Of course, if this is true, it could not he a serious question that the indictment was insufficient, and Judge Willie\u2019s opinion must be interpreted and understood in the light of this statement. It instituted no new rule, but was a statement of the law, that an indictment must allege the time of the commission of the offense. Here the indictment does allege the commission of the offense to be on a certain date.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We are, therefore, of opinion that there is no merit in appellant\u2019s contention, and the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
