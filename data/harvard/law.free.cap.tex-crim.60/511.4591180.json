On a trial had thereafter on September 26 of this year appellant was found guilty and his punishment assessed at confinement in the county jail for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">Practically the only question raised on the appeal relates to the sufficiency of the information as to the description of the money alleged to have been stolen, and also to the sufficiency of the evidence to support this charge. The money is thus described: \u201cTen dollars in money which passed current as money of the Hnited States of America of the value of ten dollars.\u201d Mr. Odom, the man from whom the money was charged to have been stolen, describes the money as follows: \u201cThe ten dollar bill that was taken out of my purse as I have described was ten dollars in money that passed current as money of the Hnited States of America and was of the value of ten dollars.\u201d We think the description of the money sufficient, and the evidence directly supports this description.
