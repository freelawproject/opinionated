The bills of exception found in the record relate to matters which can not be reviewed except the one which urges the insufficiency of the indictment. This matter is well raised in appellant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment, and is to the effect in substance that the indictment is fatally defective in that it fails to include the necessary allegation \u201cwhich had theretofore been made without lawful authority and with intent to defraud.\u201d In this respect the indictment is sufficient and follows literally the form laid down by Judge Willson in his book of Forms. See Forms, No. 311. It is also alleged that it is insufficient in that it fails to allege whether or not the First Orange Bank of Orange, Texas, was a partnership, a joint stock company or a corporation, and what business said concern was engaged in. This question has been ruled adversely to appellant in the case of Reeseman v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 430, 138 S. W. Rep., 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">Finally, it is urged that the indictment is insufficient in that it fails to allege whether or not the Cameron Live Stock Company was a partnership, a joint stock company, or a corporation. This contention seems supported by the case of Labbaite v. State, 6 Texas Crim. App., 483. However, that case was overruled in the more recent case of Howard v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 494, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>was reaffirmed in the case of Brod v. State, 42 Texas Crim. Rep., 71, 57 S. W. Rep., 671. This rule is now well settled in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Considered altogether, there seems to be no error for which the judgment should be reversed, and it is therefore ordered that the same be in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
