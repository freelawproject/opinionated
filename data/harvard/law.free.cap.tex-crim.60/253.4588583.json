App., 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">In motion for new trial it is complained that the court charged the jury as a matter of law that whisky is intoxicating liquor. In this there was no error. This question has been frequently before the court, and where the intoxicant sold was shown to be whisky the trial court is authorized to assume and charge the jury that whisky is an intoxicant.
