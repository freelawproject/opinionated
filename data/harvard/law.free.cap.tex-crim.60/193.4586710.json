He says that he did not see appellant put the whisky on the table, but it was not on the table when he put his money down, and that there was no one else in the kitchen except himself and appellant when the transaction occurred. This witness, on cross-examination, admitted that he had been indicted in a dozen or more cases, and as he says, \u201cfor nearly every little old thing.\u201d He denied that he gave appellant any money or got any whisky from him except as stated in his direct examination. Appellant took the stand in his own behalf, and stated that on the day in question he was engaged in the restaurant business, and the witness Paxton had on that day come to his restaurant and asked him for some whisky; that he told him there was none in his restaurant unless one Eli Pow-drill had some; that he, Powdrill, had a few times put some whisky in the back room of the restaurant; that Paxton stayed around a few minutes and disappeared; that he was busy at the time and did not notice which way he went or where he went to; that he thought no more about the matter until three or four days later when Paxton came back 'to him, and asked him if he had got seventy-five cents under a cup on the table, and he informed him he had not, and he, Paxton, said: \u201cWell, I left it there under the cup in the back room when I got the whisky.\u201d Appellant said to him that he had not got any whisky from him, but that he had got Eli Powdrill\u2019s whisky. Appellant further testifies that he did not have any whisky on that day anywhere, and did not sell or offer to sell Paxton any whisky at any time or place. This is the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">On this' issue the court gave a charge that at least was unexcepted to in this record, and was not complained of either in motion for new trial, by bill of exceptions or otherwise. The only ground of the motion is that the verdict of the jury is contrary to the law and the evidence. It must seem clear from the above statement that there was ample evidence, if believed, showing a sale. This made the question one essentially of fact which the jury has solved adversely to appellant, and under the circumstances we would be utterly without excuse to reverse the judgment on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">It follows therefore that the judgment must be affirmed, as is now done.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
