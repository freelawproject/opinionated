We find in the record certain memoranda intended for bills of exception, to this effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Bills of Exception:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-10\">S. of F. p. 7: (Witness Gonzales)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">Q. Then you saw somebody on him when he was down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-13\">Council for deft: We object; question is leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-14\">Objection overruled. Deft, excepts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-15\">S. of F. p. 12:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-16\">(Cross Exam, of Griego, on recall)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-17\">Q. They were there present and saw you spending your money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-18\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-19\">Counsel for deft. We object; that has been gone over prior to this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-20\">Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-21\">Deft, excepts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-22\">S. of F. p. 12:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-23\">Q. Somebody took them out of your pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-24\">Counsel for deft: We object; we just asked this witness how many men were there, that he saw there, and \"it does not give the district attorney the right to go into other matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-26\">Objection overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-27\">Exception by deft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-28\">James R. Harper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-29\">These purported bills of exception are so manifestly insufficient, if not unintelligible, as not to call in review the matters to which they relate. In this condition of the record the only matters which we can review are the validity of the indictment and the sufficiency of the evidence. The indictment is in the usual form, and the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>of the ease show the most unprovoked assault upon the assaulted party.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\">Finding no error in the proceedings of the court below, it is ordered that the judgment of conviction be and the same is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\n<em>Affirmed,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">McCord, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
