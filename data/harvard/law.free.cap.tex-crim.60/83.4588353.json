This is presented in different ways for adjudication. There are some bills of exception in the record and a request to the court to charge the jury to return a verdict of not guilty on account of a variance. The original instrument is sent up by order of the court for the inspection of this court and accompanies the record. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>indictment alleges that the instrument had in part the following description of a tract of land, to wit: \u201cAll of the large timber on the following described tract of land in the Germantown Survey of the John Austin <em>2 </em>league grant on S. B. B. of which I am the owner in fee simple: Beginning at the' S. W. Corner of Vincent Twine land, etc.,\u201d then follows a description of the land set out in the alleged forged instrument. The instrument purports to convey to appellant from one P. H. Ryan all the timber on this particular tract of land. The instrument describes the land as follows in the particular above mentioned: \u201cAll of the large timber on the following described tract of land in the Germantown Survey of the John Austin <em>2 </em>league grant IT. S. B. B. of which I am the owner in fee simple: Beginning at the S. W. corner, etc.\u201d The contention of the State is that what was claimed to be, in the original instrument, a capital IT was intended for the word \u201con.\u201d But an. inspection of the original instrument further, shows that where the capital IT was used in further describing the land, as for instance, at the IT. W. line, the IT used in connection with the IT. W. line is the same as the letter IT used in connection with the letters IT. S. B. B. in the matter discussed. We are of opinion that there is a variance and that the original contains the letters IT. S. B. B. whefeas the indictment only alleges the letters to be S. B. B. The instrument described in the indictment varies from the original instrument in the description of the land as stated and this variance is fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The other questions we deem unnecessary to discuss in view of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
