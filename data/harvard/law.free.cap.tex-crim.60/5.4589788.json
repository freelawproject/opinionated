We think the offense denounced in the statute under which this prosecution is had is analogous to those of theft and malicious mischief involving a trespass upon the property of others, and that, therefore, ownership should be charged. Being defective in this regard, the complaint is held insufficient, and, therefore, the cause is reversed and the prosecution is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-15\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
