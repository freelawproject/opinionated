A. Weeks, and showing that this prohibition law is in effect in Clay County, Texas.\u201d It will be noted from this recital that it does not appear <em>when </em>local option was voted in Clay County. Nor is it recited that any election was held in said county after the passage of the Act of the Legislature fixing a felony punishment for a violation of the law. We have quite uniformly held that we can not take judicial cognizance of the existence of such law in the several counties, but that proof of same must be made. Before the punishment of confinement in the penitentiary can be assessed for a violation of this law, it must appear that local option has been carried in the county where the prosecution is pending subsequently to the passage of the Act making the violation of same a felony. See Lewis v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 351, 127 S. W., 808; see also Coy v. State, 59 Texas Crim. Rep., 513, 128 S. W., 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">For the error pointed out the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for' proceedings in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
