We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir.2005), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Kishore was not entitled to equitable tolling where Kishore\u2019s motion to reopen was filed more than four years after the BIA\u2019s removal order and Kishore did not demonstrate that he exercised due diligence in discovering prior counsel\u2019s alleged errors. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2003) (equitable tolling available \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud or error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-18\"> The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Kishore\u2019s motion to reopen based on changed circumstances in Fiji where the evidence Kishore submitted did not establish a sufficient change. <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (requiring circumstances to \u201chave changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d). Grants of asylum to Kishore\u2019s relatives in the United States do not constitute changed circumstances. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) (allowing an exception to the ninety-day deadline for motions to reopen that are \u201cbased on changed circumstances <em>arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been </em>ordered\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also He v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 1128,1131-32 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b438-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
