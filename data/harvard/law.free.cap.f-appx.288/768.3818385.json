We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>As an initial matter, we note that Rafter appeals only from the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration and not from the court\u2019s grant of summaiy judgment in favor of defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> **4We review a district court\u2019s denial of a reconsideration motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See In re BDC 56 LLC, </em>330 F.3d 111, 123 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cThe standard for granting such a motion is strict, and reconsideration will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked.\u201d <em>Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir.1995); <em>accord In re BDC 56 LLC, </em>330 F.3d at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Here, Rafter is unable to point to any facts or controlling law that the district court overlooked in reaching its decision to grant summary judgment to defendants. While she attached an affidavit to her reconsideration motion that contained certain facts not in the original record, such motions are not vehicles for \u201ctaking a \u2018second bite at the apple,\u2019 \u201d <em>Sequa Corp. v. GBJ Corp., </em>156 F.3d 136, 144 (2d Cir. 1998), and we do not consider facts not in the record to be facts that the court \u201coverlooked.\u201d We identify no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s conclusion that Rafter\u2019s motion failed to meet the strict criteria for granting reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Accordingly, the judgment denying the motion to reconsider is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-9\">. While Rafter filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, that appeal was dismissed on January 4, 2007 for failure to comply with this court's rules. <em>See Rafter v. Liddle, </em>No. 06-4351-cv (2d Cir. Jan. 4, 2007). Rafter\u2019s motion to reinstate the appeal was subsequently denied. <em>See Rafter v. Liddle, </em>No. 06-4351-cv (2d Cir. May 14, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
