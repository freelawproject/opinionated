LMHS prevailed in its lawsuit against Medical Savings Insurance Company (\u201cMSIC\u201d) and recovered a total of $246,277.16 in damages. LMHS then sought to recover an additional $533,798.70 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.6698. The district court denied LMHS\u2019s motion on the ground that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.515(2) exempts MSIC from attorney\u2019s fees that it would otherwise be liable for under \u00a7 627.6698.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">On appeal, LMHS argues that \u00a7 627.515(2) does not exempt MSIC from attorney\u2019s fees because (1) LMHS did not present evidence at trial that any group insurance policies were issued or delivered outside Florida; (2) LMHS did not present evidence at trial that each insured was a member of an association or group through which MSIC offered a group health insurance policy; and (3) the certificates entered into evidence do not contain the statement required by \u00a7 627.515(2)(b) in contrasting color.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not err in specifically finding that the policies in question were issued or delivered outside Florida, to persons enrolled in the associations, and in compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 627.515(2)(b). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
