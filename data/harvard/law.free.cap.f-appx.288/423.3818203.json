We have no jurisdiction to review this timeliness issue because the IJ concluded that the asylum application was time-barred after resolving a factual dispute related to the validity of Ma\u2019s visa status. <em>See Sillah v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 1042, 1043-44 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam); <em>cf. Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648, 654 (9th Cir.2007) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>(per curiam), <em>reh\u2019g and reh\u2019g en bane denied by Ramadan v. Keisler, </em>504 F.3d 973 (9th Cir.2007). This is in contrast to <em>Dhital v. Mukasey, </em>532 F.3d 1044, 1049-50 (9th Cir.2008), where the legal argument was not dependent on the outcome of a factual dispute. Furthermore, we have held that attempts such as Ma\u2019s effort to fashion her argument against the IJ\u2019s discretionary decision as a due process argument fail to afford us with jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Bazua-Cota v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 747, 748-49 (9th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">We have jurisdiction to review the withholding of removal claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and review for substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Ma argues that the IJ erred by making an adverse credibility determination. We disagree. \u201c[Cjredibility findings will be upheld unless the evidence <em>compels </em>a contrary result.\u201d <em>Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 741 (9th Cir.2007) (emphasis in original); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). There is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. It was premised on the petitioners\u2019 inconsistent testimony on a matter going to the heart of their claim \u2014 whether Ma and Duan had a permit for the child born in the United States. <em>See, e.g., Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir. 2007). The evidence does not compel us to disagree with the IJ\u2019s finding. <em>See Don, </em>476 F.3d at 741; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Because we uphold the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, we uphold the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
