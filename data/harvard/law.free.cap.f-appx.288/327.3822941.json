We affirm,</p>\n<p id=\"asq-dedup-1\">X</p>\n<p id=\"aes-dedup-0\">T \u201e. , ,,,,,, . s, hancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is, as he concedes, foreclosed by this court&gt;s decisions. See <em>States </em>v. <em>Velasquez-Reyes, </em>427 <em>F.3d 1227, 1229 </em>(9th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 415 (9th Cir.2001)). As he further con. cedeg; Wg ^ that u.s.g.G. \u00a7 3EU(b) is unconstitutional is also foredosecL Uni<em>ted States </em>v. <em>Baldrich, </em>471 F.3d 1110, 1115 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United </em>States v. <em>Espinoza-Cano, </em>456 F.3d 1126, 1136 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"aux-dedup-0\">II</p>\n<p id=\"A5hu\">Lopez-Vivas argues that his sen-fence should be reversed because the district court did not consider \u2014 or adequately consider \u2014 the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and because his sentence is treasonable. The reeord reflects\u2019 however\u2019 that the dis\" trict court correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, weighed mitigating and aggravating circumstances, and imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992-93 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). His argument that the advisory Guidelines range was unreasonable due to so called \u201cdouble counting\u201d was rejected in <em>United States v. Luna-Herrera, </em>149 F.3d 1054, 1056 (9th Cir.1998). His contention that the district court should have explained why out of all the possible sentences, 51 months was the only reasonable sentence is meritless. <em>See United States v. Maciel-Vasquez, </em>458 F.3d 994, 995 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201c[Njeither <em>Booker </em>nor our circuit precedent impose any requirement that the district court state why it chose a particular sentence rather than other potential sentences.\u201d). Finally, Lopez \u2014 Vivas\u2019s argument that the district comb should have compared his sentence to sentences imposed on those charged under the fast-track program also fails. <em>See United States v. Banuelos-Rodriguez, </em>215 F.3d 969, 978 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"AXWT\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"ayn-dedup-0\">Lopez-Vivas contends that the district court committed plain error by imposing a drug testing release condition without specifying a maximum testing frequency. A showing of plain error is re- . , , , ,.. . ,, . quired because he did not challenge the release condition before the district court. <em>See Maciel-Vasquez, </em>458 F.3d at 996 n. 3. Although the district court erred in this regard, <em>see United States v. Stephens, </em>424 F.3d 876, 882-83 (9th Cir.2005), the error was not plain because any \u201cprejudice caused by the district comb\u2019s decision to impose this condition did not seriously affeet the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Maciel-Vasquez, </em>458 F.3d at 996.</p>\n<p id=\"A45\">Finally, Lopez-Vivas argues that the district court erred by imposing as a eondition of supervised release that he report to the Probation Office upon release from prison or reentry into the United States. As he concedes, however, this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>441 F.3d 767, 772 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"acl-dedup-0\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"am6-dedup-0\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
