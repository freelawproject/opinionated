On appeal, Bethel argues: (1) that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because his offense was nonviolent and he had been making strides at becoming a productive member of society; and (2) that his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced because the enhancement was based upon the fact of a prior conviction that was not alleged in the indictment. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">We review the ultimate sentence imposed by a district court for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). We review a defendant\u2019s preserved constitutional challenge to his sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-19\">We are unpersuaded by Bethel\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Bethel has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bethel had an extensive criminal history and was a habitual traffic offender, and his present case stemmed from an arrest for domestic violence. In addition, he was sentenced at the low-end of the advisory Guidelines range.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a 70-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We likewise find no merit to Bethel\u2019s contention that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on a prior conviction that was not alleged in the indictment. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), an alien who has been deported and then reenters the United States without permission is subject to a maximum sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, the maximum sentence increases to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment if the alien was convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d before removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. U.S., </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions did not need to be alleged in the indictment to be used in sentencing. The Supreme Court reaffirmed this holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), stating that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d However, in <em>Apprendi </em>and subsequent decisions the Supreme Court has cast doubt on the continuing vitality of <em>Almendarez-Totres, </em>while not actually overruling it. <em>See, e.g., Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 27-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Nevertheless, we have stated that we will continue to apply <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until the Supreme Court chooses to overrule it. <em>E.g., United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">The Supreme Court has held that when a court determines the \u201ccharacter\u201d of a previous conviction it may examine \u201cthe statutory definition, charging document, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented,\u201d but it may not look to police reports or complaint applications to determine facts about a defendant\u2019s prior conviction. <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254 (determining whether a conviction qualified as a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act). We held that <em>Shepard </em>does not limit a sentencing court from determining the character of a prior conviction from the statutory elements of the offense. <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Under this case law, the district court did not err by considering Bethel\u2019s prior conviction when enhancing his sentence. Moreover, Bethel has not put forth anything from the record to show that the district court considered something other than the statutory elements of the prior conviction when determining its character. Accordingly, Bethel\u2019s sentence enhancement was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-14\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>cational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\">.

Bethel concedes that he is not challenging the procedural reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-13\">. <em>See also Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462 (holding that a court of appeals may afford a presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1314 n. 8 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that, although we have not normally afforded a within-Guidelines sentence a presumption of reasonableness, <em>Rita </em>calls that policy into question).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
