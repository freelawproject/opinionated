An immigration judge denied the requested relief, though, because Syed could not show that, upon removal, his life or freedom would more likely than not be threatened on account of any protected ground. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the decision and dismissed Syed\u2019s appeal. Syed now petitions for review. Because Syed has not demonstrated past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution upon return to India, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">For most of his life, Syed was an adherent of Mahdavia, an Islamic sect found throughout India. As the son of a top cleric, he was expected to enter into an arranged marriage orchestrated by Mah-davia elders in his hometown of Hyderabad. But in 1995, on the eve of his wedding, he asked if he could meet his future wife, Sabiha Banu, and speak with her before their union. The elders refused the request, and Syed responded with a threat to boycott the wedding unless he could meet his bride beforehand. Syed capitulated, however, after the elders threatened him with exile. But the ensuing marriage was not a happy one. Syed was not attracted to Banu, and their sexual life was hampered by a medical problem that caused Banu great pain during sexual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">In March 1996 Syed left Hyderabad for Chennai, leaving behind his wife and newborn son. Within a week of his departure, one of Syed\u2019s in-laws found him and demanded that he return to his family in Hyderabad. Syed reports, \u201cI refused, but the man ... began to punch and push me and told me that I had better do so, or he was going to seriously hurt me.\u201d Syed appealed to the Chennai police for assistance but was told that \u201cthis is your domestic problem\u201d and that there would be no police intervention unless \u201cyou got some blood coming out from your body, then, only we make a case.\u201d Fearing further violence, Syed returned to Hyderabad. Over the next four years, he fled to Bangalore, Mumbai, and Calcutta \u2014 and each time he was forced to return to Hyderabad under similar circumstances. Upon his return, Mahdavis would \u201cthreaten [him] with violence, and even death, if [he] were to attempt to leave [his] wife again.\u201d Finally, in 2000, Syed ran away to New Delhi, where he evaded detection by \u201chiding\u201d and \u201cliv[ing] in huts\u201d for five months until departing the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">Syed entered the United States illegally on August 15, 2000. Some time later he was arrested at a bus station in Detroit, Michigan. While living in the United States, Syed obtained a divorce and converted from Mahdavia to Sunni Muslim, \u201cwhose religious laws on divorce are,\u201d according to Syed, \u201cmore reasonable and ... the clerics are not involved in the decision process of marriage or divorce.\u201d Meanwhile, Syed\u2019s parents sought a divorce on his behalf (one that the Mahdavi community would recognize) from the elders in Hyderabad. The elders denied the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>quest, however, and insisted that it was Syed\u2019s \u201cfate\u201d to remain wedded to Banu. Shortly thereafter, a group of Syed\u2019s in-laws threatened his parents and demanded that they reveal his whereabouts. They \u201cbegan to hit and push ... around\u201d Syed\u2019s father, who has health problems, and \u201che required hospital attention after this.\u201d The record does not, however, provide any further detail regarding Syed\u2019s father\u2019s medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Following this incident Syed\u2019s parents complained to the Hyderabad police, but the local inspector demanded a sizable bribe to protect them from harassment. Even after Syed\u2019s parents paid the bribe, the police refused to intervene and \u201cgenerally responded that unless someone has been killed, they are not concerned.\u201d The record contains other evidence of requests for governmental assistance, including (1) an undated letter from Syed to the president of the Hyderabad Human and Civil Rights Forum requesting protection for his parents, who are \u201celderly, weak and sensitive\u201d and \u201cnot in [a] position to handle ... gangsters or rowdies\u201d; (2) an order from the High Court of Judicature denying \u201canticipatory bail\u201d to Syed\u2019s parents because no crime has been alleged and \u201cthe police are not expected to arrest the petitioners without registering a crime\u201d; and (3) an illegible police complaint filed with the Hyderabad City Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">In February 2006 Syed sought withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), arguing that he had suffered past persecution for attempting to divorce his wife and that he feared future persecution because of his divorce in the United States and his conversion from Mahdavia to Sunni. The immigration judge (IJ) denied the applications on numerous grounds. First, the IJ determined that Syed\u2019s opposition to arranged marriage was not a religious conviction but rather a personal preference for a different wife. According to the IJ, Syed was \u201cunwilling[ ] to remain married to Ms. Banu [because] he simply did not find her attractive and believed that she came to the marriage with a medical problem.\u201d The IJ found support for this conclusion in Syed\u2019s own statements that he did not, at the outset, disagree with the institution of arranged marriage and that \u201chad his wife been a different person, he may have remained married to her.\u201d Moreover, the IJ noted, Sunnis also practice arranged marriage. Second, contrary to Syed\u2019s assertions, \u201claw enforcement authorities in India have taken some action\u201d to protect him and his parents. And, finally, the IJ held that Syed\u2019s own account of his time in New Delhi confirmed that he could relocate safely within India, \u201ca huge country with a population that is greater than the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Syed\u2019s appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) was similarly unsuccessful. The BIA agreed with the IJ that Syed had not experienced persecution because \u201chis claim evolved out of a personal disagreement\u201d as opposed to a religious opposition to arranged marriage. The BIA also determined that Indian authorities had \u201ctaken action to protect his family.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cthe mistreatment perpetrated by his in-laws, consisting of little more than harassment and minor beatings, [does not] amount[] to persecution.\u201d And Syed\u2019s experience in New Delhi demonstrated that he could relocate safely elsewhere in India.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">If the BIA issues its own opinion instead of supplementing or adopting the IJ\u2019s decision, we confine our review to the BIA\u2019s opinion. <em>Moab v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 656, 659 (7th Cir.2007). And we will uphold the agency\u2019s decision so long as it is supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Moab, </em>500 F.3d at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Syed contests the denial of his application for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which prevents removal if \u201cthe alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An applicant can establish eligibility for withholding of removal by demonstrating past persecution, which creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, or by offering evidence of a clear probability (\u201cmore likely than not\u201d) of future persecution. <em>Irasoc v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 727, 729-30 (7th Cir.2008); <em>BinRashed v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 666, 670-71 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Syed\u2019s first argument on appeal is that the BIA erred by construing his claim merely as a religious objection to arranged marriage; according to Syed, his claim also encompasses a religious objection to the Mahdavi prohibition <em>on divorce. </em>Taken together, these practices constitute \u201c[florced ... marriage.\u201d This is a very fine \u2014 and ultimately fruitless \u2014 analytical distinction. The BIA evaluated Syed\u2019s claim of religious opposition to arranged marriage <em>and </em>explicitly addressed his desire \u201cto end his marriage.\u201d Furthermore, the BIA appreciated Syed\u2019s contention \u201cthat he was forced to engage in an arranged marriage\u201d from which he could not escape while living in India.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Syed\u2019s real disagreement lies with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that his claim evolved out of a personal disagreement. The record is replete with admissions by Syed that he would have been happy in a different arranged marriage. His marriage was lacking because he was not attracted to his wife and he was sexually disgruntled. Moreover, by his own account, Syed\u2019s religious opposition to forced marriage emerged only on the eve of his wedding. Still, Syed eventually sought a new religion that would give him \u201cthe choice.\u201d According to Syed, Sunnis can, prior to arranged marriage, \u201ctalk to [one\u2019s future spouse] ... and you can go with her outside. And ... you can have an engagement before marriage, and so that you can know each other well. If you don\u2019t like, you can cancel before marriage.\u201d Ultimately, however, Syed cannot show that his in-laws and the Mahdavia elders targeted him <em>for his religious beliefs. </em>To the contrary, Syed notes that his community was angered by the wasted expense of his wedding; the humiliation that his wife has suffered; and the dishonor that Syed has brought upon Mahdavia by his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Syed also contends that the harm he has alleged is severe enough to constitute past persecution. He is wrong. This court defines persecution as \u201cpunishment or the infliction of harm for political, religious, or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.\u201d <em>Dandan v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 567, 573 (7th Cir.2004) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Persecution can take many forms, including physical abuse, economic deprivation, detention, arrest, interrogation, prosecution, imprisonment, illegal searches, surveillance, and torture. <em>Irasoc, </em>522 F.3d at 730; <em>Tarraf v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 525, 534-35 (7th Cir.2007). While there is no \u201cgeneric checklist\u201d of bad acts amounting to persecution, we consider the frequency and severity of the harm infliet-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>ed. <em>Liu v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 307, 313 (7th Cir.2004); <em>see Irasoc, </em>522 F.3d at 730. Even a single event of physical abuse can be persecution so long as the harm is great. <em>Gomes v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 746, 754 (7th Cir.2007) (defining persecution to include a single incident of \u201csevere physical abuse and terrorism inside his home, when his curtains were set on fire as Muslim fundamentalists held a knife to his throat and confiscated his property\u201d); <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>465 F.3d 316, 319-20 (7th Cir.2006) (concluding that a beating that required seven stitches was not alone enough to constitute persecution). Unfulfilled threats, however, almost never rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Bejko v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 482, 486 (7th Cir.2006) (\u201cThreats can constitute past persecution only in the most extreme circumstances, such as where they are of a most immediate or menacing nature or if the perpetrators attempt to follow through on the threat.\u201d). <em>But see Kantoni v. Gonzales, </em>461 F.3d 894, 898 (7th Cir.2006) (\u201cA credible threat that causes a person to abandon lawful political or religious associations or beliefs is persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The record reflects that Syed and his parents received threats of violence, but those threats materialized only twice \u2014 first in Chennai, when Syed was \u201cpunch[ed] and push[ed]\u201d and then again when Syed\u2019s in-laws \u201cphysically abused\u201d his father. Any report of state-sanctioned violence is troubling, but Syed has provided little detail about these two encounters. Without more information, these incidents are not severe or frequent enough to satisfy the stringent requirements of withholding of removal. <em>See Boci v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 762, 767 (7th Cir.2007). Additionally, there are reasons for the IJ to have doubted the credibility of the Mahdavis\u2019 threats. Syed reports that each time he returned to Hyderabad he was told that he would be killed if he left his wife again. Yet Syed kept leaving \u2014 which provoked only fui\u2019ther threats and harassment. Furthermore, Syed\u2019s fear of death upon return is inconsistent with the Mahdavis\u2019 demand that he \u201caccept [his] wife and child\u201d and <em>live </em>with them. Finally, Syed insists that he will be tortured if removed, but his fear of torture is based only on a single report that if he returns, \u201cthe main cleric from Hyderabad ... want[s] me to be turned over to him.\u201d This is too speculative to constitute persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Also unavailing is Syed\u2019s argument that the BIA faded to address adequately whether his conversion to Sunni makes future persecution more likely than not. The BIA\u2019s analysis on this point is light, but so too is the evidence upon which Syed relies. Syed offered the following conjecture at the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">They will harass me, because that\u2019s a big thing in my community that I cannot change my [sect].... They might kill me, or I don\u2019t know what they are going to do with me. Because there are some cases before, like 50, 60 years before? When somebody change them religion, they killed their persons, and so we got a graveyard.... [M]y father told me that ... there\u2019s the punishment they give.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Elsewhere Syed writes that the consequence of return would be torture, a forced renunciation of his Sunni faith, and a public announcement \u201cthat I have returned to the Mahdavia sect.\u201d Instead of pointing to specific evidence regarding the Mahdavis\u2019 treatment of converts, Syed compares his situation to that of a former Muslim who converted to Christianity and faced capital punishment if removed to Iran. This is no substitute for reliable information about Mahdavi practices. Because Syed failed to furnish any evidence other than his own suspicions, it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>unreasonable for the BIA to conclude that \u201cthe respondent has failed to show that he more likely than not would be persecuted upon return to India on account of his conversion from the Mahdavian sect of Islam to the Sunni sect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Syed\u2019s inability to establish past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution dooms his appeal, as does his failure to connect any of his mistreatment to a protected ground. Although Syed may have meritorious arguments on several ancillary issues, we need not reach those arguments because they would not alter the ultimate outcome of this case. <em>See Kadia v. Gonzales, </em>501 F.3d 817, 821 (7th Cir.2007) (\u201c[T]he doctrine of harmless error is applicable to judicial review of immigration decisions.\u201d). Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. Accordingly, we DENY the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">. Syed has waived his CAT claim by failing to address it in his opening brief before this court. <em>See Haxhiu v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 685, 692 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
