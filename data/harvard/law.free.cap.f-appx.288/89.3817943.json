White, </em>231 Fed. Appx. 301 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished). White\u2019s sole issue on appeal is that the district court again erred in enhancing his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000) (\u201cACCA\u201d), because the Government still has not established that White\u2019s 2000 Maryland conviction for attempted manufacture and distribution of a controlled substance was a conviction for a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finding no error, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">We conclude that the district court, utilizing the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), correctly found on remand that White\u2019s October 2000 conviction was a proper ACCA predicate conviction. As instructed by this court in our disposition of White\u2019s initial appeal, the Government produced an expert to explain how the \u201cTrue Test Copy\u201d of conviction demonstrated that White\u2019s October 2000 crime was for attempting to distribute a dangerous controlled substance that was not marijuana and, accordingly, was statutorily defined as carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years. Based on the evidence presented by the Government on remand, we conclude that, under <em>Taylor, </em>the October 2000 conviction qualified as a predicate ACCA offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-10\">. White's October 2000 conviction was for violation of Md.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 286, which was re-codified as Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law \u00a7 5-602 (LexisNexis 2002). Under these provisions, the maximum penalty for distributing a controlled dangerous substance varies depending on the drug involved; if the offense involved a Schedule I or Schedule II drug, such as cocaine, the maximum penalty would be twenty years' imprisonment, but if the drug involved was marijuana, for example, the maximum punishment would be only five years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law \u00a7\u00a7 5-607 and 5-608 (LexisNexis 2002). While challenged the October 2000 conviction as an ACCA predicate offense because he asserted that the Government\u2019s evidence did not establish the drug involved in that offense was a Schedule II drug (i.e., cocaine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-17\">. We express no opinion regarding the district court\u2019s alternative holding that the statement of probable cause sufficiently established that White\u2019s October 2000 conviction was an ACCA predicate offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
