Smith, Texas prisoner # 732505, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against Stanley D. Allen, a doctor with the University of Texas Medical Branch. Smith asserted that Allen denied him proper medical treatment in violation of his constitutional rights. The district court held that Smith\u2019s allegations failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted and dismissed the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-18\">Smith argues that the district court erred by: dismissing his complaint without holding a hearing; citing a prior unsuccessful civil rights action that he had brought; not allowing discovery; and determining that he had not established deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Smith admits that he has had two surgeries for his shoulder condition and states that these surgeries were not successful in alleviating his problems. His assertion that Allen denied him medical treatment is based on Allen\u2019s determination that Smith is not a candidate for additional shoulder surgery. Smith\u2019s disagreement with this determination is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 839-41, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-19\">Smith\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cik. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Because Smith\u2019s prior action in <em>Smith v. Largent, </em>H-02CV-1489 (S.D.Tex.2003), was dismissed for failure to state a claim, he now has accumulated three strikes. \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, Smith is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g); <em>see Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b961-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
