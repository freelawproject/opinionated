Fofana (Fofana) removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A) because he was inadmissa-ble at the time he entered the United States due to his failure to present a valid entry document. In January 2006, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed Fofana\u2019s appeal of his removal order and his removal order became administratively final. Today, Fofana\u2019s appeal of his removal order remains pending before another panel of this court, and Fofana remains in custody<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under a stay of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal arises out of a petition for habeas corpus, in which Fofana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>challenged his continuing detention while the appeal of his removal order is resolved. The district court dismissed Fofana\u2019s habe-as petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>Stephens v. Herrera, </em>464 F.3d 895, 897 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">As a preliminary matter, we need not discuss Fofana\u2019s argument that Congress does not have the authority to authorize the deportation of aliens. It is well established that Congress has the power to regulate immigration, which includes the power to admit and deport aliens. <em>See, e.g., Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 905, 912 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Fofana also contests the legality of his present detention. We conclude that Fofana\u2019s detention, though prolonged, is not indefinite. Under <em>Prieto-Romero v. Clark, </em>an alien \u201cwhose administrative review is complete but whose removal is stayed pending the court of appeals\u2019 resolution of his petition for review\u201d is detained under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a). 534 F.3d 1053, 1058 (9th Cir.2008). Thus, Fofana is currently detained under \u00a7 1226(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">An alien\u2019s detention is not indefinite just because it lacks a certain end date. <em>See Prieto-Romero, </em>534 F.3d at 1063-64. Rather, when an alien detained under \u00a7 1226(a) faces a \u201csignificant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future because the government can repatriate him to [another country] if his pending bid for judicial relief from his administratively final removal order proves unsuccessful,\u201d continuing detention is statutorily authorized under \u00a7 1226(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Here, the government claims that it can remove Fofana to Gambia and submitted a declaration of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation officer Kathy Makaena to document ICE\u2019s successful repatriation to Gambia of numerous Gambian citizens subject to orders of removal. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1063 (\u201c[T]here is no evidence that Prieto-Romero is unremovable because the destination country will not accept him or his removal is barred by our own laws.\u201d). Although Fofana argues in his brief that he is not a citizen of Gambia, the district court concluded otherwise and its factual finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Duncan v. Ornoski, </em>528 F.3d 1222, 1233 (9th Cir.2008). Fofana testified before the IJ that because his father \u201cwas a native Gambian,\u201d he was a citizen of Gambia. The Constitution of the Republic of Gambia confirms that Fofana is a citizen of Gambia if his father was a citizen of Gambia by birth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, Fofana \u201cforeseeably remains <em>capable </em>of being removed \u2014 even if it has not yet finally been determined that he <em>should be </em>removed,\u201d therefore, the government has an interest in assuring his presence at removal and his continued detention is authorized. <em>See Prieto-Romero, </em>534 F.3d at 1065 (citing <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 699, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>To the extent that Fofana claims that he has not received a sufficient individualized determination of the governmental interest in his continued detention, his claim also fails. In <em>Casas-Castrillon v. Department of Homeland Security, </em>we held that the prolonged detention of an alien under \u00a7 1226(a) \u201cis permissible only where the Attorney General finds such detention individually necessary by providing the alien with an adequate opportunity to contest the necessity of his detention.\u201d 535 F.3d 942, 951 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Here, ICE determined in Fofana\u2019s initial custody determination that he should remain in custody and Fofana received a bond determination hearing before an IJ; in January 2005, the IJ concluded that Fofana was a flight risk and a danger to the community. Fofana does not argue that his hearing was deficient in any respect. In March 2005, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of bond on the basis that Fofana posed a flight risk. We do not have jurisdiction to review this discretionary decision. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Fofana\u2019s petition for habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b455-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-15\">. In sum, Fofana has been in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for over four and a half years as he was initially taken into custody by ICE in December 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b455-23\">. Though it does not affect our analysis, it is worth noting that this stay of removal has not been in place continuously. At Fofana\u2019s request, the stay of removal was lifted on November 16, 2007, and reinstated on January 22, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\">. Fofana argues that he was initially detained under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c) and that his detention under that provision was improper. The court need not address this argument as Fofa-na misunderstands the authority for his initial detention. Fofana was not initially detained under \u00a7 1226(c) as his charge of removability was not based on any of the crimes enumerated in that provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b456-12\">. Because Fofana is a citizen of Gambia and the government has submitted evidence that Gambia accepts its citizens who are subject to removal orders, any debate regarding whether Gambia will admit Fofana based on a Gambian passport he obtained with incorrect name and birthdate information is not material to our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
