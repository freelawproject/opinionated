We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Ashker v. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>350 F.3d 917, 921 (9th Cir.2003), and affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Defendants failed to show that the challenged regulation is rationally related to a legitimate penological objective. <em>See id. </em>at 922 (\u201cA prison regulation that impinges on inmates\u2019 constitutional rights ... is valid only if it is \u2018reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 88, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)); (\u201c[A] regulation cannot be sustained where the logical connection between the regulation and the asserted goal is so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.\u201d) (quoting <em>Turner, </em>482 U.S. at 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">There was no rational basis for prison officials to confiscate Brown\u2019s magazine tear-outs of photographs because they came from his magazines, when, had the photographs been part of an article clipping that arrived in the mail from outside the prison, the officials would have left Brown\u2019s property alone. <em>See Clement v. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>364 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that policy prohibiting material downloaded from internet was arbitrary way to achieve reduction in mail volume).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-14\">Accordingly, to the extent that Brown seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment on Brown\u2019s First Amendment claim concerning his magazine tear-outs. Because Brown does not develop any argument regarding his challenge to confiscation of his personal magazines that were altered because he tore photographs out of them, we do not review that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Int\u2019l Healthcare Mgmt. v. Hawaii Coalition For Health, </em>332 F.3d 600, 609 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"ac8-dedup-0\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of qualified immunity from Brown\u2019s claims for damages. Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity because they confiscated Brown\u2019s photographs pursuant to official prison policies, which policies were not \u201cpatently violative of constitutional princi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>pies.\u201d <em>Dittman v. California, </em>191 F.3d 1020, 1027 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201c[WJhen a public official acts in reliance on a duly enacted statute or ordinance, that official ordinarily is entitled to qualified immunity\u201d unless the ordinance is \u201cpatently violative of fundamental constitutional principles.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Brown\u2019s contentions regarding collateral estoppel, inadequate notice of summary judgment procedures, violation of Local Rules, and improper denial of his motion for sanctions, are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Each party shall bear its costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AWgU\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
