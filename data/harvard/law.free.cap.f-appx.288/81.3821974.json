The district court sentenced De-huma to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. Dehuma timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Dehuma\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning the reasonableness of Dehuma\u2019s sentence. Counsel states, however, that he has found no meritorious grounds for appeal. Dehuma received notice of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file one. Finding no meritorious grounds for appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Here, counsel does not assert that the district court erred in determining the applicable Guidelines range, and our review of the record reveals no error. Dehuma was sentenced to the statutory minimum term of imprisonment, and we conclude that his sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Dehuma, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Dehuma requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Dehuma.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
