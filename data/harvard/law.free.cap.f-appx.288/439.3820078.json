Though the REAL ID Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), has overridden 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3)\u2019s jurisdictional prohibitions for questions of law and constitutional claims, Petitioner has failed to raise any questions of law or constitutional claims on appeal. <em>See Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648 (9th Cir.2007). Furthermore, the BIA properly affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s remaining claims for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) based on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s claims and affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination citing <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872, 874 (BIA 1994). A review of the IJ\u2019s decision demonstrates that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence and that the inconsistencies in Petitioner\u2019s testimony go to the heart of his claim. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004). Although most of the inconsistencies related to whether Petitioner had filed his asylum application within one year of his arrival in the United States, the IJ noted additional discrepancies that also support an adverse credibility finding for Petitioner\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and for protection under CAT. <em>See id. </em>Specifically, the IJ found that Petitioner failed to convincingly address discrepancies in his testimony regarding the number of times he gave speeches in India supporting the Shiroma-ni Akali Dal, the number of times he was arrested, and the relation of his alleged arrests to the speeches he gave.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">The IJ also noted a discrepancy between Petitioner\u2019s testimony that he was the only member of his family involved in political activities and a letter written by Petitioner\u2019s father stating that \u201cour family is well known in the area for Supporter [sic] of Shiromani Akali Dal Mann and movement of Khalistan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">Petitioner\u2019s assessment to refer raises another notable discrepancy regarding the date of his first arrest. Specifically, in his interview with the assessment officer, Hundal initially stated that his first arrest was on May 31, 1998. Later however, Hundal answered that his first arrest was on June 3, 1998, for giving a speech on May 31, 1998. While this inconsistency in dates, alone, may not be a sufficient basis upon which to make an adverse credibility finding, inconsistencies in testimony should not be viewed in isolation, but should be considered in light of all of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>presented. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Here, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence and was properly upheld by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION, AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b462-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
