We have juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>diction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review findings of fact, including eligibility and entitlement determinations, for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Even taking Iskender\u2019s testimony as true, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Iskender is ineligible for asylum. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the Turkish government was not unwilling or unable to control Iskender\u2019s alleged persecutors. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s relocation finding, because Iskerider\u2019s own statements regarding his relocation to Istanbul for three years without any incidents related to his \u201cblood feud\u201d with another family establish that he could reasonably relocate within Turkey. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998-99 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Because Iskender is ineligible for asylum, he necessarily fails to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief. Iskender has failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed to Turkey. <em>See Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1194 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b464-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
