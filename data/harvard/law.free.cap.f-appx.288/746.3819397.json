The district court sentenced Schroeder principally to a term of 23 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">Schroeder challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. He argues first that the district court did not adequately consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Second, Schroeder contends that the 23 month term of imprisonment, substantially above his 8-14 month advisory Guidelines range, and one month below the statutory maximum, is unreasonable because the court relied on factors common to all defendants convicted of this offense when justifying the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-19\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing determination for procedural and substantive reasonableness, a standard \u201cakin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006). In <em>Gall v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>[An appellate court] must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Where the district court imposes a non-Guidelines sentence, it \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing for substantive reasonableness, an appellate court must \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Schroeder\u2019s claim that the court committed procedural error by failing to consider the relevant statutory factors is without merit. The district court explicitly stated that it had considered what would be a sufficient sentence \u201cunder all the factors under [\u00a7 ] 3553(a).\u201d The record reflects nothing to the contrary, and \u201cwe presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory [sentencing] factors.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 30. Accordingly, we reject Schroeder\u2019s claim of procedural unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">We also conclude that Schroeder\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Given the factual and procedural history of this case, the district court was entitled to find that \u201cthis case cries out, it is extraordinary,\u201d warranting a sentence substantially above the advisory Guidelines range. As the court noted, the sentence for which Schroeder failed to surrender, a 10 month term of incarceration upon his conviction for laundering drug proceeds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(3)(C), was a significant departure from the Guidelines recommended range of 37-46 months\u2019 imprisonment, and had been based primarily on a \u201cmarginal\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 letter submitted by the government on Schroeder\u2019s behalf. The court had also allowed Schroeder to voluntarily surrender despite his immigration status and granted Schroeder\u2019s request that it recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that he serve the remainder of the initial 10 month sentence in a halfway house, though the Bureau of Prisons was unable to accommodate this request. The court also noted the expense of locating Schroeder.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">In light of this history, the court did not err in finding the breach of trust inherent in any failure to surrender offense to be more serious here, where it followed on the heels of notably lenient treatment. <em>Cf. United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 130 (2d Cir.2008) (finding no abuse of discretion where court considered .fact that defendant had \u201cbetrayed the trust reflected in [prior] lenient sentences\u201d when sentencing defendant for violating conditions of his supervised release). The court also reasonably suggested that a sentence above the advisory Guidelines range was necessary in order to promote respect for the law and provide adequate deterrence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Given the totality of circumstances in this case, the district court\u2019s explanation, and the deference owed \u201cto the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance,\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, we conclude that Schroeder\u2019s 23 month sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
