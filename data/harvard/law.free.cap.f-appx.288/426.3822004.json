Simms. Student Doe challenges his emergency expulsion on both procedural and substantive due process grounds and seeks an expungement of the records related to this incident that are kept by the School District. The facts are known to the parties and are repeated here only as necessary. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The Due Process Clause provides that no State shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV. We find that the School District\u2019s emergency expulsion of Student Doe complied with the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 579, 95 S.Ct. 729, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975), to provide \u201csome kind of notice\u201d and \u201csome kind of hearing.\u201d A representative of the School District met with Student Doe and his mother the morning of Student Doe\u2019s expulsion and gave them oral notice of his exclusion pending a meeting with Superintendent Simms to discuss emergency expulsion. Later that evening, Superintendent Simms met with Student Doe and his parents for several hours to discuss the incident and her concerns. As the School District\u2019s de-cisionmaker, Superintendent Simms testified in her deposition that she did not formally make the decision to emergency expel Student Doe until near the end of this meeting. Accordingly, we find that Student Doe\u2019s procedural due process rights were not violated because he was provided with adequate notice and hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">Although students do not \u201cshed their constitutional rights ... at the school house gate,\u201d <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), the Supreme Court has stated that \u201cmaintaining security and order in the schools requires a certain degree of flexibility in school disciplinary procedures.... \u201d <em>New Jersey v. T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 340, 105 S.Ct. 733, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985). Superintendent Simms testified that she made the decision to emergency expel Student Doe based on her knowledge of Student Doe\u2019s assault on his sisters and her concern that Student Doe might be a threat to the school. We find that the School District\u2019s emergency expulsion of Student Doe was consistent with Washington Administrative Code \u00a7 392-400-295 and did not violate his substantive due process rights. <em>See LaVine v. Blaine Sch. Dist., </em>257 F.3d 981, 992 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that we must review \u201cwith deference, schools\u2019 decisions in connection with the safety of their students\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">Finally, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Student Doe\u2019s request to expunge his records from this incident. The School District has represented to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>court that the only records related to this incident are maintained in an internal, confidential file. This internal file is not part of Student Doe\u2019s permanent record and consists solely of two letters \u2014 the initial decision to emergency expel Student Doe and the reinstatement letter. Student Doe has not alleged, nor is there any evidence to indicate, that his internal file does not contain an accurate, contemporaneous record of his emergency expulsion. <em>See LaVine, </em>257 F.3d at 992. We also find it significant that the School District has represented to this court that Student Doe\u2019s emergency expulsion was rescinded under Washington Administrative Code \u00a7 392-400-295 and that the School District will shred Student Doe\u2019s internal file upon his graduation from high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b449-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
