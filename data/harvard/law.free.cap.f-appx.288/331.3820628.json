Further, because petitioner\u2019s conviction for a crime of domestic violence rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C), the BIA did not need to reach the issue of whether petitioner could establish good moral character or continuous physical presence for purposes of cancellation of removal. <em>Cf. Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 649, 653 (9th Cir.2004).
