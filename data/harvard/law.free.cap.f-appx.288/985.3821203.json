He argues that the district court clearly erred in determining the drug quantity attributed to him for sentencing purposes. Estrada contends that the district court erred in its conversion of the 223.3 grams of methamphetamine at 60% purity to the 133.92 grams of \u201cmethamphetamine (actual).\u201d According to Estrada, his base offense level should have been a level 28, using only the 223.3 grams of methamphetamine because there was no evidence that he knew the purity of the methamphetamine</p>\n<p id=\"alj-dedup-1\">Estrada stipulated in his plea agreement that the offense involved a net weight of 223.2 grams, with a purity of 60%, resulting in 133.92 grams of \u201cmethamphetamine (actual).\u201d Thus, the district court\u2019s finding as to the purity of the methamphetamine and its drug quantity determination as to \u201cmethamphetamine (actual)\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(4) was not clearly erroneous and was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir. 2005). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court lias determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
