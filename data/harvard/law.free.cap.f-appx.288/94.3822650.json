While he was provided with a clinical psychologist, Dr. Peter Sansbury, Parker asserts his condition required an additional expert who specialized in pharmacology and could investigate whether he \u201csuffered from psychosis from either the overdose or withdrawal from Paxil.\u201d Parker contends that regardless of Dr. Sansbury\u2019s competency in the field of psychology, he was unqualified to investigate Parker\u2019s specific claims, as they \u201cnecessarily involve[d] questions which are medical in character, not psychological.\u201d Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">An indigent criminal defendant has a constitutional right to the assistance of a psychiatrist once he \u201chas made a preliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense is likely to be a significant factor at trial.\u201d <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 74, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985). However, a defendant does not have a \u201cconstitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 83, 105 S.Ct. 1087. While an indigent defendant may request the district court to expend public funds for expert services to assist in the preparation of his defense, the defendant must demonstrate such services are necessary to an adequate defense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e)(l) (2000). A district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s request for funds to procure expert services is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hartsell, </em>127 F.3d 343, 349 (4th Cir.1997). \u201cTo show reversible error in a district court\u2019s refusal to appoint an expert [pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e) ], a defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s refusal was prejudicial to his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Perrera, </em>842 F.2d 73, 77 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Despite Parker\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a \u201cmedically trained psychiatrist,\u201d he has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s prior appointment of an admittedly competent psychologist was statutorily or constitutionally deficient. As this court has noted, \u201cthe decision in <em>Ake </em>reflects primarily a concern with ensuring a defendant access to <em>a psychiatrist or a psychologist, </em>not with guaranteeing a particular substantive result.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Greene, </em>155 F.3d 396, 401 (4th Cir.1998) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s provision of public funds for procurement of expert psychological services, and defense counsel\u2019s decision to retain Dr. Sansbury, did not violate Parker\u2019s due process rights, as there is no obligation under <em>Ake </em>that a defendant be provided with a psychiatrist rather than a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Furthermore, Parker has not demonstrated that an additional psychiatric expert was required under <em>Ake </em>or that his appointed psychologist was unqualified to evaluate his claims relating to Paxil. <em>See Page v. Lee, </em>337 F.3d 411, 417 (4th Cir. 2003) (petitioner failed to provide any evidence his appointed experts fell below the standard of competency). While Parker contends that Dr. Sansbury was simply unable to provide the expert services his case required, there is no evidence in the record to support this allegation. At the hearing on this matter, Parker repeatedly asserted that he needed a psychiatric expert with specific knowledge regarding Paxil; however, there was no evidence presented regarding Dr. Sansbury\u2019s lack of qualifications or inability to adequately address Parker\u2019s claims. <em>See id. </em>at 420 n. 5 (\u201cEven the simplest form of evidence, such as an affidavit on this point from either expert, from trial counsel, or from petitioner himself is absent from the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Parker offered little more than conclusory assertions that a specialized expert who \u201cknows about Paxil\u201d was needed, and he failed to demonstrate that the psychological assistance provided by Dr. Sansbury would be insufficient to prepare a defense regarding his sanity at the time of the offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320, 323 n. 1, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985) (no due process violation in denial of expert where petitioner \u201coffered little more than undeveloped assertions that the requested assistance would be beneficial\u201d); <em>see also Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 82-83, 105 S.Ct. 1087 (defendant must make \u201cthreshold showing\u201d for psychiatric expert). Dr. Sansbury was not called as a witness at trial, and there is no evidence or proffer in the record indicating what his testimony would have included in regard to Parker\u2019s mental state or his use of Paxil. Accordingly, because there is no evidence in the record demonstrating that Parker\u2019s appointed psychologist could not provide the assistance necessary to prepare an adequate defense, we find that Parker\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Even assuming the existence of evidence indicating that Dr. Sansbury was unquali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>fied to properly analyze Parker\u2019s pharmacological claims, Parker has still failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s refusal to appoint another expert was prejudicial to his defense, as his claims regarding Paxil were contradictory and unsupported by the testimony in this case. <em>See Perr-era, </em>842 F.2d at 77. At trial, Parker claimed he stopped taking his prescription a week before the robberies; however, this testimony contradicted Parker\u2019s earlier assertions made in his motion to suppress, where he claimed that his statements to police were involuntary because the officers supplied him with cigarettes and coffee despite knowing he was on both Paxil and Soma. Furthermore, the FBI agent in charge of Parker\u2019s interrogation testified that Parker stated, prior to his confession, that he was currently taking Paxil and that it would not affect his ability to understand his rights. Finally, Parker\u2019s ex-wife testified that she provided him with his medication every day, and that while she did not always see him take his daily Paxil pill, Parker never told her that he had stopped taking his prescription. Therefore, in light of the lack of evidentia-ry support for Parker\u2019s contentions regarding his use of Paxil, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for additional expert services.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Parker\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-12\">. Parker was also found guilty of two counts of bank robbery by force or violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon during the commission of a bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d); however, the district court arrested judgment on those counts in order to avoid duplicative sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-17\">. The Supreme Court noted that a defendant\u2019s constitutional right is limited to the provision of \u201cone competent psychiatrist.\u201d <em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 78-79, 105 S.Ct. 1087.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\">. Additionally, Parker's counsel contradicted almost all of his client's contentions, as he stated that Dr. Sansbury was a \"sufficient expert\u201d for the case and that \"asking for further experts would be frivolous and unwarranted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
