EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">After eighteen years of employment, Defendants-Appellees Sprint United Management Company and Sprint Corporation (collectively \u201cSprint\u201d) laid off Plaintiff-Appellant Stuart A. Goldstein as part of a reduction-in-force (\u201cRIF\u201d). Goldstein alleges that, in doing so, Sprint unlawfully terminated him (1) because of his age (48), (2) because Sprint regarded him as a person disabled from back problems, and (3) in retaliation for his making age discrimination complaints. The district court granted Sprint summary judgment on all three claims. Having jurisdiction to consider this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Goldstein as the non-moving party, <em>see Seegmiller v. LaVerkin City, </em>528 F.3d 762, 766 (10th Cir.2008), indicated the following: Goldstein began working for Sprint in 1984. During his eighteen-year tenure with Sprint, Goldstein held several marketing and advertising positions. In his last position, senior proposal manager in the business supply group, Goldstein was a first-line manager supervising up to ten other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">Until March 2002, Goldstein had always received positive performance reviews. On March 1, 2002, however, Randy Bry-son, who had supervised Goldstein during the final three months of 2001, gave Gold-stein a review indicating his performance had fallen below Sprint\u2019s expectations and required improvement. This evaluation placed Goldstein in the bottom 10% of Sprint employees and made him vulnerable to any reductions-in-force.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Goldstein protested this evaluation in writing to Bryson, Greg Corwin, Gold-stein\u2019s supervisor at that time, and a human resources (\u201cHR\u201d) employee, specifically wondering \u201cwhether this is age discrimination, personal discrimination, or the desire to unjustly identify me as a future RIF candidate.\u201d As a result of Goldstein\u2019s written objections, Bryson apologized for the review, admitted his behavior had been inappropriate and explained that Jed Dodd, Bryson\u2019s supervisor, had already reprimanded Bryson for the review he had given Goldstein. Dodd, too, apologized to Goldstein, and indicated to others that \u201cerrors in judgment were made by my management team.\u201d Based upon input from Gold-stein\u2019s previous supervisor, who had actually supervised Goldstein for most of the year under review, Bryson raised Goldstein\u2019s evaluation to indicate that he was meeting Sprint\u2019s expectations. Bry-son also assured Goldstein that his job was safe. Nevertheless, both Dodd and Bryson refused to change the evaluation to the extent it placed Goldstein in the lowest performing 10% of Sprint employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Less than a week after Goldstein\u2019s 2001 performance review had been revised, Goldstein\u2019s supervisor, Greg Corwin, \u201caccidentally\u201d sent Goldstein and others within Goldstein\u2019s work group what was supposed to be a confidential email from Corwin to Bryson. That email indicated that, out of the 120 Sprint employees in Bryson\u2019s department, only Goldstein would be let go during a proposed reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">When Goldstein confronted Bryson with this information, Bryson told Goldstein he had 90 to 120 days to find a new position within the company or he was \u201cgone.\u201d Goldstein again protested to Dodd and an HR employee that his being let go was the result of age discrimination and was in retaliation for the age discrimination complaint he had voiced several weeks earlier. Dodd again apologized to Goldstein and assured him that he was safe during the upcoming reduction-in-force. Dodd, however, reiterated that Goldstein\u2019s evaluation, placing him in the lowest 10% of Sprint employees, would not change \u201cbecause it is an accurate reflection of where management believes you fall relative to your peer group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In March or April 2002, Goldstein was assigned to another supervisor, Susan Od-neal. In May, Goldstein called in sick for two days when his back went out. Although Goldstein reported his absence to Bryson\u2019s executive assistant, Bryson nevertheless conferred with the HR department about terminating Goldstein because he had \u201cabandoned\u201d his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Goldstein\u2019s back problems stemmed from a ruptured disc. On his doctor\u2019s recommendation, Goldstein took short-term disability leave for several months, beginning in May 2002. During his disability leave, several of Goldstein\u2019s supervisors expressed skepticism about whether his back condition was really disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Goldstein\u2019s short-term disability leave expired November 17, 2002. When he did not return to work immediately, Gold-stein\u2019s supervisor Odneal and an HR employee called Goldstein to discuss his options, which included returning to work, taking long-term disability, or being terminated. Goldstein explained that his doctor had advised him to remain off work until January 3, 2003, but Goldstein agreed to return to work immediately in order to keep his job. When he did return to work, Goldstein was supervising only half the number of employees he had previously supervised.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In March 2003, Odneal gave Goldstein his 2002 performance review, ranking him quite low. Odneal specifically noted that Goldstein\u2019s \u201cinvolvement with the team was somewhat lacking. He experienced [short term disability] for half the year, missing much activity during the year.\u201d According to Goldstein, Odneal further explained to him that \u201cwe have to have a certain number of people in the various rankings and you\u2019re the lucky guy. You\u2019re it. You were the easy one because you were out on disability, so it\u2019s just how ... it shook out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">In July 2003, Goldstein began reporting to still another supervisor, Michael Gochis. In September or October 2003, Gochis gave Goldstein an \u201cinterim\u201d evaluation, indicating that Goldstein was meeting expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">In August and September 2003, Sprint underwent a major reorganization. This reorganization took place in several steps. First, Sprint vice-presidents and directors determined the new organizational structure the company would adopt. Then Sprint grouped its employees into pools designated for each newly created group within the chosen organizational structure. \u201cEssentially the pools were all employees who did the work that was going to reside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>in that specific [newly created] organization.\u201d All current Sprint employees were placed in a pool, even though the reorganization also contemplated a reduction-in-force. The vice presidents and directors then chose, from among the available employees within each pool, the people who would fill the positions within the new organizational groups. The reorganization ultimately involved five organizational levels: Layers 1 and 2 were the corporate officers; Layer 3 included the directors; Layer 4 was the first-line managers, such as Goldstein; and Layer 5 was the non-supervisory employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Goldstein and the five people he supervised were initially included in the pool for Sprint\u2019s new marketing division. At the last minute, however, Goldstein and his group were transferred into the new finance division and included in the pool of employees available for the finance department\u2019s \u201cpricing\u201d group supervised by Holly Valenta. Because Goldstein\u2019s group was not added to the finance pool until the last minute, however, Valenta had already chosen all of her Layer 4 managers and had received management\u2019s and the legal department\u2019s approval of those managers. Valenta, therefore, did not select Goldstein for any Layer 4 managerial position within her newly formed pricing group. Gold-stein was then placed on a list of candidates available for Layer 5, non-managerial positions, but he was not selected to fill any of those openings.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">There was also a redeployment list of employees displaced by this reorganization, from which supervisors and managers throughout the company could fill openings. But that list was circulated on October 24, 2003, and managers had to make selections from that list by October 27. Because Goldstein\u2019s group was not added to the finance pool until October 28 or 29, Goldstein\u2019s name was not on that list when it was circulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Those employees who had not been slotted for a position in the newly reorganized finance department could still look elsewhere throughout the company for other positions. Although Goldstein specifically sought several such positions, he was never chosen to fill any remaining job openings. Sprint, therefore, notified Goldstein in November 2003 that his employment would be terminated, effective December 31, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">The district court granted Sprint summary judgment on Goldstein\u2019s claims. This court reviews that summary judgment decision <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Goldstein. <em>See Seeg-miller, </em>528 F.3d at 766. Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">Goldstein alleged three claims: (1) age discrimination, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-34; 2) retaliation for engaging in activity protected under the ADEA; and 3) disability discrimination, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Goldstein seeks to prove these claims using indirect or circumstantial evidence. <em>See Montes v. Vail Clinic, Inc., </em>497 F.3d 1160, 1173 (10th Cir.2007). We, therefore, apply the three-part <em>McDonnell </em>Douglas<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> burden-shifting analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">[A] plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Once he or she does so, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. If the defendant satisfies its burden, the plaintiff must then show that the defendant\u2019s proffered justification was simply pretext for unlawful discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><em>Montes, </em>497 F.3d at 1173 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">A. Age discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The ADEA protects individuals who are \u201cat least 40 years of age,\u201d and makes it \u201cunlawful for an employer ... to discharge any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 623(a)(1), 631(a). To succeed on his ADEA claim, therefore, Goldstein \u201cmust prove that his ... discharge was motivated, at least in part, by age.\u201d <em>Hinds v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., </em>523 F.3d 1187, 1195 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">In order to establish a prima facie age discrimination claim in the context of a RIF, Goldstein must show that he \u201c(i) was within a protected age group, (ii) was doing satisfactory work, (iii) was discharged despite the adequacy of his ... work, and (iv) has <em>some </em>evidence the employer intended to discriminate against him ... in reaching its RIF decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Goldstein has established the first three elements: he was over forty at the time of the RIF, he was performing satisfactory work, and Sprint, nevertheless, discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"A9e\">To establish the fourth element, Gold-stein must show that, after the RIF, Sprint continued to employ younger employees in positions for which Goldstein was qualified. <em>See id. </em>at 1196; <em>see also Stone v. Autoliv ASP, Inc., </em>210 F.3d 1132, 1137-38 (10th Cir.2000). \u201cIt is the fact that the employer ... decided to retain similarly situated younger employees while discharging an older employee that gives rise to an inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>Hinds, </em>523 F.3d at 1196. The district court held that Goldstein had made this showing. On appeal, Sprint challenges that determination, asserting that Goldstein failed to present <em>any </em>evidence that it retained similarly situated younger workers instead of Goldstein. We do not need to resolve this issue, however, because even assuming that Goldstein did prove a prima facie case under the ADEA, he failed to establish a triable issue concerning pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Sprint asserted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for terminating Gold-stein: Valenta had already filled the managerial positions in her organization before Sprint transferred Goldstein and his group into the finance pool, and Goldstein did not have any finance experience, which Valen-ta\u2019s already-seated managers had. The burden, then, shifted back to Goldstein to show that Sprint\u2019s proffered reasons from terminating him were a pretext for discrimination. <em>See Montes, </em>497 F.3d at 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">\u201cPretext exists when an employer does not honestly represent its reasons for terminating an employee.\u201d <em>Miller v. Eby Realty Group LLC, </em>396 F.3d 1105, 1111 (10th Cir.2005). \u201cPretext can be shown by such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable fact-finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted nondiscriminatory reasons.\u201d <em>Riggs v. Air-Tran Airways, Inc., </em>497 F.3d 1108, 1118 (10th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">The factfinder\u2019s disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus rejection of the defendant\u2019s proffered reasons will <em>permit </em>the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\"><em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 147-48, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Goldstein asserts that Sprint\u2019s reasons for terminating him are unworthy of belief because Sprint actually gives two conflicting reasons why Valenta did not select him for a position in her pricing group \u2014 she had already filled all of her managerial positions before Goldstein was transferred into the finance pool and Goldstein was not as qualified to work in the finance division as the managers Valenta had already chosen. Because evidence that an employer gave inconsistent reasons justifying its challenged action is an \u201cindication of pretext,\u201d <em>Whittington v. Nordam Group Inc., </em>429 F.3d 986, 994 (10th Cir.2005), such a showing would ordinarily be enough to survive summary judgment, <em>see Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097. Nonetheless, \u201cthere will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a pri-ma facie case [of age discrimination] and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant\u2019s explanation, no rational fact-finder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.\u201d 530 U.S. at 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097; <em>see also Montes, </em>497 F.3d at 1173 n. 18.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors. Those include the strength of the plaintiffs prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer\u2019s explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer\u2019s ease and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-11\"><em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148-49, 120 S.Ct. 2097;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>see also Swackhammer v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., </em>493 F.3d 1160, 1169 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">In this case, the two explanations offered by Valenta are not necessarily inconsistent. That is, there is nothing inconsistent with Valenta\u2019s statement that she had already filled her openings and Lampe\u2019s statement that he did bring Goldstein\u2019s name to Valenta and Valenta determined that Goldstein was not more qualified than the people she had already selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">There is no dispute that Valenta had already named her managers at the time Goldstein was transferred into the finance pool, and that she had received upper management\u2019s approval to offer those employees the positions. In addition, there is no evidence that Valenta was aware of Gold-stein\u2019s age when she had the chance to, but did not, select him to fill one of her manager position. A reasonable factfinder could not infer age discrimination from this evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>dence. <em>See Swackhammer, </em>493 F.3d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In support of his pretext argument, Goldstein points to evidence indicating that Sprint did not transfer his group into the finance pool until the last minute and, as a result, his name was not included on the redeployment list circulated throughout the company. But, again, there is no evidence indicating that these events were the result of any discriminatory animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Finally, Goldstein relies on the fact that the district court noted that he had \u201ccome forward with evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that plaintiffs former supervisors,\u201d most notably Bryson and Odneal, \u201cdesired to terminate [Gold-stein\u2019s] employment and that they desired to do so based on [Goldstein\u2019s] age,\u201d among other reasons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But Goldstein fails to establish any link between Bryson\u2019s and Odneal\u2019s earlier conduct and Sprint\u2019s decision to terminate Goldstein\u2019s employment during the 2003 reorganization. In particular, there is no evidence indicating Bry-son or Odneal had any input into the decision to terminate Goldstein\u2019s employment during the 2003 RIF, or in the decision to transfer Goldstein\u2019s group at the last minute to the finance division; nor is there any evidence that the earlier performance reviews that Bryson and Odneal gave Goldstein factored into the RIF decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">For these reasons, we conclude the district court did not err in granting Sprint summary judgment on Goldstein\u2019s age discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">B. Retaliation under the ADEA</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The ADEA also makes it \u201cunlawful for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because said individual ... has opposed any practice made unlawful by this section, or because such individual ... has made a charge, testified, assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or litigation under\u201d the ADEA. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(d). In order to establish a prima facie case of such retaliation, Goldstein must show that: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>See Hinds, </em>523 F.3d at 1202. Goldstein satisfied the first two elements \u2014 he complained about age discrimination to his supervisors and the HR department. And Sprint terminated his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-13\">Nevertheless, Goldstein failed to establish the third element, a causal connection between the protected activity and his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">A causal connection may be shown by evidence of circumstances that justify an inference of retaliatory motive, such as protected conduct closely followed by adverse action. Standing alone, temporal proximity between the protected activity and the retaliatory conduct must be very close in time. Otherwise, the plaintiff must offer additional evidence to establish causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\"><em>Haynes v. Level 3 Commc\u2019ns, LLC, </em>456 F.3d 1215, 1228 (10th Cir.2006) (citations, quotations omitted), cert <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1372, 167 L.Ed.2d 159 (2007). The temporal proximity between Goldstein\u2019s age discrimination complaints, occurring in March 2002, and Sprint\u2019s decision to terminate his employment, made approximately twenty months later in November 2003, was insufficient, by itself, to establish the requisite causal connection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number><em>See id. </em>(\u201cA seven-month period between protected activity and adverse action will not, by itself, establish causation.\u201d). This is true even if Goldstein\u2019s short-term disability leave, from May through November 2002, is not counted. <em>See Wells v. Colo. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 325 </em>F.3d 1205, 1217 (10th Cir.2003) (declining to consider time employee was on medical leave after complaining about her supervisor; noting there was no reason for supervisor to retaliate until the employee returned to work from medical leave). Goldstein returned to work in December 2002 and Sprint terminated him as part of the RIF almost a year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Goldstein argues that he has, nevertheless, shown a pattern of retaliatory conduct that ensued following his age discrimination complaints sufficient to establish a causal connection between those complaints and his later termination. This court has recognized that the \u201cclose temporal proximity usually necessary to support a retaliation claim \u201cmust not be read too restrictively where the pattern of retaliatory conduct begins ... soon after the filing of [a] complaint and only culminates later in actual discharge.\u201d <em>Marx v. Schnuck Mkts., Inc., </em>76 F.3d 324, 329 (10th Cir.1996) (addressing retaliation claim asserted under the Fair Labor Standards Act); <em>see also Piercy v. Maketa, </em>480 F.3d 1192, 1198-99 (10th Cir.2007). Nevertheless, the pattern of retaliatory conduct of which Goldstein complains stemmed from Bryson and Odneal. But Goldstein has presented no evidence linking these two former supervisors to the decision to terminate Goldstein during the 2003 RIF. <em>See Haynes, </em>456 F.3d at 1228-29 (rejecting asserted causal connection where there was no evidence linking supervisor\u2019s decision to place employee under a corrective action plan with employer\u2019s later decision to terminate that employee during a RIF); <em>cf. Metzler v. Fed. Home Loan Bank, </em>464 F.3d 1164, 1173-74 (10th Cir.2006) (rejecting assertion that there was a pattern of retaliation following protected activity because there was no evidence from which a fact finder could infer a retaliatory motive underlying the allegedly retaliatory acts). Therefore, the district court did not err in granting Sprint summary judgment on Goldstein\u2019s ADEA retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">C. Disability discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">To assert a prima facie disability discrimination claim under the ADA, Gold-stein must establish that he \u201c(1) is a disabled person as defined by the ADA; (2) is qualified, with or without accommodation, to perform the essential functions of the job held or desired; and (3) suffered discrimination by an employer or prospective employer because of that disability.\u201d <em>Justice v. Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co., </em>527 F.3d 1080, 1086 (10th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Assuming Goldstein established the first two elements of a prima facie case, he has failed to establish the third. Goldstein primarily relies on Bryson\u2019s and Odneal\u2019s conduct during and after Goldstein\u2019s short-term disability leave to establish that Sprint terminated him during the 2003 RIF because Sprint regarded him as disabled. But, again, Goldstein has asserted no evidence linking Bryson or Odneal to Sprint\u2019s decision to terminate Goldstein\u2019s employment. Nor is there any evidence that those involved in making the decision to terminate Goldstein regarded him as disabled. <em>See Rakity v. Dillon Cos., </em>302 F.3d 1152, 1163 (10th Cir.2002) (concluding plaintiff failed to establish a disability claim sufficient to survive summary judgment where, even if one of his supervisors did believe plaintiff was not capable of any lifting, that supervisor \u201cwas not responsible for making the decision to deny [plaintiffs] promotion request,\u201d which was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>subject of plaintiffs disability claim). Therefore, the district court did not err in granting Sprint summary judgment on this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision to grant Sprint summary judgment on all three of Goldstein\u2019s claims</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.
