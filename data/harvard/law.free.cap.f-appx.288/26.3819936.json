The issue on appeal is whether the determination that Runkey has sufficient residual functional capacity to work is supported by substantial evidence. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">I. <em>Background and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">Because the facts are well known to the parties, we will discuss them only briefly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">David Runkey applied for Supplementary Security Income payments on January 28, 2003. After his claim was denied, he requested a hearing, which was held before an Administrative Law Judge on December 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">A number of medical records were submitted as exhibits at the hearing. The ALJ determined that Runkey had rheumatoid arthritis, which is a \u201csevere\u201d impairment, but not one that meets the list of impairments set forth in the regulations, and that Runkey could not return to his past work. However, the ALJ found that Runkey had the following residual functional capacity: \u201csedentary level work involving no repetitive bending, no foot/pedal controls, and option to change position (sit/ stand) every 15 to 20 minutes.\u201d The ALJ concluded that Runkey had the residual functional capacity to perform work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy and therefore that Runkey was not under a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">In reaching his conclusion, the ALJ discussed the medical reports. The ALJ found that Runkey\u2019s testimony regarding the severity of his pain and total disability was not wholly credible because his testimony regarding pain was vague and his testimony regarding functional limitations was not supported by the contemporaneous medical evidence. The ALJ acknowledged the residual functional capacity assessment by Dr. Bass, one of Runkey\u2019s physicians, but declined to \u201cassign any weight\u201d to his opinion, stating, \u201che has provided no objective evidence to support his assessment and it is outweighed by the balance of the medical evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">On December 2, 2005, the Appeals Council denied Runkey\u2019s request to review the ALJ\u2019s decision. Runkey sought review in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision. Runkey timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">We have jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny a claimant\u2019s application for disability benefits. In so doing, we must determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence; we are bound by the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u201cSubstantial evidence has been defined as more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Reefer v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 376, 379 (3d Cir.2003) (internal quotations omitted). We review the whole record to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">To establish a disability under the Social Security Act, a claimant must show an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). A claimant is considered to be under a disability \u201conly if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In this case, the ALJ sufficiently explained his reasons for relying on and rejecting certain evidence, and substantial evidence supports his determination that Runkey is not under a disability. Medical evidence indicated that Runkey had the residual functional capacity to perform light, sedentary work. Even the most recent report from Dr. Bass, whom Runkey identified as his treating physician, described an adequate range of motion in a number of joints and indicated that new treatments were being considered. Furthermore, Runkey himself testified that he was able to go grocery shopping, cook, and volunteer at a food bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">In addition, the vocational expert testified as to a number of jobs that someone with limitations equivalent to Runkey\u2019s could perform. A vocational expert\u2019s testimony given in response to a hypothetical \u201cthat fairly set[s] forth every credible limitation established by the physical evidence\u201d may be relied upon as substantial evidence that a claimant is not disabled. <em>Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 431. While it is true, as Runkey points out, that the ALJ failed to include the limitations on climbing, kneeling, or crawling, the jobs identified by the vocational expert did not involve such activities. As such, we cannot say that the ALJ improperly relied on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony. The ALJ acknowledged those limitations in his opinion and ultimately concluded that Runkey is capable only of \u201csedentary level work involving no repetitive bending....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Runkey also faults the ALJ for discrediting his testimony about his pain and Dr. Bass\u2019s conclusions as to Runkey\u2019s residual functional capacity. However, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Runkey\u2019s testimony as to his pain and symptoms was not entirely credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
