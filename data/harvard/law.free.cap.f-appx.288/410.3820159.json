He contends that the district court erred in denying him a minor role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-23\">We review sentencing decisions for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2491, 171 L.Ed.2d 780 (2008). It is procedural error, and thus an abuse of discretion, for a district court to calculate the Sentencing Guidelines range incorrectly. <em>Id. </em>We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual determination whether a defendant is a minor participant in the criminal activity. <em>United States v. Santana, </em>276 Fed.Appx. 629 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-26\">Sierra-Quezada contends that he was a minor participant because he was a middleman who was involved in the distribution of two small quantities of metham<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>phetamine over a 14-month period, made only $50 for each transaction, and was not the supplier of the drugs. He argues that he did not initiate the transactions; rather, they were initiated by an informant, who was seeking a larger deal. As stated by the district court, Sierra-Quezada facilitated two hand-to-hand sales, and the record does not show that his will was overborne by the informant. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Sierra-Quezada was not substantially less culpable than other pai\u2019ticipants in the criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Flores-Payon, </em>942 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that defendant who attended negotiations and brought drugs to scene was not entitled to downward adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b432-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
