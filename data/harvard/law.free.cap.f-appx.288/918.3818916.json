He contends that (1) 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, a 12-month upward variance from the range provided by the United States Sentencing Commission Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d), was unreasonable, and (2) the district court erred by not providing advance notice that it intended to sentence him above the top of the Guidelines range. The second argument, as both Aguilar-Rodriguez and the Plaintiff-Appellee United States of America (\u201cthe government\u201d) recognize, was foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent at the time of briefing<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and is now foreclosed by the Supreme Court as well.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore limit our consideration to Aguilar-Rodriguez\u2019s first contention. Concluding that the district court committed procedural error by failing to explain adequately the reasons for the variance of sentence above the Guidelines range, we vacate the sentence, of which Aguilar-Rodriguez has already served approximately 12 months in custody,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and remand with instructions to the district court (with special cooperation from the government and the defense) to expedite resentencing, with our respectful but heartfelt request that the court consider a sentence of time served (plus any appropriate supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">Aguilar-Rodriguez, a citizen of Honduras, was indicted by the government on July 27, 2007, for illegal reentry after removal in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). According to the record on appeal, Aguilar-Rodriguez had been deported one time previously, from El Paso, Texas, in 2005, but otherwise has no criminal history of any kind. He pleaded guilty to the federal indictment on September 27, 2007, and was sentenced on December 19, 2007. A Pre-sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated a Guidelines sentence range of 0 to 6 months. Neither party objected to the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>At sentencing, the district judge recited the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) that he found relevant, highlighting \u00a7 3553(a)(1), \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense\u201d; \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d; and \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d The judge noted that \u201cthe instant offense represents at least this defendant\u2019s second illegal entry into this country. And when I say at least, I mean that I don\u2019t know how many other times he has entered this country illegally.\u201d After expressing the hope that the sentence to be imposed \u201cwill make the defendant think twice before illegally entering this country a third time and perhaps prevent others from illegally entering the country the first time,\u201d the district court sentenced Aguilar-Rodriguez to imprisonment for 18 months plus two years\u2019 supervised release after completion of his imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Counsel for Aguilar-Rodriguez vehemently objected to both the upward variance as unreasonable and the two-year term of supervised release. The district court later revised the term of supervised release from two years to one to conform with the maximum period of supervised release specified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(3). This timely appeal by Aguilar-Rodriguez followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for reasonableness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This reasonableness inquiry is the \u201cfamiliar abuse-of-discretion standard of review.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We shall not indulge in a presumption that a sentence is unreasonable simply because it falls outside the range of the Guidelines.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither shall we disturb a sentence simply because we \u201cmight reasonably ... conclude[] that a different sentence [is] appropriate.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our examination is limited to the \u201cspecific reasons provided by the District Court\u201d for its sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">\n<em>B. Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">The Supreme Court has structured our sentencing review as a two-step process. We are first to review the sentencing process for \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A district court is required to provide adequate justifications so that our review can be meaningful and sentencing is perceived as fair.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> An \u201cunusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence\u201d requires the district court to explain why its decision \u201cis appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">Only if we are satisfied with the district court\u2019s procedural compliance are we to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-diseretion standard.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A district court does not need to find \u201cextraordinary\u201d or \u201cexceptional\u201d circumstances to justify a non-Guidelines sentence, and we shall not develop, as a standard, a \u201crigid mathematical formula\u201d based on the percentage variance from the Guidelines.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do, however, require \u201ca district judge [to] give serious consideration to the extent of any departure from the Guidelines,\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and we do consider the extent of a variance when evaluating the sentence under the totality of the circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A non-Guidelines sentence requires the sentencing judge to \u201censure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201c[A] major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Aguilar-Rodriguez first contends that the district court committed procedural error in failing adequately to explain its variance from the Guidelines. We agree. Other than simply reciting the factors from \u00a7 3553(a), the district judge failed to furnish \u201csufficient justifications\u201d for imposing this \u201cunusually harsh\u201d sentence. The district judge did express some general hope that the defendant would not illegally reenter the United States again and that others would be deterred from entering illegally in the first place; but he failed to tie that hope to the particulars of this case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in a meaningful fashion. We conclude, therefore, that on the facts of this case, the barest application (merely invoking the defendant\u2019s name) of a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor to the defendant does not qualify as \u201cadequately explain [ing] the chosen sentence\u201d under <em>Gall.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Other possible explanations for this sentence do not appear in the record such that we would have to engage in what would be, at best, speculation to find them. In this respect, this case is different from <em>United States v. </em>Bonilla,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in which supporting factors could be discerned from the record.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">As we conclude that the district court committed procedural error in imposing sentence, it is unnecessary for us, at this juncture, to review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b943-18\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Aguilar-Rodriguez\u2019s 18-month sentence and REMAND the case with instructions that the district court expedite resentenc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>ing. Although we normally do not tread on a district court\u2019s broad discretion to set a particular sentence, here, in the interest of justice, we strongly recommend that the court consider a sentence of time served (plus appropriate supervised release, if any). The time served is already more than double the top of the applicable Guidelines range. Such a sentence would obviate the need subsequently to delve into the substantive reasonableness inquiry of <em>Gall </em>that is, at this juncture, premature. Given the time Aguilar-Rodriguez has already spent incarcerated, we are confident that both the district court and the Bureau of Prisons will comply with both the letter and the spirit of this judgment to ensure that the defendant receives its optimum benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b941-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The date selected, however, as the beginning of his time in official detention, whether June 23, 2007 (the date the defendant was taken into state custody), June 27, 2007 (the date of transfer to federal custody), December 19, 2007 (the date of sentencing), or January 17, 2008 (the date the defendant was delivered to begin serving his sentence), does not bear on our determination in this case as we do not conduct a substantive unreasonableness inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b942-5\">. <em>Gall v.
