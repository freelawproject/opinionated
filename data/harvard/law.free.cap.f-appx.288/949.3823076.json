(\u201cLCFP\u201d) and American Longshore Mutual Association, Ltd. (\u201cALMA\u201d) petition this court for review of the Benefits Review Board\u2019s decision affirming an administrative law judge\u2019s award of benefits to Respondent Larry Broussard. For the reasons set forth below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Larry Broussard injured his right hip, leg, elbow, and lower back on October 30, 2003, when he was struck by a forklift while working as a warehouse foreman. LCFP paid Broussard temporary total disability benefits from October 31, 2003 to May 26, 2005, at which time the company stopped making voluntary payments on the ground that a May 29, 2004 automobile accident involving Broussard constituted a supervening cause of his disability. Broussard filed for benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950 (\u201cLHWCA\u201d). The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that the May 2004 accident was not a supervening cause of Broussard\u2019s disability and awarded him benefits, including temporary total disability compensation and payment for all future reasonable medical care arising from his work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">The Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) affirmed the award. In their petition for review of the BRB\u2019s decision, LCFP and ALMA argue that the May 2004 accident was a supervening cause of Broussard\u2019s disability, that the BRB erred in affirming the ALJ\u2019s \u201cerroneous interpretation and application\u201d of the legal standard governing what constitutes a supervening cause relieving an employer of liability under the LHWCA, and that the BRB erred in finding that the ALJ\u2019s award was supported by substantial evidence. LCFP and ALMA also argue that under any standard, the increase in back pain Broussard experienced after the May 2004 automobile accident precluded the ALJ\u2019s finding that the accident was not a supervening cause of his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">We review the decision of the BRB <em>de novo. Sketoe v. Exxon Co., USA, </em>188 F.3d 596, 597 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cOur review of the [BRB\u2019s decision] is limited in scope to considering errors of law and making certain that the BRB adhered to its statutory standard of review of factual determinations, that is, whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and [are] consistent with the law.\u201d <em>Ortco Contractors, Inc. v. Charpentier, </em>332 F.3d 283, 287 (5th Cir.2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We may not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ, nor may we reweigh or reappraise the evidence; instead, we inquire whether there was substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s factual findings. <em>Louisiana Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. Bunol, </em>211 F.3d 294, 296 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence that a \u2018reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hall v. Consol. Employment Sys., Inc., </em>139 F.3d 1025, 1029 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988)). \u201cThe requirement of substantial evidence is less demanding than that of preponderance of the evidence, and the ALJ\u2019s decision need not constitute the sole inference that can be drawn from the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">\u201cGenerally, the idea of proximate cause, as applied in tort law, does not apply to the LHWCA.\u201d <em>Shell Offshore, Inc. v. Director, OWCP, </em>122 F.3d 312, 316 (5th Cir. 1997). \u201cWith only a few exceptions, the court\u2019s function is at an end once causation in fact has been established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One such exception arises \u201cwhen the claimed injury has a supervening, independent cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, LCFP and ALMA assert that Broussard\u2019s May 2004 automobile accident was a supervening cause of his disability that relieved them from further liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">As both the ALJ and the BRB recognized, and as we have previously observed, \u201csome tension\u201d exists between the standards of supervening causation articulated in <em>Voris v. Texas Employers Ins. Ass'n, </em>190 F.2d 929 (5th Cir.1951), and in <em>Mississippi Coast Marine, Inc. v. Bosarge, </em>637 F.2d 994, <em>modified on other grounds and reh'g denied, </em>657 F.2d 665 (5th Cir.1981). <em>See Bludworth Shipyard, Inc. v. Lira, </em>700 F.2d 1046, 1050-51 (5th Cir.1983) (recognizing \u201csome tension\u201d between the two cases). In <em>Voris, </em>a panel of this court held that a supervening cause is an \u201cinfluence[ ] originating entirely outside the employment\u201d that \u201coverpowered and nullified\u201d the causal effect of the employment on the claimant\u2019s injury. <em>Id. </em>at 934. In <em>Bosarge, </em>a subsequent panel stated, without discussing <em>Voris, </em>that \u201c[a] subsequent injury is compensable if it is the direct and natural result of a compensable primary injury, as long as the subsequent progression of the condition is not shown to have been worsened by an independent cause.\u201d <em>Bosarge, </em>637 F.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">Because \u201c[t]he rule in this Circuit is that only an <em>en banc </em>court can overrule or change what a previous panel has held,\u201d <em>Shell Offshore, </em>122 F.3d at 316, <em>Voris </em>controls to the extent it conflicts with <em>Bosarge </em>on the facts of this case. However, as in <em>\u25a0Shell Offshore, </em>\u201c[w]e need not decide which standard is the operative one and we affirm [Broussard\u2019s] award because the facts in this record do not meet either standard for supervening cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>During the hearing before the ALJ, Broussard submitted the deposition testimony of Dr. Michel Heard, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, that magnetic resonance imaging (\u201cMRI\u201d) scans taken before and after the May 2004 accident showed no objective worsening of Broussard\u2019s back injury. Likewise, Broussard submitted an October 21, 2005 report in which Dr. Mark McDonnell opined that Broussard\u2019s \u201clow back\u201d was not \u201csubstantially changed by the automobile accident.\u201d Broussard also testified that although a lumbar epidural steroid injection he received about a month before the automobile accident temporarily improved his condition, his back pain returned well before the accident occurred. The ALJ found Broussard to be a credible witness but did not credit the testimony of Dr. Walter Foster, LCFP\u2019s and ALMA\u2019s only witness at the hearing, because his opinion that Broussard\u2019s continuing disability was attributable to the automobile accident was premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the relevant facts\u2014 specifically, Dr. Foster erroneously believed that Dr. Heard had released Brous-sard for a functional capacity evaluation and a work hardening program before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">In light of this testimony, the BRB did not err in concluding that the record contains substantial evidence supporting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the May 2004 accident neither \u201coverpowered and nullified\u201d Broussard\u2019s workplace injury nor worsened his disability in a legally significant way. The fact that Broussard experienced additional back pain following the automobile accident does not change this result\u2014 as the BRB observed, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Brous-sard was \u201ctotally disabled before the [automobile accident] and in need of conservative treatment, and the same disability and treatment continued after the [accident].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">We DENY the petition for review of the Benefits Review Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
