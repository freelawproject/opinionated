We hold that Calhoun\u2019s sentence w7as not unreasonable, and therefore we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">In 1994, Calhoun pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts to a twenty-five-count indictment, including thirteen drug offenses and twelve unlawful-use-of-com-munieation-faeility offenses. Calhoun was sentenced to thirteen concurrent terms of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment on all drug counts, to be followed by concurrent supervised release terms of five years on five of the drug counts, and four years on eight of the drug counts. After being released from prison, Calhoun violated the terms of his supervised release. Jurisdiction was properly transferred to and accepted by the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The district court revoked Calhoun\u2019s supervised release, and sentenced him to thirteen consecutive terms of 2.3 months\u2019 imprisonment (thirty months total) and fifty-seven months\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">On appeal, Calhoun contends that his total sentence, including imprisonment and supervised release, was unreasonable because it overstated the seriousness of his supervised-release violations, and it failed to account for the \u201cpositive strides he had made.\u201d Calhoun also contends that the district court did not refer to any of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) when pronouncing his sentence. We will address in turn each of Calhoun\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">Before <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court would uphold a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release \u201c \u2018unless it [was] in violation of the law or plainly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 925 (5th Cir. 2001)). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court directed courts of appeals to \u201creview sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. Because Calhoun\u2019s sentence passes muster under either standard, we need not decide which standard of review governs sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release. <em>See Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">Calhoun first argues that his total prison sentence of thirty months is unreasonable. We disagree. Each of the thirteen 2.3-month sentences Calhoun received was below the advisory sentencing guidelines range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2006); U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.4 (2007). Moreover, the district court had authority to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment after it revoked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>concurrent terms of Calhoun\u2019s supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (2006); <em>Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 926-27. Accordingly, we hold that Calhoun\u2019s total sentence of thirty months\u2019 imprisonment was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Calhoun next challenges his sentence of fifty-seven months\u2019 supervised release. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1988), a district court may</p>\n<blockquote id=\"abc-dedup-0\">revoke a term of supervised release and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision, if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person violated a condition of supervised release.... <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">In <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000), the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1988) authorized district courts to reimpose supervised release. <em>Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 704, 713, 120 S.Ct. 1795.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the district court did not act unreasonably by revoking Calhoun\u2019s sentence and reimposing supervised release for a term of fifty-seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Finally, Calhoun argues that the district court failed to articulate expressly the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it imposed his sentence. After finding that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining the sentence to be imposed. <em>Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 929. We presume that \u201c \u2018district courts know the applicable law and apply it correctly,\u2019 \u201d and we believe that \u201c \u2018Congress never intended ... for sentencing to become a hyper-technical exercise devoid of common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 930 (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>138 F.3d 115, 119 (4th Cir.1998)). Thus, \u201c \u2018[implicit consideration of the \u00a7 3553[ (a) ] factors is sufficient.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Teran, </em>98 F.3d 831, 836 (5th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">After reviewing the sentencing transcript, we hold that the district court implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in sentencing Calhoun. The district court heard the well-articulated arguments of both Calhoun and the Government before imposing Calhoun\u2019s sentence. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d at 930. Specifically, the court heard arguments concerning Calhoun\u2019s criminal history, his prompt return to drug crime following his initial prison term, his lack of respect for the law, the availability of prison drug-abuse programs and how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>they could benefit Calhoun, and the need to adequately deter Calhoun from drug crime in the future. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3558(a). Operating under the presumption that the district court knows and correctly applies the law, and absent a contrary indication in the record, we find that the district court sufficiently considered and correctly applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in sentencing Calhoun.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">We conclude that Calhoun\u2019s total sentence of thirty months\u2019 imprisonment followed by fifty-seven months\u2019 supervised release was not unreasonable, and that the district court implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it imposed Calhoun\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b991-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-12\">. When the Massachusetts district court sentenced Calhoun, it reduced Calhoun's criminal history category from IV to II. Even if we assume Calhoun\u2019s criminal history category is category II, the guidelines recommend a term of imprisonment of four to ten months on each count. The lowest sentence in that range is greater than the 2.3-month sentence Calhoun received on each count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-7\">. The provision that now governs supervised release following revocation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (2006), requires that the reimposed term of supervised release \"not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation.\" \u00a7 3583(h). Calhoun's statute of conviction authorized a maximum of sixty months\u2019 supervised release. Calhoun contends that after sentencing him to a total of thirty months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court should have sentenced him to no more than thirty months' supervised release. The Government argues that because each individual count carried a prison term of only 2.3 months, the district court properly imposed fifty-seven months\u2019 supervised release. However, section 3583(h) \"applies only to cases in which [the] initial offense occurred after the effective date of [subsection (h) ], September 13, 1994.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 702, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). Where the initial offense occurred before September 13, 1994, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1988) governs. Calhoun pleaded guilty to all of his initial offenses on March 22, 1994. Accordingly, section 3583(e)(3) applies to the present case, and we need not decide which party properly calculated Calhoun's supervised release under \u00a7 3583(h). <em>See id. </em>at 702, 120 S.Ct. 1795.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b992-13\">. We have held it is not unconstitutional to apply <em>Johnson </em>retroactively. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 387, 390 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
