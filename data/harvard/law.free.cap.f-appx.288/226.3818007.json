Ogburn argues that the district court: (1) erred by denying his requested jury instruction; and (2) imposed an unreasonable sentence. Crutcher argues that the district court erred by: (1) admitting another co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea; (2) denying him counsel at a critical stage; (3) not suppressing wiretap evidence; (4) enhancing his sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841; and (5) enhancing his sentence for prior convictions in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. For the following reasons, we affirm Ogburn\u2019s and Crutcher\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-19\">This case involves a major cocaine distribution conspiracy led by Andrez Miranda and involving Ogburn, Crutcher and fifteen other named defendants. Although most of the defendants pled guilty, Ogburn and Crutcher both pled not guilty and proceeded to a jury trial. Ogburn was found guilty of: (1) conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; and (2) possession of 500 grams or more of cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Crutcher was found guilty of: (1) conspiracy to distribute marijuana and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>five grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; (2) three counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841; (4) possession of firearms in furtherance of drug trafficking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and (5) being a felon in possession of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The facts relating to Ogburn are as follows. At trial, the government provided testimony from Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agents and wiretap recordings detailing Ogburn\u2019s conversations with Miranda and evidence of Ogburn\u2019s multiple purchases of cocaine from Miranda.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Ogburn\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) recommended a base offense level of 26 based on the amount of cocaine attributable to him. But because Ogburn qualified as a career offender due to his two prior felony convictions for violent or drug offenses, the PSR recommended a base offense level of 37, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A). As a career offender, his criminal history category was deemed to be VI, resulting in a recommended sentence of 360 months to life. Ogburn objected to the PSR on a number of grounds, including the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court rejected Ogburn\u2019s arguments and adopted a Guidelines range of 360 months to life. It explained, however, that the career offender enhancement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not primarily intended \u201cto punish for the particular crime [of conviction] but to reflect the seriousness [of the defendant\u2019s risk of] recidivism.\u201d Concerned about the increase of 11 offense-levels (from 26 to 37) and the potential resulting disparity between Og-burn\u2019s sentence and that of other co-conspirators, the court found that \u201cthe enhancement ... has an extraordinary and unreasonable impact on [Ogburn\u2019s] guideline range.\u201d Because this impact \u201ctakes this case out of ... the heartland of cases[,]\u201d the district court determined that it \u201cjustifie[d] a downward departure of two offense levels.\u201d As a result, the district court determined that Ogburn\u2019s offense level should be 35, resulting in a Guidelines range of 292-365 months. The district court then imposed a sentence of 300 months. It went on to explain that in imposing this sentence (as well as Crutch-er\u2019s), it considered \u201cthe nature and circumstances of this offense, [the defendant\u2019s] involvement in the conspiracy, as well as the history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d It further noted that the sentence would \u201creflect seriousness for this offence, ... promote respect for the law, ... provide just punishment, ... afford adequate deterrence, ... protect the public from further crimes, ... [and] provide opportunities [for the defendants] to get drug treatment^] medical care[, a]nd educational opportunities.\u201d It also specifically noted that \u201cthe sentencing guidelines are not mandatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The facts relating to Crutcher are as follows. According to testimony at trial, Crutcher was first introduced to Miranda by Miguel Hernandez. Originally, Hernandez acted as a middle-man, purchasing cocaine from Miranda and then selling it to Crutcher. But Crutcher eventually began purchasing cocaine directly from Miranda and distributing it from a supply house. DEA wiretaps and surveillance eventually alerted agents to Crutcher\u2019s vehicle (a tan Suburban), which agents observed at the supply house.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Crutcher was arrested on October 27, 2003 while driving the tan Suburban. In his vehicle, arresting officers discovered a bag containing $164,705 in cash which Crutcher said he was taking to \u201c[Hernandez\u2019s] people.\u201d After a search warrant for Crutcher\u2019s house was executed, officers found two loaded handguns, a loaded shotgun, and an additional $23,300 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Following his arrest, Crutcher came to the DEA office in Nashville where he was interviewed by DEA Agent Marti Roberts. At trial, Roberts testified that after Crutcher was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he admitted that he intended to use the $164,705 to pay Hernandez for several kilograms of cocaine that Hernandez had provided Crutcher a few days earlier. Roberts further testified that Crutcher described purchasing cocaine from both Hernandez and Miranda and distributing the cocaine out of a supply house.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Prior to trial, Crutcher filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to suppress wiretap evidence and joined (along with Ogburn) another motion filed by other co-defendants to suppress the same evidence. Crutcher also filed a motion to suppress statements made to police following his arrest. After an evi-dentiary hearing on September 23, 2004, the district court denied each of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 notifying Crutcher that it would seek a sentence enhancement based on Crutcher\u2019s three previous felony drug convictions in Tennessee state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">At trial, co-defendants Adolpho Arrizon, Mickey Flinn, Wantaya Ford, Jaime Guzman, Ronald Petway, John Pillow, Brian Woodward, and Hernandez all testified as to their involvement with Miranda in the conspiracy. Seven of these co-defendants also testified as to their guilty pleas related to this conspiracy. Wiretap recordings and testimony from Hernandez, Arrizon, Agent Matt Bradford, and Roberts chronicled Crutcher\u2019s interactions with Miranda and his cocaine purchases from Hernandez and Miranda. Although Miranda did not testify, Roberts testified as to Miranda\u2019s guilty plea without objection. Following trial, a jury found Crutcher guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Crutcher\u2019s PSR calculated his recommended Guidelines range in three steps. First, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, the PSR grouped the conspiracy (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846) and possession with intent to distribute cocaine (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841) offenses. Based on the PSR\u2019s assumption that at least 50 but less than 150 kilograms of cocaine were attributable to Crutcher for these offenses, Crutcher\u2019s base offense level would have been 36 for the conspiracy and possession offenses under \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2). But because Crutcher\u2019s offense involved distribution of cocaine and possession of firearms in furtherance of a trafficking offense, Crutcher qualified as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1. Accordingly, the PSR recommended a base offense level of 37 for Crutcher\u2019s conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Second, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c), the felon in possession of firearms offense (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)) was grouped with the first set of offenses, using only the higher base offense level. Crutcher\u2019s offense level for the felon in possession of firearms offense was 33, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B), because he qualified as an \u201carmed career criminal\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Because the base offense level for the conspiracy/possession offenses (37) was greater than for his felon in possession charge (33), the PSR assigned Crutcher a base offense level of 37. Combining this with Crutch-er\u2019s criminal history category VI resulted in a Guidelines range of 360 months to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Third, Crutcher\u2019s possession of firearms in furtherance of trafficking offense (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)) was considered separately because it requires a consecutive term of imprisonment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, note 1. Pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(2)(A), adding the mandatory 60 month minimum penalty for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) offense to the 360 months to life Guidelines range resulted in a Guidelines range of 420 months to life plus 60 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Crutcher objected to the Guidelines range recommended by the PSR on a number of grounds. At the sentencing hearing, the district court first addressed the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) statutory enhancement. Section 841 includes various mandatory statutory enhancements if an offense occurs \u201cafter two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense have become final.... \u201d Specifically, it requires a mandatory life sentence for a defendant convicted of possessing 5 kilograms or more of cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). The government relied upon Crutcher\u2019s prior convictions in Tennessee state court for the following felony offenses: (1) possession of 300 grams or more of cocaine with intent to distribute, arising out of Crutcher\u2019s sale of cocaine to undercover agents on May 30, 1992; (2) conspiracy to sell 300 or more grams of cocaine, arising from events occurring between May 14-30, 1992; and (3) possession of marijuana on May 31, 1992, which constituted a felony due to Crutcher\u2019s pri- or possession convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Crutcher argued that these convictions should be treated as one offense such that the \u00a7 841(b) enhancement would not apply. The district court rejected this argument, concluding that Crutcher\u2019s prior state convictions were separate felony drag offenses such that the mandatory enhancement applied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">After hearing testimony regarding the amount of drugs attributable to Crutcher and a number of Crutcher\u2019s arguments, the district court adopted the Guidelines range of 420 months to life as recommended in the PSR. But based upon the \u00a7 841(b) mandatory statutory enhancement, the district court sentenced Crutch-er to a life-sentence with a 60-month consecutive sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Ogburn contends the district court: (1) erred by refusing to give his requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>jury instruction; and (2) imposed a procedurally unreasonable sentence. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">A district court\u2019s refusal to give a specific instruction is typically reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Fisher v. Ford Motor Co., </em>224 F.3d 570, 576 (6th Cir. 2000). Because Ogburn did not object to the proposed instructions, however, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Cleaves, </em>299 F.3d 564, 567 (6th Cir. 2002). To establish plain error, Ogburn must \u201cshow (1) error, (2) that was obvious or clear, (3) that affected [his] substantial rights and (4) that affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 386 (6th Cir.2008) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Ogburn argues that the district court should have given the jury his first proposed instruction: \u201cSingle acts, without more, are insufficient to link a defendant to a conspiracy.\u201d Ogburn contends that the district court should have given this instruction because a buyer-seller relationship alone does not establish the agreement necessary to prove membership in a conspiracy. Ogburn is correct that a defendant\u2019s involvement in a conspiracy requires awareness of the object of the conspiracy and voluntarily association with the conspiracy. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gibbs, </em>182 F.3d 408, 421-22 (6th Cir.1999). But a district court is not required to explicitly clarify the difference between a buyer-seller relationship and a conspiracy so long as it \u201chas given a complete instruction reciting all the elements of conspiracy and requirements for membership in a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Riggs v. United States, </em>209 F.3d 828, 833 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">To establish Ogburn\u2019s participation in the conspiracy, in addition to the amount of drugs involved (500 grams or more of cocaine), the government was required to prove \u201c(1) an agreement to violate drug laws, (2) knowledge and intent to join the conspiracy, and (3) participation in the conspiracy.\u201d <em>See United States v. Colon, </em>268 F.3d 367, 375 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The district court instructed the jury, in relevant part, that it would need to find that:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\"><em>First, </em>two or more persons reached an agreement or came to an understanding to knowingly and intentionally distribute or possess with intent to distribute controlled substances;</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\"><em>Second, </em>from on or about November 1, 2002, to on or about October 27, 2003, the defendants voluntarily and intentionally joined in the agreement or understanding; and</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\"><em>Third, </em>you find that the agreement or understanding involved a quantity of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana and 500 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">This jury instruction accurately stated the required elements for membership in the conspiracy. <em>See Riggs, </em>209 F.3d at 833. Therefore, the district court did not err, let alone plainly err, by refusing to give Ogburn\u2019s additional instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">Ogburn also argues that in imposing his sentence, the district court committed procedural errors by treating the Guidelines as mandatory and failing to fully consider the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We conclude that the district court committed no such errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-15\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>we review sentences for reasonableness. 543 U.S. 220, 260-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This review has both procedural and substantive components. <em>Gall v. United States </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As the Supreme Court recently explained, treating the Guidelines as mandatory or failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors would constitute \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Ogburn first contends that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory because it \u201cexplicitly determined a guideline range and sentenced with that range as a firm starting point.\u201d This argument is not well taken. The district court <em>was required to </em>properly calculate the Guidelines range, <em>id., </em>which as \u201c[t]he Supreme Court explained in <em>Gall </em>[is] <em>the \u2018starling \u25a0point and the initial benchmark </em>\u2019 for federal sentencing.\u201d <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>515 F.3d 556, 561 (6th Cir. 2008) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596). In this case, the district court explicitly noted that \u201cthe sentencing guidelines are not mandatory.\u201d Moreover, the district court exercised its discretion by sentencing Ogburn to 300 months\u2014 below the properly calculated Guidelines range of 360 months to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Ogburn also suggests that the district court impermissibly \u201capplied a rebuttable presumption\u201d that the Guidelines range provided an appropriate sentence. Og-burn is correct that a district court may not presume that the Guidelines range provides a \u201creasonable\u201d or appropriate sentence. <em>See United, States v. Wilms, </em>495 F.3d 277, 281 (6th Cir.2007). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court\u2019s obligation is to impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2) ].\u201d \u201cReasonableness is the <em>appellate </em>standard of review in judging whether a district court has accomplished its task.\u201d <em>United States v. Foreman, </em>436 F.3d 638, 644 n. 1 (6th Cir.2006). And this court\u2019s presumption that within-Guidelines sentences are substantively reasonable, <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006), is an <em>appellate </em>presumption. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">But the record does not indicate that the district court applied a rebuttable presumption that the Guidelines provided an appropriate sentence. <em>Compare Wilms, </em>495 F.3d at 281 (concluding sentence was unreasonable because district court explicitly required defendant to \u201covercome the presumption of reasonableness with respect to the sentencing guidelines\u201d). The fact that the district court ultimately imposed a below-Guidelines sentence strongly suggests that it did not presume that the Guidelines provided an appropriate sentence. Still, Ogburn suggests that \u201cit is conceivable, based on the district court\u2019s comments, that it would have sentenced [Ogburn] even lower, but for the guidelines.\u201d This may be true. But the Guidelines are one of the factors to be considered; the district court\u2019s consideration of them does not mean that the district court presumed that the Guidelines provided an appropriate sentence or treated the Guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">We also conclude that the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 which ultimately caused it to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>pose a below-Guidelines sentence. Overall, the district court noted that both Og-burn\u2019s and Crutcher\u2019s sentences were based upon a number of \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment, affording deterrence, and the need to protect the public from future crimes. With respect to Ogburn in particular, the district court noted the importance of providing him the opportunity to obtain treatment and education while incarcerated and its concern that the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement \u201cextraordinarily and unduly exaggerated\u201d his Guidelines range. It also considered the potential disparity between Ogburn\u2019s sentence and other members of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The district court did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory or fail to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, Og-burn\u2019s procedural reasonableness argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Crutcher argues that the district court erred by: (1) admitting another co-defendant\u2019s guilty plea; (2) denying him counsel at a critical stage; (3) not suppressing wiretap evidence; (4) enhancing his sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841; and (5) enhancing his sentence for prior convictions in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Crutcher first argues that the admission of a non-testifying alleged co-conspirator\u2019s (Miranda\u2019s) guilty plea violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness against him. Roberts testified that Miranda, the focus of the DEA\u2019s investigation, had pled guilty to the drug conspiracy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Generally, \u201cConfrontation Clause violations are subject to harmless error review.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Hurley, </em>397 F.3d 360, 363 (6th Cir.2005). But because Crutcher did not object to the introduction of Miranda\u2019s plea at trial, we review this claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>458 F.3d 513, 517 (6th Cir.2006). Again, to show plain error, Crutcher must \u201cshow (1) error, (2) that was obvious or clear, (3) that affected [his] substantial rights and (4) that affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 386 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">The Confrontation Clause requires that \u201ctestimonial\u201d out-of-court statements offered against the accused to prove the truth of the matter asserted only be admitted if the declarant is unavailable and the defendant has had an opportunity to cross-examine the defendant. <em>United States v. Cromer, </em>389 F.3d 662, 671 (6th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 61, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004)). The government does not contend that Miranda was unavailable or that Crutcher had a previous opportunity to cross-examine him. Therefore, it was constitutional error to admit Miranda\u2019s plea if the plea was (a) testimonial, and (b) offered for the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">We need not decide whether Miranda\u2019s plea was testimonial or offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Assuming both <em>arguendo, </em>Crutcher cannot show that his substantial rights were violated by the admission of Miranda\u2019s guilty plea. Given the overwhelming amount of testimony by other defendants in this case regarding the existence of a conspiracy and Miranda\u2019s leading role in it, Crutcher cannot seriously argue that jurors doubted either fact. And Hernandez, Arrizon, Bradford, and Roberts all tied Crutcher to Miranda and described Crutcher\u2019s own role in the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>spiracy. Because Crutcher cannot show that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had evidence of Miranda\u2019s plea not been admitted, he has not established that his substantial rights were violated by any potential error.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Crutcher next contends that he was \u201cdenied counsel at a critical stage\u201d \u2014 during the September 24, 2004 suppression hearing. But Crutcher does not allege that his counsel was absent from the suppression hearing. <em>Compare Bell v. Cone, 535 </em>U.S. 685, 695, 122 S.Ct. 1848, 152 L.Ed.2d 914 (2002) (\u201cA trial would be presumptively unfair ... where the accused is denied the <em>presence </em>of counsel at a critical stage ....\u201d) (emphasis added) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Instead, Crutcher argues that the district court should have honored his request (on the eve of the suppression hearing) to substitute David Cooper for Edward Kindall as his attorney. The district court denied this request along with Kindall\u2019s motion to withdraw, but allowed Cooper to participate in the suppression hearing. Although Crutcher had two attorneys present at the hearing, he contends that because of his \u201cbreakdown in communication\u201d with Kindall, the court should have allowed him to substitute counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">We review the denial of a motion to substitute counsel for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>376 F.3d 593, 606 (6th Cir.2004). In reviewing denial of a motion to substitute counsel, we consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">(1) the timeliness of the motion, (2) the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry into the matter, (3) the extent of the conflict between the attorney and client and whether it was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense, and (4) the balancing of these factors with the public\u2019s interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-10\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Mack, </em>258 F.3d 548, 556 (6th Cir.2001)). Weighing these factors, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. First, Crutcher submitted his request to substitute counsel on the eve of a suppression hearing involving eighteen defendants. <em>See Trujillo, </em>376 F.3d at 606-07 (noting untimeliness of motion to substitute submitted three days before trial). Second, after denying Kindall\u2019s motion and allowing Cooper to remain at the suppression hearing, the district court asked Crutcher his thoughts about this arrangement. Crutcher answered \u201c[i]t is f\u00edne.\u201d This exchange indicates that the district court adequately inquired into the matter. <em>See United States v. Sullivan, </em>431 F.3d 976, 980-81 (6th Cir.2005) (court\u2019s inquiry was adequate where a defendant informed the court that counsel could proceed). Third, any conflict between Crutcher and Kindall does not appear to have caused a \u201ctotal lack of communication preventing an adequate defense....\u201d <em>See Trujillo, </em>376 F.3d at 606. Instead, Crutcher merely had two attorneys present at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Crutcher next argues that the district court erred by not suppressing evidence from the wiretaps because the government did not show that such wiretaps were necessary. \u201cWhen reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Foster, </em>376 F.3d 577, 583 (6th Cir.2004). Regarding the issuance of warrants for electronic surveillance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518, \u201cgreat deference is normally paid to the determination of an issuing judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Giacalone, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>853 F.2d 470, 479 (6th Cir.1988) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe burden of production and persuasion rests on the person seeking to suppress evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>783 F.2d 648, 650 (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">A judge may issue a warrant for electronic surveillance if (1) \u201cnormal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous,\u201d and (2) an application includes a \u201ca full and complete statement\u201d to this effect. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3)(c), (l)(c). \u201cHowever, the government is not required to prove that every other conceivable method has been tried and failed or that all avenues of investigation have been exhausted.\u201d <em>Gia-calone, </em>853 F.2d at 480 (quoting <em>United States v. Alfano, </em>838 F.2d 158, 163 (6th Cir.1988)). Instead, \u201c[a]ll that is required is that the investigators give serious consideration to the non-wiretap techniques prior to applying for wiretap authority and that the court be informed of the reasons for the investigators\u2019 belief that such non-wiretap techniques have been or will likely be inadequate.\u201d <em>Alfano, </em>838 F.2d at 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The district court found that the government provided \u201cmultiple alternative means of investigation and explained why each failed to achieve all the objectives of the investigation, why each was unlikely to succeed if tried, or why such efforts threatened to alert the conspirators to the investigative efforts.\u201d It also noted that the government had submitted affidavits attesting to the inadequacy of using many other methods including physical surveillance, undercover agents, confidential informants, and traditional search warrants. The government asserted that these methods threatened to alert the conspirators to the investigative efforts or would fail to meet the full objectives of the investigation, which sought to identify other conspirators, dates, times, and locations of conspiracy activities. Crutcher does not argue that any of the district court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Instead, Crutcher argues that once the hub of the conspiracy (Miranda) was identified, \u201cthere was no proof that ... traditional methods could not have been utilized.\u201d But the government was not required to <em>prove </em>that traditional methods <em>could not have been utilized. </em>Instead, it only needed to provide reasons for its belief that traditional methods were likely to be inadequate. <em>Alfano, </em>838 F.2d at 163-64. Crutcher fails to explain how traditional methods that the government believed were inadequate for achieving the objectives of the investigation became adequate once the government learned (in part through electronic surveillance) that Miranda was the hub of the conspiracy. After Miranda was identified, the government still sought to identify additional members and activities of the conspiracy, and the affidavits still support the conclusion that traditional methods would be inadequate to achieve this objective. The district court did not err in , denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-12\">Crutcher next contends that the district court erred in sentencing him to life' imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 841 requires, in relevant part, that a defendant convicted of possessing 5 kilograms or more of cocaine be sentenced to life imprisonment if he commits this offense \u201cafter two or more prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>convictions for a felony drug offense have become final.... \u201d <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). Crutcher argues that the district court erred in applying this statutory provision because his prior drug offenses should have been treated together as one conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Because \u201cdetermining whether the conduct was a single occasion or multiple occasions presents a legal question concerning the interpretation of a statute, we review the district court\u2019s decision de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, 211 </em>F.3d 316, 319 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u201cLife sentences under \u00a7 841(b) are triggered by predicate criminal episodes that occur at distinct times.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>76 F.3d 685, 690 (6th Cir.1996) (citation and quotation marks omitted) (also finding it significant that defendant\u2019s prior felonies occurred at \u201cat different places, and with different people,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 691). Even where the timing of two convictions overlaps, \u201c[a]n episode is an incident that is part of a series, but forms a separate unit within the whole. Although related to the entire course of events, an episode is a punctuated occurrence with a limited duration.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>924 F.2d 1354, 1361 (6th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In this case, the district court properly applied \u00a7 841(b). The government relied upon three prior Tennessee state court\u2019 convictions for felony offenses: (1) possession of 300 grams or more of cocaine with intent to distribute, arising out of Crutch-er\u2019s sale of cocaine to undercover agents on May 30, 1992; (2) conspiracy to sell 300 or more grams of cocaine, arising from events occurring between May 14-30, 1992; and (3) possession of marijuana on May 31, 1992, which constituted a felony due to Crutcher\u2019s prior possession convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Although there was some overlap between the cocaine possession with intent to distribute and conspiracy convictions, the former seems to qualify as \u201can incident that is part of a series, but forms a separate unit within the whole [conspiracy].\u201d <em>See Hughes, </em>924 F.2d at 1361. Regardless, the marijuana possession conviction clearly arose from conduct occurring at a time (May 31) distinct from the conduct involved in the conspiracy (May 14-30) and cocaine possession (May 30) convictions and occurred in a distinct place (Crutcher\u2019s home). Accordingly, the marijuana possession conviction constituted a separate episode from the cocaine possession and conspiracy convictions. <em>See Anderson-, </em>76 F.3d at 690. Because the government established at least two \u2014 if not three \u2014 felony convictions, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 841(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Crutcher argues that enhancing his Guidelines range based on the fact of prior convictions not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated the Sixth Amendment. The Supreme Court has held that the fact of a prior conviction need not be submitted to a jury. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); see <em>also Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (noting that \u201c[arguably] <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was wrongly decided,\u201d but still holding that <em>\u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, </em>any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d) (emphasis added). Still, Crutcher argues that the prior conviction exception is no longer good law based on Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence in <em>Shepard v. United, States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 27-28, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>(Thomas, J., concurring) (noting that \u201ca majority of the Court now recognizes that <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>was wrongly decided[,]\u201d and that \u201cin an appropriate case, this Court should consider <em>Almendarez-Torres\u2019 </em>continuing viability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">But following <em>Shepard, </em>this court has held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>453 F.3d 777, 779 (6th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>440 F.3d 292, 298-99 &amp; n. 3 (6th Cir.2006) (rejecting argument that Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence renders <em>Almenda-rez-Torres </em>overruled because \u201cthe Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the Supreme Court] the prerogative of overruling its own decisions\u201d) (quoting <em>Tenet v. Doe, </em>544 U.S. 1, 10-11, 125 S.Ct. 1230, 161 L.Ed.2d 82 (2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the fact of Crutcher\u2019s prior convictions did not need to be submitted to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">6.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Crutcher has submitted a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief alleging a number of additional grounds upon which the district court erred. Because Crutcher was represented by counsel on appeal, we decline to address these claims. <em>See United States v. Howton, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 813, 819 (6th Cir. 2008) (\u201cWe decline to address these arguments because [the defendant] was represented by counsel in this matter.\u201d); <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>229 Fed.Appx. 362, 370 (6th Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]e do not ordinarily consider <em>pro se </em>claims brought by a defendant represented by counsel on appeal....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">. Although the judgment form provides that all three counts involved 500 grams or more of cocaine, the indictment, jury form, and PSR all provide that two of these offenses involved more than 500 grams of cocaine and that one involved more than 5 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\">. The district court referred to the \"851\u201d enhancement. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, the government was required to provide Crutcher notice that it would seek a sentence enhancement based on Crutcher\u2019s three previous felony drug convictions in Tennessee state court. The government clearly provided this notice. We presume that the district court was referring to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(A), which provides for a base offense level of 37 if the offense carries a statutory maximum of life imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\">. In addition, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, the district court concluded that Crutcher qualified as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) which, in turn, applies to a defendant that violates \u00a7 922(g) and has three previous violent felony convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b253-15\">. The life sentence was based on Crutcher\u2019s conspiracy and possession of greater than 5 kilograms of cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). The district court imposed concurrent 360 month sentences for the two possession of 500 grams or more offenses and the \u00a7 922(g) offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b255-9\">. Ogburn devotes a significant portion his brief to arguing that appellate proportionality review is incompatible with <em>Booker. </em>Indeed, our appellate review may not require extraordinary justifications for large variances or employ a \"rigid mathematical formula\u201d com-paling the strength of such a justification with the extent of a variance. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 595. But Ogburn fails to explain how our <em>appellate </em>standard of review influenced <em>the district court\u2019s </em>imposition of Ogburn\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\">. Although Crutcher refers to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, which provides the <em>notice </em>provision associated with \u00a7 841, we understand Crutch-er to be challenging the imposition of the life sentence rather than the notice he received that this enhancement would be sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
