McSwain\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2008), and the reasonableness of the sentence, but stating that there was no merit to the appeal. McSwain filed a pro se brief asserting that his sentence was enhanced based on an uncounselled juvenile conviction and requesting a reduction of his sentence based on a recent amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. Our review of the record discloses no reversible error; ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>cordingly, we affirm McSwain\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Initially, we note that McSwain\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 841 has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>58 F.3d 96, 99-100 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. D\u2019Anjou, </em>16 F.3d 604, 612 (4th Cir.1994). To the extent that McSwain seeks to have this court reconsider its decisions, \u201ca panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting en banc can do that.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 271-72 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Appellate courts review sentences imposed by district courts for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). When sentencing a defendant, a district court must: (1) properly calculate the guideline range; (2) treat the guidelines as advisory; (3) consider the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008); and (4) explain its reasons for selecting a sentence. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. We presume that a sentence within the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of rebuttable presumption of correctness of within guideline sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">The district court followed the necessary steps in sentencing McSwain, and we find no abuse of discretion in the 120-month sentence imposed. McSwain\u2019s challenge to the use of a juvenile conviction to enhance his sentence is meritless. McSwain was tried as an adult on that offense and he was represented by counsel. Accordingly, we affirm McSwain\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-17\">McSwain also seeks a reduction in his sentence pursuant to Amendment 706 to the sentencing guidelines, which lowered the base offense level for drug offenses involving crack cocaine. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2D1.1 (2007); USSG App. C. Amend. 706. It is for the district court to first assess whether and to what extent a criminal defendant\u2019s sentence may be affected by Amendment 706, either sua sponte or by motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008). <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367, 373 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-18\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm McSwain\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew his motion for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b913-14\"> The recent Supreme Court decision <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (holding that district court has discretion to find \"that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purpose, even in a mine run case\u201d), did not find \u00a7 841\u2019s penalty provisions unconstitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
