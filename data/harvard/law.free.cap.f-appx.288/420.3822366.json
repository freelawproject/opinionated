Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Li v. </em>Ashcroft, 378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), we conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not adequately supported. The IJ failed to address Singh\u2019s explanation for the discrepancy about whether he returned to the United States in May or July 2002. <em>See Rajinder Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1106 (9th Cir.2006). Moreover, the IJ did not discuss the full contents of Exhibit 3, which includes a doctor\u2019s letter containing the dates Singh claimed to be in an Indian hospital in 2001 and 2002. Because the adverse credibility finding is insufficiently supported, Singh was not required to provide further corroboration. <em>See id. </em>at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The IJ\u2019s alternative merits determination is not supported by substantial evidence because the IJ did not apply the presumption that internal relocation is unreasonable when the claimed persecutor is a government, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(3)(ii), or the relevant factors regarding whether relocation would be reasonable for Singh. <em>See Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1069-70 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">We therefore grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings, taking Singh\u2019s testimony as true, to determine whether Singh is eligible for relief. <em>See He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 604 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
