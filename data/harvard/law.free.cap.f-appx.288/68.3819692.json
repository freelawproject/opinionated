We affirm Davis\u2019 convictions, but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Davis objected to his sentence on the basis that the one hundred-to-one sentencing disparity between cocaine base and powder cocaine in \u00a7 841 violated his constitutional rights. While the Sentencing Commission has recently amended the federal sentencing Guidelines to reduce the disparity between cocaine base and powder cocaine in the Guidelines, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (2007) (Amendment 706); <em>USSG </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c) (Mar. 3, 2008), the statute has not been amended. The Supreme Court, in <em>Kimbrough, v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), held that under the advisory Guidelines, the sentencing court may conclude in a particular case that a sentence based on the one hundred-to-one disparity is too great, and may consequently impose a variance sentence below the Guideline. Notably, however, the Court did not find \u00a7 841\u2019s penalty provisions unconstitutional. We have repeatedly rejected challenges to the constitutionality of \u00a7 841. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fisher, 58 </em>F.3d 96, 99-100 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. D\u2019Anjou, </em>16 F.3d 604, 612 (4th Cir.1994). Thus, the district court did not violate Davis\u2019 constitutional rights when it sentenced him under \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Next, Davis challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. The district court did not have the benefit of <em>Kimbrough </em>when it determined Davis\u2019 sentence. To give the district court the opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough, </em>we conclude that resentencing is appropriate.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\"> We offer no criticism of the district court, which properly applied the relevant law at the time of sentencing. We express no view of the sentence to be imposed on Davis on remand, leaving that to the sound discretion of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
