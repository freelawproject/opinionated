Sanchez asserts: (1) the district court erred at sentencing in applying a two-level dangerous weapon enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); (2) the district court erred in applying a three-level manager or supervisor enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b); and (3) her total sentence of 324-months\u2019 imprisonment, which was at the lowest end of her Guidelines range, is procedurally or substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review each issue in turn, and affirm Sanchez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">We review a preserved objection to a district court\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) for clear error, and the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1245 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">A district court is instructed by the Guidelines to apply a two-level enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ment to a defendant\u2019s offense level if she possessed a firearm or other dangerous weapons in connection with a drug trafficking or possession offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). \u201cThe adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), comment, (n.3); <em>see also United States v. Audain, </em>254 F.3d 1286, 1289-90 (11th Cir.2001) (noting the government is not required to prove the firearm was used to facilitate the distribution of drugs, but only that the firearm was present during the drug-trafficking offense). \u201cThe government has the burden under \u00a7 2D1.1 to demonstrate the proximity of the firearm to the site of the charged offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Audain, </em>254 F.3d at 1289. \u201cIf the government is successful, the eviden-tiary burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that a connection between the weapon and the offense was \u2018clearly improbable.\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that, because it was \u201cmore likely probable that the firearm was ... used to protect the drugs,\u201d and Sanchez knew of the firearm, a two-level dangerous weapon enhancement was appropriate. Evidence showed law enforcement officials found a firearm in Sanchez\u2019s home, in close proximity to where they also discovered: (1) a digital scale with methamphetamine residue; (2) a small bag of cocaine; (3) two envelopes containing $1000 each, and a third envelope containing $700, all in $20 denominations; (4) two notebooks a Government witness opined contained \u201cdrug notes;\u201d and (5) sandwich bags, which, according to a Government witness, were used \u201cextensively\u201d by drug dealers to package narcotics. Sanchez, on the other hand, failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that a connection between the firearm and the drugs was clearly improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Moreover, in light of the evidence the firearm was found under the mattress of Sanchez\u2019s own bed, and a bullet for the gun was found in a bedroom dresser drawer, there was sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that Sanchez knew of the firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant was a manager or supervisor for enhancement purposes under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir.2005). Under the Guidelines, a defendant\u2019s offense level is to be increased by three-points if she \u201cwas a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SBl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The evidence established there were at least five members of the conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine \u2014 Sanchez, Victor Ponce, William Stokes, Jr., Phillip Presley, and Jackie Hazelwood, among others, and many of them testified at trial as cooperating witnesses and admitted culpability in the conspiracy or to committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>drug related offenses. Evidence also showed: (1) Sanchez possessed, in her home, drug paraphernalia, drug notes, and a large amount of cash in small denominations; (2) she purchased much of the methamphetamine and distributed it to the other co-conspirators, who then sold the drugs and collected the proceeds; and (3) she monitored the status of larger transactions, including one by Ponce to Steven Huffman during the controlled buy. On this record, the district court did not clearly err in finding that a three-level manager or supervisor enhancement was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we ordinarily review sentences for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court recently clarified reasonableness review is synonymous with the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, in this case, Sanchez never raised a reasonableness objection below. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether her omission in this regard dictates the plain error standard of review should apply, however, since Sanchez\u2019s reasonableness claim fails under any standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">In imposing a sentence, a district court first must correctly calculate a defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range, and then must consider all of the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to arrive at an appropriate sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. These factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (5) pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After deciding on the appropriate sentence, the district court must sufficiently explain the chosen sentence to permit meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">Appellate review of a sentence imposed is two-fold. First, we must ensure the district court committed no significant procedural error. <em>Id. </em>Second, we must ensure the sentence imposed by the district court was substantively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>A sentencing decision is procedurally sound if the district court correctly calculated the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence that was not based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">A sentencing decision is substantively reasonable if the district court acted within its discretion in determining the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 600. A \u201cdistrict court need only \u2018acknowledge\u2019 that it \u2018considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors[,]\u2019 and need not discuss each of these factors in either the sentencing hearing or in the sentencing order[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>grounds by Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). \u201c \u2018[I]t is not the role of an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the sentencing court as to the appropriateness of a particular sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>187 F.3d 1316, 1323 (11th Cir.1999) (alteration in original). Thus, we will reverse a procedurally proper sentence only \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Sanchez\u2019s total sentence is procedurally sound. We have already concluded the enhancements applied were done so appropriately. Accordingly, the district court correctly calculated Sanchez\u2019s adjusted offense level and her criminal history category, and accurately calculated her applicable sentencing range based on these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">In addition, the court considered Sanchez\u2019s arguments and evidence as to a reasonable total sentence, acknowledged the Guidelines were advisory, and reasoned that a total sentence at the low end of Sanchez\u2019s applicable Guidelines range was appropriate in light of the facts and circumstances of the case and the statutory purposes of sentencing. The court\u2019s explanation of its reasons was sufficient. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (stating a lengthy explanation is not necessarily required when a court imposes a sentence within the defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range, particularly where it has listened to the arguments of the parties and considered the parties\u2019 supporting evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">Sanchez\u2019s total sentence is substantively reasonable as well. First, the district court imposed the 324-month total sentence only after listening to and considering the parties\u2019 evidence and arguments as to a reasonable sentence. Second, the court noted it considered the statutory purposes of sentencing, and specifically listed at least three of those factors. Although the court did not mention explicitly every \u00a7 3553(a) factor, it was not required to do so, and \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>See Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363. Finally, Sanchez\u2019s sentences of 324-months\u2019 (or 27 years) imprisonment on each of the three counts of conviction, to run concurrently, was at the lowest end of her Guidelines range, and was significantly less than the statutory m\u00e1ximums, of life imprisonment on Counts One and Three, and the statutory maximum of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment on Count Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">Thus, Sanchez\u2019s total sentence of 324-months\u2019 imprisonment is procedurally sound and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-11\">. Sanchez also asserts the district court erred in applying a two-level obstruction of justice enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1103 (11th Cir.1990) <em>(ioveiruled on other grounds by United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136, 1137 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc)), in which this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-12\">Where the district court has offered the opportunity to object and a party is silent or fails to state the grounds for objection, objections to the sentence will be waived for purposes of appeal, and this court will not entertain an appeal based upon such objections unless refusal to do so would result in manifest injustice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-17\">Sanchez waived this claim by failing to object in writing to the obstruction of justice recommendation in the second amended PSI and by failing to object orally to the recommendation at sentencing, even though she was given multiple opportunities to do so. Before concluding the sentencing hearing, the district court elicited objections from both Sanchez and the Government. Because Sanchez failed to raise this objection at sentencing, it is deemed waived. Finding no manifest injustice, we decline to consider this argument for the first time on appeal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-6\">. To the extent Sanchez relies on <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218 (11th Cir. 2006), her reliance is misplaced. In <em>Stallings, </em>we vacated a district court's application of a dangerous weapon enhancement under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) since the government failed to provide any evidence the firearms found in the defendant's home \u2014 where no activities related to the drug conspiracy took place \u2014 belonged to the defendant or were somehow connected to the conspiracy. <em>Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1220-21. By contrast, in this case, the Government established the firearm was found under the mattress of Sanchez\u2019s bed, and that drug related activities occurred inside her house.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
