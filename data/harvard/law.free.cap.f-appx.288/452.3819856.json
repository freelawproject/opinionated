On March 31, 2006, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) affirmed his conviction. Mr. Troutt attempted to obtain state post-conviction relief, but his application was stricken for failure to follow local rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Proceeding pro se, Mr. Troutt filed a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, raising thirteen grounds for relief. He first claimed that the striking of his state application for post-conviction relief violated his due process and equal protection rights. His remaining claims alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel with respect to the pretrial investigation, trial, and sentence. The magistrate judge issued a detailed 16-page report and recommendation concluding that Mr. Troutt\u2019s first claim should be dismissed for failure to state a cognizable claim for habeas relief, that the remaining claims should be summarily dismissed as time-barred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) or, alternatively, for failure to exhaust state remedies, and that his pending motions should be denied. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, dismissed the ha-beas petition, and denied the pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Mr. Troutt now seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). With respect to the first claim, which the district court rejected on the merits, we may issue a COA only if Mr. Troutt makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2), such that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). With respect to his remaining claims, which were dismissed on procedural grounds, we may issue a COA only if he makes a substantial showing that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based upon our independent review of the record, and for substantially the same reasons given by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district court, we conclude that no reasonable jurist could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Mr. Troutt raises four additional arguments on appeal, one of which claims that his habeas petition is not time-barred because the limitations period inns from when the state court mandate was issued, not from when the state court\u2019s judgment was entered. However, for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), a conviction is final when, \u201cfollowing a decision by the state court of last resort ... the United States Supreme Court has denied review, or, if no petition for certiorari is filed, after the time for filing a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court has passed.\u201d <em>Locke v. Saffle, </em>237 F.3d 1269, 1273 (10th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The time for filing a petition with the Supreme Court is 90 days after entry of the state court judgment, <em>see </em>Sup.Ct. R. 13(1), which runs from the date of the entiy of the judgment, not from the issuance date of the mandate, <em>see </em>Sup.Ct. R. 13(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Mi-. Troutt also argues his petition is timely because \u201cthe time was tolled during all proceedings.\u201d The only \u201cproceeding\u201d that could have tolled the limitations period was Mr. Troutt\u2019s state post-conviction proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). However, as the magistrate judge and district court properly concluded, that time cannot be tolled here because the state court determined that Mr. Troutt\u2019s post-conviction application was not \u201cproperly filed.\u201d <em>Id.) see Burger v. Scott, </em>317 F.3d 1133, 1139 (10th Cir.2003) (explaining that we look to state procedural law to determine whether state petition is \u201cproperly filed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Mr. Troutt\u2019s remaining claims, at best, amount to due-process challenges to Oklahoma\u2019s post-conviction procedures and therefore do not state constitutional claims cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding. <em>United States v. Dago, </em>441 F.3d 1238, 1248 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Petitioner\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED. Petitioner\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. Petitioner is relieved of any obligation to pay the appellate filing and docketing fees as the district court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1) does not apply to habeas proceedings. <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 811 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
