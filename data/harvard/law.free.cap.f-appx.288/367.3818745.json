He drove his brother, Somchit Nasrichampang (\u201cSomchit\u201d), to the scene of the crime, where Somchit got out of the car and twice shot the victim. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Somphone\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Souk Douangmala (\u201cSouk\u201d), another passenger in Somphone\u2019s car, pled guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for his cooperation. The California Court of Appeal reasonably determined that Souk\u2019s testimony at Somphone\u2019s trial was not coerced. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Even assuming that his pretrial statements were coercively obtained, the plea agreement required only that he tell the truth on the witness stand. \u201cAn agreement that requires a witness to testify truthfully ... is proper so long as \u2018the jury is informed of the exact nature of the agreement, defense counsel is permitted to cross-examine the accomplice about the agreement, and the jury is instructed to weigh the accomplice\u2019s testimony with care.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allen v. Woodford, </em>395 F.3d 979, 995 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Yarbrough, </em>852 F.2d 1522, 1537 (9th Cir.1988)). This is so even when the agreement leaves sentencing open until after the testimony is given. <em>See Yarbrough, </em>852 F.2d at 1537. There is no violation of due process when a witness who previously was illegally interrogated is \u201csubject to cross-examination at trial through which the jury could assess the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Williams v. Woodford, </em>384 F.3d 567, 596 (9th Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Mattison, </em>437 F.2d 84, 85 (9th Cir.1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The California Court of Appeal reasonably concluded that any failings by Somphone\u2019s trial counsel were not prejudicial. Presentation of Somphone\u2019s proposed defense \u2014 that he intended to help Somchit fight the victim, but did not know that Somchit planned to shoot him \u2014 would not have had a reasonable probability of securing acquittal. <em>See Wilson v. Henry, </em>185 F.3d 986, 988 (9th Cir.1999). As an aider and abetter, Somphone would be guilty of any offense that is a \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of the assault he intended. <em>People v. Prettyman, </em>14 Cal.4th 248, 261, 58 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 926 P.2d 1013 (1996). Souk testified that Somehit\u2019s gun was plainly visible in the car on their way to locate the victim, giving Somphone \u201creason to believe that [Somehit] would use a deadly weapon\u201d to commit the assault. <em>See id. </em>at 267, 58 Cal.Rptr.2d 827, 926 P.2d 1013. Souk was thoroughly cross-examined on this point at trial, and we do not second-guess issues of credibility. <em>See Sandoval v. Calderon, </em>241 F.3d 765, 773 (9th Cir.2000). Neither counsel\u2019s failure to argue for severance, <em>see id. </em>at 772, nor her inartful references to liability and a voice stress analyzer, <em>see Hovey v. Ayers, </em>458 F.3d 892, 907 (9th Cir.2006), undermine confidence in the trial\u2019s outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
