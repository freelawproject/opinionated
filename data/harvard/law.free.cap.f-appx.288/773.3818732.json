D\u2019Angelo denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Chand, </em>No. A 70 647 421 (B.I.A. Mar. 22, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 70 647 421 (Immig. Ct. Hartford Aug. 31, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">When \u201cthe BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions \u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based on the IJ\u2019s assessment of Chand\u2019s demeanor and multiple inconsistencies. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73 &amp; n. 7. Chand does not challenge the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding and does not assert that the inconsistencies do not exist in the record. Rather, Chand argues generally that the inconsistencies were not central to his claim. However, contrary to Chand\u2019s assertion, the inconsistencies identified by the IJ involve central elements of his claim \u2014 whether he had previously been detained by police for political activity, whether he was threatened by members of the All India Sikh Student Federation, whether he went into hiding to avoid the police because his name was disclosed concerning anti-government activity, and whether his father was arrested when the police came looking for him. Chand\u2019s proffered explanations \u2014 that he was nervous, had a lot on his mind, and that his son made an error preparing his wife\u2019s affidavit \u2014 would not compel a reasonable factfinder to credit them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Although Chand argues that the IJ failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>to evaluate evidence supporting his claim, he fails to identify any material evidence in the record that the IJ overlooked. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e presume that an IJ has taken into account all of the evidence before him, unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Additionally, Chand points to no evidence supporting his claim that his inability to understand English explains the discrepancies. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d at 80-81. Indeed, Chand testified through a Punjabi translator at his merits hearing, submitted an affidavit correcting the asserted language errors in his asylum application, and was given the opportunity to amend his asylum application before he signed an affirmation indicating that everything within it was correct. Moreover, he testified that he read and understood everything in his wife\u2019s affidavit before he submitted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, the IJ properly denied Chand\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal where the only evidence that Chand would be persecuted depended on his credibility. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005). Because Chand failed to sufficiently challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim before this Court, we deem any such challenge waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Chand\u2019s motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
