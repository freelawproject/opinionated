Michael Seabright, United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b367-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-22\">Prudential Insurance Company of America (\u201cPrudential\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Jim Younkin in Younkin\u2019s suit for benefits and penalties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d). Prudential also appeals a portion of the district court\u2019s order awarding Younkin attorneys\u2019 fees. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-23\">The district court erred by holding that Prudential was liable for penalties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(c). We have held that only a \u201cplan administrator\u201d can be liable for penalties under that section. <em>See Sgro v. Danone Waters of N. Am., Inc., </em>532 F.3d 940, 944-46 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Moran v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>872 F.2d 296, 299-300 (9th Cir.1989). Here, the ERISA plan at issue named Washington Corporations \u2014 not Prudential \u2014 as the \u201cplan administrator.\u201d The fact that Prudential makes benefit determinations does not change this analysis. <em>Sgro, </em>532 F.3d at 945-46. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Younkin\u2019s favor as to this issue and vacate the district court\u2019s order requiring Prudential to pay penalties under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Younkin\u2019s successful claim for ERISA benefits was not \u201cdistinct in all respects\u201d from his unsuccessful claim for penalties, such that the district court should have excluded the time spent on the penalties claim when determining the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 440, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (holding that \u201c[w]here the plaintiff has failed to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee\u201d). Both of Younkin\u2019s claims arose from the same core set of facts \u2014 Prudential's August 1, 2002 amendment of the ERISA plan and Prudential\u2019s subsequent interpretation of that amendment. Additionally, some of the work performed in connection with Younkin\u2019s penalties claim likely aided the work done on his benefits claim because Younkin was unable to assert his benefits claim until he obtained the 2002 version of the ERISA plan. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Schwarz v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>73 F.3d 895, 903 (9th Cir.1995) stating that the pertinent question in determining whether claims are related for purposes of recovering attorneys\u2019 fees under <em>Hensley </em>is whether the \u201c[unsuccessful claim] arises from the same core of facts as the [successful claim] and [whether] it is likely that some of the work performed in connection with the [unsuccessful claim] also aided the work done on the merits of the [successful claim]\u201d (brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b367-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
