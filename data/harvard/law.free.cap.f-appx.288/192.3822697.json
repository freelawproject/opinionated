United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), have abrogated previous Fifth Circuit decisions by broadening the district court\u2019s discretion to impose a nonguidelines sentence. He argues, therefore, that the sentencing court labored under a misconception that it could not sentence him below the advisory <em>J </em>guidelines range in the absence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d or based on the court\u2019s disagreement Math guidelines 1C^\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A38\">We review for plain error because Camacho did not argue in the district court that this court\u2019s precedent was unduly restrictive. <em>See United States v. Campos\u2014 Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2959, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2008). Nothing in the record suggests that the district court was constrained by this court\u2019s precedent from considering any of Camachos arguments for a nonguidelines sentence. Accordingly<em>, </em>there was no plain error. See <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"apb-dedup-0\"><em>n </em>, i , 1,1,1- , Camacho also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because there is no empirical support for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the Guideline mandating the COV increase. He did not challenge the empirical basis of \u00a7 2L1.2 in the district court, so his contention is reviewed for plain error. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Nothing in the record suggests that the district court believed that it was precluded by circuit precedent from imposing a lesser sentence in the face of \u00a7 2L1.2. Moreover, <em>pre-Gall </em>precedent did not prevent a district court from giving a lower sentence than advised by \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See id.; United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 557 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"aqt-dedup-0\">Camacho shows no plain error. The district eourt&gt;s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AWV\"> Pursuant to 5TH Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
