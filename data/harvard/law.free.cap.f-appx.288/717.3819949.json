Nov. 21, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 377 699 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 23, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-21\">As an initial matter, although Laca is challenging the denial of relief in \u201casylum-only\u201d proceedings, as opposed to an actual removal order, we nevertheless have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) because the denial of relief in these circumstances is the functional equivalent of a removal order. <em>See Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir.2006). Where, as here, the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cas if it were that of the BIA.\u201d <em>Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Coro-vic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir. 2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>We find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that conditions in Albania have fundamentally changed such that Laca does not have a well-founded fear of persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). We have held that where \u201cchanged conditions evidently prevail in a country that is the subject of an appreciable proportion of asylum claims,\u201d the agency \u201cneed not enter specific findings premised on record evidence\u201d when making its changed country conditions finding. <em>Hox-hallan v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 187 (2d Cir.2006)(affirming the agency\u2019s finding that an applicant was ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal based on material political changes in Albania).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Here, the IJ and BIA properly relied on background evidence in the record to find that the government met its burden of showing that conditions in Albania had fundamentally changed such that Laca does not have a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See id. </em>Under these circumstances, the agency properly denied Laca\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 187; <em>see also Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Finally, because Laca failed to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his application for CAT relief, we decline to review that denial. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
