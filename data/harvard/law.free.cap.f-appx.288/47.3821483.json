The District Court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 1915A(b)(l). We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The parties are familiar with the facts and thus we will only briefly summarize them here. Calhoun, who was incarcerated at the Monmouth County Correctional Institution in Freehold, New Jersey, when he filed this suit, alleges that Kevin Young, Assistant Deputy Public Defender of Ocean County, New Jersey, violated his rights by discontinuing his representation after Calhoun refused to plead guilty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Calhoun further alleges that Francisco Gonzalez, Deputy Public Defender of Ocean County, New Jersey, and Yvonne Smith Segars, Public Defender of New Jersey, violated his constitutional rights by not taking corrective action against Young, and conspiring to deprive indigent criminal defendants of them constitutional rights by securing their convictions through guilty pleas. Calhoun also contends that the State of New Jersey violated his constitutional rights by \u201cattempting\u201d to charge him approximately $1,500 in expenses for his court-appointed counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">For these putative constitutional violations, Calhoun seeks monetary damages and an injunction against the State of New Jersey to stop it \u201cfrom charging indigent criminal defendants for court appointed counsel.\u201d Calhoun also sought class action status for all criminal defendants suffering losses of their constitutional rights due to the actions of defendants. The District Court dismissed Calhoun\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and 1915A(b)(l). Calhoun timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">In order to establish a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 civil rights claim, a claimant must show: \u201c(1) that the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) that the conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Robb v. City of Philadelphia, </em>733 F.2d 286, 290-91 (3d Cir.1984) (citing <em>Parrott v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 535, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981)). Accordingly, Calhoun\u2019s claims against Young regarding his ineffective representation were properly dismissed because it is well established that a public defender performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant is not acting under color of state law. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>ther, to the extent Calhoun is attempting to hold Gonzalez and Segars liable for Young\u2019s actions on a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory, he failed to present a federal claim. <em>See Polk, </em>454 U.S. at 325, 102 S.Ct. 445 (\u201cSection 1983 will not support a claim based on a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory of liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Calhoun\u2019s claims regarding an alleged conspiracy between Young and the other two defendants were also properly dismissed because \u2014 even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Gonzalez and Segars could be considered state actors here \u2014 the allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom fail to state a conspiracy claim. <em>See Young v. Kann, </em>926 F.2d 1396, 1405 n. 16 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Finally, to the extent Calhoun sought monetary damages and injunctive relief from the State of New Jersey for \u201cattempting\u201d to charge him and other indigent defendants for the cost of the public defender services provided them, the complaint was properly dismissed because a State is not a person for purposes of \u00a7 1983. <em>Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Even construing Calhoun\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint liberally and assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such relief would be available from Segars in her individual and/or official capacities, this claim was nonetheless properly dismissed. In the first instance, it appears that Calhoun has not suffered an injury, let alone a deprivation of a constitutional right, because he alleges only that there was an \u201cattempt\u201d to charge him for the cost of his public defender. <em>See also Fuller v. Oregon, </em>417 U.S. 40, 54, 94 S.Ct. 2116, 40 L.Ed.2d 642 (1974) (upholding Oregon recoupment statute providing that an indigent convicted person, who later becomes able to pay for his counsel, may be required to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\">. Calhoun's state criminal trial proceedings appear to be ongoing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">. The New Jersey Public Defender Act includes reimbursement and lien provisions. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A. 2A:158A-16, 158A-17. N.J.S.A. 2A:158A-16 provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">In all cases where it appears that the defendant has or reasonably expects to have means to meet some part, though not all, of the cost of the services rendered to him he shall be required to reimburse the office, either by a single payment or in installments, in such amounts as he can reasonably be expected to pay; but no default or failure in the making of any such payment shall in any wise [sic] affect or reduce the rendering of the services to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-12\">. Moreover, given that Calhoun appears to be awaiting trial in state criminal proceedings, to the extent his complaint seeks injunctive relief for alleged present and continuing constitutional deprivations regarding his representation or the on-going proceedings, the complaint seeks relief that a federal court should not provide. <em>See O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 496, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974) (citing <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
