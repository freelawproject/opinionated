The debtors argue that Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., violated the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 559.55-559.785, and the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 501.201-501.23. The debtors complain that Mortgage Systems sent them deceptive notices, which described Mortgage Systems as a \u201ccreditor,\u201d and Mortgage Systems filed foreclosure actions against the debtors\u2019 property without legal authority. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Fin. Sec. Assurance, Inc. v. Stephens, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Roberts v. Fla. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>146 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.1998)). We accept the allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The debtors argue that Mortgage Systems sent them deceptive notices that violated section 559.72(9) of the Collection Act. The debtors argue that the notice misidentified Mortgage Systems as them \u201ccreditor.\u201d The debtors also contend that the district court should have applied the least-sophisticated-debtor standard to determine whether these notices were misleading. These arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Under the mortgage contracts, Mortgage Systems has the legal right to foreclose on the debtors\u2019 property. Mortgage Systems is the mortgagee. The notices sent to the debtors restated information from the mortgage contracts and were not likely to mislead even the least-sophisticated debtor. See <em>Jeter v. Credit Bureau, Inc., </em>760 F.2d 1168, 1175-76 (11th Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The debtors also argue that Mortgage Systems violated the Collection Act when it filed foreclosure actions against them, but this argument also fails. Even if it engaged in \u201cdebt collection activities\u201d under the Collection Act, Mortgage Systems did not violate section 559.72(9), because Mortgage Systems has the authority to file foreclosure actions. <em>Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Revoredo, </em>955 So.2d 33, 34 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007); <em>Mortgage Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Azize, </em>965 So.2d 151, 153-54 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2007). Florida law also provides post-litigation immunity for any foreclosure action filed by Mortgage Systems. <em>Echevarria, McCalla, Raymer, Barrett &amp; Frappier v. Cole, </em>950 So.2d 380, 384 (Fla.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The dismissal of the debtors\u2019 complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
