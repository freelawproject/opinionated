May 31, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 393 666 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-24\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, but found that her frivolousness finding was not adequately supported. As such, we review only the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-25\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ relied, in part, on Wu\u2019s false testimony that he lived with his cousin during a July 2005 hearing, after which he submitted an affidavit admitting that he had moved out of his cousin\u2019s apartment in February 2005. We have held that \u201c[t]estimonial inconsistencies are not sufficient as the sole basis for an adverse credibility finding where the inconsistencies do not concern the <em>basis for the claim of asylum or withholding.\u201d Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 127 (2d Cir.2007) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003)). At the same time, however, \u201ceven where an IJ relies on discrepancies or lacunae that, if taken separately, concern matters collateral or ancillary to the claim, ... the cumulative effect may nevertheless be deemed consequential by the fact-finder.\u201d <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-07 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[A]n IJ need not consider the centrality <em>vel non </em>of each individual discrepancy or omission\u201d and can instead \u201crely upon the cumulative impact of such inconsistencies, and may conduct an overall evaluation of testimony in light of its rationality or internal consistency and the manner in which it hangs together with other evidence.\u201d). Here, although ancillary to his claim, it was not impermissible for the IJ to rely on Wu\u2019s false testimony regarding his residence in making her adverse credibility finding where it was not \u201cthe sole basis\u201d for that finding. <em>See Liang Chen, </em>454 F.3d at 106-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The IJ also noted numerous inconsistencies in the record. To form the basis of an adverse credibility determination, a discrepancy must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09. As the IJ observed, Wu gave contradictory testimony about the year he was arrested throughout his testimony. In addition, Wu testified inconsistently about when his parents paid his bail in order to have him released from detention. These inconsistencies are substantial, as the alleged arrest and one-month period of detention that followed are the central elements of Wu\u2019s claim of persecution, and his discrepant testimony casts doubt on whether he was arrested at all. <em>Id. </em>Further, the IJ observed Wu\u2019s demeanor in the midst of his testimony on this matter, noting that he was \u201csweating profusely,\u201d and that his \u201cmanner deteriorated\u201d as his attorney attempted to sort out the issue. This observation of Wu\u2019s demeanor provided further support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Majidi, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The IJ also noted that while Wu first testified that he went into hiding in Jiang Xi (or Jie An) \u201cfor quite a few years,\u201d he later changed his testimony to \u201capproximately 17 months.\u201d This inconsistent testimony casts doubt on whether Wu went into hiding at all, and is thus material and substantial. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Taken together, these findings provide substantial evidence in support of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>Id. </em>As such, the denial of asylum was proper. To the extent that Wu based his claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>same factual predicate as his asylum claim, those claims necessarily fail. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
