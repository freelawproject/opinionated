Montante denying his applications for adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). <em>In re Hassan Mohamed Bayoumi, </em>No. A94 005 766 (B.I.A. Jan. 6, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A94 005 766 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo Aug. 25, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in some respects but not others, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., minus the arguments for denying relief that the BIA rejected. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">Because Bayoumi petitions for review only of the BIA\u2019s January 2005 decision affirming the IJ\u2019s decision denying his application for adjustment of status and INA \u00a7 212(h) relief, we will not consider any arguments pertaining to the BIA\u2019s December 2001 decision summarily dismissing his appeal of the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">While we arguably lack jurisdiction over Bayoumi\u2019s petition for review because it was untimely filed, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), <em>Malvoisin v. INS, </em>268 F.3d 74, 75 (2d Cir.2001), we need not decide whether Bayoumi\u2019s evidence that he arranged for a timely filing meets our jurisdictional requirements. <em>See also Bowles v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366-67, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Even if the petition was timely, we otherwise lack jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s January 2005 decision to deny adjustment of status if the IJ made a judgment that even if the applicant were eligible for adjustment of status, he or she should be denied such relief as a matter of discretion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Harjinder Singh v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 135, 137 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Bugayong v. INS, </em>442 F.3d 67, 71 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam)). We also lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of a waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 331-32 n. 11 (2d Cir.2006). While we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cquestions of law\u201d notwithstanding the jurisdictional bars applied to discretionary decisions, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), <em>Xiao Ji. Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 328-29, and even construing Bayoumi\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief liberally, <em>Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir.2006), he fails to raise any arguments that constitute a question of law. Indeed, his brief does not raise any arguments addressing the IJ\u2019s multiple findings supporting the denial of relief as a matter of discretion. Because the agency denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Bayoumi\u2019s adjustment application and his request for INA \u00a7 212(h) relief as a matter of discretion, and because he fails to raise a colorable question of law, we dismiss his petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Harjinder Singh, </em>468 F.3d at 137; <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 328-29, 331-32 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
