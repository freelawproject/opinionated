Counsel for Appellants filed a consolidated brief in which they essentially challenge the reasonable<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ness of their sentences and ask this court to remand for resentencing. The Government asserts that the appeals are barred by the appellate waivers contained in Appellants\u2019 respective plea agreements. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Kim\u2019s sole challenge on appeal is that the Government breached his plea agreement when it introduced his polygraph examination results to establish that he breached his plea agreement, thereby convincing the district court to deprive him of credit for acceptance of responsibility and increase his Guidelines range for obstruction of justice. Because there was nothing in Kim\u2019s plea agreement that prevented the Government from presenting his polygraph examination failure at sentencing, the Government did not breach his plea agreement. Accordingly, Kim\u2019s appeal is barred by the appellate waiver contained in his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Bae also asserts only that her departure sentence is unreasonable because, according to Bae, the district court abused its discretion when it departed upward due to Bae\u2019s inability to secure the return of money she secreted in South Korea. We agree with the Government that Bae\u2019s appeal is barred by her appellate waiver. <em>See id. </em>Although Bae summarily asserts that her attorney was ineffective because he failed to preserve her right to appeal from an upward departure, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are not generally cognizable on direct appeal unless ineffective assistance \u201cconclusively appears\u201d on the record. <em>See United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003). We find that it does not \u201cconclusively appear\u201d on the record that counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve Bae\u2019s right to appeal from an upward departure at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
