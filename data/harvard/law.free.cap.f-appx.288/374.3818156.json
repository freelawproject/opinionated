We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing due process claims de novo, <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000), and factual findings for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-23\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Sumenge failed to establish that her experiences as a member of the Hosanna group rose to the level of persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1016-17. Further, because Sumenge was never physically harmed, and her sister remains in Indonesia unharmed, she failed to show that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted if she returns to Indonesia. See <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 817 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-24\">Substantial evidence further supports the denial of CAT relief because Sumenge did not show it is more likely than not that she will be tortured by or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>with the acquiescence of the government. <em>Cf. Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1194-95 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Sumenge\u2019s due process contention fails because the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [s]he was prevented from reasonably presenting [her] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971 (internal citation omitted); <em>see also Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 921-22 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that IJ did not violate petitioner\u2019s due process rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b397-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
