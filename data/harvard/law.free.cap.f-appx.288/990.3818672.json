By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Branum is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Branum does not challenge the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. Instead he argues that the Constitution requires that he be granted leave to proceed IFP on appeal because he does not have the money to pay the appellate filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">There is no constitutional right to proceed in a civil action without paying the proper filing fee; the ability to proceed IFP is a privilege that may be extended or withdrawn. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 290 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, Branum\u2019s assertion that the good faith certification requirement violates his constitutional rights is without merit. <em>See id. </em>at 290-91. As Branum does not challenge the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith, he has waived any such challenge. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">Branum argues that the district court improperly required that he pay the $455 appellate filing fee in installments while simultaneously denying him leave to proceed IFP on appeal. However, \u201cthe plain language of [\u00a7 1915(b)(1) ] requires that appellate fees be assessed at the moment the appeal is filed, regardless of whether the appeal is later dismissed.\u201d <em>Williams v. Roberts, </em>116 F.3d 1126, 1128 (5th Cir. 1997). Accordingly, the district court did not err by ordering that the appellate filing fee be taken from Branum\u2019s prison trust account in installments pursuant to \u00a7 1915(b). <em>See </em>id.; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">Branum\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The IFP motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-17\">Both this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Branum\u2019s complaint count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir. 1996). During the pendency of this appeal, this court imposed the \u00a7 1915(g) bar against Branum. <em>See Branum v. Johnson, </em>265 Fed.Appx. 349, 350 (5th Cir.2008). Branum is admonished that he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-18\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR REMAINS IN EFFECT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
