For the first time on appeal, Anguiano-Rosales contends that <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), requires that his sentence be vacated and remanded for resentencing so that the district court can consider the sentencing disparity between defendants in the Northern District of Texas and similarly situated defendants in jurisdictions with a fast-track program. Although not conceded by Anguiano-Rosales, this exact argument was decided contrary to his position in <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 557-64 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 2, 2008) (No. 08-5226) and <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 30, 2008) (No. 08-5101), and is foreclosed. To the extent that Anguiano-Rosales\u2019s appeal raises an equal protection argument, it is also foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2008) (No. 08-5514).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-24\">Anguiano-Rosales also raises arguments that are foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. <em>United States v. Pinedor-Arrellano, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Because all of Anguiano-Rosales\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent, the Government moves for summary affir-mance. In the alternative, the Government requests an extension of time in which to file a brief on the merits. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary af-firmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1016-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
