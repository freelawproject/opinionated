Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (permitting challenges to state parole procedures under \u00a7 1983). The district court denied his request for counsel, dismissed three of his claims for failure to exhaust the grievance process, and ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>mately granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Shaw challenges each of these rulings. We affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Shaw is currently serving a life sentence plus twenty years for rape and murder. In the hopes of someday attaining parole, Shaw participated in the Sex Offender Treatment Program (SOTP). But prison doctors expelled Shaw from SOTP in 1999 on the grounds that he had refused to participate fully and had failed to acknowledge the seriousness of his crimes and violent sexual tendencies. Four years later, Shaw\u2019s therapist noted a marked improvement in \u201cself-disclosure and feedback.\u201d His therapist stopped short of any treatment recommendation, though, because \u201c[a]ny final treatment decisions should also include physiological measures of current sexual deviancy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">In light of his therapist\u2019s suggestion, Shaw requested a penile plethysmograph procedure, which the Wisconsin Department of Corrections uses to measure sexual arousal in response to suggestive content. Prison officials construed Shaw\u2019s request as an application for re-enrollment in the SOTP program \u2014 the procedure is typically administered as part of the program \u2014 and denied the request because \u201cpriority is given to inmates who have not yet been afforded their first opportunity\u201d to participate in SOTP. Shaw responded with a grievance in which he clarified that he had not requested re-enrollment in the \u201c3 to 4 years Sex Offender Treatment Program.\u201d Shaw explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">All I (very clearly) requested ... was for them to hook me up to them plythis-malgraph [sic] that they have housed over there in K-Building.... Measuring my current sexual deviancy on this plythismalgraph [sic] only takes an hour or two.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Prison officials ultimately dismissed Shaw\u2019s grievance because he had not articulated any violations of law or prison regulations in connection with the denial of his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">After he was denied parole for reasons that included unsatisfactory participation in SOTP, Shaw sued various prison officials under \u00a7 1983, claiming, as relevant here, that the defendants had refused his request for re-enrollment in SOTP in violation of his right to equal protection. Shaw also claimed that the unwritten requirement of SOTP completion prior to parole violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because the program was not in place at the time that Shaw was sentenced and the requirement of completion retroactively extended his punishment. Finally, Shaw requested that the district court furnish him with counsel in light of the complexity of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">The district court denied Shaw\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, noting that civil litigants do not have a right to counsel. <em>See Pruitt v. Mote, </em>503 F.3d 647, 649, 656-58 (7th Cir.2007) (en banc). While the court acknowledged that Shaw had been unable to recruit counsel, the court concluded that the legal issues he presented were \u201cstraightforward and uncomplicated.\u201d Moreover, the court reasoned, Shaw\u2019s extensive filings showed that he was capable of litigating his case. In any event, the court wrote, the presence of counsel would not likely affect the outcome of Shaw\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The court also dismissed Shaw\u2019s equal-protection claim for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 83-92, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). The court reasoned that Shaw\u2019s grievance asked for only the plethysmo-graph procedure \u2014 not reinstatement in SOTP \u2014 and thus could not have put prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>officials on notice of his desire to return to SOTP.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Finally, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Shaw\u2019s ex post facto claim because Shaw had not identified any \u201claw\u201d requiring him to complete SOTP before he could be released on parole. Given Shaw\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment, the court wrote, he enjoyed no entitlement to mandatory release under Wisconsin law, and parole in Wisconsin is a matter of discretion to which the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">On appeal Shaw contends that the district court erred in finding that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his equal-protection claim. We review de novo a district court\u2019s determination of failure to exhaust. <em>Dole v. Chandler, </em>438 F.3d 804, 809 (7th Cir.2006). Exhaustion is a modest requirement: \u201cAll the grievance need do is object intelligibly to some asserted shortcoming\u201d so that prison officials can remedy the problem before facing a lawsuit. <em>Strong v. David, </em>297 F.3d 646, 650 (7th Cir.2002); <em>see Ngo, </em>548 U.S. at 89, 126 S.Ct. 2378. Shaw argues that his grievance amounted to a request for re-enrollment because the procedure sought is only available to SOTP participants. Any language to the contrary, Shaw insists, sought to clarify only that he did not wish to start the program anew but rather pick up where he left off in 1999 \u2014 two units short of completion. Yet a plain reading of the grievance makes clear that Shaw asked for the procedure and nothing more. Shaw explicitly instructed prison officials that his request did not pertain to SOTP. Accordingly, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Shaw did not apprise the defendants of his desire to re-enter SOTP.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Next up is Shaw\u2019s assertion that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to his ex post facto claim. We considered\u2014 and rejected \u2014 an identical argument in <em>Grennier v. Frank, </em>453 F.3d 442, 444-45 (7th Cir.2006). Grennier, a Wisconsin inmate serving a life sentence for murder, argued that his sex-offender designation and the requirement of treatment before parole violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because it \u201champer[ed] his chance for parole release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444. We held, however, that any requirement of treatment was not a \u201claw\u201d for purposes of the clause. <em>Id. </em>at 444^45. Our opinion in <em>Grennier </em>identified the flaw in this argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">Defendants allow that Wisconsin has become less willing to release persons convicted of serious offenses and now demands assurance that interests in deterrence, desert, and public safety have been satisfied before a murderer will be let free. Neither the ex post facto clause nor the due process clause has anything to say about how discretion will be exercised under an open-ended system, however. <em>See Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 308-10, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).... The constitutional interest is in the rules and statutes \u2014 the \u201claws\u201d to which it refers \u2014 rather than the attitudes of public officials who administer a discretionary system. <em>See Prater v. U.S. Parole Commission, </em>802 F.2d 948 (7th Cir. 1986) (en banc). Parole officials who become more concerned with public safety \u2014 and who act on that concern by insisting that prisoners complete sex-offender treatment programs before release \u2014 do not violate the Constitution. <em>See, e.g., McKune v. Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Finally, Shaw argues that the district court erred in denying him counsel. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1). Civil litigants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>do not have a constitutional or statutory-right to counsel, though a court may, in its discretion, put out the call for a volunteer attorney to represent an indigent plaintiff. <em>Id.; see Johnson v. Doughty, </em>433 F.3d 1001, 1006 (7th Cir.2006). When faced with a request to recruit counsel, a district court must consider whether the plaintiff has made reasonable attempts to find counsel on his own and whether the plaintiff has demonstrated an ability to litigate his case. <em>See Pruitt, </em>503 F.3d at 654-55. Any examination of a plaintiffs ability to prosecute his case must consider his \u201cliteracy, communication skills, educational level, and litigation experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. We review a denial of a motion to recruit counsel under \u00a7 1915(e)(1) for abuse of discretion coupled with prejudice. <em>Hammer v. Ashcroft, </em>512 F.3d 961, 971 (7th Cir.2008); <em>Pruitt, </em>503 F.3d at 658-60. Our task on appeal, then, begins with an examination of \u201cwhether the district court applied the correct legal standard and reached a reasonable decision based on facts supported by the record.\u201d <em>Pruitt, </em>503 F.3d at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">There is no doubt that the district court applied the correct legal standard in rejecting Shaw\u2019s request for counsel. We conclude that it was a reasonable decision as well. Shaw demonstrated his competence throughout the litigation. He submitted requests for discovery, filed numerous motions, cited relevant case law, and made cogent legal arguments. Five of his civil-rights claims survived screening. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. We detect no abuse of discretion in the decision to let him continue his litigation without the support of an attorney. <em>See Hammer, </em>512 F.3d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">One final point warrants discussion. Shaw appears to raise a fourth issue in his brief by posing the question, \u201cDid Shaw present sufficient evidence to establish the denial of the use of his new religious name placed a substantial burden on the practice of his religion?\u201d Shaw says nothing more, however, so he has waived this argument. <em>See Campania Mgmt. Co. v. Rooks, Pitts &amp; Poust, </em>290 F.3d 843, 852 n. 6 (7th Cir. 2002) (\u201cPerfunctory and undeveloped arguments are waived.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
