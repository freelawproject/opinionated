LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b487-16\">Plaintiffs-appellants Jack L. Jones and Kay A. Jones (\u201cthe Jones\u201d) filed this breach-of-contract action in Kansas state court. Defendants-appellees KP&amp;H, LLC and Brad Penny removed the case to federal district court and then filed a motion to dismiss the Jones\u2019 claims based on a choice of venue clause in the contract. Interpreting this clause as providing for exclusive venue in San Diego County, California, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b487-18\">In June 2006, Jack and Kay Jones entered into an agreement to sell roughly 10,000 acres of land in Barber County, Kansas to KP&amp;H, a Delaware Limited Liability Company based in San Diego, and Brad Penny, a citizen of Florida (collectively \u201cKP&amp;H\u201d). This agreement, known as the Definitive Purchase Agreement (\u201cDPA\u201d), consisted of three documents: the Purchase Agreement, the Addendum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>to the Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions (\u201cFirst Addendum\u201d), and the Second Addendum to the Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions (\u201cSecond Addendum\u201d). The issues in this appeal revolve primarily around four provisions of the DPA: Section 7 of the Purchase Agreement (\u201cSection 7\u201d), Section 13 of the Purchase Agreement (\u201cSection 13\u201d), Section 3 of the First Addendum (\u201cSection 3\u201d), and Section 4 of the Second Addendum (\u201cSection 4\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Under the terms of the DPA, KP&amp;H was required to deliver an Earnest Money Deposit (\u201cDeposit\u201d) equaling $300,000 to an escrow agent prior to the sale of the property. The DPA then granted KP&amp;H a 90-day period to inspect the property and examine the title. Section 7 gave KP&amp;H the right to physically enter the property during this period \u201cto inspect, examine, survey, and make test borings, soil bearing tests, and any other soil or engineering tests or surveys which Purchaser may deem necessary....\u201d This section states that \u201c[a]t any time period [before] the expiration of the Inspection Period, Purchaser may terminate this Contract for any reason as a result of these inspections at the Purchaser\u2019s full and complete discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In Section 3, the First Addendum clarifies that after the end of the inspection period, the Deposit would be transferred to the Jones. After the inspection period, the Deposit would only be refunded to KP&amp;H if the Jones defaulted or failed to satisfy their obligations under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Section 13.1 discusses the possibility of default by either of the parties. If KP&amp;H defaulted, the Jones were \u201centitled to retain the [Deposit] as liquidated damages and in full settlement of any claims or damages, except with respect to such provisions of Section 7 and 12.2.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, the parties agreed that \u201cwithout resale, Seller\u2019 [s] damages may be difficult to ascertain and that the [Deposit] constitutes a reasonable liquidation thereof....\u201d If the Jones defaulted, however, KP&amp;H was entitled to the return of the Deposit without any prejudice to its right to seek other kinds of relief, pursuant to Section 13.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">In the event of a dispute between the parties, the DPA included a choice of venue clause, which provided for two different venues depending on the nature of the dispute. Section 4 states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">(a) any dispute arising out of or relating to Buyer\u2019s Deposit or Earnest Money Deposit, or the release, failure to release, refund, return or collection of the same to or by Buyer shall be tried and litigated exclusively in the State and Federal Courts located in San Diego County, California....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-12\">(b) any dispute arising out of or relating to the purchase and sale of the Property shall be tried and litigated exclusively in the State and Federal Courts located in Barber County, Kansas....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">In addition to the DPA, the parties entered into a separate agreement with an escrow agent (the \u201cEscrow Deposit Agreement\u201d), containing instructions for the delivery and release of the Deposit. Under the terms of the Escrow Deposit Agreement, if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-14\">the purchase and sale of the property is not consummated for any reason permitting a termination of the [DPA] other than a default under the [DPA] by Purchaser, the Deposit shall be refunded to Purchaser without any requirement of additional instruction from Seller....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Upon such termination, no party to this Agreement shall have any further right or obligation to the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">On October 25, 2006, five days before the end of the inspection period, KP&amp;H sent a letter to the Jones, notifying them that it was terminating the DPA and demanding refund of the Deposit. A copy of this letter was also sent to the escrow agent. In the letter, KP&amp;H stated that it was terminating the agreement in accordance with Section 7 \u201cas a result of Buyer\u2019s due diligence investigation and inspections of the Property, and disapproval thereof.\u201d The letter then directed the escrow agent to return the Deposit to KP&amp;H, which the agent did.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The Jones filed a breach-of-contract suit against KP&amp;H in Kansas state court approximately one month later. They claimed that under Section 7 of the DPA, KP&amp;H could only terminate the agreement as a result of the inspections specified in that section, that KP&amp;H had never conducted any of the enumerated tests, and that KP&amp;H had thus violated these terms of the contract. As relief, the Jones sought specific performance, return of the Deposit, or liquidated damages in the amount of $300,000. They also requested an additional $75,000, reflecting the cost of forbearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">KP&amp;H removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas and moved to dismiss for improper venue under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3). In its motion, KP&amp;H directed the court\u2019s attention to Section 4 and argued that because the Jones\u2019 dispute related to the disposition of the Deposit, venue was proper only in San Diego County, California.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The district court agreed with KP&amp;H and granted the motion to dismiss. Applying the venue provision of the agreement, the court reasoned that Barber County was not the proper venue because the dispute did not arise out of or relate to the sale or purchase of the property as no sale had occurred. It also noted that the Jones\u2019 requested relief involved retention of the Deposit under Section 13.1\u2019s liquidated damages clause, and that the dispute therefore concerned the Deposit. Accordingly, it ruled that venue was proper in San Diego County. The Jones appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">Review of dismissal for improper venue based on a contract\u2019s choice of venue clause presents a question of law which we consider de novo. <em>See Riley v. Kingsley Underwriting Agencies, Ltd., </em>969 F.2d 953, 956 (10th Cir.1992); <em>see also SBKC Sen. Corp. v. 1111 Prospect Partners, L.P., </em>105 F.3d 578, 581 (10th Cir.1997) (matters of contract interpretation are reviewed de novo).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We use the same standard applied to dismissals for failure to state a claim. <em>See Phillips v. Audio Active Ltd., </em>494 F.3d 378, 384 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Nazaruk v. eBay, Inc., </em>223 Fed.Appx. 815, 816 (10th Cir.2007) (unpub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>lished).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That is, we accept \u201call well-pleaded allegations as true and view[ ] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Lane v. Simon, </em>495 F.3d 1182, 1186 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Because the DPA provides that Kansas law governs the construction of its terms, we apply Kansas substantive law to this case. <em>Yavuz v. 61 MM, Ltd., </em>465 F.3d 418, 427-28 (10th Cir.2006). Under Kansas law, \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of contract construction requires courts to determine the parties\u2019 intent from the four corners of an instrument by construing all provisions together, and in harmony with each other rather than by critical analysis of a single or isolated provision.\u201d <em>Town Ctr. Shopping Ctr., LLC v. Premier Mortgage Funding, Inc., </em>37 Kan.App.2d 1, 148 P.3d 565, 572 (2006). Kansas courts favor reasonable over unreasonable interpretations of the contract and \u201c[r]esults which vitiate the purpose or reduce the terms of a contract to an absurdity should be avoided.\u201d <em>Kan. State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. DeLorean, </em>7 Kan.App.2d 246, 640 P.2d 343, 349 (1982). In this case, we consider the unified intent behind both the DPA and the Escrow Deposit Agreement because instruments that were \u201cexecuted by the same parties at or near the same time in the course of the same transaction and concern the same subject matter ... will be read and construed together.\u201d <em>In re Villa West Assoc., </em>146 F.3d 798, 803 (10th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Akandas, Inc. v. Klippel, </em>250 Kan. 458, 827 P.2d 37, 51 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The parties do not dispute the binding effect of the venue provision; they question only its proper interpretation. Section 4(a) states that San Diego County is the exclusive venue for litigating disputes \u201carising out of or relating to the [Deposit], or the release, failure to release, refund, return or collection of the same to or by the Buyer.\u201d Under Section 4(b), Barber County is the exclusive venue for disputes \u201carising out of or relating to the purchase and sale of the Property.\u201d The essential question is whether the Jones\u2019 breach-of-contract claim is best characterized as \u201carising out of or relating to\u201d the proper disposition of the Deposit or the sale of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The Jones claim that because the DPA governs the sale of the property, all disputes based upon provisions in the DPA necessarily arise out of or relate to the sale and fall under Section 4(b); by contrast, only disputes based upon terms in the Escrow Deposit Agreement can properly be characterized as relating to the Deposit under Section 4(a). KP&amp;H disagrees, contending that the parties intended for all disputes arising before the sale to be litigated in San Diego County, and all disputes arising after the sale to be litigated in Barber County, where the property is located. Although the parties\u2019 representations regarding their intent are certainly relevant to our analysis, in this case neither party presents an interpretation of the contract that construes all the provisions in harmony and avoids reducing particular terms to an absurdity. Based upon our independent reading of the contract, we conclude that this dispute arises out of the release of the Deposit, and that venue is proper in San Diego County. We begin with the plain language of the contract, and then turn to the parties\u2019 proposed interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">The Jones claim that KP&amp;H breached the contract by improperly terminating the transaction before the end of the inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>tion period. Although the DPA does not explicitly address the consequences of an <em>improper </em>termination <em>during </em>the inspection period, it does discuss proper terminations during this period and all other terminations after this period. From these provisions, we determine that the parties intended to limit the scope of particular disputes arising out of KP&amp;H\u2019s termination prior to the sale of the property, such that the only matter to be resolved between the parties would be the proper disposition of the Deposit. This particular case falls within that set of disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Under the terms of the contract, a proper termination by KP&amp;H before the end of the inspection period would result in the return of the Deposit to KP&amp;H. Section 7 permits KP&amp;H to terminate the contract \u201c[a]t any time period [before] the expiration of the Inspection Period.\u201d The Escrow Deposit Agreement, which we construe in conjunction with the DPA, <em>Akan-das, </em>827 P.2d at 51, states that if \u201cthe purchase and sale of the Property is not consummated for any reason permitting a termination of the [DPA] ... the Deposit shall be refunded to Purchaser....\u201d In addition, in the title examination provision of the DPA, KP&amp;H reserved the right to terminate prior to the expiration of the inspection period if it found any uncorrectable defects in the title. Upon such termination \u201cEscrow Agent shall immediately return to Purchaser the [Deposit].\u201d Consequently, upon a proper termination, either for the reasons permitted in Section 7 or for a defect in title, KP&amp;H would receive the Deposit from the escrow agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Once the Deposit was returned, the agreement would terminate and the parties would have no further obligations to each other. Both the title examination provision and the Escrow Deposit Agreement state that upon termination, \u201cno party ... shall have any ... further rights or obligations\u201d to the other. Reading the DPA and the Escrow Deposit Agreement together, we conclude that upon a proper termination by KP&amp;H before the end of the inspection period, the parties intended for the Deposit to be returned to KP&amp;H immediately and without dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">If, however, KP&amp;H terminated the agreement under any other circumstances, but prior to the consummation of the sale, the Jones would receive the Deposit. This conclusion is supported by language in Section 13.1, Section 3, and the Escrow Deposit Agreement. Under Section 13.1, termination by KP&amp;H before the sale would result in the agreement becoming \u201cnull and void and of no further force or effect,\u201d and the Jones would take the Deposit \u201cin full settlement of any claims or damages.\u201d Section 3 provides that, after the end of the inspection period, the Deposit will be not be refunded to KP&amp;H if it breaches the DPA. The Escrow Deposit Agreement only allows return of the Deposit to KP&amp;H if it terminated for a reason \u201cother than a default under the [DPA] by Purchaser.\u201d By contrast, if the Jones defaulted at any point in time, under Section 13.2 the Deposit would be refunded to KP&amp;H \u201cwithout prejudice to any other rights or remedies of Purchaser, including without limitation, the right to seek specific performance of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Taken together, it is clear that the parties intended to limit the scope of disputes arising out of KP&amp;H\u2019s presale termination. Although the Jones emphasize that KP&amp;H terminated the contract <em>improperly </em>prior to the end of the inspection period, a claim which is not specifically addressed by the DPA, the most reasonable interpretation of the contract turns on which party terminated and when. So long as KP&amp;H terminated the contract prior to sale, the only matter to be resolved between the parties was the proper transfer of the Deposit. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>contrast, other types of disputes, perhaps arising out of a presale termination by the Jones or a postsale breach by either party, would not be so limited in scope, and might reasonably fall under Section 4(b)\u2019s more general language. In light of this intent, we determine that Section 4(a) governs the dispute at issue here, which arose out of a presale termination by KP&amp;H. Because Section 4(a) controls, venue is proper in San Diego County.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The parties have each proposed alternative interpretations of the contract, but these proposals are inconsistent with the language and intent of the DPA. The Jones assert that the parties intended for all disputes arising out of provisions in the DPA to be litigated in Barber County and that only disputes arising out of the Escrow Deposit Agreement would be litigated in San Diego County. They contend that the Escrow Deposit Agreement exclusively governs the \u201crelease, refund, return and collection\u201d of the Deposit, as those terms are used in Section 4(a). By contrast, they argue, the DPA contains \u201ccontractual terms\u201d that necessarily relate to the \u201cpurchase and sale\u201d of the property, to which Section 4(b) applies. Because then-claim arises out of an alleged breach of Section 7 of the DPA, the Jones maintain that Section 4(b) controls, and that venue is proper in Barber County.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">This interpretation, however, conflicts with the plain language of the contract. Provisions governing the \u201crelease\u201d and \u201crefund\u201d of the Deposit are not confined solely to the Escrow Deposit Agreement; they are also scattered throughout the DPA. For example, Section 3 of the DPA states that at the end of the inspection period, the escrow agent \u201cshall immediately <em>release </em>to Seller\u201d the full amount of the Deposit (emphasis added). If, however, the seller defaults, the Deposit \u201cwill be <em>refunded </em>to Buyer ...\u201d (emphasis added). Additionally, in a section of the DPA governing proper title, KP&amp;H reserved the right to terminate the agreement for any title defects, \u201cwhereupon the Escrow Agent shall immediately <em>return </em>\u201d the Deposit to KP&amp;H (emphasis added). Under the Jones\u2019 theory, these provisions, which explicitly involve the release and refund of the Deposit, would not fall under the \u201crelease\u201d and \u201crefund\u201d language of Section 4(a). Because the Jones\u2019 interpretation conflicts with the plain language of the contract, it is necessarily unreasonable. <em>See DeLorean, </em>640 P.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">In a related argument, the Jones urge us to focus on the nature of their cause of action, which they characterize as a suit for breach of a sale contract. Because the breach \u201crelates to\u201d the sale of the property, they contend that venue is proper in Barber County. While it is true on a general level that any breach of the DPA \u201crelates to\u201d the sale, such a broad interpretation would render Section 4(a) meaningless. Principles of Kansas contract law prevent us from reading Section 4(a) completely out of the contract. <em>See DeLorean, </em>640 P.2d at 349. Moreover, under the rule of ejusdem generis, we must interpret general provisions in light of more specific provisions in a contract. <em>See Smith v. Russ, </em>184 Kan. 773, 339 P.2d 286, 291 (1959); <em>Exch. State Bank v. Kan. Bankers Sur. Co., </em>39 Kan.App.2d 232, 177 P.3d 1284, 1285 (2008). In other words, Section 4(b)\u2019s language regarding disputes \u201carising out of or relating to the purchase and sale of the Property\u201d must refer to disputes other than those falling under the more specific provisions of Section 4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">KP&amp;H suggests that the application of the venue provision turns on the consummation of the sale, with all presale disputes being litigated under Section 4(a) and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>postsale disputes under Section 4(b). In support of its argument, KP&amp;H directs us to Section 13.1, which sets liquidated damages for any breach by KP&amp;H made prior to the sale. This section states that \u201c[i]f the transaction contemplated herein is not consummated because of a default of Purchaser ... Seller shall be entitled to retain the [Deposit] as liquidated damages and in full settlement of any claims or damages .... \u201d Because the Jones\u2019 sole remedy for any breach of contract occurring before the sale was the Deposit, KP&amp;H asserts that all such pre-sale disputes relate to the proper disposition of the Deposit and should be litigated in San Diego County.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The Jones counter that venue cannot depend on the remedy they sought, which included, among other things, the Deposit or the value of the Deposit as liquidated damages. In support of their argument, they cite a case holding that the application of a statute of limitations may not turn on the remedy requested. <em>Four B Corp. v. Daicel Chem. Indus., Ltd, </em>258 F.Supp.2d 1147, 1155 (D.Kan.2003). They do not offer an authority, however, that prohibits parties from wilting a contract in which venue turns on the remedy. Moreover, we see no reason why parties could not write such a contract. As a general matter, parties are free to adopt any contract terms they wish, so long as these terms are not illegal, contrary to public policy, or the result of fraud. <em>See Augusta Med. Complex, Inc. v. Blue Cross of Kan., Inc., </em>227 Kan. 469, 608 P.2d 890, 895 (1980). In some instances, they may even agree to terms that conflict with statutory requirements, and Kansas courts will give effect to their agreement rather than the statute. <em>See In re Estate of Sauder, </em>283 Kan. 694, 156 P.3d 1204, 1214 (2007). As a matter of policy, we do not conceive of any reason why courts should prohibit parties from making venue provisions contingent on the remedy sought. <em>See Stephan v. Goldinger, </em>325 F.3d 874, 878 (7th Cir.2003) (holding that contractual venue clauses \u201cgenerally are valid\u201d). \u201cVenue is not a substantive right, but is a procedural matter designed for the convenience of the litigants,\u201d 77 Am.Jur.2d Venue \u00a7 1, and courts have previously allowed parties to contract similar procedural matters. <em>See Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, </em>499 U.S. 585, 591-95, 111 S.Ct. 1522, 113 L.Ed.2d 622 (1991); <em>Milk 'N' More, Inc. v. Beavert, </em>963 F.2d 1342, 1346 (10th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The Jones argue that even if venue clauses that turn on remedy are enforceable, this particular contract is not susceptible to such an interpretation. They assert that if all presale disputes \u201crelate to\u201d the Deposit, then there would be no circumstance under which Section 4(b) would apply, rendering that provision a \u201cnullity.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We agree that a liquidated damages clause restricting the available remedy, standing alone, would not necessarily control our interpretation of Section 4.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But in this case, the questions of remedy and venue are intertwined, as the parties clearly intended to limit the available remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>depending on the nature of the dispute and also intended to assign venue based upon the nature of the dispute. \u201c[C]onstruing all provisions together and in harmony with each other,\u201d <em>Town Ctr. Shopping Ctr., </em>148 P.3d at 572, we conclude that the parties intended to limit the scope of particular disputes, such that the only question between them was the disposition of the Deposit. Because the Jones\u2019 particular claims fall within this set of disputes, Section 4(a) applies, and venue is therefore proper in San Diego County, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the dismissal for improper venue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">. The reference to Section 12.2 was removed by the First Addendum because there is no Section 12.2 in the DPA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\">. Alternatively, KP&amp;H urged dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) because the Jones failed to allege that it had breached the terms of the contract. The Jones, in turn, sought remand to the state court. Because the district court determined that venue was not proper in Kansas, it did not rule on either of these arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b489-14\">. Although the parties refer to Section 4 as a \"forum selection clause,\u201d we deem it more properly termed a \"choice of venue clause\u201d or \"venue provision,\u201d and refer to it as such. <em>See SBKC, </em>105 F.3d at 582 (clarifying that the term \"forum selection clause\u201d refers only to \"agreements which clearly confine litigation to <em>specific tribunals,\u201d </em>as opposed to specific venues which may contain multiple acceptable tribunals (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\">.

The Jones also claim that Section 3 of the First Addendum implicitly negated Section 13.1's liquidated damages provision. Our reading of the contract does not reveal anything contradictory in these two provisions. Moreover, Section 15 of the First Addendum removed specific portions of Section 13.1 but did not strike the language regarding liquidated damages. Had the parties intended to rescind the damages provision in Section 13.1, they likely would have done so explicitly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b493-10\">.

In my view, the choice of venue clause contained in the parties\u2019 Definitive Purchase Agreement (DPA) clearly requires the Jones\u2019 breach-of-contract claim to be \u201ctried and litigated\u201d in \u201cBarber County, Kansas.\u201d Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with directions to grant the Jones\u2019 motion to remand the proceedings to the Kansas state court in which they were originally filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Central to this appeal is the proper interpretation of the choice of venue clause set forth in Section 4 of the Second Addendum to the Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions. That clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amr-dedup-0\">4. <em>Jurisdiction and Venue for Dispute Resolution. </em>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the revised Draft Purchase Agreement or the Escrow Agreement (including any hand marked or initialed deletions or additions to the Escrow Agreement), (a) any dispute arising out of or relating to Buyer\u2019s Deposit or Earnest Money Deposit, or the release, failure to release, refund, return or collection of the same to or by Buyer, shall be tried and litigated exclusively in the State and Federal Courts located in San Diego County, California, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction thereof solely for such purpose, and (b) any dispute arising out of or relating to the purchase and sale of the Property shall be tried and litigated exclusively in the State and Federal Courts located in Barber County, Kansas, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction thereof solely for such purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Aplee.App. at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">There is no dispute that this choice of venue clause was intended to encompass any and all disputes arising between the parties. Thus, the Jones\u2019 breach-of-contract claim necessarily has to fall within the scope of either subsection (a) or (b) of the choice of venue clause. In other words, as the majority notes, \u201c[t]he essential question is whether the Jones\u2019 breach-of-contract claim is best characterized as \u2018arising out of or relating to\u2019 the proper disposition of the Deposit or the sale of the property.\u201d O&amp;J at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">The majority resolves this question in a roundabout fashion. First, the majority concludes, citing various provisions of the DPA and the Escrow Deposit Agreement, \u201cthat the parties intended to limit the scope of disputes arising out of KP&amp;H\u2019s presale termination.\u201d O&amp;J at 11. More specifically, the majority asserts that \u201c[s]o long as KP&amp;H terminated the contract prior to sale, the only matter to be resolved between the parties was the proper transfer of the Deposit.\u201d O&amp;J at 11. In turn, the majority concludes that because \u201cthe dispute at issue here ... arose out of a presale termination by KP&amp;H,\u201d \u201cSection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>4(a) governs\u201d and \u201cvenue is [thus] proper in San Diego County.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The key flaw in this analysis lies in the assumption that, in the event of a so-called \u201cpresale termination\u201d by KP&amp;H, \u201cthe only matter to be resolved between the parties was the proper transfer of the Deposit.\u201d To be sure, the provisions of the DPA cited by the majority make clear that the parties intended (a) for the Deposit to be returned to KP&amp;H \u201cimmediately and without dispute\u201d in the event that it properly terminated, and (b) for the Deposit to serve as a measure of liquidated damages in the event that KP&amp;H improperly terminated. Importantly, however, in order to decide how the Deposit should be disposed of in the event of a termination by KP&amp;H, it must necessarily be determined whether such termination was \u201cproper\u201d or \u201cimproper,\u201d i.e., whether it was consistent with, or in violation of, the terms of the DPA. Indeed, that very question lies at the heart of this case \u2014 the Jones assert that KP&amp;H terminated in violation of the DPA, while KP&amp;H asserts that its termination was consistent with the terms of the DPA \u2014 and will have to be determined at some point, by some court. Thus, it is simply not true that \u201cthe only matter to be resolved between the parties\u201d in the event of a presale termination by KP&amp;H is \u201cthe proper transfer of the Deposit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Returning to the plain language of the choice of venue clause, it is obvious that the Jones\u2019 breach-of-contract claim fits much more readily within the scope of subsection (b) than subsection (a). The Jones\u2019 breach-of-contract claim clearly does not \u201carise out of\u2019 the Deposit, and only tangentially, at best, \u201crelates to\u201d the Deposit (in the sense that the Deposit will serve as liquidated damages in the event that the Jones prevail, or will be remain with KP&amp;H in the event that defendants prevail). Without question, however, the breach-of-contract claim \u201carises out of\u201d or \u201crelates to\u201d the \u201cpurchase and sale of\u2019 the Jones\u2019 property. It is undisputed that the parties entered into a written agreement regarding the purchase and sale of the Jones\u2019 property. Had KP&amp;H completed the purchase process, rather than terminating the agreement, the Jones would have suffered no loss and would have had no claim. Thus, them breach-of-contract claim clearly \u201carises out of\u2019 the purchase and sale of the property. <em>Cf. Georgacara-kos v. United States, </em>420 F.3d 1185, 1186-87 (10th Cir.2005) (construing similar \u201carising out of\u2019 language in federal statute); <em>Foos v. Terminex, </em>31 Kan.App.2d 522, 67 P.3d 173, 176 (2003) (construing similar \u201carising out of\u201d language in Kansas Workers Compensation Act). For the same reasons, the Jones\u2019 breach-of-contract claim obviously \u201crelates to\u201d the purchase and sale of the property. Consequently, the breach-of-contract claim squarely falls within the scope of, and must be governed by, subsection (b) of the choice of venue clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Although defendants argue that subsection (b) of the choice of venue clause applies only in the event of a completed purchase/sale, they are mistaken. The terms \u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201csale\u201d are employed as nouns in subsection (b) and, given them plain and ordinary meaning, encompass the entire act of purchasing/selling. <em>See Anderson v. Dillard\u2019s Inc., </em>283 Kan. 432, 153 P.3d 550, 554 (2007); <em>Schartz v. Kansas Health Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>275 Kan. 515, 66 P.3d 866, 869 (2003). More specifically, the term \u201cpurchase,\u201d when used as a noun, refers to \u201c[t]he action or an act of purchasing something.\u201d Oxford English Dictionary (Draft Revision Mar. 2008). Similarly, the term \u201csale,\u201d when used as a noun, refers to \u201c[t]he action or an act of selling or making over to another for a price.... \u201d Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed.1989). Rather than focusing on a completed transaction, both terms encompass all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the actions inherent in or necessary to purchasing or selling something. Thus, subsection (b) of the choice of venue clause does not, as suggested by defendants, apply only in the event of a completed purchase/sale.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Consistent with the notion that subsection (b) of the choice of venue clause was intended to encompass a broad range of disputes \u201carising out of\u2019 or \u201crelating to\u201d the purchase/sale of the property, it is readily apparent that subsection (a) was intended to more narrowly encompass claims directly relating to the Earnest Money Deposit. Not only does the plain and unambiguous language of subsection (a) lead to this conclusion, a review of the Escrow Deposit Agreement confirms this construction. Paragraph 10 of the Escrow Deposit Agreement provides that \u201c[a]ny dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement [i.e., the Escrow Deposit Agreement] ... shall be tried and litigated exclusively in the State and Federal Courts located in San Diego County, Cali-fornia____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. This language, which was obviously intended to be consistent with the DPA\u2019s choice of venue clause, confirms that only disputes relating directly to the Earnest Money Deposit were to be brought in San Diego County.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In sum, because the Jones\u2019 breach of contract claim clearly falls within the scope of subsection (b) rather than subsection (a) of the choice of venue clause, the district court should have denied defendants\u2019 Rule 12(b)(3) motion to dismiss and granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand the case to Barber County, Kansas, where it was originally filed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\">. Defendants' proposed interpretation of the choice of venue clause would place nearly every contractual dispute within the scope of subsection (a), and would therefore render subsection (b), despite its plain language, all but meaningless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
