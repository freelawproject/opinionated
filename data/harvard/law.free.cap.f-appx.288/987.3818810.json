In Mullins\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application he challenged his guilty-plea convictions of possession of a firearm by a felon and aggravated assault against a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>servant and the resulting concurrent sentences of 10 and 20 years of imprisonment. Mullins contends that the district court erred by applying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), the date on which Mullins\u2019s conviction became final, as the limitation period commencement date, rather than \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), the date on which the factual predicate of the claim could have been discovered through due diligence. He argues that pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), the limitation period commencement date should be the date that he received an order of the Texas State Board of Examining Psychologists (TSBEP), which reprimanded the psychologist who examined Mullins in his criminal case for his work in Mullins\u2019s criminal proceeding. Mullins insists that the TSBEP order of reprimand forms the factual predicate for his constitutional claims and that, if the date that he received the order is used as the limitation commencement date, his \u00a7 2254 application would be timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">An order dismissing a habeas application as time barred is subject to de novo review. Starns <em>v. Andrews, </em>524 F.3d 612, 617 (5th Cir.2008). Mullins asserted in the instant \u00a7 2254 application that he was denied due process because the psychologist\u2019s conclusions were faulty, the faulty report was used as a basis for his guilty plea, and the trial court and his counsel should have investigated the issue. Because Mullins\u2019s claims are essentially a challenge to his guilty plea, the TSBEP order of reprimand is not the basis for Mullins\u2019s \u00a7 2254 claims. Rather, that order provides support for Mullins\u2019s claims. This conclusion is also supported by review of Mullins\u2019s allegations in his initial state habeas application, which he filed prior to receiving the TSBEP order of reprimand. Initially, Mullins challenged his guilty plea based upon ineffective assistance of coun-1 sel, contending that (1) his attorney was ineffective for failing to investigate the issue of his sanity, (2) his attorney coerced him into pleading guilty by telling him that he did not have an insanity defense, and (3) he was mentally incompetent when he entered the guilty plea. Mullins attached diagnostic reports to his state habeas application to contradict the conclusions set forth in the psychologist\u2019s report that was used in Mullins\u2019s criminal proceeding. As the TSBEP order of reprimand is merely support for Mullins\u2019s repeated attempts to challenge his guilty plea, the order does not form the factual predicate for his claims, as contemplated by \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(D). <em>See Flanagan v. Johnson, </em>154 F.3d 196, 198-99 (5th Cir.1998). As such, Mullins\u2019s contention that \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) should apply and the statue of limitations did not begin to run until he received the TSBEP order is without merit. Rather, the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), which the district court applied, governs this case. <em>See Flanagan v. Johnson, </em>154 F.3d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Mullins does not address the district court\u2019s analysis and conclusion under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) that his \u00a7 2254 application is time barred. He also does not address the district court\u2019s conclusion that equitable tolling was not warranted. He has therefore abandoned these issues. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgement of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
