Sept. 5, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 401 227 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 18, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in some respects but not others, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision, minus those arguments for denying relief that were rejected by the BIA. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). However, where the BIA adopts and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the BIA did not affirm the IJ\u2019s finding that Li was not credible, but otherwise adopted and affirmed her decision in all respects. Thus, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA, minus the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Xue Hong Yang, </em>426 F.3d at 522; <em>Yan Chen, </em>417 F.3d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-16\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">Li does not appear to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) in his counseled brief to this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, we deem any such argument waived, <em>Yueq-ing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005), and proceed to review only his challenge to the denial of his application for relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-18\">Li\u2019s claim that he will be tortured by the Chinese government as a result of his alleged illegal departure is largely governed by <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005), and <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003). In these two cases, we concluded that evidence that some individuals who left China illegally are imprisoned and that human rights violations (including torture) occur in Chinese prisons is insufficient to establish a clear probability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>of torture for a particular illegal emigrant. In <em>Mu-Xing Wang, </em>we made clear that the relevant inquiry is whether someone in the petitioner\u2019s \u201cparticular alleged circumstances\u201d is more likely than not to be tortured. 320 F.3d at 143-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">While Li alleges that particularized evidence of torture is \u201cnot readily and reasonably available to him,\u201d he does not provide any explanation for why this is the case other than the unsupported statement that \u201c[t]hose who are deported back to China and punished may not have access to media or afforded an outlet to document or report abuse.\u201d Furthermore, Li\u2019s argument-to wit: that his testimony, \u201ccombined with the systematic abuse of detainees in China and lack of human rights,\u201d establishes a likelihood of torture-is not the type of particularized evidence required to demonstrate that someone in his circumstances would more likely than not face torture in China. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin, </em>432 F.3d at 160. Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-13\">. Indeed, we are perplexed why both the IJ and BIA purported to adjudicate a withholding of removal claim under INA \u00a7 241 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)) where the record reflects Li\u2019s intent to proceed only on his CAT claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
