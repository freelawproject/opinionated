Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the District Court granted that motion on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were time-barred, and plaintiffs filed this appeal from the District Court\u2019s judgment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">Plaintiffs urge the vacatur of the District Court\u2019s judgment because (1) they were not on \u201cinquiry notice\u201d of the fraud claims in February 2001; (2) the five-year statute of limitations established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and not the one-year limitations period imposed by the District Court, governs this claim; and (3) their state-law claims were improperly dismissed. We disagree on the fust two counts, but agree on the thud.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-15\">First, we, like the District Court, conclude that plaintiffs were on inquiry notice of the alleged fraud in February 2001. \u201cInquiry notice \u2014 often called \u2018storm warnings\u2019 in the securities context \u2014 gives rise to a duty of inquiry \u2018when the circumstances would suggest to an investor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she has been defrauded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lentell v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 161, 168 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Levitt v. Bear </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>Stearns &amp; Co., Inc., </em>340 F.3d 94, 101 (2d Cir.2003)). \u201cStorm warnings in the form of company-specific information probative of fraud will trigger a duty to investigate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169. If inquiry notice is established and the investor fails to conduct an inquiry, knowledge of the fraud is imputed as of the date he received inquiry notice. <em>Id. </em>at 168. Here, a class action complaint filed in February 2001 \u2014 in the wake of a substantial decline in Nortel\u2019s stock price that received extensive media coverage \u2014 alleged that Nortel had materially misstated its financial results for the third and fourth quarters of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Plaintiffs contend that these allegations did not alert them to the accounting fraud giving rise to them action because they acquired Nortel shares prior to the third quarter of 2000 and therefore had no cause to fear that they had been the victims of the fraud charged in the class-action complaint. We disagree. The class-action allegations, while pertaining explicitly only to financial reporting for the second half of 2000, would have alerted an investor of ordinary intelligence that financial statements issued earlier in 2000 and in 1999 may have suffered from the same infirmities. As such, these allegations constituted \u201ccompany-specific information probative of fraud\u201d that \u201ctrigger[ed] a duty to investigate.\u201d <em>Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Plaintiffs next argue that they had no inquiry notice in 2001 because they could not have brought an action for securities fraud at that time. This argument conflates inquiry notice with actual notice. It may be true that plaintiffs could not have brought a viable securities-fraud action in 2001, but inquiry notice does not require them to do so. Inquiry notice imposes only a duty of inquiry. Plaintiffs do not allege, however, that they conducted any inquiry whatsoever, and where an \u201cinvestor makes no inquiry once the duty arises, knowledge will be imputed as of the date the duty arose.\u201d <em>Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 168 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, as the District Court held, plaintiffs had constructive knowledge of the fraud in February 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Second, plaintiffs maintain that their action was governed by the five-year statute of limitations set forth in section 804(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSOX\u201d), and not the one-year limitations period established by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i(e). Prior to the passage of SOX, \u201c[t]he statute of limitations for claims pursuant to section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 [was] \u2018within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neuman v. Warnaco Group, Inc., </em>335 F.3d 187, 193 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i(e) (2000)). Section 804(b) of SOX extended the limitations period for securities fraud actions to the lesser of two years from discovery of the fraud or five years from the date of the fraud. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658. In <em>Shah v. Meeker, </em>we explained that SOX \u201cextended the limitations period to two years, but applies only to fraud claims arising on or after the effective date of the Act \u2014 July 30, 2002 \u2014 and does not revive claims that were already time-barred under the prior one-year limitations period.\u201d 435 F.3d 244, 249 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>In re Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC Sec. Litig., </em>391 F.3d 401, 411 (2d Cir.2004)). In light of <em>Shah </em>and <em>Enterprise Mortgage, </em>plaintiffs cannot avail themselves of the statute of limitations established by SOX. The alleged fraud at issue in this action occurred in June (or September) 2000 and plaintiffs had constructive knowledge of the fraud \u2014 due to their failure to carry out an investigation after having received inquiry notice \u2014 in February 2001. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78i(e), their claim was time-barred as of February 2002, five months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>before SOX was enacted. Because SOX \u201cdoes not revive claims that were already time-barred under the prior one-year limitations period,\u201d <em>Shah,, </em>435 F.3d at 249, plaintiffs are bound by the one year statute of limitations. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 federal securities claims are untimely. The applicable statute of limitations expired in February 2002 and this action was filed three years later on February 14, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Third, plaintiffs urge that, regardless of the viability of their federal securities claims, the District Court had independent jurisdiction over the state-law claims\u2014 arising from diversity of citizenship \u2014 and the District Court erred by dismissing them. We agree insofar as the District Court\u2019s Order and Opinion of January 26, 2007 did not provide any basis for its dismissal of the state-law claims. Defendants urge several grounds on which the state-law claims could be dismissed, and defendant Roth contends that he is not subject to the personal jurisdiction of New York Courts. The District Court, however, has not yet ruled on any of these arguments, and \u201c[i]t is this Court\u2019s usual practice to allow the district court to address arguments in the first instance.\u201d <em>Dardana Ltd. v. A.O. Yuganskneftegaz, </em>317 F.3d 202, 208 (2d Cir.2003). For that reason, we vacate the District Court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 federal securities fraud claims, VACATE the judgment insofar as it dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims, and REMAND the action to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
