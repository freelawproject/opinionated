R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Adam Trotter appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of defendant in his action alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Coons v. Sec\u2019y of the U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>383 F.3d 879, 884 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Trotter\u2019s discrimination claims because he failed to rebut defendant\u2019s evidence that the requested accommodation would be an undue hardship to the defendant. <em>See U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 </em>U.S. 391, 401-02, 122 S.Ct. 1516, 152 L.Ed.2d 589 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Trotter\u2019s retaliation claims because he failed to show a causal connection between his request for an accommodation and the adverse employment decision. <em>See Coons, </em>383 F.3d at 887-88. The record shows that disciplinary action against Trotter began before he first requested an accommodation, and Trotter concedes that his repeated absences caused his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">We grant in part defendant\u2019s motion to strike attachments to Trotter\u2019s opening brief, specifically as to the \u201cPLFA Supplemental Agreement\u201d and the deposition excerpts of Dennis H. Nicholson, M.D. <em>See Kirshner v. Uniden Corp. of Am., </em>842 F.2d 1074, 1077 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cPapers not filed with the district court or admitted into evidence by that court are not part of the clerk\u2019s record and cannot be part of the record on appeal\u201d). We consider the evidence appended to Trotter\u2019s motion to reconsider, although Trotter waived review of the order denying reconsideration by not raising it in his opening brief. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">Trotter\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b421-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
