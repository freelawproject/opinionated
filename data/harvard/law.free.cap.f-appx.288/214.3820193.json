Contreras argues that the Government breached his plea agreement at the sentencing hearing by opposing his motion for a downward departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2\u2014 the so-called \u201csafety valve\u201d \u2014 on, <em>inter alia, </em>grounds that he possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense. He contends that the Government was precluded from making such an argument based on this stipulation in the plea agreement: \u201cThe adjustment of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) does not apply because there is insufficient evidence that a dangerous weapon was possessed during the commission of the offense.\u201d The district court denied his motion for the safety valve departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Whether the Government has violated a plea agreement is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Wittie, 25 F.3d 250, 262 </em>(5th Cir.1994). When analyzing a claim that a plea agreement has been breached, the reviewing court should consider whether the Government\u2019s actions are consistent \u201cwith the parties\u2019 reasonable understanding of the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 367 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The critical question is what the parties agreed to. The plea agreement contained no understanding with respect to Contreras\u2019 request for a downward departure under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2; rather, it spoke only to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The record makes clear that at the time of sentencing, the applicability of the safety valve was an open question. The weapons enhancement and the safety valve are separate issues, and what the Government agreed to do was not to attempt to prove the weapons enhancement. The Government\u2019s agreement not to seek the weapons enhancement did not relieve Contreras from his burden of proving that there was no weapon. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2006) (noting that the defendant \u201chas the burden of showing that he is entitled to the safety-valve adjustment\u201d). While the Government stated that it lacked sufficient evidence to seek the enhancement, it does not follow that the Government had <em>no </em>evidence of a weapon. The Government\u2019s concession that it did not have enough evidence to prove the presence of the weapon is neither a concession that Defendant did not have a weapon nor a concession that he can prove its absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Further, the stipulations paragraph in the plea agreement specifically provided that nothing in the plea agreement would preclude argument by either party regarding any other specific offense characteristic or guideline adjustment. Contreras has not shown that the Government violated the plea agreement. <em>See Price, </em>95 F.3d at 367; <em>Wittie, </em>25 F.3d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Contreras also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for a downward departure and that the district court plainly erred in failing to grant a two-level reduction in his offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(9). Contreras\u2019 appeal of these issues is barred by the waiver-of-appeal provision in his plea agreement. See <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
