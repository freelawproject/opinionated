We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Henline worked as an underground coal miner for at least 21 years between 1965 and 1993. Henline developed breathing problems during the last few years of his work that worsened over time and eventually forced him to retire.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">On July 18, 2000, Henline filed a claim for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901-44 (West 2007). After Henline underwent testing and was examined by a Department of Labor physician, the Department of Labor awarded him benefits. At the request of Island Creek, the undisputed responsible operator for any benefit award, the claim was then transferred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges for formal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">Following a hearing, ALJ Robert Les-nick issued a decision awarding benefits. The ALJ found that Island Creek failed to rebut the applicable presumption that Henline filed his claim within the applicable three-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.308 (2007). In this regard, the ALJ concluded that there was no evidence that any doctor had given Hen-line, more than three years before he filed his claim, a \u201creasoned opinion\u201d that he was totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis. J.A. 525. The ALJ alternatively found that the only evidence that a doctor had given Henline any opinion to that effect\u2014 reasoned or unreasoned \u2014 more than three years prior to the filing of his claim was testimony from Henline himself. The ALJ discredited this testimony because Henline had admitted that a stroke had left him with a poor memory, and because his testimony was inconsistent and composed primarily of a series of \u201cyes\u201d answers. Regarding the merits of Henline\u2019s claim, the ALJ credited the opinions of Henline\u2019s expert, Dr. Cohen, and the Department of Labor\u2019s doctor, Dr. Rasmussen, that Hen-line was totally disabled due to pneumoco-niosis and rejected the contrary opinions of Island Creek\u2019s three doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">On appeal, the Board affirmed the decision in part and vacated and remanded in part. Although not reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Henline\u2019s testimony on the timeliness issue, the Board nevertheless affirmed the determination that Henline\u2019s claim was timely. The Board did so on the grounds that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.308 requires that notice to the miner that he was totally disabled due to pneu-moconiosis must be in writing to trigger the three-year statute-of-limitations clock and that Island Creek had not provided evidence that Henline had received such notice. The Board also affirmed the ALJ\u2019s finding that Henline was totally disabled. However, concluding that the ALJ did not explain why he found the opinions of Drs. Cohen and Rasmussen more persuasive than those of Island Creek\u2019s doctors, the Board remanded for reconsideration of whether Henline had pneumoconiosis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>whether his total disability was due to pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The case was assigned to ALJ Daniel L. Leland on remand. Finding Dr. Cohen to be the most qualified based on his experience and published research, and finding his opinion, which was supported by Dr. Rasmussen, to be better documented and reasoned than any of Island Creek\u2019s doctors, the ALJ reinstated Henline\u2019s benefits award. The Board affirmed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Island Creek then petitioned this court for review of the Board\u2019s decision, challenging, <em>inter alia, </em>the Board\u2019s conclusion that notice to a miner that he is disabled due to pneumoconiosis must be in writing to trigger the statute-of-limitations clock. We agreed with Island Creek, vacated the Board\u2019s decision, and remanded to the Board for reconsideration of the timeliness issue. <em>See Island Creek Coal Co. v. Henline, </em>456 F.3d 421, 425-27 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">On remand, the Board, noting that whether a claimant\u2019s hearing testimony is sufficient to rebut the timeliness presumption is a matter committed to the ALJ\u2019s discretion, rejected a claim by Island Creek that ALJ Lesniek erred in discrediting Henline\u2019s testimony on the statute-of-limitations issue. Thus, the Board again affirmed Henline\u2019s benefits award. Island Creek has now petitioned this court again for review of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Island Creek first argues that ALJ Les-nick and the Board erroneously concluded that a \u201creasoned\u201d opinion from a doctor was required to ti\u2019igger the three-year statute-of-limitations clock. Whether the ALJ or the Board so concluded is immaterial, however, since the ALJ discredited the only testimony that Henline received any medical opinion \u2014 reasoned or unreasoned \u2014 that would have triggered the limitations clock more than three years prior to the claim, and the Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">Island Creek next contends that ALJ Leland offered flawed analysis regarding his rejection of its experts\u2019 opinions. We conclude, however, that the ALJ reasonably determined that none of Island Creek\u2019s doctors satisfactorily explained why Henline\u2019s total disability was not due to a coal-dust induced disease other than coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. In employing this analysis, the ALJ did not improperly \u201cshift[ ] the burden of proof from the claimant to the employer,\u201d as Island Creek claims he did. Br. of Petitioner, at 19. Rather, he merely concluded that their analysis was incomplete, and therefore that their opinions were not well-reasoned.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">Island Creek also maintains that ALJ Leland erred in crediting the opinions of Drs. Cohen and Rasmussen. We disagree. The ALJ reasonably concluded that these doctors, unlike their counterparts, provided a persuasive and logically complete explanation for them conclusions. While Island Creek\u2019s physicians criticized several aspects of Dr. Cohen\u2019s analysis, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Cohen provided credible and logical responses to the criticisms. The ALJ also plausibly found that Cohen was \u201cthe most qualified with respect to both experience and published research, in addition to his board-certification and B-reader credentials.\u201d J.A. 566. The ALJ properly relied on all of these conclusions in deciding to defer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>opinions of Drs. Cohen and Rasmussen over the opinions offered by Island Creek\u2019s physicians. <em>See Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 211 (4th Cir.2000) (\u201c[I]t is the province of the ALJ to evaluate the physicians\u2019 opinions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">For all the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\"> Island Creek also maintains that the ALJ\u2019s criticism of Dr. Renn\u2019s assessment concerning a history of myocardial infarction and the existence and effect of congestive heart failure was unwarranted. However, there is no indication in the AO's opinion that his resolution of this issue had any bearing on his rejection of Dr. Renn\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
