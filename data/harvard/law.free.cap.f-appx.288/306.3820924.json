We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-26\">In 1994, Firepond, Inc.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a Minnesota-based computer technology firm, entered into an agreement with GM to provide computerized sales and marketing information. The agreement allowed Firepond to terminate if GM failed to make timely payments. In early 2000, a billing dispute arose. Firepond notified GM it intended to terminate the agreement if GM did not cure the default within ten days. GM, believing it had thirty days to bring its accounts current, failed to make payment. Firepond notified GM the agreement was terminated and invited it to renegotiate a new agreement. Firepond and GM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>reached a new agreement which was more favorable to Firepond. GM reluctantly agreed to the new terms but expressly stated it was not in breach and had been coerced into renegotiating.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">GM sued Firepond alleging, among other claims, breach of contract. Firepond tendered defense of the litigation to Chubb under an Electronic and Information Technology Errors or Omissions policy. Chubb refused the tender claiming GM\u2019s complaint did not allege a wrongful act as defined by the policy, and did not allege Firepond negligently failed to perform electronic and information technology services.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Firepond brought this action against Chubb and both sides moved for summary judgment. The district court granted Chubb\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding GM\u2019s breach of contract claim did not allege acts covered by the policy. Specifically, the claim did not allege wrongful acts \u201carising out of\u2019 Firepond\u2019s \u201cperformance or failure to perform electronic and information technology services.\u201d We agree and affirm under 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-15\">. The Honorable Donovan W.
