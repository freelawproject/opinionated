McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), we DENY a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>In 2002, Mr. Lewis was charged with two counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(ii). The actions that formed the basis for Count 1 came about when Mr. Lewis and his companion, Sherman Brown, were stopped in Oklahoma while transporting a large quantity of cocaine to Tulsa. Count 2 arose from Mr. Lewis\u2019s arrest several months later for possession of an unrelated quantity of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Count 2 of the indictment originally charged that Mr. Lewis \u201cdid knowingly and intentionally possess with intent to distribute 56.6 grams or more ... of cocaine base.\u201d The government filed a motion to redact the indictment, however, seeking to remove the reference to a specific drug quantity. Mr. Lewis\u2019s attorney did not object to the redaction and the court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Following a jury trial, Mr. Lewis was convicted on both counts. Mr. Lewis filed a direct appeal, and we affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict on May 18, 2004. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>97 Fed.Appx. 875 (10th Cir.2004) (unpublished). Mr. Lewis then moved to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court denied relief and did not issue Mr. Lewis a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a habeas petitioner must show that his counsel\u2019s conduct \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and that such deficient performance resulted in prejudice to the defense \u2014 that is, \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Mr. Lewis cannot meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Mr. Lewis contends that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to: (1) interview and subpoena Mr. Brown; (2) object to the Presentence Investigation Report\u2019s (PSR) use of crack cocaine rather than powder cocaine in calculating the sentence; (3) object to the redaction of the drug quantity from Count 2 of the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">We already considered on direct appeal whether Mr. Lewis\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to present the allegedly exculpatory testimony of Mr. Brown.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We held that his counsel\u2019s decision \u201cnot to subpoena Brown to testify at trial was objectively reasonable and, in any event, did not prejudice Lewis.\u201d <em>See Lewis, </em>97 Fed.Appx. at 877. Because we already addressed and disposed of this claim, we will not consider it again. <em>See United States v. Warner, </em>23 F.3d 287, 291 (10th Cir.1994) (holding that defendant could not raise issues in a \u00a7 2255 motion that were \u201cpreviously considered and disposed of\u2019 on direct appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">Second, on direct appeal we held that the district court did not err in treating all of the drugs as containing cocaine base when calculating Mr. Lewis\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d). <em>Lewis, </em>97 Fed.Appx. at 878. As we previously pointed out on direct appeal, a drug analyst testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the drugs seized tested positive for cocaine base. <em>See id. </em>Under these circumstances, Mr. Lewis\u2019s counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the PSR\u2019s use of cocaine base in calculating his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Finally, Mr. Lewis contends that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the redaction of the drug quantity in Count 2 of the indictment. We note, first, that Mr. Lewis\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the redaction because drug quantity was not a required element of the offense under \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>237 F.3d 1258, 1262 (10th Cir. 2001). Moreover, even if we were to assume that counsel erred in failing to object to the redaction, Mr. Lewis has failed to demonstrate he suffered prejudice as a result. He contends that he was prejudiced by the redaction because the PSR \u201cinserted a drug amount attributable to [Count 2], and that figure was used in [the] calculation of [Mr. Lewis\u2019s] sentence.\u201d As the district court noted, however, the PSR combined 9.7 grams of cocaine base associated with Count 2 with the 182.676 grams associated with Count 1 to determine his base offense level. The PSR set the base offense level at 34 based on an offense that involved at least 150 grams of cocaine base but less than 500 grams. Even if the amount used in connection with Count 2 were omitted, Mr. Lewis would still have received a base offense level of 34. Accordingly, he has not demonstrated that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S.- at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Reasonable jurists could not debate that Mr. Lewis has failed to present a claim he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. We therefore DENY his application for a COA on this issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-16\">. Mr. Lewis did not file a timely appeal. Rather, he filed an application for COA, which we construe as the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal. <em>See Martin v. Rios, </em>472 F.3d 1206, 1207 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">. Mr. Lewis also made various other arguments before the district court that he does not renew on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\">. While we normally do not consider ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal, we addressed Mr. Lewis's claim because it was \"identified and rejected on the merits by the district court\" and was indeed \"patently frivolous.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>97 Fed.Appx. at 877.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
