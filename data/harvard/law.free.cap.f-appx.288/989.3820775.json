Bocanegra challenges the district court\u2019s determination that she was not entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 because she did not truthfully provide the Government all relevant information concerning her offense. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings concerning a defendant\u2019s eligibility for a sentence under the \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve for clear error. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">A defendant convicted of an offense involving drugs is eligible for a two-level reduction in offense level if she meets the five criteria necessary to qualify for a sentence under the \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve provision. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(9); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>264 F.3d 527, 529-30 (5th Cir.2001). The fifth criterion, the only one at issue here, requires that \u201cthe defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense.\u201d \u00a7 501.2(a)(5); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). The defendant has the burden of showing that she truthfully provided the Government with all relevant information. <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146-47 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">In this case, the district court made an \u201cindependent determination\u201d that Bocanegra had not provided truthful information that qualified her for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457-58 (5th Cir.2006). That determination is not clearly erroneous in light of the implausibility of Bocanegra\u2019s explanation how she became involved in the conspiracy and her description of her encounters with the person who recruited her to transport drugs. <em>See Miller, </em>179 F.3d at 963-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1012-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
