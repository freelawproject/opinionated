Sauls argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint as duplicative of the complaint in case no. 06-CV-276. Sauls reasserts his arguments that his civil rights were violated by verbal threats, false disciplinary proceedings, and seizures of his property from his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-22\">Sauls does not argue, much less show, that the instant suit does not duplicate the claims in district court case no. 06-CV-276. Thus, Sauls has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the lawsuit was repetitious and, therefore, malicious. <em>See Bailey v. Johnson, </em>846 F.2d 1019, 1021 (5th Cir. 1988); <em>See also Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 994-95 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Wilson v. Lynaugh, </em>878 F.2d 846, 850 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-23\">Sauls\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Sauls\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996). The dismissal by the district court of case no. 06-CV-276 as frivolous and for failure to state a claim also counts as a strike under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 387-88. Because Sauls has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
