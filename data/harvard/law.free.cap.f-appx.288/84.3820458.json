He appeals this sentence,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contending that he was improperly denied a departure for substantial assistance, <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2002), and a hearing on the issue. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Guest\u2019s plea agreement provided that the government would move for a departure if his cooperation was deemed substantial by the government. At his sentencing hearing, Guest\u2019s attorney acknowledged that his client had been interviewed, but that the results of his cooperation were as yet unknown, and for that reason the government would not move for a departure. Both defense counsel and the government held out hope for a later motion for sentence reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Unless the government is obligated under the terms of a plea agreement, its decision as to whether the defendant has provided substantial assistance is discretionary. <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir.2000). Guest\u2019s plea agreement leaves the discretion to determine whether he provided substantial assistance warranting a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure with the government. Guest did not object at sentencing to the government\u2019s decision not to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, and the record does not disclose any evidence that the government refused to make the motion based on any unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (holding that \u201cfederal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive.\u201d). Further, Guest has not shown that the government\u2019s decision at sentencing was \u201cnot rationally related to any legitimate Government end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-11\">. The district court granted Guest a late appeal under <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir. 1993), after he filed a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (2000). The court held Guest\u2019s other claims in abeyance pending this appeal. Although Guest has completed his prison term, we retain jurisdiction because he remains on supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-17\"><em>. </em>The government ultimately decided that Guest\u2019s assistance was not substantial, and did not move pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) for a reduction based on substantial assistance. Guest alleged in his \u00a7 2255 motion that the government\u2019s decision not to move for a sentence reduction was arbitrary or made in bad faith. Because this issue is pending before the district court, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
