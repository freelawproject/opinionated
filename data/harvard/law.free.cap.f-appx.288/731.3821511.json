Weisel denying his application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ricardo Widada, </em>No. A96 203 492 (B.I.A. Dec. 27, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 203 492 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 19, 2006). We assume the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">As an initial matter, because Widada failed to exhaust his challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for relief under the CAT, we are without jurisdiction to consider that claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Beharry v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 51, 59 (2d Cir.2003)). We dismiss the petition for review to that extent and review only Widada\u2019s challenge to the denial of his application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Where the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one and then supplements that decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA, \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). Because the BIA found clear error in the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we assume, without determining, Widada\u2019s credibility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland, Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Here, the agency found that the incidents Widada described constituted discrimination and harassment, but did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)\u00a9; <em>see also Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (to constitute persecution, harm to an applicant must be sufficiently severe, rising above \u201cmere harassment\u201d). We find no error in that determination. Widada testified that he was taunted by schoolchildren, asked for money by the police following a motorcycle accident, and slapped by a police officer while at a restaurant. He further claimed that someone painted a derogatory term on his fence, and that a Muslim man knocked his Bible to the ground and spit on it. While disturbing, we cannot find, contrary to the agency, that these incidents constitute persecution, even when viewed cumulatively. <em>See Ai Feng Yuan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005) <em>overruled in pad on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc) (\u201cpersecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive\u201d) (internal citation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm the agency\u2019s past persecution finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">We also find that the agency reasonably determined that Widada failed to establish \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he ... would be persecuted on account of [a protected ground].\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2); <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 105 (2d Cir.2006). Absent a showing of a pattern or practice of persecution against similar persons, an applicant must provide evidence that he or she would be singled out for persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2). Here, the BIA found that Widada had not demonstrated a pattern or practice of persecution against Chinese Christians. Because Widada does not challenge that finding in his opening brief, we deem any such challenge waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Moreover, Widada produced no objective evidence suggesting that he would be singled out for persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>\u00a7 1208.16(b)(2). While the record contains the Department of State\u2019s 2004 International Religious Freedom Report and its 2005 Human Rights Practices Report for Indonesia, these reports are not specific to Widada. Further, as the BIA observed, they indicate that while there is ongoing interreligious conflict in Indonesia, conditions are improving. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006). The agency also properly considered the fact that Widada\u2019s siblings have remained in Indonesia unharmed in finding that he had not shown that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted. <em>See Poradi-sova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 80 (2d Cir. 2005). Thus, there is no merit to Widada\u2019s argument that the agency failed \u201cto acknowledge the reality of the situation in Indonesia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Nor is there merit to Widada\u2019s argument that the BIA applied an improper standard in evaluating his \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution,\u201d by not looking to his objective and subjective fear. This argument conflates the burden of proof for asylum with that for withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 429, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984) (finding that the well-founded fear standard is unique to discretionary claims for asylum); <em>see also Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155-156 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that withholding, unlike asylum, does not require a subjective fear of persecution). Accordingly, the agency properly denied Widada\u2019s withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
