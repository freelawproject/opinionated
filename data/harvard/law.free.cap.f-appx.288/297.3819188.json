The district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Wos was here once before protesting the <em>assessment </em>of income taxes for tax years 1996 and 1997. He claimed then that he provided an \u201ceven exchange\u201d of services for money in those years and thus had not actually generated any \u201cincome\u201d subject to tax. The Tax Court rejected this frivolous contention, and so did we. <em>Wos v. CIR, </em>110 Fed.Appx. 689, 691 (7th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">This time Wos is trying to thwart <em>collection </em>of the taxes assessed for those years. In the summer of 2004, shortly before we issued our last decision, the IRS notified Wos of its intent to levy against his property. Wos was advised that under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330 that he could request a \u201ccollection due process hearing\u201d to raise concerns about the proposed levy. Wos instead requested a \u201cface to face conference\u201d for \u201cverification of the tax liability.\u201d The IRS denied this request as frivolous because the underlying liability no longer was subject to challenge. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). Wos was informed, however, that he could resubmit his request for an in-person hearing if he would agree to limit the discussion to the payment process, but otherwise he would be limited to communicating with the IRS in writing or by telephone. Wos, though, continued to press for an in-person hearing to contest liability, and eventually the IRS Office of Appeals issued a determination authorizing the collection to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-13\">Within 30 days of that determination, Wos filed a civil action in the district court naming the United States as a defendant. Essentially he claimed that the IRS had violated \u00a7 6330 and denied him due process by refusing his demand for a face-to-face hearing to contest the levy. The district court dismissed the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, reasoning that jurisdiction lies exclusively in the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">Wos previously advanced a number of jurisdictional theories that the district court appropriately rejected. Now in this court he apparently acknowledges that what he really seeks to achieve thorough his lawsuit is a \u201cface to face\u201d hearing which, in his view, was required under \u00a7 6330. The district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacks jurisdiction to address this question is reviewed de novo by this court. <em>See St. John\u2019s United Church of Christ v. City of Chi., </em>502 F.3d 616, 625 (7th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>2007); <em>Small v. Chao, </em>398 F.3d 894, 897 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Under \u00a7 6330, the IRS must tell taxpayers that they can request a \u201ccollection due process hearing\u201d before the agency will proceed with a proposed levy. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(a)(l)-(3). The taxpayer \u201cmay raise at the hearing any relevant issue related to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A), but he cannot challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of the underlying tax liability\u201d unless he \u201cdid not receive any statutory notice of deficiency ... or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); <em>see also Kindred v. CIR, </em>454 F.3d 688, 695 (7th Cir.2006). Under the version of \u00a7 6330 in effect when Wos sued, if the Office of Appeals concluded that the intended levy should go foiward, then the taxpayer could \u201cappeal such determination \u2014 (A) to the Tax Court (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter); or (B) if the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction of the underlying tax liability, to a district court of the United States.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The \u201cparty invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of demonstrating its existence.\u201d <em>Hart v. FedEx Ground Pkg. Sys. Inc., </em>457 F.3d 675, 679 (7th Cir.2006). Wos did not meet his burden. The applicable version of \u00a7 6330 gives the Tax Court jurisdiction to review levy determinations if it has jurisdiction, as it does in this case, over the underlying tax liability. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-l(f)(2) Q &amp; A F3 (2006); <em>Wagenkuecht v. United States, </em>533 F.3d 412, 416-17 (6th Cir.2008); <em>Downing v. CIR, </em>118 T.C. 22, 27, 2002 WL 15574 (T.C.2002); <em>accord Voelker v. Nolen, </em>365 F.3d 580, 581 (7th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (holding that \u201ca case involving [unpaid] income taxes ... must be filed with the Tax Court\u201d and affirming district court\u2019s dismissal on jurisdiction grounds of taxpayer\u2019s claim that IRS violated due process in determining income tax liability). And because the Tax Court had jurisdiction, the district court properly found that its jurisdiction was lacking. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">. The authorization for appeal has changed since Wos filed suit. The current version omits all reference to the district court and instead provides that a taxpayer may \u201cappeal such determination to the Tax Court (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction over such matter).\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
