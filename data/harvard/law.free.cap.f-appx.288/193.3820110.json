For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"ayx-dedup-0\">L FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AHF\">A B-l visa allows a \u201cnon-immigrant alien\u201d to come into the United States to conduct business on behalf of a foreign employer. To obtain a B-l visa, the alien submits an application to the U.S. consulate in his home country. The visa lasts <em>for </em>six months and does not allow the alien to work for any U.S. employers. To extend the visa, an alien may file an 1-539 application with the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (\u201cCIS\u201d) in the Department of Homeland Security.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An 1-539 application must include the reason for requesting an extension, any effect it will have on the applicant\u2019s foreign employment or residency, evidence that the applicant\u2019s stay will be temporary, and an explanation of how the alien will support himself <em>(e.q., </em>bank statements). Common- . .. , ., \u2122 ,. ly, an alien submits with his 1-539 applica- ,. . ,, \u201e .. \u201e . . tion a letter from his foreign employer ...... . .... establishing this information. Although such a letter is not required, it is the most common form of documentation and is considered sufficient for this purpose. The aden also must sign the 1-539 form under a statement certifying, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the application and attached documents is \u201ctrue and correct.\u201d At issue in this appeal is an 1-539 visa application.</p>\n<p id=\"AGbk\">T, Liu was employed as a legal assistant anj translator in the office of Yali Huang (\u201cHuang\u201d), an immigration lawyer praetic-\u00a1ng jn Houston. Part of Liu\u2019s responsibilities included collecting the necessary documents for I_539 appiicati0ns. This sometimes involved drafting letters for aliens specifying pertinent information about their foreign employers. For these letters, Liu often would use information from the alien\u2019s business card. Liu testified that she \u201cnearly always\u201d would give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the letter back to the alien to obtain an authorized signature from the alien\u2019s employer. Liu also would sign certificates of accuracy for translations of letters from foreign employers.</p>\n<p id=\"AkD\">This appeal involves Liu\u2019s work on a visa application for Yu Chung Tseng (\u201cTseng\u201d), a confidential informant who went by the pseudonym Chenhong Dai in his dealings with Liu and Huang. Tseng is an alien \u201e m . , , . .. tt i from Taiwan who entered the United States illegally in 2002 and was later approached by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) agents to cooperate in that agency\u2019s investigation of Huang. The agents provided Tseng with a fake Chinese passport and outfitted him with a recording device for his visits to the law 0fgce</p>\n<p id=\"AN5\">Tseng first went to the law office on _. . , \u201e\u201e\u201e\u201e ... . . February 4, 2003, and discussed visa possi- . ,, tt \u201e , . bilities with Huang. On his second visit to ,, . ... \u00b0 , ,o or,.0 tt the law office, on March 12, 2003, Huang , . recommended that Tseng seek a visa ex- , . ... \u201e tension. After meeting with Huang, m . ,. .... T \u2022 r \u2022 Tseng had a conversation with Liu. Liu , . m ,,T , \u201e , . asked Tseng, Is your passport fake? and he responded, \u201cNo, the passport is real but the company, there is no such company.\u201d Liu also asked Tseng, \u201cDo you not have a company over there?\u201d and Tseng responded \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have a company.\u201d Liu told Tseng that he needed a return airline ticket and a letter from a bank showing that he had over $3,000 in an account.</p>\n<p id=\"Aep\">Tseng returned on March 27, 2003, at 1:45 p.m., and presented to Liu several documents an ICE agent had provided to him: a passport, a return airline ticket, a bank statement, and a business card for Hongyun Engineering Operations. Regarding the business card, Tseng told Liu, \u201cit\u2019s a fake one. This was printed by me.\u201d Liu testified that she took this to mean that the information on the business card might be genuine even if the card itself was made by Tseng. Tseng also presented a certificate of deposit from a bank, admitting that he had made the form himself and that it did not come from a bank. Liu told Tseng that if the bank certificate was fake, he should not use it because \u201cthis is the United States.\u201d Liu told Tseng he would need to sign the form and that he should return later in the day.</p>\n<p id=\"AIA\">Tseng returned to the law office at 3:30 \u00b0 that afternoon- There was some dlsPute over what happened regarding the employ-er lettei\u2018 At issue is whether Liu \u00a7ave TsenS a letter to brinS back after his emPloyer siSned or whether Liu presented the lettei for Tseng himself to sign wben he returned to the office. Liu claims she prepared the letter for Tseng to have signed by an authorized representative of , . , , employer. The government contends ,,, T 7 ,, . . , m that Liu drafted the letter and had Tseng \u201e ,, . \u201e , . , , forge the signature of his purported em-. .,,, , ,, ,. ployer. Although the enfire exchange was , , T. , m recorded, Liu and Tseng spoke m Chinese, , \u2019 and Liu and the government present dif\u201e . . \u201e , ferent translations of a key passage, ^ <em>\u00b0</em></p>\n<p id=\"ayy-dedup-0\">Under the government\u2019s translation, Liu said upon Tseng\u2019s return to the office, \u201cI have the letter. Come here and sign.\u201d Liu\u2019s counsel argued that the Chinese pas-sage was properly translated as \u201cHave you brought the letter with you?\u201d During Tseng\u2019s testimony, he was asked to write, in Chinese, what Liu told him when he returned in the afternoon of March 27. The trial interpreter translated the written passage as \u201cLetter is here. Sign.\u201d Later, that same interpreter revised his translation to \u201cLetter is being brought here. Sign your name.\u201d A different translator testifying for the defense opined that the passage could be interpreted as either \u201cHave you brought the letter with you?,\u201d \u201cHere is the letter,\u201d or \u201cLetter is being brought here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Kegardless of which interpretation prevails, Liu and Tseng completed the 1-539 application and submitted it to CIS. In June 2003, Tseng\u2019s application for a visa extension was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"ant-dedup-0\">On October 31, 2006, Liu and Huang were charged in a five-count second superseding indictment with one count of conspiracy in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324 and four counts of visa fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Huang was convicted of all five counts and is not a party to this appeal. Liu was acquitted of the first four counts, but a jury found her guilty of Count Five, which covered Tseng\u2019s visa application. The court imposed a sentence of eighteen months\u2019imprisonment plus two years of supervised release and a $100 special assessment. Liu appeals her conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"akt-dedup-0\">\u201e _________ II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aee\">A. Sufficiency of the evidence</p>\n<p id=\"asn-dedup-0\">\n<em>i. Standard of review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A2E\">Where a defendant objected to the sufficiency of the evidence at the trial level-as Liu did in this case-the standard of review is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable jury could find that the evidence supports the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>476 F.3d 369, 377 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cThe evidence need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, and the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Fuchs, </em>467 F.3d 889, 904 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201cstandard of review does not change if the evidence that sustains the conviction is circumstantial rather than direct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u2018 All reasonable inferences must be drawn, and all credibility determinations made, in the light most favorable to the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"AyJ\">\n<em>i'i- Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">Liu articulates four challenges based on the sufficiency of the evidence to support the julys verdict. First, she contends that the government\u2019s evidence does not SUpport a conclusion that Liu had the eulpable mental state required to be eonvicted of the alleged crime. Liu claims that ,, ., , , , ., there is no evidence she knowingly submitted false information in Tseng\u2019s visa application- Liu notes that the trial evidence actually suggested that she refused to accept falge information fi.om Tseng when ghe toM Mm he should not use the forged bank recordg he attempted to submit.</p>\n<p id=\"AKA\">However, the fact that Liu refused some forged documents does not mean she did not accept others. There also was substantial evidence that Liu knew that Tseng\u2019s application contained false information. According to Tseng\u2019s testimony, he told Liu that he was an air conditioning repair man in China, not an employee at Hongyun Engineering. In fact, Tseng testified that he told Liu that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>such company in China and that his business card bearing the name of that same company was fake. Tseng also testified ,, , , . , . , \u2122 ,, that when he returned to the office on the , <em>c\\n </em>t . . , , . afternoon of March 27, Liu presented him , ,, , , , , . , T, with a letter she had created under Hon- , ,, , , , , , , . , . gyun letterhead and asked him to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad5\">Forensic computer evidence showed that the letter was created on Liu\u2019s computer at 2:47 p.m. and printed at 3:42 p.m. that same day. Because Tseng returned to the office at 3:30, the government argues that the timing of this evidence supports the conclusion that Liu herself created the fraudulent letter, printed it for Tseng, had him forge his employer\u2019s signature, and submitted it with his application. Thus, the government presented substantial in-culpatory evidence, and a reasonable jury could have found that Liu had the requisite mental state to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar7\">Second, Liu argues that because the I-539 form does not require a letter from a foreign employer, Liu was entitled to rely on assurances from Tseng that he was employed by a foreign employer even without a legitimate letter. Liu cites the instructions for filing the 1-539 form, which she notes do not explicitly require a letter from a foreign employer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, by a plain reading of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a), the question of whether the 1-539 instructions required a letter from a foreign employer is immaterial to the question of whether Liu knowingly submitted the form that included false statements. Neither party disputes that Tseng\u2019s certification that all of the materials in his application were true was an untruth. The question at trial was not whether Liu could have relied on Tseng\u2019s statements about his foreign employment, but whether she knowingly submitted false information.</p>\n<p id=\"akp-dedup-0\">\u201e ; \u201e Third, Liu argues that the government \u201e , , established no motive for her to commit immigration fraud. Liu earned $35,000 , . . . , per year for her work and claims she did , . .. .. . . not profit financially from any alleged lm-migration fraud. However, motive is not an element of the charged offense. The government put forth sufficient evidence to prove each element of the offense, and Liu provides no support for her claim that her alleged lack of motive should undermine the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"ALC\">Finajly, Liu contends that the juiys temporary deadlock is an indication that there wag insuff\u00edcient evidence to support the conviction. the time the jury deliberated might be relevant to Liu's challenge to the COurt\u2019s <em>AUen </em>charge, see infra, it is immaterial to Liu's suff\u00edciency of-the-evidence challenge. <em>Marx v. </em>Hart<em>ford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>321 F.2d 70, (25th Cir.1963) (per curiam) ( We cannot an hour-glass over a jury. If the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict the lenSth of time the 3U1T deliberates immaterial. ).</p>\n<p id=\"AVf\">Therefore, we conclude that the jury\u2019s verdjct was supported by the evidence, and \u00a3be djstrict court properly denied Liu\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal,</p>\n<p id=\"aiv-dedup-0\">_ T . . \u00ae' instruct\u2122\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"abu-dedup-0\">Liu challenges the district court\u2019s jury instructions for the first time in this appeal. She alleges that the district court failed to properly define \u201cfalse statement\u201d and erred in submitting a \u201creckless indif-ferenee\u201d instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\n<em>i. Standard of review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">This court reviews a challenge to jury instructions for abuse of discretion if the alleged error was preserved below. <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>281 F.3d 168, 183 (5th Cir.2002). We will not reverse \u201cunless the instructions taken as a whole do not correctly reflect the issues and law.\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>374 F.3d 313, 319 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Where, as here, the appellant did not raise an objection in the trial court, this court reviews for plain error. <em>Id. </em>Plain error occurs when \u201c(1) there is an error, (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affects [the defendant\u2019s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Loso-ya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 441 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if those factors are met, this court has discretion to affirm unless the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>In this case, Liu concedes that she did not properly preserve these objections to the jury instructions at trial, so the plain error standard applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\n<em>ii. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The visa fraud statute requires a showing that the defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d made or presented a \u201cfalse statement\u201d in an application, affidavit, or other document required by the immigration laws. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a). The district court gave the following jury instructions for visa fraud, Counts Two through Five:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Title 18, United States Code, Section 1546(a), makes it a crime for anyone to knowingly subscribe as true any false statement with respect to a material fact in any application or other document required by the immigration laws or regulations or to knowingly present such applications or other documents containing such false statements. In this case, Counts Two through Five of the Indictment charge the defendants with knowingly presenting applications or petitions that contained false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">For you to find a defendant guilty of this crime, you must be convinced that the government has proved each of the following beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n<p id=\"AMl\"><em>First: </em>That the defendant knowingly presented to the Immigration and Naturalization Services or Citizenship and Immigration Services an application or petition required by the immigration laws prescribed thereunder;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\"><em>Second: </em>That the application or petition presented contained a material false statement made under penalty of perjury or knowingly subscribed as true;</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\"><em>Third: </em>That the defendant knew that the false statement made in the submitted application or petition was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">A statement or representation is \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201cfraudulent\u201d if it is known to be untrue or is made with reckless indifference to its truth or falsity. A representation would also be \u201cfalse\u201d when it constitutes a half truth, or effectively conceals a material fact, with intent to defraud.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">Liu first argues that these instructions are incorrect because the definition of \u201c \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018fraudulent\u2019 \u201d does not apply the \u201cwith intent to defi'aud\u201d requirement to the \u201cknown to be untrue\u201d and \u201creckless indifference\u201d clauses of the definition\u2019s first sentence. The visa fraud statute at issue in this case, however, requires only that a defendant act \u201cknowingly\u201d; it contains no requirement of \u201cintent to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>fraud.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a). And no Fifth Circuit precedent compels an \u201cintent to defraud\u201d instruction in a prosecution under this statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Liu next argues that the \u201creckless indifference\u201d language used in the instructions impermissibly lowered the required mental state for this crime below the statutorily defined mental state of \u201cknowingly.\u201d The instructions clearly state that the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt \u201c[t]hat the defendant knew that the false statement made in the submitted application or petition was false.\u201d The next sentence, however, provides that a \u201cstatement or representation is \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018fraudulent\u2019 if it is known to be untrue or is made with reckless indifference to its truth or falsity.\u201d Liu argues that these conflicting statements could have allowed the jury to convict her based on a mens rea lower than \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Liu analogizes to another false statement statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, which defines an offense for an individual who \u201cknowingly and willfully ... makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry\u201d in any matter within the jurisdiction of the federal government. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a). That offense is defined similarly to the visa fraud offense, which defines a crime for \u201cknowingly presenting] any such application, affidavit, or other document which contains any such false statement.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">We have held that \u00a7 1001 \u201crequires proof that the defendant had the specific intent to make a false or fraudulent statement deliberately or at least with reckless disregard of the truth and with the purpose to avoid learning the truth.\u201d <em>United States v. Tamargo, </em>637 F.2d 346, 351 (5th Cm. Unit B Feb.1981). In other words, \u00a7 1001 allows a \u201creckless disregard\u201d instruction only if the defendant also acted \u201cwith the purpose to avoid learning the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have not decided whether the same requirement would apply to \u00a7 1546.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Liu also cites to pattern jury instructions for False Statement to Firearms Dealer, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), and False Statements in Bank Records, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005, both of which define the mens rea and the element of falsity without reference to recklessness. <em>See </em>Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal) \u00a7 2.45 (for \u00a7 922(a)(6): \u201cA statement is \u201cfalse or fictitious\u201d if it was untrue when made and was then known to be untrue by the person making it.\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2.50 (for \u00a7 1005, requiring a showing that \u201cthe defendant made a false entry [in a bank record] ... [and][t]hat the defendant did so knowing it was false\u201d). Notably, however, both of these criminal statutes require proof of an additional intent element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>beyond those required under \u00a7 1546. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6) (requiring a showing that the false statement was \u201cintended or likely to deceive\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1005 (requiring a showing that a false entry was made \u201cwith intent to injure or defraud\u201d). Thus, it is unclear how relevant these instructions are for a statute that lacks that additional intent requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Because Liu never objected to the \u201creckless indifference\u201d language, the district court did not have the opportunity to consider whether it might have been appropriate, thus we review only for plain error. We admit that the jury instructions in this case are not a model of clarity. Nevertheless, we do not believe they constitute plain error. Liu concedes that there was no evidence to support a conclusion that Liu acted recklessly. In addition, the \u201creckless indifference\u201d language arguably modifies only the falsity of a statement by the person making the statement <em>(\u201cmade with </em>reckless indifference\u201d), not the mental state of the person submitting a document that contained the statement, which is unambiguously defined as knowingly. Finally, as discussed above, the prosecution presented overwhelming evidence that Liu knew the statements in the application were false. Therefore, although we might have written the jury instructions differently, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">C. Prosecutorial misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">During the government\u2019s cross-examination of defense witness Yan Song, the husband of Liu\u2019s co-defendant Yali Huang, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">Q Mr. Song, this country has provided a lot of opportunities for you and your wife, hasn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">A Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">Q So given all those opportunities, how does it feel to come into federal court in front of this judge and these 13 jurors and commit perjury?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">The court sustained the defense\u2019s objection and instructed the jury to disregard the comment. The defense immediately moved for a mistrial, which the court denied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Liu appeals that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-17\">\n<em>i. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-18\">The district court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wyly, </em>193 F.3d 289, 298 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-19\">\n<em>ii. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-20\">\u201c \u2018Improper comments by a prosecutor may constitute reversible error where the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is substantially affected.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>522 F.3d 482, 491 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Audrews, </em>22 F.3d 1328, 1341 (5th Cir.1994)). In evaluating a claim of improper arguments, the court asks (1) whether the prosecutor\u2019s remark was legally improper, and if it was, (2) whether the remark prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantive rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-21\">We first consider whether these comments were in fact improper. The offending remarks came after Song made farfetched claims about the legitimacy of Ultra Controls, Inc., a company listed in some of the visa applications relevant to this case. For example, Song agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the prosecutor\u2019s statement that in nine years of the company\u2019s existence, the company had \u201cnever completed a dollar\u2019s worth of transactions.\u201d Song also produced the purported business records of Ultra Controls for its nine years of existence, which was only a three-inch stack of documents. Although letters supporting several visa applications variously stated that Ultra Controls was a printing pallet equipment business, an automotive-related business, and a software company, Song admitted that none of the documents in the business records referred to printing pallet equipment, auto parts, or banking software, nor could he produce any documentation to establish that Ultra Controls was involved in any of these industi\u2019ies.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The government argues that, in this context, it was not improper to ask the \u25a0witness to comment on the truthfulness of his own testimony. The Seventh Circuit has held that although ultimate questions of credibility are for the jury, a prosecutor may \u201cask[ ] a witness to remark on the truthfulness of her own testimony because the witness\u2019s reaction and response are proper fodder for the jury\u2019s credibility determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Freitag, </em>230 F.3d 1019, 1024 (7th Cir.2000). We have held that it is not improper for the government to tell a witness the consequences of committing perjury. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>130 F.3d 676, 687 (5th Cir.1997). We need not decide whether the comment in this case was improper because, even if it was, it did not result in reversible error in the context of this trial because it did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In deciding whether the comment affected Liu\u2019s substantive rights, this court looks to \u201c(1) the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the statements; (2) the efficacy of any cautionary instruction; and (3) the strength of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Lowenberg, </em>853 F.2d 295, 302 (5th Cir.1988). Liu argues that this comment was \u201chighly prejudicial, improperly argumentative and caused undue harm to appellant.\u201d Liu contends that the government\u2019s perjury accusation was unduly prejudicial to an otherwise credible witness and that the district court\u2019s instruction was insufficient to cure the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Taken in light of the entire trial, it is difficult to see how this comment affected Liu\u2019s substantive rights. Song\u2019s testimony related only to his involvement with Ultra Controls, which was relevant only to the counts for which Liu was acquitted. Ultra Controls was referenced as a domestic employer for letters used in some of the visa applications in this case, but not in the application at issue in Count Five. In addition, the court issued an immediate curative instruction, and the prosecution did not refer to the question during closing argument. Furthermore, the substance of Song\u2019s testimony relates in no way to the facts underlying Liu\u2019s conviction, which are substantial and sufficient to support the conviction. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Liu\u2019s motion for a mistrial on prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">D. Extrinsic evidence of prior conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Liu objects to the entry into evidence and questioning surrounding a biographical information form she submitted with her own 1-485 application for permanent U.S. residency that she filed years prior to the facts underlying this case. On the form, Liu stated that she was employed by Amerise, Inc., as an engineer. The address for Amerise was the same as the address listed as Liu\u2019s home addi'ess. The form itself was admitted into evidence without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">During questioning of an ICE agent, the government pointed out that the two ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>dresses were the same and implied that Amerise was not a legitimate company. At that point, in a side bar, the defense objected to use of the form as evidence of wrongful acts under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The prosecution stated that it only sought to establish Liu\u2019s loyalty to her employer and co-defendant, Huang, because Huang had sponsored Liu\u2019s visa application. The court overruled the objection but warned that it would not allow 404(b) evidence to be presented. Thereafter, the prosecution again noted that the address for Liu\u2019s employer, Amerise, was the same as her home address.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Later in the trial, during the government\u2019s cross-examination of Liu, the prosecutor repeated this allegation:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">BY MR. VARNADO:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Q Ms. Liu, isn\u2019t it true that you never worked at a company called Amerise, Inc., and all this is is the same address as your residence here at 6501 Ranches-ter and you falsely claimed to be an engineer in support of your biographical information on your green card application?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">MR. ERVIN: Same objection, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">THE COURT: Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">MR. ERVIN: Relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to cut you off. Go on.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">MR. ERVIN: No. Relevance and violation of 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">THE COURT: Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">THE WITNESS: I didn\u2019t lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">BY MR. VARNADO:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-22\">Q You\u2019re asking this jury to believe that you were an engineer at the Happy Village Apartments?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-23\">A Because the company used that address.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-24\">Q A company just happened to use your address; is that right?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-25\">A The registered office address.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-26\">THE COURT: Of the whole company was at your apartment?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-27\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-28\">BY MR. VARNADO:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-29\">Q Ms. Liu, are you aware that Texas Work Force Commission reports no wages for a company Amerise, Inc.?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-30\">A This is a new company.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-31\">Q Okay. Well\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b225-32\">THE COURT: How new?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-33\">THE WITNESS: 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-34\">At that point, the government sought to introduce a certified copy of the Texas Workforce Commission (\u201cTWC\u201d) records indicating no wages had been paid by Am-erise, Inc. Liu\u2019s counsel objected on the basis of relevancy, and Huang\u2019s counsel objected on the basis of Rule 608 and Rule 404; the court overruled the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-35\">The government persisted in questioning Liu about whether she was legitimately employed by Amerise as an engineer. There was no further defense objection. On redirect, Liu\u2019s counsel elicited testimony that Amerise was a startup company created by Liu and her brother. The company dealt in import and export of electrical equipment, including helping Chinese <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>companies looking for manufacturing in the United States. Liu testified that she used her knowledge of mechanical equipment and metallurgy to help her brother with the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Liu now contends that this line of questioning \u2014 including, presumably, the TWO records \u2014 should not have been admitted under Rule 404(b) or Rule 608(b). In the alternative, Liu argues the evidence should have been excluded as unduly prejudicial under Rule 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>i. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>343 F.3d 511, 517 (5th Cir.2003). If the court finds abuse of discretion, the harmless error doctrine applies. <em>Id. </em>For any evidentiary ruling to be reversible error, the improperly admitted evidence must have substantially prejudiced the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Id. </em>at 519. Admission of evidence without objection at trial is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Duffaut, </em>314 F.3d 203, 209 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\n<em>ii. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">\u201cWhether Rule 404(b) or Rule 608(b) applies to the admissibility of other-act[s] evidence depends on the purpose for which the prosecutor introduced the other-acts evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Tomblin, </em>46 F.3d 1369, 1388 (5th Cir.1995). Rule 404(b) applies if the other-acts evidence is relevant to an issue in the case, such as the intent of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>Rule 608(b) applies when such evidence is used to impeach the witness or to show character for untruthfulness. <em>Id. </em>The government argues that its questioning of Liu\u2019s past truthfulness was proper under Rule 608(b), and Liu\u2019s immigration form and the TWO records were properly admitted under Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Rule 608(b) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness, other than conviction of crime as provided in rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Fed.R.Evid. 608(b). The government concedes that the TWO records could not have been admitted under Rule 608(b), and therefore must have been admitted as substantive evidence of intent under Rule 404(b). <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>505 F.3d 332, 340 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cRule 608(b) does not allow extrinsic evidence of specific instances of misconduct outside of cross-examination. ...\u201d). Similarly, Rule 608(b) would not allow Liu\u2019s own immigration form to be admitted. However, the government contends that its questioning of Liu regarding the truthfulness of her answers in her prior visa application was proper impeachment evidence under Rule 608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">Because Liu testified at trial, her character for truthfulness became an issue, allowing the government to inquire into prior bad acts under Rule 608(b). <em>See Tomblin, </em>46 F.3d at 1388 (\u201cA defendant makes his character an issue when he testifies.\u201d). A prior false visa application would serve to impeach Liu by contradicting her testimony that she had never filed a document with the immigration agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that she knew to be false. The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in finding the government\u2019s cross-examination of Liu on the truthfulness of her answers in her own immigration form permissible under Rule 608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Admission of the actual documents\u2014 Liu\u2019s immigration form and the TWC records \u2014 is a closer call. Rule 404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order,to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). This court employs a two-prong test to review the admissibility of extrinsic evidence under Rule 404(b). <em>Sanders, </em>343 F.3d at 517-18. First, the court must determine whether the evidence is \u201crelevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character, <em>i.e., </em>motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518. Second, \u201cthe evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must meet the other requirements of Rule 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Liu claims that evidence of her answers in her visa application was introduced only as character evidence in an attempt to prove conformity therewith, in violation of Rule 404(b). The government argues that this evidence could have been admitted to show Liu\u2019s intent under 404(b). Because Liu stated in her direct testimony that she did not intend to file false documents, the government claims that evidence suggesting that she previously had filed false documents could be admissible as proof of intent under Rule 404(b). <em>See Morgan, </em>505 F.3d at 340-41. If Liu had previously lied in a visa application, that could undermine her claim that she did not intend to present a false statement in the visa applications at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">This court has previously expounded on the use of Rule 404(b) evidence to show intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">Where the issue addressed is the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the offense charged, the relevancy of the extrinsic offense derives from the defendant\u2019s indulging himself in the same state of mind in the perpetration of both the extrinsic and charged offenses. The reasoning is that because the defendant had unlawful intent in the extrinsic offense, it is less likely that he had lawful intent in the present offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-12\"><em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc). The charged and extrinsic offenses must be similar, and \u201crelevancy is determined by comparing the state of mind of the defendant in perpetrating the respective offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>780 F.2d 1165, 1173 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">In <em>Gordon, </em>for example, evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior attempt to defraud an insurance company was relevant because it showed his intent to defraud as part of his current insurance fraud prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1174. The prosecution alleged that Gordon attempted to defraud his insurer by having two men take his eighteen wheeler tractor-trailer and cut it up into parts so Gordon could collect insurance money on the truck. <em>Id. </em>at 1168. At trial, the gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>eminent offered the testimony of those same two men, who alleged that a month prior to the truck-related fraud, Gordon had asked the men to burn down his house so he could collect insurance money. <em>Id. </em>at 1173. The court concluded that the \u201cstate of mind inherent in the commission of such nearly identical offenses would necessarily be the same,\u201d and therefore, the testimony was relevant under 404(b). <em>Id. </em>at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In this case, the prior alleged offense and the current offense both involve false statements in visa applications involving the visa applicant\u2019s employer. However, that is where the similarity ends. A suggestion that Liu had lied in her own visa application does not bear on a non-character issue in this case, where the major issue in dispute was whether Liu knew the statements in Tseng\u2019s application were false. The proffered evidence at issue functions more as inadmissible character evidence used to prove conformity therewith. In other words, the government basically argues that Liu lied in the past, therefore she must be lying now. This is the type of evidence that is expressly inadmissible under Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Nevertheless, we find that this error was harmless. \u201cAn error is harmless if the reviewing court is sure, after viewing the entire record, that the error did not influence the jury or had a very slight effect on its verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>43 F.3d 117, 123 (5th Cir.1995). The jury acquitted on four other counts but convicted Liu on Count Five, where the evidence was very strong. The disputed evidence could have had no more than a very slight effect on the jury\u2019s verdict, especially given the substantial amount of other inculpating evidence, which included highly persuasive and reliable evidence such as audio recordings and computer records. In addition, Liu\u2019s testimony on redirect \u2014 in which she had a chance to defend the legitimacy of Amerise, Inc.\u2014 removed any possibility of undue prejudice. She had a substantial opportunity to explain the background of Amerise, including why its address was the same as her own and why the company did not appear on TWC records. Therefore, we conclude that this error did not influence the jury\u2019s decision to convict Liu on Count Five.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">E. <em>Allen </em>charge</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The trial concluded and the jury began its deliberations at 4:08 p.m. on Wednesday, February 7, 2007; the judge informed the jury that the court and the attorneys would not be available after 5:00 that evening. The jury deliberated on Thursday, February 8 but did not'reach a verdict. On Monday, February 12, at 11:34 a.m., the jury sent the following note to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">The jury cannot come to a conclusive decision, not guilty or guilty, by all. We voted Thursday afternoon, discussed this morning and voted again. Some votes have changed since Thursday; but we, the jury, are still deadlocked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The government requested an <em>Allen </em>charge,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the defense requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the charge state simply, \u201ccontinue to deliberate.\u201d The court gave the instruction, \u201cPlease continue your deliberations.\u201d At 3:38 that afternoon, the jury sent another note, stating, \u201cWe have unanimous agreement on half the counts. At this point we are hopelessly deadlocked on the other half.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The government requested a modified <em>Allen </em>charge; the defense objected, requesting instead a repetition of the \u201cPlease continue to deliberate\u201d instruction. The court overruled that objection and gave the following instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">I\u2019m going to have a set of instructions for you at this time. I\u2019m going to ask that you continue your deliberations in an effort to agree upon a verdict and dispose of this case. And I have a few additional comments I would like for you to consider as you do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">This is an important case. The trial has been expensive in time, effort, and money to both the defense and the prosecution. If you should fail to agree on a verdict on the remaining counts, the case is left open and must be tried again. Obviously, another trial would only serve to increase the cost to both sides and there\u2019s no reason to believe that the case can be tried again by either side better or more exhaustively than has been tried before you.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Any future jury must be selected in the same manner and from the same source as you were chosen. And there\u2019s no reason to believe that the case would ever be submitted to 12 men and women more conscientious, more impartial, or more competent to decide it or that more or clearer evidence could be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Those of you who believe that the Government has proved the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt should stop and ask yourself if the evidence is really convincing enough given that the other members of the jury are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">And those of you who believe that the Government has not proved the Defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt should stop and ask yourself if the doubt you have is a reasonable one given that other members of the jury do not share your doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">Remember at all times that no juror is expected to yield conscientious opinion he or she may have as to the weight or the effect of the evidence. But remember also that after full deliberation and consideration of the evidence in your case, it\u2019s your duty to agree upon a verdict, if you can do so, without surrendering your conscientious opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">You must also remember that if the evidence in the case fails to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused should have your unanimous verdict of not guilty. You may be as leisurely in your deliberations as the occasion may require and should take all the time which you may feel is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">As I often do \u2014 and I mentioned to the attorneys- \u2014 I want you to turn to Page 3 of the instructions. This is just at the beginning of the instructions, and I want to read it again to you and just remind you.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>You, as jurors, are the judges of the facts; but in determining what actually happened in this case, that is, in reaching your decision as to the facts, it\u2019s your duty to follow all of the rules of law as I explain them to you. You have no right to disregard or give special attention to any one instruction or to question the wisdom or correctness of any rule I may state to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">You must not substitute or follow your own notion or opinion as to what the law is or ought to be. It\u2019s your duty to apply the law as I give it to you regardless of the consequences. It\u2019s also your duty to base your verdict solely upon the testimony and evidence in the case without prejudice or sympathy. That was the promise you made and the oath that you took before being accepted by the parties as jurors in this case and they have the right to expect nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">I will now ask that you retire once again and continue your deliberations with these additional comments in mind to be applied, of course, in conjunction with all of the instructions I\u2019ve previously given to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Thank you. Return and continue your deliberations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The jury was excused to continue deliberations at 3:50 p.m. and returned with its verdict at 1:53 p.m. the following day. On appeal, Liu argues that the <em>Allen </em>instruction in this case was coercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\n<em>i.

Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">District courts have broad discretion to give <em>Allen </em>charges when the jury indicates deadlock. <em>United States v. Rivas, </em>99 F.3d 170, 175 (5th Cir.1996). In reviewing a modified <em>Allen </em>instruction, the court asks whether the charge meets the following requirements: \u201c(1) the semantic deviation from approved <em>Allen </em>charges cannot be so prejudicial to the defendant as to require reversal, and (2) the circumstances surrounding the giving of an approved <em>Allen </em>charge must not be coercive.\u201d <em>Lindell, </em>881 F.2d at 1321 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">Liu argues that the <em>Allen </em>charge coerced the jurors into finding her guilty on Count Five. Liu argues that (1) even a verbatim reading of the approved <em>Allen </em>charge can be deemed coercive based on the circumstances of the case, and (2) the timing of the court\u2019s instruction in this case was coercive because the jury had previously informed the court that they were hopelessly deadlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">Liu relies primarily on <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>468 F.2d 652 (5th Cir.1972).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In <em>Bailey, </em>in deciding whether an <em>Allen </em>charge was coercive, we considered (1) \u201c \u201cwhether the interval between the retiring of the jury and the delivery of the instruction was so short that the trial court abused its discretion in calling the jury back and urging them to reach agreement\u2019 \u201d; and (2) \u201c \u2018whether the period be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tween the delivery of the charge and the rendering of the verdict was so brief as to give rise to an inference that the jury was coerced by the instruction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664 (quoting Note, <em>Due Process, Judicial Economy, and the Hung Jury: A Reexamination of the </em>Allen <em>Charge, </em>53 Va. L.Rev. 123,129-30 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The <em>Bailey </em>court concluded that an instruction given three-and-a-half hours after the jury began deliberations was not coercive, and that the one-and-one-half-hour period between the instruction and the verdict also did not imply coercion. <em>Id. </em>at 664-65 (citing <em>Andrews v. United States, </em>309 F.2d 127, 129-30 (5th Cir.1962) (holding periods of one hour and five minutes before the <em>Allen </em>charge and 25 minutes between the charge and verdict not to be coercive)). Although the <em>Bailey </em>court criticized the <em>Allen </em>charge and pointed out other circuits\u2019 efforts to abolish it or limit its use, it concluded that binding Fifth Circuit precedent approved use of the <em>Allen </em>charge. <em>Id. </em>at 666-69. In Liu\u2019s trial, the jury deliberated for nearly two full days before receiving the full <em>Allen </em>charge and another afternoon and morning before arriving at a verdict. Under <em>Bailey, </em>this timing does not suggest coercion, and the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">F. Obstruction of justice sentence adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Liu\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended an offense level of 11 and criminal history category of I, which correspond to a Guidelines sentencing range of eight to fourteen months. At sentencing, the court applied an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The district court provided the following reasoning for applying this enhancement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">I believe, after sitting and listening to the entire trial, together with most especially this defendant\u2019s testimony at trial, I believe that this defendant testified falsely when she said she did not have the confidential informant sign a fraudulent invitation letter from a Chinese company and that the 1-539 application relating to the extension of his [B-l] visa in her presence. She stated that it was done outside. When the [confidential informant] came to the law office of Yali [Huang] on that afternoon of March 27th, 2003, Ms. Liu claimed that she had previously given this confidential informant the letter and the application, and he returned with it to the office itself. I believe the testimony certainly will flesh out the testimony of this defendant and all of the other testimony in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ame-dedup-0\">The enhancement increased Liu\u2019s sentencing range to twelve to eighteen months.

The Guidelines also state that the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement is not appropriate for inaccurate statements that result from \u201cconfusion, mistake, or faulty memory and, thus, not all inaccurate testimony or statements necessarily reflect a willful attempt to obstruct justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The Supreme Court has held that a district court must establish a factual predicate to apply the obstruction of justice enhancement: \u201c[I]f a defendant objects to a sentence enhancement resulting from her trial testimony, a district court must review the evidence and make independent findings necessary to establish a willful impediment to or obstruction of justice, or an attempt to do the same, under the perjury definition.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 95, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). In <em>Dunnigan, </em>the Court also adopted the definition of perjury from the federal perjury statute as relevant to this inquiry: \u201cA witness testifying under oath or affirmation violates this statute if she gives false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621(1)). In laying the factual predicate, the Court noted that it is \u201cpreferable for a district court to address each element of the alleged perjury in a separate and clear finding,\u201d but it is sufficient for a district court to make a finding of obstruction of justice that \u201cencompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 113 S.Ct. 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Liu argues that because the district court failed to make an explicit finding that Liu\u2019s false statements were material, the court failed to establish the factual predicate for this enhancement. Liu cites <em>United States v. Launj, </em>985 F.2d 1293, 1308 (5th Cir.1993), for the proposition that a district court must make a separate and clear finding on each element of perjury. But <em>Laury </em>imposes no such requirement. In fact, <em>Laury </em>simply cites the <em>Dunnigan </em>standard that a district court must make a finding that encompasses all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Como, </em>53 F.3d 87, 89 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cA separate and clear finding on each element of the alleged perjury, although preferable, is not required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">In this case, the district judge ordered that obstruction of justice be added to the PSR, and then the court adopted the factual findings within the PSR. The PSR\u2019s factual findings became the findings of the district court. <em>United States v. Cabral-Castillo, </em>35 F.3d 182, 186 (5th Cir. 1994). The PSR, as adopted by the district judge, concluded that Liu lied when she testified that she did not have Tseng sign a fraudulent invitation letter from a fictional Chinese company. These facts are a sufficient basis to satisfy the three elements of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">First, the court made a factual conclusion that Liu made a false statement. Second, this court can easily conclude that the statement was material. This court has \u201cupheld an implicit finding of materiality when it determined that the false testimony was obviously \u2018material\u2019 in that it was clearly designed to substantially affect the outcome of the ease.\u201d <em>Como, </em>53 F.3d at 90 (internal quotation marks omitted). Liu notes that the district court found that Liu gave false testimony only with respect to the letter from Tseng\u2019s employer. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>cause such a letter is not a required part of the 1-539 application, Liu argues that her testimony with respect to that letter could not have been material to the prosecution. However, the crime at issue in this case involves knowingly presenting a visa application containing a false statement to the government. Therefore, Liu\u2019s false testimony about whether she knew the employer\u2019s letter was falsified is material to this case because that letter was in fact a part of the 1-539 application, regardless of whether such a letter was a required part of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Third, Liu claims that the district court\u2019s interpretation of her testimony as false turns on a disputed translation of the recorded conversation between Liu and Tseng. However, there was other evidence to suggest that Liu was aware that Tseng was misrepresenting his foreign employment. For example, the forensic computer evidence shows that Liu created the employment letter on her own computer and printed it <em>after </em>Tseng returned to the office a second time on the afternoon of March 27, 2003. This evidence belies Liu\u2019s claim that she printed the letter earlier and gave it to Tseng to have signed by an authorized representative of his employer. Therefore, the district court\u2019s factual finding that Liu lied in her testimony encompassed all of the factual predicates for a finding of perjury, and the district court did not commit clear error in applying the obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">G. Rule <em>33 </em>motion for new trial</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>i Standard, of Revie w</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 33 motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dula, </em>989 F.2d 772, 778 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\n<em>ii. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">A district court may grant a new trial \u201cif the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 33(a). On appellate review, however, this court is limited to the question of \u201cwhether or not the district court\u2019s ultimate decision in granting or denying the motion for a new trial constituted a clear abuse of its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Tarango, </em>396 F.3d 666, 672 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cIn our capacity as an appellate court, we must not revisit evidence, reevaluate witness credibility, or attempt to reconcile seemingly contradictory evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Dula, </em>989 F.2d at 778-79).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">Here, Liu presents miscellaneous reasons that she should be granted a new trial in the interests of justice or, alternatively, to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. First, she argues that the alien witnesses who testified against her are not credible because they had all committed immigration fraud and were seeking to curry favor with the government. Liu speculates that, in exchange for then- testimony, those witnesses were granted immunity and allowed to work legally in the United States. However, it is clear that the jury \u2014 and the district judge \u2014 already made this credibility determination, and <em>Tarango </em>dictates that such determinations are not to be second guessed on appellate review. <em>Tarango, </em>396 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Second, Liu repeats her contention that the <em>Allen </em>charge unduly coerced the twice deadlocked jury to a reach verdict. However, as we have already noted, the district court did not err in issuing its <em>Allen </em>charge. Because Liu has shown no abuse of discretion, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of her Rule 33 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Liu\u2019s conviction and sentence. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ahc\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The jury heard the testimony of an adjudications officer with the CIS, who noted that although such a letter does not need to be from the applicant\u2019s employer, the most common form of documentation used to support a visa extension request is a letter from a foreign employer,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\">. The district court adapted the Fifth Circuit pattern jury instructions for mail fraud in defining the required mental state for visa fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b222-6\">. Liu contends that several Fifth Circuit cases require this instruction, citing <em>United States v. Dillman, </em>15 F.3d 384, 393 (5th Cir.1994) (requiring a showing of \"intent to defraud\u201d in jury instructions in a bank fraud prosecution); <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>876 F.2d 1113, 1119\u2014 20 (5th Cir.1989) (same); and <em>United States v. Chavis, </em>772 F.2d 100, 108 (5th Cir.1985) (requiring a showing of \"intent to defraud\u201d in jury instructions in a mail fraud prosecution). However, these cases all apply to different criminal statutes that do include \"intent to defraud\u201d elements. <em>Dillman </em>and <em>Gunter </em>were prosecutions under tire bank fraud statute, which applies to a defendant who \"knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice ... to defraud....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344(1); <em>see also United States v. Saks, </em>964 F.2d 1514, 1518 (5th Cir.1992) (discussing how the \"scheme to defraud\u201d language of \u00a7 1344 requires a showing of intent to defraud). <em>Chavis </em>was a prosecution for mail fraud, which also is defined as including a \"scheme or artifice to defraud.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">.
