MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b567-20\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this court has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-21\">Appellants Dennis Smith and Bruce Smith initiated an action in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado by filing a document captioned, \u201cPrivate Case to Appropriate Suitor\u2019s Superior Claim.\u201d The matter was dismissed without prejudice on August 22, 2007, after Appellants failed to comply with the district court\u2019s order instructing them to cure deficiencies. Eight months later Appellants filed a document with the district court titled, \u201cNotice of Conditions Precedent.\u201d The court entered a minute order finding the document both inappropriate and incomprehensible. Appellants were warned that any further inappropriate pleadings they file in the matter will be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-22\">Appellants filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal seeking to challenge the district court\u2019s minute order. Their appellate briefs do not contain any reasoned argument that the court\u2019s minute order is a final decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 or immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>appealable under any exception to the final judgment rule. Appellants do not assert that they have been prevented from filing any additional pleadings with the district court or argue that their document titled \u201cNotice of Conditions Precedent\u201d is a properly filed motion pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Dennis Smith\u2019s motion and Bruce Smith\u2019s motion seeking to proceed <em>in forma pau-peris </em>on appeal are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
