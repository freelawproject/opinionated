We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">The agency abused its discretion in concluding that Vu\u2019s motion to reconsider did not establish \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l) to excuse his failure to appear at his removal hearing. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.2002) (the agency \u201cshould not deny reopening of an in absentia deportation order where the denial leads to the unconscionable result of deporting an individual eligible for relief from deportation\u201d). Vu \u201cdiligently appeared for all of his previous healings,\u201d \u201ccould have easily misunderstood the [date] of the [missed] hearing,\u201d and had an immediate relative visa petition approved shortly after his in absentia removal order. <em>See id. </em>(stating that in like circumstances the agency should not \u201crequire] the deportation of an individual with a valid claim for relief from deportation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">We grant the petition for review and remand for the agency to revisit Vu\u2019s contention that he is not removable, with reference to our intervening case law, <em>see, e.g., Cuevas-Gaspar v. Gonzales, </em>430 <em>F.3d </em>1013 (9th Cir.2005), and Vu\u2019s claims that he is eligible for adjustment of status and relief under former \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b444-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
