Sept. 27, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Ordinarily this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001). Here, however, Yang does not challenge the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen his proceedings sua sponte, and fails to renew the due process arguments he raised before the BIA, thereby leaving nothing for us to review. A petitioner\u2019s attorney must \u201cinclude his most cogent arguments in his opening brief, upon pain of otherwise finding them waived.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. SEC, </em>406 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.2005). Where the petitioner has been represented by counsel throughout these proceedings, \u201cit is not our obligation to ferret out [his] arguments. That, after all, is the purpose of briefing.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. SEC, </em>406 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, because we do not find that manifest injustice would result if we decline to reach the BIA\u2019s September 2007 order, we deem waived any challenge thereto. <em>See Yueq-ing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Because Yang has effectively waived any challenge to the issues this Court would be \u201cempowered to review,\u201d the petition for review must be denied. <em>See Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007) (denying petition where applicant failed to raise \u201cany of the issues relevant\u201d to BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">In his brief, Yang argues that his proceedings should have been reopened in light of changed country conditions in China that would place him in danger by virtue of the birth of his two children. We lack jurisdiction to review that claim, however, where it was not presented to the BIA in the motion to reopen that is the subject of the instant petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see generally Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir.2005). We note that Petitioner\u2019s counsel, Gary Yerman, has numerous petitions for review pending in this Court that challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen based on changed country conditions in China. The BIA decision in this case, however, was not one of them. To the extent that Attorney Yerman\u2019s brief refers to evidence Yang did not present and findings that the BIA did not make in this case, it is apparent that he has submitted a boilerplate brief not tailored to the facts of his client\u2019s case. Future briefing of this quality may result in referral to this Court\u2019s Grievance Panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
