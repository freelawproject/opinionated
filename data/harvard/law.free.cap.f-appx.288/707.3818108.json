Because McReynolds\u2019s sole argument on appeal relates to issues over which we do not have jurisdiction, <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), we <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-25\">Our jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Veterans Court is strictly limited to questions of law and constitutional issues; we have no jurisdiction to review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>McReynolds does not contend that the Veterans Court\u2019s decision involved the validity or interpretation any statute or regulation. Nor does he allege that this case presents any constitutional issues. Rather, McReynolds\u2019s sole statement on appeal relates to the Board\u2019s allegedly erroneous finding that there was no service connection. Any arguments supporting this allegation would relate to factual determinations and the application of law to facts\u2014 issues outside the scope of our jurisdiction. Accordingly, because McReynolds fails to present an issue over which we have jurisdiction, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
