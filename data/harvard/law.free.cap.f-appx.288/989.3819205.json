He argues, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence is error because he should have received a safety-valve reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The Government moves for summary af-firmance or dismissal, urging that the appeal is barred by the waiver-of-appeal provision of Buckett\u2019s plea agreement. Alternatively, the Government seeks an extension of time to file a merits brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-22\">Our review of the record shows that Buckett\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary and that, under the plain language of the plea agreement, the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 445-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Buckett\u2019s appeal waiver bars review of the issue he seeks to raise on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-23\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the Government\u2019s motions for dismissal or an extension of time are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1011-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
