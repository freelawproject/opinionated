The district court dismissed the complaint as barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The district court also denied Kelly\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-22\">Kelly\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). However, Kelly does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint. Because he fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, any such argument is abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-23\">Kelly has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir. 1983). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Both the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Kelly has one previous strike. <em>See Kelly v. Dallas Co. Sheriffs and Medical Dep\u2019t, </em>No. 3:95-CV-0062-P (N.D.Tex. May 28, 1996). Because Kelly has accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1015-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
