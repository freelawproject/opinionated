The IJ found that petitioners had not established that they were refugees \u201cas defined by the statute\u201d and had not \u201cbeen persecuted by anyone for any of the five reasons [\u2018race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u2019<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] set forth above.\u201d The BIA agreed. The petitioners challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of them request for asylum, urging that substantial evidence does not support the determination that they did not suffer past persecution or did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of political opinion. The petitioners maintain that neither the BIA nor the IJ addressed their claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Finally, they contend that the I J\u2019s reference to the Colombian terrorist guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or \u201cthe FARC,\u201d as a gang problem was a fundamental flaw and not mere harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">In <em>INS v. </em>Elias-Zacarias,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Court held that forced recruitment by guerillas was not persecution based on political opinion because the alien\u2019s refusal to join the movement was not based on his political opinion but on his fear of retaliation by the Government if he joined. This court, in reliance on <em>Elias-Zacmias, </em>has held that persecution because of a refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>fight with a particular group, absent demonstration of persecution based on a petitioner\u2019s political opinion or membership in a social group, is not persecution on account of political opinion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To persuade us that the FARC\u2019s alleged persecution was a result of the petitioners\u2019 political opinion or membership in a social group, the petitioners must point to some evidence of the FARC\u2019s motives in targeting them for recruitment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that the \u201creasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record, considered as a whole,\u201d fails to support \u201cthe decision\u2019s factual findings.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If petitioners establish a political opinion or membership in a social group, they must also show \u201cthat the record also compels the conclusion that ... [they have] a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 \u201d of persecution \u201cbecause <em>of </em>that political opinion\u201d or membership in a group, \u201crather than because of [them] refusal to fight\u201d with the FARC.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The petitioners potentially showed that they held a political opinion, but the record evidence does not compel a conclusion that they were recruited because of them political opinion. Mauro, speaking for himself and his younger brother, testified that he \u201cdid not want to be a part of them [the FARC]\u201d because \u201cthis is a terrorist group and my aspirations are very different from the aspiration of a terrorist group.\u201d This, to some extent, distinguishes him from the petitioner in <em>Elias-Zacarias </em>who testified only about fear of recruitment-stating that he \u201cdid not want to join the guerrillas because the guerrillas are against the government and he was afraid that the government would retaliate against him and his family if he did join the guerrillas.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, even if petitioners\u2019 testimony about holding different aspirations from the FARC is sufficient to establish that petitioners have a political opinion, they have not produced evidence that the FARC knew of or targeted petitioners as a result of their opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The evidence shows that petitioners never communicated with the FARC, aside from receiving letters under their door and hearing someone, whom they believed to be from the FARC, yelling outside of their door and banging on the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Petitioners may also have presented evidence that they were members of a social group, assuming children who resist recruitment by the FARC<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> can be defined as a \u201csocial group\u201d under \u00a7 1101,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>simply individuals who do not wish to join a guerrilla group. Petitioners presented paper evidence that the FARC has targeted children, and that children have resisted the FARC\u2019s recruitment efforts or turned themselves in to authorities after being recruited. Petitioners were young\u2014 ages 17 and 15 \u2014 when they began receiving the FARC recruitment letters. But even if petitioners have presented evidence that the FARC\u2019s motivation in targeting them was <em>because </em>o/their status in a social group \u2014 a conclusion that is not compelled based on the evidence \u2014 the BIA found that petitioners had not established a well-founded fear of persecution, and this was not in error. The BIA\u2019s determination \u201ccan be reversed only if the evidence presented by ... [petitioners] was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s \u201cconclusion that the respondent does not have a well founded fear of a clear probability of persecution if returned to Colombia,\u201d finding that \u201cattempted forced recruitment does not constitute persecution.\u201d This finding buries the subtler point that forced recruitment on account of affiliation with a social group could, with a showing of the requisite well-founded fear, constitute persecution. Petitioners on appeal point to the strong language in the letters, such as \u201cthis is not a game,\u201d \u201cthis is the last opportunity,\u201d \u201cyou are making us lose our patience for the last time we\u2019ll be waiting for you,\u201d and \u201cyou will regret it for not paying attention.\u201d They also argue that \u201cthe FARC multiplied its threat with midnight home-visiting and door banging in [a] threatening manner.\u201d But more is needed for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u201cBecause the IJ credited ... [petitioners\u2019] testimony, ... [their] subjective fear of persecution is not at issue and our review focuses on the objective reasonableness of ... [their] fear.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cThe well-founded fear standard does not require an applicant to demonstrate that he <em>will </em>be persecuted if returned to his native country, but rather, requires that he establish persecution as a \u2018reasonable possibility.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> To establish the objective reasonableness of a well-founded fear of persecution, an applicant must prove that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5Q\">(1) he possesses a belief or characteristic a persecutor seeks to overcome by means of punishment of some sort; (2) the persecutor is already aware, or could become aware, that the alien possesses this belief or characteristic; (3) the persecutor has the capability of punishing the alien; and, (4) the persecutor has the inclination to punish the alien.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX_\">Petitioners did not show that the FARC targeted them because of their political opinions, and the evidence presented by petitioners does not compel a finding that the FARC is or has become aware that they are children who resist recruitment by the FARC. Petitioners are no longer \u201cchildren\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and have presented insufficient evidence to compel a conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>they now possess \u201ca belief or characteristic a persecutor seeks to overcome by means of punishment of some sort.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nineteen and twenty-two year olds may still be considered as targets for FARC recruitment, but petitioners\u2019 age and the FARC\u2019s attempted recruitment of petitioners in Colombia does not compel a conclusion that \u201cit is more likely than not that ... [petitioners\u2019] \u2018life or freedom would be threatened ... because of ... [their] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u2019 \u201d upon return.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In sum, petitioners have not shown that they \u201cwill be persecuted ... based on ... [their] political opinion or social gi\u2019oup, \u2018rather than because of ... [their-] refusal to fight with\u2019 \u201d the FARC.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The petitioners further argue that the IJ and the BIA failed to address the issue of whether they established a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to Colombia. Both the IJ and BIA addressed the issue.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Finally, the petitioners have not shown that the BIA erred in determining that the IJ\u2019s single reference to \u201cgang\u201d problems in Columbia was \u201cmerely semantic and therefore a harmless error.\u201d The IJ\u2019s decision reflects that she was aware that the FARC was a terrorist organization. The IJ discussed, for exam-pie, \u201cthreats he [Mauro] received from the guerrillas, the FARC, which is the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\u201d and referred to the FARC as a \u201cterrorist group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">The petitioners, who are represented by counsel, do not challenge the denial of them request for withholding of removal or relief under CAT. These issues are deemed abandoned.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b157-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
