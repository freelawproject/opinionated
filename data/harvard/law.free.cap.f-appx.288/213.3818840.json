Ibanez-Martinez, who has been a fugitive since the selection of the jury, was tried and sentenced in absen-tia. The record reflects that the district court based its decision on the difficulty in rescheduling the trial; the burden on the Government and the Government\u2019s key witness, who was under a hold by the Department of Homeland Security; and the unlikelihood that Ibanez-Martinez would return or be captured in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The Government contends that this court should dismiss Ibanez-Martinez\u2019s appeal pursuant to the \u201cfugitive disentitlement doctrine.\u201d Counsel for Ibanez-Mar-tinez does not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The \u201cfugitive disentitlement doctrine\u201d is an equitable doctrine that \u201climits a criminal defendant\u2019s access to the judicial system whose authority he evades.\u201d <em>Bagwell v. Dretke, </em>376 F.3d 408, 410-13 (5th Cir. 2004) (internal citation omitted). Ibanez-Martinez has not been returned to custody since he became a fugitive on September 24, 2007. Under the circumstances, dismissal of Ibanez-Martinez\u2019s appeal is appropriate. It is unlikely that Ibanez-Mar-tinez will return, under his own volition or otherwise, in the foreseeable future. Dismissal of this appeal is further supported by enforceability concerns, as any judgment on review may be impossible to enforce, and would serve an important deterrent function and \u201cadvance an interest in efficient, dignified appellate practice.\u201d <em>Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 234, 240-42, 113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581 (1993); <em>see Bagwell, </em>376 F.3d at 410-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5ti-i Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
