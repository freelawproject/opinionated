The BIA concluded that Wu\u2019s conviction for trafficking in counterfeit labels, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318, was a crime involving moral turpitude and therefore Wu was inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). The BIA also concluded that the offense of trafficking in counterfeit labels under \u00a7 2318 is an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R) because such conduct \u201crelated to counterfeiting,\u201d making Wu ineligible for cancellation of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b, and waiver, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">\u201c[A]ny alien convicted of, or who admits having committed, or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of ... a crime involving moral turpitude (other than a purely political offense) or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime ... is inadmissible.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I). To determine whether a crime involves moral turpitude, we apply the \u201ccategorical\u201d approach set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the purpose of which is to assess whether the statute of conviction is narrower than or equal to the generic definition of moral turpitude. <em>See Navarro-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1063, 1067-68 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). If so, the conviction necessarily is for a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">Offenses involving fraud are crimes of moral turpitude. <em>Id. </em>at 1074 (Reinhardt, J., concurring for the majority of the court). Even if intentional fraud is not an explicit element of the offense, as in this case, a crime involves fraud if \u201cthe nature of the crime is inherently fraudulent,\u201d which we have defined as involving \u201cknowingly false representations made in order to gain something of value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">Wu pleaded guilty to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318 (1996), which proscribed \u201cknowingly traffic[king] in a counterfeit label affixed or designed to be affixed to\u201d a specified set of materials. A guilty plea under \u00a7 2318 is categorically a plea to an inherently fraudulent crime because the statute of conviction\u2019s elements fit within the definition of inherently fraudulent conduct, which is knowingly making false representations in order to gain something of value. First, counterfeit labels are by definition false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>representations because they \u201cappear[ ] to be genuine, but [are] not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2318(b)(1). Persons who traffic in such materials knowing them to be counterfeit perpetuate the false representation, as they are knowingly passing off counterfeit material as real. Second, according to \u00a7 2318, the term \u201ctraffic\u201d means \u201cto transport ... as consideration for anything of value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2318(b)(2). Therefore, the act of trafficking is done necessarily \u201cto gain something of value.\u201d <em>Navarro-Lopez, </em>503 F.3d at 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Wu contends that a conviction under \u00a7 2318 is not a categorical fit to punish fraud because it also encompasses conduct by sellers who sell to willing buyers of counterfeit goods. We held in <em>Tall v. Mu-</em>kasey, 517 F.3d 1115, 1119-20 (9th Cir. 2008), that a petitioner\u2019s state conviction for willfully manufacturing, intentionally selling, or knowingly possessing for sale any counterfeit trademark is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude because all conduct punished by the statute is inherently fraudulent. Analogizing such a crime to a species of theft, we concluded that such crimes are categorically inherently fraudulent because the commission of such crime \u201cnecessarily defrauds the owner of the mark, or an innocent purchaser of the counterfeit items, or both.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1120. Under <em>Tall, </em>then, the definition of \u201cinherently fraudulent\u201d also encompasses willing buyers of counterfeit goods. Therefore, the BIA correctly concluded that Wu is inadmissible for having committed a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The BIA also found Wu ineligible for cancellation of removal and waiver of inadmissibility because it concluded that his guilty plea under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2318 was for an offense \u201crelating to counterfeiting,\u201d and therefore qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R). Section 2318 is categorically a counterfeiting statute, as the objects it concerns are \u201ccounterfeit labelfs],\u201d the end product of counterfeiting. What the statute actually addresses are those who \u201cknowingly traffic[] in\u201d such labels. Under an ordinary meaning of \u201crelating to,\u201d trafficking in counterfeit labels would be an activity relating to counterfeiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Wu argues that \u00a7 2318 is not categorically a counterfeiting statute because it also criminalizes the use of \u201cillicit labelfs].\u201d While the current version of \u00a7 2318 proscribes the trafficking in of \u201cillicit label[s],\u201d the version of \u00a7 2318 in effect when judgment was entered against Wu did not. <em>See </em>Intellectual Property Protection and Courts Amendments Act of 2004, Pub.L. No. 108-482, \u00a7 102(a)(1), (a)(5), 118 Stat. 3912, 3914. Therefore this argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Moreover, in <em>Albillo-Figueroa v. INS, </em>221 F.3d 1070, 1073-74 (9th Cir.2000), we held that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472, which criminalizes use or possession of counterfeit bills, qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R) because it was an offense relating to counterfeiting. In so holding, we concluded that \u201c[s]ection 101(a)(43)(R) necessarily covers a range of activities beyond those of counterfeiting or forgery itself.\u201d <em>Albillo-Figueroa, </em>221 F.3d at 1073; <em>see also Vizcarra-Ayala v. Muka-sey, </em>514 F.3d 870, 877 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201c \u2018[Relating to\u2019 has been applied to include activities ancillary to the core offense \u2014 for example, possession of counterfeit or forged documents, <em>Albillo-Figueroa v. INS, </em>221 F.3d 1070 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Richards v. Ashcroft, </em>400 F.3d 125 (2d Cir.2005); knowing use of a counterfeit mark, <em>Park v. Attorney General, </em>472 F.3d 66 (3d Cir.2006); and forging documents with the intent to \u2018deceive,\u2019 as opposed to the traditional \u2018defraud,\u2019 <em>Drakes v. Zim-ski, </em>240 F.3d 246 (3d Cir.2001).\u201d). By pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>nalizing those who knowingly traffic in counterfeit labels, \u00a7 2318, like the statute of conviction in <em>Albillo-Figueroa, </em>\u201cseeks to discourage [the act of] counterfeiting through the criminalization of the use of its end product.\u201d <em>Albillo-Figueroa, </em>221 F.3d at 1073.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Wu\u2019s Petition for Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b451-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
