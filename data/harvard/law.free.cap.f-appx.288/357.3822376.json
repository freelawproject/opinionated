We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">We review a district court\u2019s decision in a social security case <em>de novo. Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir.2005). The Commissioner\u2019s disability determination should be upheld unless the decision contains legal error or is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Stout v. Comm\u2019r of Social Sec. Admin., </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2006); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Desrosiers v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>846 F.2d 573, 577 (9th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cWhere evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation,\u201d the ALJ\u2019s decision should be upheld. <em>Burch, </em>400 F.3d at 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">McFarland first argues that the ALJ erred by failing to consider McFarland\u2019s global assessment of functioning (\u201cGAF\u201d) scores. McFarland\u2019s medical records included three GAF scores of 50, which according to the scale, indicate \u201cserious symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, severe obsessional rituals, frequent shoplifting) OR any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., no friends, unable to keep a job).\u201d Am. Psychiatric Ass\u2019n, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (4th ed. 2000). The Commissioner has determined the GAF scale \u201cdoes not have a direct correlation to the severity requirements in [the Social Security Administration\u2019s] mental disorders listings.\u201d 65 Fed.Reg. 50,746, 50,765 (Aug. 21, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">For substantially the same reasons set forth by the district court, we find the ALJ\u2019s failure to address the three GAF scores specifically does not constitute legal error. The ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment took into account McFarland\u2019s mental impairments, was not inconsistent with McFarland\u2019s three limited duration GAF scores, and was supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">Second, McFarland argues the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment was inconsistent with the assessment of McFarland\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Douglas Kirkpatrick, concerning McFarland\u2019s limited cervical range of motion. We disagree. Dr. Kirkpatrick assessed McFarland\u2019s cervical range of motion to be 10-20% of normal on August 16, 2001; however, later, on February 5, 2002, Dr. Kirkpatrick noted McFarland\u2019s range of motion had improved to 50% of normal. Scott Oldfield, N.P., who examined McFarland in October and December of 2003 found diminished cervical range of motion but found that McFarland possessed full range of motion for the most pai\u2019t. In addition, Dr. Martin Kehrli, who reviewed McFarland\u2019s medical records, noted that McFarland admitted to performing under-the-table mechanic work, including working under cars, which, along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>with McFarland\u2019s other reported activities of daily living, was inconsistent with McFarland\u2019s claimed limitations. \u201cWhere evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, it is the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that must be upheld.\u201d <em>Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 679 (9th Cir.2005). We find the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of McFarland\u2019s cervical limitations is supported by substantial evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Third, McFarland argues the ALJ improperly considered equivalence at step three of the sequential evaluation. Step three requires an ALJ to consider whether a claimant\u2019s impairments meet or equal a listed impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920(a)(4)(iii). We find the ALJ gave a sufficient explanation for his finding that McFarland\u2019s impairments neither singularly nor in combination met or equaled a listing. <em>See Gonzalez v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir.1990) (finding the ALJ\u2019s discussion of equivalence sufficient despite the ALJ\u2019s failure to \u201cstate what evidence supported the conclusion that appellant\u2019s impairments do not meet or exceed the Listing of Impairments.\u201d). We find the ALJ\u2019s determination at step three is supported by substantial evidence on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Finally, McFarland claims the ALJ failed to consider medication side effects. However, McFarland points to no specific evidence in the record where he complained of medication side effects. To the contrary, the record is replete with statements by McFarland to medical care providers that he was not experiencing side effects from his various medications. Thus, we find the ALJ did not err in failing to address side effects of medication in his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">We find the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record, and the district court\u2019s order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b381-10\"> The Honorable Lyle E.
