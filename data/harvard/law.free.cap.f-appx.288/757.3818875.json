Woods asserts that summary judgment was unwarranted because she had demonstrated material issues of disputed fact on Title VII claims of (1) a racially hostile work environment, (2) racially discriminatory termination, and (3) unlawful retaliation. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">At the outset we note that, even though the district court\u2019s 49-page summary judgment opinion reviews and analyzes the evidence with characteristic thoroughness, we are obliged to undertake <em>de novo </em>review, and we will affirm only if the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, reveals no genuine issue of material fact. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48,106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Ollman v. Special Bd. of Adjustment No. 1063, </em>527 F.3d 239, 245 (2d Cir.2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-16\">1. <em>Racially Hostile Work Environment</em></p>\n<p id=\"a9s-dedup-0\">Woods submits that the district court erred in concluding that she failed to adduce evidence sufficient to permit a fact finder to infer that racial animus informed the hostility she encountered in her work environment. <em>See Richardson v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Corr. Serv., </em>180 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>426, 440 (2d Cir.1999), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). On <em>de novo </em>review, we reach the same conclusion as the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In essence, Woods asserts a hostile work environment based on two circumstances: disrespectful comments and insubordinate actions by teachers under her supervision, and the failure of Woods\u2019s superiors to discipline these teachers. Woods submits that an inference of racial animus in these circumstances could be inferred from a number of facts: (a) when she assumed administrative responsibilities, the school\u2019s principal told her \u201cthere may be some people who will not accept you because of the color of your skin,\u201d (b) all of the teachers who repeatedly showed her disrespect were Caucasian, (c) a supervisor told Woods that certain teachers had complained that Woods \u201cwent to the NAACP on them,\u201d and (d) that same supervisor told Woods that she had previously \u201cfaced racist conduct from teachers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">As the district court correctly noted, the last two facts cannot be considered because they relied on hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)(1) (stating that affidavit opposing summary judgment \u201cmust be made on personal knowledge, set[ting] out facts that would be admissible in evidence\u201d); <em>Feingold v. New York, </em>366 F.3d 138, 155 n. 17 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cIn reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, ... we may only consider admissible testimony.\u201d); <em>see also Patterson v. County of Oneida, </em>375 F.3d 206, 222 (2d Cir.2004) (finding that hearsay evidence regarding another person\u2019s tolerance for racial behavior was \u201cnot competent evidence in opposition to summary judgment\u201d). As for the first fact, the principal\u2019s statement as to possible future discrimination by unspecified persons might have provided a basis for further discovery as to the facts informing his prediction to see if a link might be inferred from those facts to the conduct subsequently complained of by Woods. But, by itself, the principal\u2019s con-clusory prediction as to the possibility of racial bias is insufficient to permit an inference that such bias did, in fact, inform any particular conduct experienced by Woods, much less \u201cpermeat[e]\u201d her work environment. <em>See Williams v. County of Westchester, </em>171 F.3d 98, 100 (2d Cir. 1999); <em>see also Holcomb v. Iona Coll., </em>521 F.3d 130, 137 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cEven in the discrimination context, ... a plaintiff must provide more than conclusory allegations to resist a motion for summary judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Woods mistakenly relies on <em>Alfano v. Costello, </em>294 F.3d 365 (2d Cir.2002), to support an argument that race-neutral incidents can be sufficient, by themselves, to permit an inference of discrimination. <em>Al-fana\u2019s </em>observation that \u201cincidents that are facially sex-neutral may sometimes be used to establish a course of sex-based discrimination\u201d presumed evidence of \u201cmultiple acts of harassment, some overtly sexual and some not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375. It is Woods\u2019s failure to point to evidence of any act infected by racial bias that compels summary judgment in favor of defendants on her hostile-work-environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">2. <em>Discriminatory Termination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Woods asserts that the district court erred in concluding that, under the burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), she failed to adduce evidence sufficient to satisfy the fourth factor of a <em>prima facie </em>case, <em>i.e., </em>discharge under circumstances giving rise to an inference of racial discrimination. <em>See Patterson v. County of Oneida, </em>375 F.3d at 221. Woods submits that such an inference could be drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>from the fact that, while she was terminated for violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g, other employees who violated that statute were not. <em>See Chuliam v. Long Island R.R., </em>230 F.3d 34, 39 (2d Cir.2000) (holding that inference of discrimination could be drawn from evidence that plaintiff was treated \u201cless favorably than a similarly situated employee outside [her] protected group\u201d). Woods\u2019s argument fails because her case does not bear a sufficient resemblance to her comparators\u2019 to permit an inference of discrimination. <em>See id. </em>(holding that, while plaintiff need not show \u201cidentical\u201d circumstances, \u201ca reasonably close resemblance of the facts and circumstances of plaintiffs and comparator\u2019s cases\u201d is necessary to support an inference of discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We recognize that the similarity of comparators\u2019 situations generally presents a question of fact for the jury. <em>Id. </em>This, however, is a rare case where the issue can be resolved as a matter of law. At the outset, we note that one of Woods\u2019s two comparators is African American. Thus, as Woods herself appears to concede, this individual does not fall \u201coutside\u201d Woods\u2019s protected group. <em>Id. </em>To the extent Woods\u2019s other comparator received only a letter of reprimand for a FERPA violation whereas Woods was terminated, we note that the comparator held tenure whereas Woods\u2019s employment was probationary. While this distinction does not preclude an inference of discrimination in every case, it does so here because Woods\u2019s African-American \u201ccomparator,\u201d who also held tenure, received a similar letter of reprimand for the identical FERPA violation. Under these circumstances, Woods\u2019s proposed comparisons cannot support an inference of racial bias. <em>Cf. Feingold v. New York, </em>366 F.3d at 153 (recognizing that permanent and probationary employees are not similarly situated with respect to conditions under which they could be terminated; nevertheless, where evidence showed members of one race \u201cwere not disciplined <em>at all </em>\u201d for conduct at issue, discriminatory motive could be inferred).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We further note that the tenured employees\u2019 FERPA violations were remarkably similar to each other but distinct from Woods. The tenured employees transmitted student grades on postcards, a practice that failed to ensure the confidentiality required by statute but that enjoyed the seeming tacit approval of longstanding district practice. By contrast, Woods violated FERPA by directing school staff members to copy large volumes of material, including student records afforded statutory confidentiality, in what can be viewed most favorably to her as a mistaken understanding of the scope of a superior\u2019s directive to gather information relevant to her upcoming job evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">Defendants submit that, even if Woods had carried her <em>prima facie </em>burden, the poor judgment reflected in her copying action (which was further reflected in Woods\u2019s decision to bring the copied materials home), establishes a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination that Woods failed to rebut. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 507, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993); <em>Patterson v. County of Oneida, </em>375 F.3d at 221. Like the district court, we agree. While Woods\u2019s claimed misunderstanding of her superior\u2019s directive helps explain her exercise of poor judgment, it does not demonstrate the falsity of this non-discriminatory reason for her discharge and the probability that racial bias was the real reason for her termination. <em>See Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., </em>224 F.3d 33, 42 (2d Cir.2000) (holding that, to demonstrate pretext, plaintiff must produce \u201csufficient evidence to support a rational finding that the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons proffered by the [defendant] were false, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>that more likely than not [discrimination] was the real reason for the [employment action]\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">3. <em>Retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">To the extent Woods asserts that her termination was in retaliation for her complaints of discrimination, summary judgment was appropriately entered in favor of defendants in light of Woods\u2019s failure to adduce evidence indicating the falsity of defendants\u2019 proffered non-discriminatory rationale for her discharge. <em>See Holt v. KMI-Continental, Inc., </em>95 F.3d 123, 130-31 (2d Cir.1996) (holding summary judgment appropriately awarded to employer where Title VII plaintiff \u201cput forth no evidence to show that defendant\u2019s asserted reasons for the retaliation were pretextual\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s February 8, 2007 judgment is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-12\">. The district court also awarded defendants summary judgment on Woods's claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a and \u00a7 1983 as well as the New York Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296. Because Woods does not pursue these claims on appeal, we deem them waived. <em>See Shakur v. Selsky, </em>391 F.3d 106, 119 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
