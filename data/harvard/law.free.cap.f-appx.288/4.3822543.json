Brown, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2218, 167 L.Ed.2d 1014 (2007). We will reinstate our original judgment to the extent that it affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of relief on Andre Stevens\u2019s sole guilt-phase claim. As we explain briefly below, we will otherwise remand the ease for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-32\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-33\">For present purposes, we need not, and do not, recite the factual and procedural history of the case in any detail. It is sufficient to note that Stevens\u2019s habeas petition raised a single claim related to the determination of his guilt as well as several claims targeted at his capital sentence. The District Court denied relief on the guilt-phase claim, which alleged that trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>counsel had ineffectively failed to formulate and press a diminished capacity defense. It granted relief on one of Stevens\u2019s sentencing claims, a claim that a potential juror was improperly excluded under <em>Witherspoon v. Ill., </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968). It did not reach Stevens\u2019s remaining sentencing claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Both Stevens and the Commonwealth appealed. We affirmed the judgment of the District Court in all respects. <em>Stevens v. Horn, </em>187 Fed.Appx. 205, 216-17 (3d Cir.2006) (nonprecedential). Each side sought review in the Supreme Court. Stevens\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari was denied. <em>Stevens v. Beard, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1376, 167 L.Ed.2d 165 (2007). The Commonwealth\u2019s petition was successful, and the Court vacated our judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Uttecht. Beard v. Stevens, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2966, 168 L.Ed.2d 260 (2007). We directed the parties to address in supplemental briefs the effect of <em>Uttecht </em>on this matter. These supplemental briefs have been received, and the matter is now ripe for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">First, we return briefly to the disposition of Stevens\u2019s sole guilt-phase claim. We addressed that claim in detail in our original opinion, agreeing with the District Court that Stevens had not established that his trial counsel ineffectively failed to investigate, develop, and present a diminished capacity defense. <em>See Stevens, </em>187 Fed.Appx. at 206-12, 216-17. The Supreme Court denied Stevens\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari as to this claim. Accordingly, we will reinstate the portion of our original opinion and judgment that rejected Stevens\u2019s guilt-phase claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">What remains is the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s determination, under <em>Witherspoon, </em>that the trial court improperly removed a potential juror based on her moral opposition to capital punishment. Having carefully considered <em>Uttecht, </em>the prior opinions in this case, and the parties\u2019 supplemental briefs, we conclude that Stevens\u2019s <em>Witherspoon </em>claim is best addressed anew by the District Court in the first instance. Unsurprisingly, the parties vigorously dispute the effect of <em>Ut-techt </em>on the case. In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, <em>Uttecht </em>\u201cprovides an explicit framework ... that differs in several important respects\u201d from the one we previously utilized. Commonwealth\u2019s Supplemental Brief, 3. Stevens contends, by contrast, that <em>Uttecht </em>\u201cwas an application of the well-established principles of <em>Witherspoon </em>and its progeny,\u201d which we \u201calready applied.\u201d Stevens\u2019s Supplemental Brief, 2. Obviously, the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were not made with <em>Uttecht </em>in mind. We decline at this juncture to attempt to provide a definitive gloss on the Supreme Court\u2019s new opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">We emphasize that we are fully committing the remanded proceedings to the sound discretion of the District Court. We offer only these few observations. First, because <em>Uttecht </em>stresses the importance of an attorney\u2019s failure to object to a potential juror\u2019s exclusion, <em>see Uttecht, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2229-30, the District Court may wish to consider one of Stevens\u2019s other sentencing claims- \u2014 that counsel ineffectively failed to object to the removal of Hartling \u2014 contemporaneously. Although we do not reach the question at this time, it may be the case that general factfinding concerning the sentencing court\u2019s conduct of voir dire, or more specific factfinding concerning counsel\u2019s failure to object to Hartling\u2019s exclusion, would be helpful to the proper resolution of Stevens\u2019s <em>Witherspoon </em>claim. Also, we stress that we do not mean to suggest that the District Court must nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>essarily turn its attention first to Stevens\u2019s <em>Witherspoon </em>claim. If the District Court determines on remand that it would be more efficient to begin with other of Stevens\u2019s unresolved sentencing claims, it will, of course, be free to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Finally, we note that federal review of Stevens\u2019s conviction and death sentence has already been lengthy. We are confident that the District Court will make the timely resolution of Stevens\u2019s habeas petition a priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on Stevens\u2019s claim that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance at the guilt phase (C.A. No. 04-9013). As to Stevens\u2019s <em>Witherspoon </em>claim (C.A. No. 04-9011), we will vacate the District Court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Uttecht.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
