We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">Cisco argues that the evidence in the record does not support the finding that he did not have a severe impairment on or before June 30, 2001, his date last insured. We disagree. The Commissioner\u2019s final decision must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error. <em>See Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 954 (9th Cir.2002). When the evidence can be rationally interpreted in more than one way, \u201cit is the [Administrative Law Judge\u2019s] conclusion that must be upheld.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir. 1999) (citation omitted). The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) viewed the entire record and concluded that Cisco did not suffer from a severe impairment as of June 30, 2001. An evaluation of the medical evidence shows that Cisco had \u201cthe physical and mental ability ... necessary to perform [basic work] activities.\u201d Social Security Ruling 85-28, at *4 (1985), <em>available at </em>1985 WL 56856. The evidence also indicates that Cisco\u2019s back pain occurred intermittently and responded well to medications. The record therefore demonstrates that substantial evidence exists to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>See Thomas, </em>278 F.3d at 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Cisco contends that it was legal error for the ALJ to find, without first developing the record, that there was no evidence Cisco\u2019s back impairment caused him any limitation in his ability to function before his date last insured. We disagree. An ALJ has the \u201cduty to fully and fairly develop the record and to assure that the claimant\u2019s interests are considered.\u201d <em>To-napetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). An ALJ\u2019s duty to \u201cconduct an appropriate inquiry\u201d is triggered when the record contains \u201cambiguous evidence\u201d or when the \u201crecord is inadequate to allow for proper evaluation of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The record demonstrates that Cisco has claimed that his single, chronic back condition developed in an unbroken progression since 1996; therefore, the development of his condition has not involved any \u201cobvious vicissitudes\u201d in his health. <em>Cf. Webb v. Barnhart, </em>433 F.3d 683, 687 (9th Cir.2005) (noting that the evidence was sufficiently ambiguous to trigger the ALJ\u2019s duty because of the \u201cobvious vicissitudes\u201d in the plaintiffs health). Cisco also consistently reported that he obtained \u201cgood relief\u201d from medications, that medications controlled his intermittent back pain \u201cquite well,\u201d and that he used muscle relaxers only \u201csparingly.\u201d The ALJ relied on a record showing Cisco\u2019s infrequent complaints of back pain, as well as doctors\u2019 reports indicating no work-related functional limitations prior to that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In addition, Cisco expressly waived his right to appear and testify at his hearing, and has never claimed that his waiver was invalid. Cisco did not respond to documentation (1) requesting that he update the record, (2) explaining that he could obtain an attorney for the hearing, and (3) attempting to schedule medical evaluations. In this case, the sporadic nature of Cisco\u2019s medical records supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Cisco\u2019s impairments were not severe as of June 30, 2001. Cisco never asserted that his medical records were incomplete. The medical evidence in this case is therefore neither ambiguous nor inadequate, because it shows the absence of any significant work-related functional limitations prior to Cisco\u2019s date last insured. The record therefore demonstrates that it was not legal error for the ALJ to make a finding without further developing the record. <em>See Thomas, </em>278 F.3d at 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b365-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
