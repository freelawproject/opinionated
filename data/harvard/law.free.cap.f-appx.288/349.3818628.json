We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">The district court did not err in denying Quintana\u2019s motion to suppress. Investigatory stops are permissible \u201cif the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot.\u201d <em>United States v. Berber-Tinoco, </em>510 F.3d 1083, 1087 (9th Cir.2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d required for a <em>Terry </em>stop may be satisfied by the collective knowledge of the police officers. <em>See United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 229-32, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985); <em>Guerra v. Sutton, </em>783 F.2d 1371, 1375 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cLaw enforcement officers and agencies are entitled to rely on one another to a certain extent.\u201d). The officer who stopped Quintana had specific and articulable facts justifying a reasonable suspicion that the occupant of the vehicle was its owner and had committed a crime. Another police officer had observed the vehicle currently registered to a person known by the officer to recently have outstanding warrants. The driver of the vehicle, Quintana, matched the general description of the vehicle\u2019s registered owner. Quintana drove in an unusual manner, passing several empty parking spots and parking the vehicle be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>hind parked vehicles. The driver also quickly walked away from the vehicle. These facts, taken together, warrant a brief seizure of the vehicle\u2019s driver for further investigation. <em>See United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417 n. 2, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981) (\u201c[A]n officer may stop and question a person if there are reasonable grounds to believe that person is wanted for past criminal conduct.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">When the driver of the vehicle provided the officer with a name, but no identification, it was permissible for the officer to perform a records check on the name \u201cAlexander Quintana\u201d to verify Quintana\u2019s identity. <em>See United States v. Christian, </em>356 F.3d 1103, 1107 (9th Cir.2004). Upon doing so, the officer discovered Quintana was driving with a suspended license. The officer then had probable cause to arrest Quintana.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Because Quintana\u2019s subsequent arrest for driving without a license was lawful, the search of his vehicle incident to arrest was also valid. <em>See New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981); <em>see also United States v. Osife, </em>398 F.3d 1143, 1147-48 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>Thornton v. United States, </em>541 U.S. 615, 124 S.Ct. 2127, 158 L.Ed.2d 905 (2004) did not overrule <em>Belton). </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err by denying Quintana\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
