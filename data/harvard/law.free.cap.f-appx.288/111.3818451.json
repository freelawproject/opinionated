Ospina seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders dismissing as moot his appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting IndyMac Bank\u2019s motion for relief from the automatic stay and denying reconsideration. IndyMac has moved to dismiss the appeal. Upon review of the record, we grant the motion and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-16\">The district court\u2019s final order was entered on the docket on October 26, 2007. The notice of appeal was filed on January 29, 2008. Because Ospina failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant IndyMac\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
