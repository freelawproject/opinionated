The Petitioners contend that the BIA abused its discretion in denying their motions to reopen because they both established <em>pri-ma facie </em>eligibility for adjustment of status under the Cuban Adjustment Act, Pub.L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161 (1966) (reproduced as historical note to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255) (\u201cCAA\u201d). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">On April 6, 2004,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> before the Petitioners were served with the notices to appear (\u201cNTAs\u201d), Elsa filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1231(b)(3), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Carlos<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was included in the application. Elsa indicated on the application that she sought relief based upon her political opinion and membership in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">On September 30, 2004, Elsa filed a \u201cMotion Regarding the One Year Bar to Her Asylum Claim\u201d in which she asserted several facts, including: (1) \u201cIn April of 2003 [Elsa] was informed that her husband had been taken at the hands of the paramilitaries,\u201d and (2) she had \u201cfiled her 1-589 Asylum application less than one year after her husband\u2019s abduction. The husband is still absent.\u201d Elsa framed the issue in the motion as \u201cDoes the disappearance of an immediate relative at the hands of [the] same group that is persecuting [Elsa] amount to a changed circumstance within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. 208.4(4)?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">At the October 5, 2005, removal hearing, Elsa testified that she was married to Carlos Humberto Rey (\u201cCarlos Humberto\u201d), who was also from Colombia, but April 2003 was the last time Elsa knew her husband\u2019s whereabouts. Elsa explained to the Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) that her husband was in politics when he disappeared in April 2003, but Elsa did not know the exact date of his disappearance, did not have a newspaper article announcing his disappearance, did not have a police report investigating his disappearance, and did not report her husband missing either to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>authorities in Colombia or to the Colombian embassy in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In her written order, the IJ denied Elsa\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief, and ordered the Petitioners removed to Colombia. In her oral decision, the IJ found that the Petitioners were statutorily ineligible to apply for asylum because Elsa failed to demonstrate any extraordinary circumstances to excuse her untimely filing of her application. Specifically, the IJ found incredible Elsa\u2019s claim that her husband was missing in light of the fact Elsa had not provided any corroborating evidence of his disappearance and no one, including Elsa, had reported the husband missing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">On March 10, 2006, while the appeal was pending, Elsa filed a motion to remand to the IJ for a hearing on her application for adjustment of status.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Elsa attached several documents to the motion, including, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) a copy of Elsa\u2019s marriage certificate; and (2) a copy of Elsa\u2019s 1 \u2014 485 application for adjustment of status. The marriage certificate indicated that Elsa married Jesus De Amas (\u201cDe Amas\u201d) on December 24, 2005, and it also stated that Elsa\u2019s previous marriage had ended in divorce on May 4, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The BIA dismissed the Petitioners\u2019 appeal and denied Elsa\u2019s motion to remand. With respect to the motion to remand, the BIA concluded that Elsa failed to establish that she was <em>prima facie </em>eligible for adjustment of status. Specifically, the BIA pointed out that Elsa had testified at the October 5, 2005, asylum hearing that she was \u201cmarried,\u201d but that her Colombian husband had disappeared in April 2003, and she had not \u201cheard a thing from him or about him.\u201d However, the BIA noted that Elsa\u2019s marriage license reflected that she had been divorced from her first husband since May 4, 2005, \u201cfive months before she relayed to the [IJ] that she was \u2018married.\u2019 \u201d Aso important to the BIA was the fact that Elsa had not indicated to the IJ at the October 2005 hearing that she was seeking a divorce from her husband, and had not produced any documents to corroborate her divorce. Thus, the BIA concluded, the record did not contain sufficient evidence to establish the validity of Elsa\u2019s present marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">In response to the BIA\u2019s order, Elsa filed a motion to reopen for adjustment of status based upon her December 24, 2005, marriage to De Amas, whom, Elsa noted, was a Cuban national and a United States Lawful Permanent Resident (\u201cLPR\u201d). Elsa asserted that she was statutorily eligible for adjustment of status pursuant to the CAA because, <em>inter alia, </em>she was legally married to De Amas. Elsa included with her motion an untranslated copy of her Colombian divorce decree, and stated that she would submit a certified translation of the document as soon as practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">Carlos also filed a motion to reopen. Carlos claimed that he, too, was eligible for adjustment of status under the CAA based upon his <em>bona fide </em>marriage to a Cuban citizen residing as a parolee in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">On October 22, 2007, the BIA denied both motions to reopen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The BIA stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>that Elsa\u2019s motion to reopen was based on the same underlying marriage as she claimed in her previous motion. However, \u201c[b]ecause the lead respondent has still not provided conclusive evidence of the validity of her present marriage, [the BIA] con-cludefd that] the respondent has once again failed to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for adjustment of status.\u201d The BIA noted that it could not consider the untranslated photocopy of the document Elsa claimed was her Colombian divorce decree. The BIA went on to state that, even if Elsa\u2019s present marriage were valid, she had not established that she had an immigrant visa immediately available to her in light of the fact that her alleged husband was not a United States Citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">With respect to Carlos\u2019s motion to reopen, the BIA stated that Carlos also did not establish that he was <em>prima facie </em>eligible to adjust his status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 because his wife\u2019s current immigration status as parolee did not place Carlos in any preferential visa category. The BIA noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">The lone piece of evidence [Carlos] has submitted in support of his spouse\u2019s alleged adjustment application [under the CAA] is a computer-generated shipment tracking document, which, apart from reflecting that a package was shipped from Miami to Chicago, in no way reflects who shipped the package or to whom it was sent, much less what the contents of the package might have been.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen proceedings for abuse of diseretion. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005). Our review is \u201climited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted); <em>see also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (\u201cThe decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen is within the discretion of the [BIA]\u201d). To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">An alien may file a motion to reopen his removal order. INA \u00a7 240(c)(7), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The motion to reopen \u201cshall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Motions to reopen may be granted if there is new evidence that is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the removal hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA may deny a motion to reopen if the alien fails to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (llth Cir.2001). Moreover, the BIA \u201chas discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the moving party has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case for relief.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">The CAA provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">That, notwithstanding the provisions of section 245(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the status of any alien who is a native or citizen of Cuba and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>who has been inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States subsequent to January 1, 1959, and has been physically present in the United States for at least one year, <em>may </em>be adjusted by the Attorney General, <em>in his discretion </em>and under such regulations as he may prescribe, to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence <em>if the alien makes an application for such adjustment, and the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence. ... </em>The provisions of this Act shall be applicable to the spouse and child of any alien described in this subsection, regardless of their citizenship and place of birth, who are residing with such alien in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Pub.L. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161, \u00a7 1. We have stated that \u201c[t]he [DHS] ... clearly has discretion under the Act to adjust the status of the spouse and child of a Cuban alien who has been admitted for permanent residence ... [, h]owever, this discretion only extends to the spouse and child if they are statutorily eligible.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. McNary, </em>980 F.2d 1418, 1420 (11th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The Supreme Court has explained that in cases on appeal where the BIA has not addressed a particular issue that a petitioner put before it, \u201cthe proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.\u201d <em>INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). We determined in <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y General, </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2007), that \u201crare circumstances\u201d were present in an appeal because the issue the BIA failed to address was legal in nature, not factual, and required an \u201cobjective, procedural inquiry\u201d concerning whether the petitioner specified errors of law and supported them with pertinent authority or did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Elsa\u2019s motion to reopen was properly denied. Although the Petitioners argue that Elsa was not required to produce \u201cconclusive\u201d proof of her <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for adjustment of status under the CAA, Elsa was, nonetheless, required to support her motion to reopen \u201cby affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). With her subsequent motion to reopen, the only evidence that Elsa provided to support her claim that she was divorced from her first husband was an untranslated document, and it was within the BIA\u2019s discretion to decline to consider that document. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.33 (\u201cAny foreign language document offered by a party in a proceeding shall be accompanied by an English language translation and a certification signed by the translator that must be printed legibly or typed\u201d). Thus, based on the evidence contained in the record, Elsa failed to establish with evidentiary material that she was <em>prima facie </em>eligible for adjustment of status as a \u201cspouse\u201d of a Cuban alien for purposes of the CAA because, by her own testimony, it was unclear what the status of her first marriage was. <em>See </em>CAA, Pub.L. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Carlos\u2019s motion to reopen was also properly denied. As the BIA pointed out, the DHL tracking history that Carlos provided to corroborate his claim that his spouse filed an application under the CAA \u201cin no way reflects who shipped the package or to whom it was sent, much less what the contents of the package might have been.\u201d Significantly, Carlos failed to establish with any evidentiary material that his spouse is \u201celigible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United States for permanent residence.\u201d <em>See </em>CAA, Pub.L. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Therefore, although the BIA stated that Carlos failed to establish his <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, his motion to reopen was nonetheless properly denied because he also failed to establish his <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for adjustment of status under the CAA. <em>See </em>CAA, Pub.L. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1330; <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In light of the foregoing, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-12\">. Elsa was admitted to the United States on or about January 21, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-14\">. Elsa\u2019s younger son, Juan Camilo Serpa Gutierrez, was also included in the application, but he was not a party in Elsa\u2019s or Carlos\u2019s motions to reopen, the denial of which is the subject of this petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">. The IJ also considered the underlying merits of the asylum application, but concluded that the Petitioners had failed to \"credibly demonstrate that they suffered past persecution or that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in Colombia on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b610-15\">. Elsa\u2019s youngest son, Juan, was also included in the motion to remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b610-16\">. Elsa filed a motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s order, and with the motion she included a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>translated version of her Colombian divorce decree, which had a seal dated May 4, 2005. However, the BIA denied the Petitioners' motion to reconsider, and Petitioners have not petitioned this Court for review of that denial. As such, the translated document is also not before us. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (\"the court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based\u201d); <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1256 n. 7 (11th Cir. 2006) (declining to consider a document that was not part of the administrative record on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
