(\u201cWestlake\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on her claims that Westlake engaged in unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of sex and race in violation of Louisiana law, La. Stat. Rev. Ann. \u00a7 23:332.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Beaudoin, a black female, worked as a loading operator at Westlake\u2019s chemical facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana. West-lake terminated Beaudoin\u2019s employment following her alleged involvement in a propylene-flaring incident. Although there were no injuries, Westlake\u2019s formal investigation report described the flaring incident as having \u201cSerious Potential for Catastrophic Event.\u201d According to Westlake\u2019s investigation, the events leading to the propylene flare spanned two shifts, including Beaudoin\u2019s. The investigation determined that each of the three operators on duty that day shared responsibility for the flare. Specifically, with respect to Beau-doin, Westlake\u2019s investigation found that Beaudoin failed adequately to assess and address the situation leading up to the flare and also failed to appreciate the magnitude of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">Westlake\u2019s management decided that disciplinary action was warranted for each of the three operators involved in the flaring incident. Beaudoin and another full-time employee operator, a white male, each received two levels of discipline under Westlake\u2019s progressive discipline policy. Based on the prior documented discipline in Beaudoin\u2019s personnel file, this discipline resulted in her termination. The other full-time operator had fewer and less severe disciplinary incidents documented in his personnel file. He received a two-day suspension. The third operator, a white male, was a \u201ctemporary\u201d operator and was terminated immediately after the incident, although he had no prior disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">Beaudoin alleges that she was unlawfully terminated on the basis of sex and race. Beaudoin argues that any mistake made during the flaring incident was not her own. She also argues that Westlake applied its progressive discipline policy inconsistently, subjectively, and arbitrarily, establishing a genuine issue of materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>al fact as to whether Westlake\u2019s stated reason for terminating Beaudoin\u2019s employment was pretextual. The district court rejected Beaudoin\u2019s arguments and granted summary judgment to Westlake, concluding that Beaudoin failed to offer sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Westlake\u2019s reason for her termination was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 386 (5th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is proper if the record shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Having carefully reviewed the applicable law and the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties and the district court\u2019s analysis, we are satisfied that the district court\u2019s rulings are fully supported. For the reasons stated by the district court, Beaudoin has failed to offer sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find that she was terminated unlawfully on the basis of sex or race. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b939-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-12\">. Beaudoin also brought claims against several of Westlake's corporate affiliates, Westlake Styrene L.P. and WPE Corp. The district court dismissed these entities because Beau-doin offered no basis on which to hold these other entities liable. Beaudoin does not dial-lenge that ruling. Thus, our reference to \"Westlake\u201d refers only to Westlake Management Services Inc., the only defendant whose dismissal Beaudoin challenges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Akd1\">. Beaudoin's claim arises only under state and not federal law. The district court nonetheless properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of diversity of citizenship. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
