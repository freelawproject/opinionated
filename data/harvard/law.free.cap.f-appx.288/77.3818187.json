He was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. Everhart appealed, and although we affirmed his convictions, we remanded for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Everhart, </em>166 Fed.Appx. 61 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">On remand, Everhart argued, in relevant part, that the district court should impose a variance sentence because the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 100-to-l crack coeaine/powder cocaine ratio created unwarranted sentencing disparity. Based upon then-authoritative Circuit precedent, the district court rejected Everhart\u2019s request for a variance sentence and reimposed a 360-month term of imprisonment. We affirmed the district court\u2019s order. <em>See United States v. Everhart, </em>245 Fed.Appx. 316 (4th Cir.2007), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1750, 170 L.Ed.2d 536 (2008). Everhart filed a petition for writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court, which vacated his sentence and remanded his case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve [18 U.S.C.A] \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575. <em>Kimbrough </em>has thus abrogated <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625 (4th Cir. 2006) (holding sentencing court may not vary from Guidelines range solely because of 100-to-l ratio for crack/powder offenses), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 853, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2008). The district court did not have the benefit of <em>Kimbrough </em>when it determined Everhart\u2019s sentence. To give the district court the opportunity to reconsider the sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough, </em>we conclude that re-sentencing is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-20\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-21\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b100-11\"> On remand, Everhart will be resentenced under the revised Guidelines for crack offenses that took effect on November 1, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
