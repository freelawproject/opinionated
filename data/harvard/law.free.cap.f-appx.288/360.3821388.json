Hart Union High School District (\u201cHart\u201d) appeals the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Aja and Karen Termine following the Termines\u2019 successful actions under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d). In the December 2001 action, a special education due process hearing before the California Special Education Hearing Office (\u201cSEHO\u201d), the Termines alleged that Hart\u2019s October 2001 special education placement offer to Aja was inappropriate. In February 2002, the Termines brought a separate action \u2014 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u201cstay-put\u201d case \u2014 in federal district court, alleging that Hart should be required to maintain Aja in her then-current non-public school placement pending the outcome of the due process hearing. The district court concluded that the Termines were prevailing parties in both of the actions, and issued an award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3) in the amount of $729,038.64. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the Termines were the prevailing parties in the stay-put case. Although the district court declined to specifically designate Westmark School (\u201cWestmark\u201d) as the stay-put placement during the period from October 3, 2001 to July 3, 2002, the Termines achieved relief that changed the legal relationship between the parties with respect to a significant issue, and also successfully invalidated Hart\u2019s argument regarding the stay-put placement. <em>See Shapiro v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. No. 69, </em>374 F.3d 857, 864-65 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Parents of Student W. v. Puyallup Sch. Dist., No. 3, </em>31 F.3d 1489, 1498 (9th Cir.1994). Specifically, Aja remained at Westmark during the pendency of the dispute; Westmark was determined to be an appropriate stay-put placement; Hart\u2019s proposed placement was deemed inappropriate; and the Termines were awarded reimbursement of tuition for the time period of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the fee award based on arguments that the Termines achieved only partial success and protracted the litigation, or that the Termines\u2019 counsel spent an excessive amount of time on the matter. The district court properly concluded that the Termines\u2019 failure to obtain 100 percent of the requested damages does not necessarily constitute grounds for reducing fees, and that the Termines\u2019 nonmonetary success \u2014 clarifying the law regarding stay-put placements \u2014 was significant. <em>See Morales v. City of San Rafael, </em>96 F.3d 359, 362-65 (9th Cir.1996). The issue of whether the Termines should be compelled to produce Aja for an assessment was an exceedingly minor one, and so interrelated with the other claims, such that separating out the time spent on this particular issue would have been inappropriate. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <em>Thomas v. City of Tacoma, </em>410 F.3d 644, 649-50 (9th Cir.2005). Moreover, the Termines were ultimately the prevailing party as to the stay-put issue despite unsuccessful motions before the SEHO. <em>See Cabrales v. County of Los Angeles, </em>935 F.2d 1050, 1052-53 (9th Cir.1991). The fees incurred on the availability of expert fees were reasonable given the circuit split on whether expert witness fees are recoverable, and were so minimal that the time that would have been expended to disentangle them from the \u201cfees for fees\u201d incurred after March 2006 would not have been in either party\u2019s financial interest. Because Hart was unable to identify a single billing entry associated with the Termines\u2019 alleged protraction of the proceedings, the district court\u2019s decision not to reduce the fee award under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(F)(i) was not an abuse of discretion. Given that the Ter-mines\u2019 attorneys filed both opening and reply briefs, while Hart\u2019s lawyers filed only opposition briefs, that the Termines\u2019 attorneys spent 23 percent more time on the case was not unreasonable. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce the fee award pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(F)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in calculating the hourly rate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fees award. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(F)(ii). The district court correctly concluded that the rate Hart paid its counsel should not be the starting point for determining the proper hourly rate to award the Termines. <em>See Trevino v. Gates, </em>99 F.3d 911, 924-925 (9th Cir.1996). Moreover, there is competent evidence that the Termines\u2019 counsel\u2019s rates are commensurate with those of attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, reputation, and experience in the community performing similar work. <em>See Welch v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>480 F.3d 942, 946 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Using the prime rate in setting the amount of interest awarded was not an abuse of discretion. Where a court makes an interest adjustment of attorneys\u2019 fees to compensate for delay in payment, it is appropriate to use the prime rate. <em>See id. </em>at 947; <em>In re Wash. Pub. Power Supply Sys. Sec. Litig., </em>19 F.3d 1291, 1305 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The court\u2019s award of compound interest was not an abuse of discretion. Compound prejudgment interest is the norm in federal litigation and the decision whether to award it is left to the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>See Am. Nat. Fire Ins. Co. ex rel. Tabacalera Contreras Cigar Co. v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., </em>325 F.3d 924, 937-38 <em>&amp; </em>n. 11 (7th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>West Virginia v. United States, </em>479 U.S. 305, 310, 107 S.Ct. 702, 93 L.Ed.2d 639 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees for time spent by the Termines\u2019 counsel in correcting their fee claim to reflect the proper rate of interest. The cost of adjusting them billing program to use historical prime rates would have been incurred whether or not the Termines\u2019 counsel initially erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b383-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
