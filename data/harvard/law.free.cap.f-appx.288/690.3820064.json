Joseph contends that the district court erred by finding that his prior Florida conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was a violent felony for purposes of enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 2004) because: (1) the offense was not inherently dangerous or violent; (2) in Florida, a person may carry a concealed weapon if he has a license; (3) the Florida statute does not require proof that the person intended to use the concealed weapon for violent purposes; and (4) carrying a concealed weapon is more like a felon-in-possession crime, which is not a violent crime, than the offenses enumerated in the career offender provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines and its fact-findings only for clear error. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005). A defendant is classified as a career offender under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) if he has at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(a). In <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated by Begay v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), we held that \u201ccarrying a concealed weapon in violation of Florida law is a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(1).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1372. In June 2008, however, this Court decided that <em>Gilbert </em>had been abrogated by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay </em>and held that the Florida offense of carrying a concealed weapon \u2014 Joseph\u2019s prior conviction at issue \u2014 was not a crime of violence under the guidelines. <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1348-49, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">Joseph was sentenced as a career offender based on the district court\u2019s finding that his prior Florida conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was a crime of violence for the purposes of \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). That finding was entirely consistent with the law of this circuit at the time. The law having changed, however, the sentence must be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing in light of our recent <em>Archer </em>decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\">. The guideline we referred to as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(1) in <em>Gilbert </em>was listed as \u00a7 4B1.2(a) under the 2004 version of the guidelines, which apply to the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\">. Joseph also contends that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by increasing his sentence based on a fact not admitted or found by the jury, and that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. However, because we have vacated Joseph\u2019s sentence, we need not address those issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
