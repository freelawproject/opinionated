The DHS found Ev-ers removable after conducting an expedited removal proceeding pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b). We dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-26\">We deny Evers\u2019 first claim that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228 violates due process because it does not permit him to reopen proceedings to seek withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture, based on changed country conditions. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.5(a)(l)(i), Evers could have filed a motion to reopen proceedings as an \u201caffected party\u201d after the DHS\u2019s decision. There is no evidence Evers attempted to file such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-27\">We deny Evers\u2019 second claim there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the DHS\u2019s finding Evers was convicted of violating California Penal Code \u00a7 288(c) (lewd and lascivious act upon a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>child age 14 or 15). The record includes numerous court documents establishing Evers\u2019 conviction of three counts of violating \u00a7 288(c). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 238.1(b)(l)(iii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">We lack jurisdiction over Evers\u2019 claims of procedural due process errors in the issuance of the Notice of Intent, because Evers failed to exhaust these claims by raising them to the DHS during his removal proceeding, as provided for by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 238.1(c)(2)(i). Thus, we lack jurisdiction over these claims. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2003) (stating \u201cwe may not entertain due process claims based on correctable procedural errors unless the alien raised them below\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">We deny Evers\u2019 remaining procedural due process claims because Evers fails to claim, let alone demonstrate, any prejudice as a result of these purported due process violations. <em>See Vides-Vides v. INS, </em>783 F.2d 1463, 1469 (9th Cir.1986) (\u201cThe alien has been denied the full and fair hearing which due process provides only if.the thing complained of causes the alien to suffer some prejudice.\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b463-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
