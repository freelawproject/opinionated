The district court also denied Mr. Fuller leave to proceed IFP on appeal. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we grant Mr. Fuller leave to proceed IFP on appeal, vacate the district court\u2019s order denying him leave to proceed IFP in that court, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">In a previous order, this Court found that Mr. Fuller had filed in federal court at least three prisoner actions or appeals that were determined to be frivolous or malicious or failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>Fuller v. Wilcox, </em>No. 08-3077, Mar. 24, 2008. Mr. Fuller does not challenge his status as a prisoner who has filed at least three such actions or appeals. Consequently, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), Mr. Fuller may not proceed IFP on appeal \u2014 or in the district court \u2014 unless he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d We therefore ordered Mr. Fuller to show cause why this appeal should not be dismissed for failure to prepay the entire appellate filing fee as required by \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">To determine whether Mr. Fuller is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious physical injury,\u201d we look to the allegations in his complaint. <em>See Ibrahim v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>463 F.3d 3, 6 (D.C.Cir.2006). In addition, we liberally construe his complaint, accepting the allegations as true. <em>See Martinez v. Garden, </em>430 F.3d 1302, 1304 (10th Cir.2005) (noting that we construe \u201ca pro se complaint liberally\u201d and \u201cmust accept the allegations of the complaint as true\u201d (quotation omitted)). In order to meet the \u201cimminent danger\u201d requirement, \u201cthe harm must be imminent or occurring at the time the complaint is filed.\u201d <em>Ciarpaglini v. Saini, </em>352 F.3d 328, 330 (7th Cir.2003). In other words, allegations of past injury or harm are insufficient, <em>see id., </em>as are vague and conclusory assertions of harm, <em>see White v. Colorado, </em>157 F.3d 1226, 1231 (10th Cir.1998). To fall within the exception, Mr. Fuller\u2019s complaint must therefore contain <em>\u201cspecific </em>fact allegations of ongoing serious physical injury, or of a pattern of misconduct evidencing the likelihood of imminent serious physical injury.\u201d <em>Martin v. Shelton, </em>319 F.3d 1048, 1050 (8th Cir.2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The district court denied Mr. Fuller leave to proceed IFP because it determined that Mr. Fuller failed to allege a serious physical injury occurring at the time he filed the complaint. But although most of Mr. Fuller\u2019s allegations concern past injuries, he also alleges that he is unable to walk without a wheelchair and prison officials have refused to provide him with one. He claims that, without a wheelchair, he is forced to crawl and is unable to walk to the shower or lift himself from the cell floor to his bed. If Mr. Fuller does indeed require a wheelchair, the failure to provide him with one could result in a number of serious physical injuries. We therefore conclude that Mr. Fuller\u2019s allegations, assuming they are true, satisfy the imminent danger exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">In concluding that the exception applies, we express no opinion concerning the merits of Mr. Fuller\u2019s claim. <em>See Ciarpaglini, </em>352 F.3d at 331 (noting that \u201c \u00a7 1915(g) is not a vehicle for determining the merits of a claim\u201d). On remand, the district court should dismiss the complaint as part of the screening process if it determines that the complaint is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from an immune defendant. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), 1915A. Provided the complaint satisfies the threshold requirements, the court should provisionally grant IFP status and proceed with service of process. If the defendants challenge the factual allegations supporting the imminent danger exception, the district court must then determine whether these allegations are credible. <em>See Fuller v. Myers, </em>123 Fed.Appx. 365, 367-68 (10th Cir.2005) (unpublished opinion) (citing <em>Gibbs v. Roman, </em>116 F.3d 83, 86-87 (3d Cir.1997), <em>overruled on other grounds by </em>Abdul\u2014 <em>Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307 (3d Cir. 2001) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Because Mr. Fuller\u2019s complaint facially satisfies the imminent danger requirement, we VACATE the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for leave to proceed IFP and REMAND for further proceedings. We also GRANT Mr. Fuller leave to proceed IFP in this appeal and remind him of his obligation under \u00a7 1915(b) to make payments until the appellate filing fee is paid in full. In addition, we DENY Mr. Fuller\u2019s motion to supplement his opening brief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.

An order denying a motion for leave to proceed IFP is a final, appealable order. <em>Roberts v. United States Dist.
