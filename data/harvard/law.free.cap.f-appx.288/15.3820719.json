We will affirm the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-26\">The evidence here indicates that the film processing industry became extremely competitive in the 1980\u2019s. This led to a high rate of client turnover, which caused Technicolor to lose many of its customers despite its previous long-term relationships. At the same time, Technicolor gained new customers. The evidence thus shows that the long-term history of Technicolor\u2019s customer relationships is not indicative of their strength at the time it was acquired by Carlton Communications Pic in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>We agree with the Tax Court that the client relationships at issue here had no useful life. Any expectation that the customer relationships were likely to continue into the future was unreasonable because of the intense competition in the film processing market in the 1980\u2019s. <em>See Capital Blue Cross &amp; Subsidiaries v. Comm\u2019r, </em>431 F.3d 117, 126 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201c[A]n at-will relationship may constitute a valuable asset if it is reasonably likely to continue into the future.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We also reject Technicolor\u2019s argument that the Tax Court\u2019s finding was incorrect because it failed to establish the existence of goodwill or going concern assets other than customer relationships to account for the agreed Class IV basis. The Court found that Technicolor \u201chad an experienced management team, sophisticated equipment, and proximity to the studios\u2019 filming locations. In addition, personal relationships, between Technicolor\u2019s and the major film studios\u2019 executives, facilitated client development and retention.\u201d The evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s contention that these factors account for the Class IV basis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the Order of the Tax Court entered April 10, 2007.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-18\">. Under \u00a7 165, the amount of a deduction is limited to the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted basis in a lost asset. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\">. We need not address Technicolor\u2019s contention that the Tax Court applied the incorrect valuation burden and an improper standard</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
