(\u201cWooten\u201d), and Wooten\u2019s bank, First National Bank of Crossett (\u201cFNBC\u201d). Boyte agreed to make such payment jointly in response to a letter sent by FNBC stating that Wooten had assigned its contract proceeds to FNBC \u201cin connection with the financing for the [Boyte-Wooten] project.\u201d FNBC, however, only loaned money to Wooten for purposes unrelated to financing for the Boyte-Wooten project. FNBC then used a substantial portion of the contract proceeds assigned to it to pay down this unrelated debt. Consequently, suppliers and materialmen used by Wooten were not paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Boyte brought suit against FNBC for amounts due and owing the unpaid suppliers and materialmen. After a bench trial, the district court found FNBC liable under theories of negligent misrepresentation and detrimental reliance. The district court awarded Boyte $97,491.22, together with prejudgment interest from June 29, 2007,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and post-judgment interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a). FNBC now appeals the district court\u2019s determination of liability. Boyte brings a cross-appeal, asserting that the district court should have awarded prejudgment interest beginning on July 27, 2004, the date of Boyte\u2019s original petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-17\">Having reviewed the record and the briefs, we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to FNBC\u2019s appeal. Regarding Boyte\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim, there was sufficient evidence from which the district court could have concluded that: (1) FNBC assumed a legal duty to supply correct information; (2) FNBC breached that duty by incorrectly stating that Wooten had assigned the contract proceeds to FNBC in connection with the financing for the project; and (3) this breach caused damages to Boyte. With respect to Boyte\u2019s detrimental reliance claim, there was also sufficient evidence for the district court to conclude that: (1) FNBC represented to Boyte that Wooten assigned the contract proceeds to FNBC in connection with the financing of the project; (2) Boyte justifiably relied on this representation; and (3) Boyte changed his position to his detriment because of his reliance. Accordingly, the district court did not commit clear error. <em>See Water Craft Mgmt. LLC v. Mercury Marine, </em>457 F.3d 484, 488-89 (5th Cir .2006) (reviewing findings of fact in a bench trial for clear error).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>With respect to Boyte\u2019s cross-appeal, the district court correctly rejected Boyte\u2019s assertion that his original petition contained the first judicial demand on his claim of negligent misrepresentation. The factual allegations in his original petition were simply insufficient to support such a claim. Therefore, as the district court determined, Boyte\u2019s award of prejudgment interest shall run from June 29, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b151-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-19\">. The district court found that the parties\u2019 proposed pre-trial order, filed on June 29, 2007, contained the first judicial demand on Boyte\u2019s negligent misrepresentation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-20\">. FNBC also asserts the legal argument that the district court failed to consider all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>requirements of claims for negligent misrepresentation and detrimental reliance. This argument has no merit. FNBC's other defenses lack merit given our findings regarding the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
