Green asserts that RBS infringed his rights under the FCRA because it (1) was negligent in its investigation of disputes sent to it by credit reporting agencies (\"CRA\"), (2) erroneously reported two accounts, instead of one, and failed to rectify the problem after receiving a dispute from a CRA, and (3) furnished inaccurate information to GRAs. After the parties joined issue, RBS moved the district court for summary judgment. The court granted its motion in a comprehensive 40-page order on January 23, 2008. Green now appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AoTT\">The FCRA governs claims by consumers, like Green, against a furnisher of information, such as RBS, based on an allegation that the furnisher submitted incorrect information regarding the consumer to GRAs. See generally 15 U.s.c. \u00a7~ 1681a(c) &amp; (f), 1681s-2(a). The FCRA imposes two separate duties on furnishers. First, \u00a7 1681s-2(a) requires furnishers to submit accurate information to GRAs. Second, \u00a7 1681s-2(b) requires furnishers to investigate and respond promptly to notices of customer disputes. Green contends that citizens Bank of Rhode Island (\"citizens\") violated \u00a7 1681s-2(a) by tendering false information regarding his account. The FCRA, however, does not provide a private right of action to redress such a violation, and the district court was correct in so holding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Acu-\">The FCRA does provide a private right of action for a violation of \u00a7 1681s-2(b), but only if the furnisher received notice of the consumer's dispute from a consumer reporting agency. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b)(1). Assuming that Green asserted such a claim, the undisputed evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>dence is against him. Green initiated oniy three disputes with CRAs, one with Expe-nan and two with Trans Union. Citizens investigated the Experian dispute and accurately reported its findings to Experian the next day. Citizens investigated the Trans Union disputes and accurately reported its findings to Trans Union within no more than eight days. In short, Citizens timely complied with the letter of the law in all three instances.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai_8\">We have no basis for disturbing the district court's January 23, 2008 order, and therefore affirm the court's judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AN4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"aqr-dedup-1\">. In addition to arguing that the court erred in granting RBS summary judgment, Green contends that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion for an extension of time for discovery. We find no error, much less an abuse of discretion, in the court's denial of the motion. As the court properly explained in its January 16, 2008 order denying the motion, the motion was untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"adb-dedup-1\">. Enforcement of this provision is limited to federal agencies, federal officials, and state officials. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681s-2(c), (d); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s(c)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
