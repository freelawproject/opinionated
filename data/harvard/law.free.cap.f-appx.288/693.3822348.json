Laity (\u201cLaity\u201d) appeals the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d), <em>Laity v. Nicholson, </em>No. 05-2739 (Vet.App. Aug. 27, 2007). Laity argues that the Veterans Court erred in affirming the determination of the Board of Veterans Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) that he had not established service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) and a cardiac condition including mitral valve prolapse syndrome (\u201cMVPS\u201d). Because Laity\u2019s arguments rest on factual determinations outside this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, we <em>dismiss </em>the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-23\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b715-24\">Laity served on active duty in the United States Navy between August 1971 and October 1974. Laity filed two claims that are at issue in this appeal, a claim for service connection for PTSD and a claim for service connection for MVPS. In De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>cember 2004, the Board sustained Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) decisions rejecting these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Laity appealed to the Veterans Court. In an opinion dated August 27, 2007, the Veterans Court affirmed the Board\u2019s denial of service connection for PTSD and MVPS. A single judge of the Veterans Court held that the Board had not erred in denying service connection because Laity had not provided medical evidence of the existence of the claimed conditions or their connection to his service, and explained that Laity\u2019s lay testimony that he suffered from a cardiac condition and from PTSD was not sufficient under <em>Jandreau v. Nicholson, </em>492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.Cir. 2007). Laity moved for a decision by the full Veterans Court, but this motion was denied. Final judgment was entered on January 7, 2008. Laity timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">We have jurisdiction to review a decision of the Veterans Court \u201cwith respect to the validity of a decision of the Court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof ... that was relied on by the Court in making the decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a). However, we \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">With respect to MVPS, the Board found that there was no competent evidence of service connection, and the Veterans Court concluded that this determination was not clearly erroneous. On appeal, Laity urges that the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) should have provided him with a cardiac sonogram to diagnose MVPS and should have obtained a private medical record that he argues establishes a diagnosis of MVPS. However, there is no indication that a sonogram could assist in determining service connection, and Laity admitted before the Veterans Court that the private medical records he urges should have been obtained do not include evidence of service connection. Laity also argues that he suffers from MVPS, and that because MVPS is a congenital condition, he must also have suffered from MVPS during service (and may also assert that the condition was aggravated in service). It is unclear how the assertion that MVPS is congenital could assist Laity in demonstrating service connection. In any event, the question of whether there was evidence of service connection is a question of fact beyond our jurisdiction. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Similarly, it appears that Laity\u2019s challenges to the PTSD determination are based on alleged factual errors, which are beyond our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Laity asserts in his reply brief that the Board and the Veterans Court failed to apply 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5107(b), which requires the VA to \u201cconsider all information and lay and medical evidence of record\u201d and \u201c[wjhen there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter\u201d to \u201cgive the benefit of the doubt to the claimant\u201d as to that issue. Because the Veterans Court and the Board both concluded that there was no competent evidence to establish that Laity suffers from either PTSD or MVPS, section 5107(b) is not implicated and cannot serve as a basis for our jurisdiction. Also, we note that Laity does not take issue with the Board\u2019s view that medical evidence was required under the circumstances of this case. <em>See Jandreau, </em>492 F.3d at 1377 n. 4 (\u201cSometimes the [testimony of a] layperson will be competent to identify [a medical] condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>This appeal is <em>dismissed </em>for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
