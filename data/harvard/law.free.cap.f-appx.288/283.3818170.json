Sanders, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 527 (7th Cir.2005), Tyler Sanders filed a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied the motion but granted Sanders a certificate of appealability allowing him to pursue on appeal his claim that trial counsel had been ineffective. We affirm the denial of Sanders\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">On July 29, 2003, a government informant named Lisa Mahone called Sanders and asked him for prices for various quantities of \u201chard\u201d cocaine or crack. The next day, while agents looked on, Mahone met Sanders and gave him $1,250 in exchange for a small plastic bag containing a brown substance. Sanders was arrested several days later and charged with distributing crack in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). He pleaded not guilty and was represented at trial by two retained attorneys: James W. Reilley and his co-counsel, Mark Sut-ter. The parties stipulated that the bag <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Mahone gave to the agents contained 62.7 grams of crack. The defense theory was that Mahone framed Sanders by hiding the crack in her bra, meeting Sanders within view of the agents, and then pretending he had given it to her, all in the hope of securing a reduction in the nine-year sentence her boyfriend was serving for drug crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">At trial the government called Mahone and two FBI agents. After acknowledging that she was cooperating with authorities in the hope of benefitting her boyfriend, Mahone testified that on July 29, 2003, she had contacted Sanders and asked for his prices for an eighth and a sixteenth of a kilogram of crack. Mahone testified that Sanders told her he would sell her a sixteenth of a kilogram (about 62.5 grams) for $1,250. Mahone told Sanders she would talk to \u201cfriends\u201d to get the money together. Instead, she reported the conversation to the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The next day Mahone called Sanders again and told him she had the money. They arranged to meet at a carwash. Agents gave Mahone $1,250 and a recording device, patted her down from head to toe, and searched her purse and car. Ma-hone first drove to the caiwash and then, at Sanders\u2019s direction, proceeded to a restaurant about three blocks away. Mahone testified that once she and Sanders both had parked in the lot, he approached her car, leaned against the driver\u2019s door, and dropped a bag through the open window onto her lap. After she gave him the money, Mahone continued, Sanders talked with her for a few minutes and then left. Mahone met up with the agents, who searched her and her car a second time, and she gave them the drugs and the recording device. Reilley cross-examined Mahone vigorously, exploring her motive for cooperating with the police, confronting her with prior inconsistent statements on several details, and clarifying that the agents had not searched inside Mahone\u2019s clothing when they frisked her just before the controlled buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Special Agent Michael Culloton testified that he had watched the controlled buy from a distance of about one block. Although he saw Sanders approach Mahone\u2019s car and lean in through the window, he could not see Sanders drop the bag into Mahone\u2019s lap. On direct examination he testified that Mahone had been searched before she went to meet Sanders, but on cross-examination he conceded that the search of her person was really a \u201ccursory\u201d pat-down. Sutter, not Reilley, handled Culloton\u2019s cross-examination. The lawyer elicited confirmation that neither Mahone nor Sanders had used the words \u201ccocaine\u201d or \u201ccrack\u201d in any of them recorded conversations, and he questioned why some conversations were not recorded at all, why the controlled buy was not videotaped, and why Culloton had not used binoculars to watch Mahone and Sanders. Sutter also explored with Culloton the motive Mahone had for cooperating.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Special Agent David Twohig testified that after Sanders was arrested he signed a written confession admitting that on June 30, 2003, he sold \u201c63 grams of crack cocaine\u201d to a woman named Lisa. He also confessed to selling crack to other customers in amounts ranging from 63 to 126 grams. Sutter also cross-examined Two-hig, primarily focusing on why Twohig wrote out the statement Sanders signed instead of having Sanders write it himself. The government introduced the written confession, along with several recorded conversations between Mahone and Sanders. The defense did not present any witnesses or evidence. The district court questioned Sanders on the record concerning his decision not to testify; Sanders assured the court that he had freely cho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>sen not to take the stand after discussing the matter with his lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">At sentencing the district court found that Sanders\u2019s relevant conduct included between 500 grams and 1.5 kilograms of crack, but that finding had no effect on Sanders\u2019s sentence. Because of his prior felony drug conviction, the offense of conviction (irrespective of relevant conduct) carried a mandatory minimum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii), and that is the sentence the district court imposed. On direct appeal, Sanders challenged the district court\u2019s determination that the substance he dealt was crack and not some other form of cocaine base. We rejected that argument. <em>See Sanders, </em>149 FedAppx. at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">In his <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion, Sanders alleged more than a dozen constitutional errors, but most of his claims were barred either because they were presented and resolved on direct appeal, <em>see, e.g., Peoples v. United States, </em>403 F.3d 844, 847, 849 (7th Cir.2005), or because Sanders had failed to raise them during that proceeding, <em>see, e.g., Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998); <em>Young v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 794, 795-96 (7th Cir.1997). The district court rejected the remaining claims on the merits without conducting an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Sanders did not submit an affidavit or any other evidence in support of his various claims. Instead, when he applied to the district court for a certificate of ap-pealability, Sanders asserted for the first time that before and during trial he saw Reilley, his lead attorney, taking \u201cpowerful pain medication\u201d because he was suffering from a terminal illness. (Reilley died approximately nine months after Sanders\u2019s trial ended.) According to Sanders, who put these new allegations into an affidavit, the medication had affected Reilley\u2019s \u201ccognitive functions,\u201d making him \u201cvery forgetful.\u201d Sanders said that Reilley \u201cwould or could not\u201d give straight answers to Sanders about his defense. According to the affidavit, Reilley told Sanders that he would interview witnesses and present a defense at trial, but in Sanders\u2019s view he did neither. Sanders insisted that, had he known Reilley would not follow through, he would have sought a plea agreement from the government instead of going to trial. Sanders also submitted an affidavit from his mother stating that she had seen Reilley take pain pills on one occasion. Without commenting on these affidavits, the district court granted a certificate of appealability limited to Sanders\u2019s claim that Reilley\u2019s assistance at trial was ineffective.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">In evaluating the denial of Sanders\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, its legal conclusions de novo, and its decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>See Suggs v. United States, </em>513 F.3d 675, 678 (7th Cir.2008); <em>Galbraith v. United, States, </em>313 F.3d 1001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>1006, 1009 (7th Cir.2002). We analyze Sanders\u2019s Sixth Amendment ineffective-assistance claim under the framework established in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), asking \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052. It was up to Sanders to establish that counsel\u2019s performance fell below \u201can objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also Daniels v. Knight, </em>476 F.3d 426, 434 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In his brief on appeal, Sanders alludes to a number of alleged shortcomings in Reilley\u2019s performance (Sutter\u2019s performance is never challenged or, indeed, even mentioned). But only two of Sanders\u2019s theories are sufficiently developed to warrant consideration. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>United States v. Thames, </em>214 F.3d 608, 611 n. 3 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Dunkel, </em>927 F.2d 955, 956 (7th Cir.1991). Of those two theories, the first is a nonstarter. Sanders argues that Reilley\u2019s performance was deficient because he was taking pain medication, was distracted by death and illness in his family, and was angry with Sanders for trying to have him replaced prior to trial. Even if these allegations are true, however, they would not help Sanders overcome the \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that Reilley performed reasonably at trial. <em>See Daniels, </em>476 F.3d at 434. Sanders was required to identify <em>specific </em>acts or omissions by counsel that caused him prejudice, but these allegations have no apparent link to Reilley\u2019s performance. Outside influences such as serious illness or use of medication might <em>explain </em>a deficiency, but they do not constitute deficiencies by themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We turn, then, to Sanders\u2019s second theory, which does concern an alleged omission by counsel: the failure to interview and call as a witness a woman named \u201cMickey Marshal.\u201d In the district court Sanders asserted that Reilley had refused to interview \u201creadily available defense witnesses,\u201d but he did not name any such witnesses or describe the nature of them expected testimony. The district court accordingly rejected Sanders\u2019s failure-to-investigate theory for lack of specificity. <em>See Wright v. Gramley, </em>125 F.3d 1038, 1044 (7th Cir.1997) (\u201c[A]t the very least the petitioner must submit an affidavit from the uncalled witness stating the testimony he or she would have given had they been called at trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">On appeal Sanders attempts to rectify the lack of specifics by detailing in his brief the testimony that might have been elicited from Marshal. Sanders says that if Reilley had interviewed and called Marshal as a witness, she would have testified that Lisa Mahone bragged to her that she was going to help her boyfriend get out of prison early by setting up Sanders. According to Sanders, Marshal would have testified that Mahone admitted that she never really bought crack from Sanders but instead had hidden the drugs in her bra before meeting with Sanders and simply tricked Sanders into \u201cholding\u201d $1,250 for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">There are several problems with this theory, any one of which is fatal. To begin, Sanders cannot press a theory here that he did not present to the district court. <em>See, e.g., Fischer v. United States, </em>285 F.3d 596, 600-01 (7th Cir.2002); <em>Valenzuela v. United States, </em>261 F.3d 694, 700 (7th Cir.2001). Moreover, Sanders has not provided an affidavit from Marshal, and we will not assume that his attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>did not try to interview Marshal or that she would have testified as Sanders describes. <em>See Wright, </em>125 F.3d at 1044. Even if we were willing to overlook these problems, Sanders does not explain why he believes that Marshal\u2019s testimony would have trumped the other evidence of his guilt (including his signed confession). His sanguine declaration that if Marshal had testified \u201cthere would have been a different outcome\u201d at trial is not enough to demonstrate that the failure to call her prejudiced his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Finally, Sanders argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying him an evidentiary hearing on the claims in his \u00a7 2255 motion. Sanders correctly notes that a district court must grant an evidentiary hearing if the movant \u201calleges facts that, if proven would entitle him to relief,\u201d <em>Stoia v. United States, </em>22 F.3d 766, 768 (7th Cir.1994), but the petitioner\u2019s factual allegations must be \u201csupported by an affidavit before we will require the additional step of an evidentiary hearing,\u201d <em>Galbraith, </em>313 F.3d at 1010; <em>see Aleman v. United States, </em>878 F.2d 1009, 1012 (7th Cir.1989) (\u201cMere unsupported allegations cannot support a petitioner\u2019s request for a hearing.\u201d). The only theory for which Sanders provided any factual support in the district court was his allegation that prior to and during the trial Reilley was taking pain medication to manage his serious illness, but even that factual support was submitted <em>after </em>the district court had already denied his motion. Even if the affidavits had been submitted earlier, they would not have warranted an evidentiary hearing because they do not identify any <em>specific </em>instances in which illness or medication compromised Reilley\u2019s performance. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Sanders\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">. We note that Sanders argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred when it refused to continue his trial so that he could discharge Reilley and obtain substitute counsel. This argument could have been raised on direct appeal but was not, <em>see Bous-ley, </em>523 U.S. at 621, 118 S.Ct. 1604; <em>Young, </em>124 F.3d at 795-96, was not raised before the district court, <em>Fischer, </em>285 F.3d at 601; <em>Valenzuela, </em>261 F.3d at 700, and is beyond the scope of the certificate of appealability. Accordingly, we decline to review it. We note in passing, however, that even though Sanders asserts that he made the request prior to trial \u201cin open court on the record,\u201d we were unable to locate any such request in the trial transcript, and no motion for a continuance or to substitute counsel appears on the district court's docket.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
