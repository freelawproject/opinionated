MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b565-26\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-27\">Luis Tomas Ramirez-Nino pleaded guilty to unlawful re-entry of a deported alien following a felony conviction, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Prior to his deportation, Ramirez-Nino was convicted of the felony offenses of soliciting child prostitution in violation of Colorado Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>vised Statute \u00a7 18-7-402 and intimidating a witness, in violation of Colorado Revised Statute \u00a7 18-8-704.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Ramirez-Nino filed a pro se \u201cMotion for ResentencingTteconsideration, Alternatively Notice of Appeal\u201d asserting his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to request a continuance of the sentencing hearing. Thereafter, his trial counsel filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this court, Ramirez-Nino\u2019s counsel, Keyonyu X O\u2019Connell, filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), moving to withdraw as counsel. Specifically, counsel advises that Ramirez-Nino waived his right to appeal his conviction. In the alternative, counsel suggests that the appeal raises no arguably meritorious issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Under <em>Anders, </em>counsel may \u201crequest permission to withdraw where counsel conscientiously examines a case and determines that any appeal would be wholly frivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005). Counsel is required to submit a brief to both the defendant and this court indicating any potential appealable issues. <em>Id. </em>The defendant may then submit additional arguments. \u201cThe [c]ourt must then conduct a full examination of the record to determine whether defendant\u2019s claims are wholly frivolous. If the court concludes after such an examination that the appeal is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and may dismiss the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Ramirez-Nino\u2019s counsel filed her <em>Anders </em>brief on March 3, 2008. The defendant has not submitted any additional arguments. Our conclusions, therefore, are based on counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and our own review of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">\u201cA defendant who knowingly and voluntarily pleads guilty waives all non-jurisdictional challenges to his conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>43 F.3d 491, 494 (10th Cir.1994) (footnote omitted). In <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1325 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc), this court held it would enforce appellate waivers so long as three conditions were met: (1) the matter on appeal falls within the scope of the waiver; (2) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) enforcing the waiver will not result in a miscarriage of justice. Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>our review of the record demonstrates that Ramirez-Nino knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty and the <em>Hahn </em>factors favor enforcing the defendant\u2019s waiver of appellate rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Even if Ramirez-Nino could appeal his conviction, the appeal contains no arguably non-frivolous grounds. Ramirez-Nino, in his pro se filing in the district court, alleged his counsel was ineffective for failing to request a continuance of his sentencing hearing. The defendant argued the continuance was necessary to allow his counsel to further investigate, <em>inter alia, </em>whether his Colorado conviction for intimidating a witness could be challenged based on the court\u2019s and his Colorado lawyer\u2019s failure to advise him of the deportation consequences of his plea. Ramirez-Nino argued that if his motion to set aside his Colorado conviction was granted, his current conviction for unlawful reentry following a felony could not be sustained. This argument is without merit on at least two grounds. First, pursuant to <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions are sentencing enhancements, not an element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>to be proved under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Second, the failure to advise a defendant of \u201cthe collateral consequences of possible deportation prior to the entry of a guilty plea\u201d cannot form the basis of relief. <em>Varela v. Kaiser, </em>976 F.2d 1357, 1357 (10th Cir.1992); <em>see also People v. Pozo, </em>746 P.2d 523, 526 (Colo.1987) (\u201cIt is well settled that a trial court is not required to advise a defendant <em>suu sponte </em>of potential federal deportation consequences of a plea of guilty to a felony charge when accepting such plea.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The only other possible basis for an appeal would relate to Ramirez-Nino\u2019s sentence. Our review of the record, however, reveals no other claims arguable on their merits, and we accordingly conclude that Ramirez-Nino\u2019s appeal is wholly frivolous. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted and this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b565-12\">This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\">.
