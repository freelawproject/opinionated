Meares was sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>to a total of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment. He challenges this sentence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">As to the armed bank robbery offense charged in Count One, the Presentence Investigation Report recommended an adjusted offense level of twenty and a criminal history category of V, thereby resulting in an advisory guideline range of 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A (2006) (sentencing table). As to the firearms offense charged in Count Two, Meares\u2019s advisory guideline sentence was the minimum term of imprisonment required by statute, or eighty-four months. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2K2.4(b) (2006); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Meares agreed with the contents of the presentence report, including the details surrounding a second armed bank robbery that was charged in Count Three, but dismissed pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement. The district court, however, determined that an additional two-level increase was warranted under USSG \u00a7 3A1.1 (2006) (vulnerable victim enhancement) because Meares took a woman in her fifties hostage during the second armed bank robbery. Meares\u2019s counsel argued against the enhancement, stating the purpose of \u00a7 3A1.1 was to punish offenders who intentionally chose victims based on an immutable characteristic, such as race. The court disagreed with counsel\u2019s argument, and applied the enhancement. Consequently, the advisory guideline range for Count One, based on an adjusted offense level of twenty-two and a criminal history category of V, was 77 to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Because the facts surrounding the robberies were egregious, the court determined that a sentence above the advisory guideline range was warranted. Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K2.21 (2006), the court calculated an upward departure range based on the facts surrounding the dismissed count, including the fact that the second armed bank robbery involved a \u201cvulnerable victim.\u201d Since the court concluded that the departure guideline range was still \u201cinadequate to accurately reflect the planning and consummation of these crimes,\u201d it imposed a variance sentence totaling 300 months\u2019 imprisonment, which included 180 months on Count One and a consecutive term of 120 months on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Meares challenges the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines on appeal. He specifically argues that the court impermissibly double counted the conduct in the dismissed count by using it as the basis for application of a vulnerable victim enhancement during its determination of the advisory guideline range as well as for an upward departure under \u00a7 5K2.21. The Government concedes that the district court impermissibly double counted. Additionally, the Government notes that the court\u2019s application of the vulnerable victim enhancement in calculating the advisory guideline range was likewise erroneous as it was based on conduct unrelated to the crimes for which Meares pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">When determining a sentence, the district court must calculate the appropriate advisory guideline range and consider it in conjunction with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006). Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence, \u201cwhether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range,\u201d is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 591.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">\u201cDouble counting occurs when a provision of the Guidelines is applied to increase punishment on the basis of a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>sideration that had been accounted for by application of another Guideline provision or by application of a statute.\u201d <em>United States v. Reevey, </em>364 F.3d 151, 158 (4th Cir.2004). Unless expressly prohibited by the Guidelines, double counting is permitted. <em>Id. </em>Such is the case in \u00a7 5K2.21, which recognizes that a court may \u201cdepart upward to reflect the actual seriousness of the offense based on conduct ... underlying a charge dismissed as part of a plea agreement,\u201d but requires that the conduct at issue may not have \u201center[ed] into the determination of the applicable guideline range.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5K2.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The district court indisputably used the dismissed conduct in Count Three to both calculate the advisory guideline range and depart upward under \u00a7 5K2.21. As this form of double counting is expressly prohibited by \u00a7 5K2.21, the court\u2019s application of the Guidelines was erroneous. Moreover, as commendably noted by the Government, the court\u2019s application of the vulnerable victim enhancement in initially determining Meares\u2019s advisory guideline range was likewise erroneous as the conduct underlying the enhancement was unrelated to the chai\u2019ges for which Meares pled guilty. Consequently, Meares\u2019s sentence, which is the result of significant procedural error, is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 160-62, 164 (4th Cir.2008). We therefore vacate Meai'es\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">On remand, the district court should fh'st determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for the determination. <em>Id. </em>at 160-61. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 161. If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should articulate its reasons for the departure or variance with respect to each count. <em>Id. </em>We, of course, indicate no view as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon Meares, leaving that detex\u2019mination, in the first instance, to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
