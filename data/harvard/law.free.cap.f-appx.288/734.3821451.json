We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-15\">Diaz-Pichardo does not challenge the procedure by which the district court determined his sentence. Instead, he argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the purpose of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and did not reflect the mitigating circumstances of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-16\">Diaz-Pichardo argues that a lower sentence is appropriate because his crimes were not violent and because he reentered the United States to earn money for his sick mother\u2019s medical care. The district court considered these mitigating factors but found that because of Diaz-Pichardo\u2019s recidivist behavior, a sentence within the Guidelines range was warranted. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s sentence was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201cRegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of discretion standard.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b757-19\">Diaz-Pichardo raises two other arguments for the first time on appeal, which we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 207-08 (2d Cir.2007). First, Diaz-Pichardo ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>gues that the Guidelines sentencing range for illegal reentry offenses is excessive because it is greater than the range applicable to certain violent offenses. This disagreement with the policies reflected in the Guidelines does not establish plain error. Second, Diaz-Pichardo argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it violates \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s dictate to \u201cavoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Diaz-Pichardo contends that his sentence would have been lower in a district with a \u201cfast track\u201d program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This also does not establish plain error. \u201c[A] district court\u2019s refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a fast-track program does not make a sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158, 164 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-23\">. A \u201cfast track program\u201d permits a defendant to receive the probability of a lower sentence in exchange for a decision to plead guilty quickly, to refrain from filing pretrial motions, and to waive his right to appeal or collaterally attack his sentence. A district must be authorized by the Attorney General to offer a \u201cfast track\u201d program.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
