LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b563-26\">Alejandro Ortiz-Lopez, a citizen of Mexico, appeals his sentence of 41 months\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>imprisonment imposed following his plea of guilty to one count of unlawful reentry into the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). In a brief filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Ortiz-Lopez\u2019s counsel asserts that there are no nonfrivolous arguments for presentation on appeal and moves for leave to withdraw. Because we agree that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, we dismiss the appeal, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">On May 8, 2007 \u2014 only four days after Ortiz-Lopez was deported due to New Mexico state convictions for assault with intent to commit a violent felony, false imprisonment, and aggravated battery \u2014 an agent from the United States Border Patrol apprehended him as he attempted to cross into the United States near Columbus, New Mexico. Two months later, on July 10, 2007, a federal grand jury indicted Ortiz-Lopez on one count of unlawful reentry of a previously removed alien, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). Ortiz-Lopez subsequently pleaded guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Ortiz-Lopez\u2019s Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III. His criminal history category was set at III based on five criminal history points\u2014 three from the aforementioned New Mexico state convictions, and two because his illegal reentry into the United States occurred within two years of his release from state custody. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a) &amp; (e). These sentencing considerations yielded an advisory United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. Nevertheless, the PSR noted that, under \u00a7 4A1.3(b), the Guidelines appeared to substantially overrepresent Ortiz-Lopez\u2019s criminal history and that a downward departure might therefore be warranted. It recommended that the court consider imposing a sentence as if Ortiz-Lopez had been placed in a criminal history category of II, which would have resulted in an advisory sentencing range of 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Both before and during his sentencing hearing, Ortiz-Lopez asked the court to grant a downward variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and to sentence him to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the January 15, 2008, sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the PSR\u2019s recommendation for a downward departure and placed Ortiz-Lopez in criminal history category II. The court then analyzed the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), and imposed a sentence of 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of the resulting Guidelines range. This timely appeal followed. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">If an attorney conscientiously examines a case and determines that any appeal would be wholly frivolous, counsel may \u201cso advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Counsel must submit a brief to both the appellate court and the client, pointing to anything in the record that could potentially present an appealable issue. The client may then choose to offer argument to the court. If, upon complete examination of the record, the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>dismiss the appeal. <em>Id. </em>Acting pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>counsel in the present case provided Ortiz-Lopez with a copy of the appellate brief, and Ortiz-Lopez has declined the opportunity to file a pro se brief in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Counsel\u2019s brief raises only two arguably appealable issues: (1) whether the district court adequately considered the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), and (2) whether the district court imposed a substantively reasonable sentence. Upon complete review of the record, we conclude that there is no nonfrivolous basis for challenging the sentence. The transcript from the sentencing hearing demonstrates that the district court properly considered the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a), and that the sentence given, considering each of those statutory factors, was reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201cRegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-diseretion standard.\u201d); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">Thus, because Ortiz-Lopez has failed to present us with any meritorious grounds for appeal, we DISMISS the appeal, and GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-27\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
