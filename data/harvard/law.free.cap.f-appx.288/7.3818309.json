He initiated this civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, alleging violations of the Eighth Amendment and retaliation. Although defendants moved for summary judgment only as to the Eighth Amendment claim, the District Court granted summary judgment as to both claims on the basis that Powell\u2019s failure to show deliberate indifference necessarily meant that he could not show an improper motive in support of his retaliation claim. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Powell alleged that on January 31, 2005, defendant Margaret Miller, a nurse at the correctional institution, forced him to take the wrong medicine, which caused unspecified health problems, and that she refused to permit Powell to see a doctor. Powell alleges that Miller was retaliating against him for a previous lawsuit he had filed in state court. Powell also alleged that defendant Mary Jo Hays refused to permit Powell to see a doctor, also in retaliation. Powell asserted that Miller and Hays conspired against him because he had sued one of their friends, Nurse Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The District Court dismissed Powell\u2019s claims seeking damages from defendants Beard and Tennis. The defendants moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims on the basis that Powell allegedly had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment on Powell\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim. Powell filed a response in opposition. In their reply brief, defendants addressed Powell\u2019s retaliation claim. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting in part and denying in part defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion regarding exhaustion. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting summary judgment on Powell\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim, and denying summary judgment on Powell\u2019s retaliation claim due to defendants\u2019 failure to present them argument in them opening brief. The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendations regarding exhaustion and the Eighth Amendment claim. The District Court disagreed with the Magistrate Judge\u2019s recommendation regarding the retaliation claim and granted summary judgment as to both the Eighth Amendment claim and the retaliation claim. Powell appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and we apply the same standard that the District Court should have applied. <em>MBIA Ins. Corp. v. Royal Indem. Co., </em>426 F.3d 204, 209 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Powell has stated that he appeals the District Court\u2019s order only as to his retaliation claim. Accordingly, we will confine our review to that issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">To prevail on a claim for retaliation by prison officials, a plaintiff must show that: (1) he engaged in constitutionally protected conduct; (2) he suffered some \u201cadverse action\u201d by prison officials; and (3) his exercise of a constitutional right was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action. <em>Rauser v. Horn, </em>241 F.3d 330, 333-334 (3d Cir.2001). \u201cPrison officials may still prevail by proving that they would have made the same decision absent the protected conduct for reasons reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">Defendants failed to move for summary judgment on Powell\u2019s retaliation claim. Although District Courts have the power to grant summary judgment <em>sua sponte, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>entry of summary </em>judgment generally is proper only if the party against whom summary judgment will be entered had notice of possible summary judgment and an opportunity to come forward with relevant evidence to prevent summary judgment. <em>Gibson v. Mayor and Council of Wilmington, </em>355 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir. 2004) (citing <em>Celotex v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 326, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The District Court determined that permitting Powell to respond would be futile because Powell had failed to proffer any evidence of the defendants\u2019 deliberate indifference and thus could not prevail as a matter of law. We agree. As the District Court observed, the record reveals that Powell refused to be weighed and/or measured when he sought to be examined by a prison doctor, and that his lack of cooperation prevented him from seeing a doctor. Powell submitted nothing to dispute those facts. Although defendants did not move for summary judgment on the retaliation claim, Powell was on notice that he was required to come forward with evidence to dispute defendants\u2019 explanation of their actions in response to defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to his Eighth Amendment claim that he was denied access to medical care. Powell failed to proffer any evidence of improper motive, and therefore, his retaliation claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">For this reason, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-6\">. It appears that summary judgment was properly granted as to Powell\u2019s other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
