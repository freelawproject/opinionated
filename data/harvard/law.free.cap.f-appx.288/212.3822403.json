The district court imposed a non-guideline sentence of 60 months in prison, which was twice the advisory guidelines range maximum of 30 months. Craft argues that this sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The record shows that the district court specifically considered Craft\u2019s criminal history, his victimization of vulnerable codefendants, the need to deter his future criminal conduct, the need to protect the public, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to provide a just punishment. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Craft because it properly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and provided sufficiently detailed reasons for arriving at the sentence imposed. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 808-09 (5th Cir.2008). Furthermore, the extent of the variance was not unreasonable given the evidence before the district court. <em>See United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 419 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 251-53 (5th Cir.), <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>479 F.3d 904 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
