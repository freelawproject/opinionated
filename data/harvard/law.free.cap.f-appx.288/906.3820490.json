We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">The Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). The INA defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). An applicant can establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2006). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir.2006). A determination regarding eligibility for asylum is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer \u201cspecific, cogent reason[s]\u201d for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). \u201cExamples of specific and cogent reasons include inconsistent statements, contradictory evidence, and inherently improbable testimony .... \u201d <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). This court accords broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). This court will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not clearly erroneous. The record does not compel a different result. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Board\u2019s denial of Kaba\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding from removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-11\"> Kaba does not challenge the Board's denial of his application for withholding under the CAT.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
