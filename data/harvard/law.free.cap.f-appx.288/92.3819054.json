He was sentenced to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment or the low end of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range of imprisonment. On appeal, Franklin\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising for the court\u2019s consideration whether the district court plainly erred by enhancing Franklin\u2019s offense level based on possession of a firearm. Franklin was informed of the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief, but did not do so. The Government did not file a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-21\">Because Franklin did not object to the firearm enhancement, review is for plain error. To establish plain error under <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), a defendant must show that (1) error occurred; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. Even when these conditions are satisfied, we will exercise our discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-22\">The district court determines issues related to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>United States v. Engleman, </em>916 F.2d 182, 184 (4th Cir. 1990). Based on the facts in the presen-tence investigation report, we find there was no plain error. In any event, Frank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>lin\u2019s offense level was determined by his career offender status. Thus, even if there was error with respect to the firearm enhancement, Franklin was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this ease and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Franklin\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If he requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
