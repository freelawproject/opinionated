Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Che </em>(B.I.A. July 31, 2007). Further, we grant Che\u2019s motion to submit on briefs. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
