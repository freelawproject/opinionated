Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d) and Michael E. Peters (\u201cPeters\u201d) (together, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant Dover Downs, Inc. (\u201cDefendant\u201d or \u201cDover Downs\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Defendant terminated them in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq. </em>In granting Defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, the district court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to carry their evidentiary burdens under either the \u201cdirect evidence\u201d framework of <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) or the \u201cindirect evidence\u201d framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Williams v. Dover Downs Inc., </em>No. 05-CV-435, 2007 WL 1297022, at **4-7 (D.Del. May 2, 2007). We agree and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Because we write for the benefit of the parties, we discuss only the facts necessary to the disposition of this case. On December 23, 2003, Plaintiffs were among six Dover Downs employees who observed an unauthorized drag race between two other employees, Ernie Carlisle and Brian Williams (who is Williams\u2019 son), at the Dover International Speedway. The Speedway is owned by Defendant and world famous for its NASCAR races. The race ended when Brian Williams crashed his vehicle and was taken away in an ambulance. After investigating the incident, Dover Downs fired Carlisle, Brian Williams, and both Plaintiffs. At the time of the firing, Williams was fifty-five years old and had worked for Dover Downs since 1978; Peters was fifty-two years old and had been employed there since 1985. The other four employees, whose ages ranged from twenty-four to sixty-eight years, were briefly suspended but were not terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-14\">In Plaintiffs\u2019 written termination notices, Dover Downs explained that Plaintiffs were being fired \u201c[i]n view of the fact that [they] had very recently been issued a written warning for insubordination, and the fact that [they] did not report this very serious incident.\u201d The letters noted that both Plaintiffs situated them work vehicles at the gate to the race track so as to \u201cprevent anyone from coming in during the race,\u201d and indicated that them positions as Mechanic I\u2019s gave them the \u201cresponsibility to report any suspicious, unsafe or reckless behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">Edward Sutor, Dover Downs\u2019 Chief Operating Officer, made the final decision to fire Plaintiffs, testifying that he held Plaintiffs more culpable than the other four observers \u201cbecause of them age and experience.\u201d When asked whether he held older employees to a higher standard, Sutor said \u201cNo,\u201d stating instead that his expectations of Plaintiffs were based on their many years of experience, not their ages. Sutor also testified that Plaintiffs\u2019 insubordination citations were not relevant to the termination decision; instead, according to Sutor, the termination decision was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>on the \u201cegregious nature of the incident\u201d and the \u201cbreach of responsibility\u201d they committed by parking them vehicles across the gate to the track.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same tests as the district court. <em>Tomasso v. Boeing Co., </em>445 F.3d 702 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">To succeed in an age discrimination case under the ADEA, \u201ca plaintiff must show that his or her age \u2018actually motivated\u2019 and \u2018had a determinative influence\u2019 on the employer\u2019s decision to fire him or her.\u201d <em>Fakete v. Aetna, Inc., </em>308 F.3d 335, 337 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 141, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000)). \u201cA plaintiff can meet this burden (1) by presenting direct evidence of discrimination, <em>see Price Waterhouse </em>..., or (2) by presenting indirect evidence of discrimination that satisfies the familiar three-step framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>...\u201d <em>Fasold v. Justice, </em>409 F.3d 178, 184 (3d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Fakete, </em>308 F.3d at 337-38); <em>Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1101 (3d Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Direct evidence of age discrimination under the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>scheme requires that Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of age discrimination be sufficient to allow the fact-finder to find that the employer placed a substantial negative reliance on the plaintiffs age in reaching its decision. <em>Glanzman v. Metro. Mgmt. Corp., </em>391 F.3d 506, 512 (3d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Fakete, </em>308 F.3d at 338). This means that Plaintiffs must produce evidence that \u201cthe employer\u2019s discriminatory motivation \u2018caused\u2019 the employment decision.\u201d <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 265, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Once the plaintiff has done so, the burden shifts to the employer, who must then prove that it would have taken the same action regardless of Plaintiffs\u2019 ages. <em>See Fakete, </em>308 F.3d at 338 (citing <em>Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 265-66, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Here, Plaintiffs argue that Sutor\u2019s statement that Plaintiffs \u201chad a greater degree of responsibility ... because of them age and experience\u201d is direct evidence of age discrimination sufficient to meet the <em>Price Waterhouse </em>test. Sutor\u2019s statement is not direct evidence that an age-discriminatory motive caused the terminations. As the district court rightly noted, the context of Sutor\u2019s statement indicates that he fired Plaintiffs mainly because of their longevity of service and familiarity with the operations at Dover Downs, <em>see Hazen, Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 </em>U.S. 604, 611, 113 S.Ct. 1701, 123 L.Ed.2d 338 (1993) (\u201c[A]ge and years of service are analytically distinct\u201d); <em>cf. Kg. Ret. Sys. v. EEOC, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2361, -, 171 L.Ed.2d 322 (2008) (concluding that differential treatment based upon a pension status that turns in part on age does not necessarily mean that the differential treatment is \u201cmotivated\u201d by age or that there was discrimination \u201cbecause of\u201d age), and because he perceived that they were more involved in the racing activity than the other participants. Moreover, even if we assume that Sutor\u2019s statement constitutes evidence that a discriminatory motive caused Plaintiffs\u2019 terminations, Defendant has demonstrated that it would have terminated Plaintiffs regardless of their ages. <em>See Price Waterhouse, </em>490 U.S. at 266, 277, 109 S.Ct. 1775 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">Alternatively, ADEA plaintiffs may proceed under the indirect evidence theory, if they present circumstantial evidence sufficient to satisfy their burden under our \u201cslightly modified version\u201d of the three-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>step <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting scheme. Under that scheme, Plaintiffs must first establish a prima facie case using indirect evidence by showing that they (1) were members of the protected class, i.e., they were 40 years of age or older, <em>see 29 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 631(a), (2) were discharged, (3) were qualified for the position from which they were terminated, and (4) were replaced by a sufficiently younger person to create an inference of age discrimination. <em>See Keller, </em>130 F.3d at 1108; <em>accord Atkinson v. Lafayette Coll., </em>460 F.3d 447, 454 (3d Cir.2006). Once Plaintiffs establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden of production (but not the burden of persuasion) shifts to Defendant, \u201cwho must then offer evidence that is sufficient, if believed, to support a finding that it had a legitimate reason for the discharge.\u201d <em>Keller, </em>130 F.3d at 1108 (citing <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 506-07, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993)). If the employer fails to satisfy its burden, judgment must be entered for the plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>If, on the other hand, the employer satisfies this burden, Plaintiffs may survive summary judgment by pointing \u201cto some evidence, direct or circumstantial, from which a factfinder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer\u2019s articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 763 (3d Cir.1994)); <em>see also Atkinson, </em>460 F.3d at 454 (\u201cIf the [employer advances a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action,] the burden shifts back to [Plaintiffs] to prove that the nondiscriminatory explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Here, Plaintiffs have established a pri-ma facie case. Defendant, however, has offered sufficient evidence to support a finding that it had a legitimate reason for the discharge, namely, that Plaintiffs (1) held positions of some responsibility, which included the responsibility for reporting unsafe or reckless behavior of other employees, (2) blocked the gate in order to prevent interference with the race, and (3) failed to report the drag race to management or security, or to take any efforts to stop the race.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Because Defendant has satisfied its burden of production, Plaintiffs must point to some evidence from which we could reasonably conclude that Defendant\u2019s articulated legitimate reasons are not believable or that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer\u2019s action. This they have failed to do. Plaintiffs point only to Sutor\u2019s \u201cage\u201d reference and Dover Downs\u2019 inconsistent explanations for the terminations. These inconsistencies do not constitute \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions ... that a reasonable factfinder <em>could </em>rationally find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Fuentes, </em>32 F.3d at 765 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201c[D]efendant in this case provided evidence that it had a particularly powerful reason for discharging\u201d Plaintiffs, i.e., their participation in and failure to stop the drag race on pit row, which resulted in an extremely serious crash, a crash which Williams described as the \u201cmost horrible thing I have ever seen in my life.\u201d <em>See Keller, </em>130 F.3d at 1109. Nothing put forth by Plaintiffs meets their burden of showing, \u201cnot merely that the employer\u2019s proffered reason[s were] wrong, but that [they] were so plainly wrong that it cannot have been the employer\u2019s real reason.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Plaintiffs failed to provide direct or circumstantial evidence of age discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>sufficient to survive summary judgment.
