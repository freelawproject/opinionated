Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Luciano-Ramos\u2019 untimely filing of his asylum application should be excused due to changed or extraordinary circumstances. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Luciano-Ramos failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground if he returns to Brazil. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (explaining that applicant for withholding of removal bears burden of showing persecution was or will be on account of a protected ground).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">Substantial evidence further supports the denial of CAT relief because Luciano-Ramos did not show it is more likely than not that he will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government. <em>Cf. Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1194-95 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">We lack jurisdiction to review Luciano-Ramos\u2019 contentions that he qualifies for humanitarian asylum, that his procedural due process rights were violated, and that he suffers from seizures, because he failed to exhaust these claims before the agency. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b392-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
