Rogers makes several arguments on appeal. First, Rogers contests the amount of drugs to which the district court held him accountable, and he also asserts that the court should have \u201ctotally excluded\u201d the amount of cocaine from his offense level calculation, imposed as relevant conduct, because Rogers provided the information about the conspiracy\u2019s cocaine involvement to law enforcement agents. Second, Rogers argues that the court clearly erred by finding that he committed the instant of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>fense while on probation. Third, Rogers contests the court\u2019s application of an obstruction of justice enhancement and its denial of reductions for acceptance of responsibility and safety-valve relief. Fourth, Rogers argues that his sentence is unreasonable. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual determination of the drug quantity for which Rogers is accountable. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cFor a factual finding to be \u2018clearly erroneous,\u2019 we, \u2018after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Because Rogers argues for the first time that the district court violated \u00a7 1B1.8, we review that issue only for plain error. \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Rogers\u2019s argument that he is responsible for less than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana is without merit in light of the fact that he admitted during his plea hearing and in his written and signed plea agreement that he was responsible for more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. In his brief on appeal, he again acknowledges that he pled guilty to involvement with over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana. Thus, the district court did not err by holding Rogers accountable for an amount of marijuana that was consistent with, and, in this case, less than, the amount to which he admitted. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989) (stating that \u201c[t]he findings of fact of the sentencing court may be based on evidence heard during trial, facts admitted by a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, undisputed statements in the presentence report, or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Even though Rogers admitted to being responsible for at least 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, the district court held him accountable for a lesser amount of marijuana. Specifically, the court found that Rogers was accountable for a total of 1,067.7 kilograms of marijuana, which consisted of 911 kilograms of marijuana and 156.7 kilograms of marijuana-equivalent cocaine. Although the charge to which Rogers pled guilty did not specify cocaine involvement, the record, nonetheless, supports the court\u2019s finding with respect to the amount of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Co-conspirator John Mikhael testified that he sold Rogers 125 grams of cocaine on 4 occasions for a total of 500 grams, and 1 ounce on 10 occasions for a total of 283.5 grams. Although Rogers testified that John Mikhael provided him only two ounces of cocaine, the district court\u2019s determination to credit John Mikhael\u2019s testimony was within its exclusive province. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1280-81 n. 2 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 175, 169 L.Ed.2d 119 (2007) (applying the principle that credibility determinations are the exclusive province of the fact finder). The bottle of inositol and the jeweler\u2019s baggies that were found in Rogers\u2019s residence during a search corroborated the court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Significantly, the court limited its finding to those amounts of cocaine that were directly attributable to Rogers. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.2) (specifying that in a case involving drugs, the conspirator\u2019s relevant conduct includes amounts directly attributable to the conspirator and \u201call reasonably foreseeable quantities of [drugs] that were within the scope of the criminal activity that [the conspirator] jointly undertook\u201d). Thus, the court did not clearly err in finding that Rogers\u2019s \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for purposes of calculating his base offense level included 156.7 kilograms of marijuana based on 783.5 grams of cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 &amp; comment, (n.2); <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Finally, Rogers\u2019s argument concerning \u00a7 lB1.8(a) is without merit for at least two reasons. First, the government was entitled to revoke the plea agreement based upon Rogers\u2019s untruthful testimony about the cocaine. Because cause existed for revocation of the agreement, the government was not required to withhold Rogers\u2019s statements concerning the conspiracy\u2019s involvement with cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.8(a). Second, although Rogers provided information about the conspiracy's cocaine involvement, the record reflects that Rogers\u2019s \u201cinformation\u201d confirmed information that was already known by the authorities. Thus, information that the conspirators were involved with cocaine was obtained from independent sources. <em>See United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1244 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that, \u201cso long as the information is obtained from independent sources or separately gleaned from codefendants, it may be used at sentencing without violating \u00a7 1B1.8\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not err, much less plainly err, by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>find a violation of \u00a7 lB1.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">When the defendant objects to his criminal history points in the district court, we review the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Phillips, </em>413 F.3d 1288, 1292 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">The Sentencing Guidelines instruct that two points are added to the defendant\u2019s criminal history score \u201cif the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, [or] supervised release....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d). The Commentary reiterates that \u201c[t]wo points are added if the defendant committed any part of the instant offense (i.e., any relevant conduct) while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, [or] supervised release....\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">The district court did not clearly err by finding that Rogers committed the instant offense while he was on probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court\u2019s finding was consistent with Rogers\u2019s guilty plea and his admission to the factual basis contained in the written plea agreement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which Rogers also signed. Nonetheless, aside from Rogers\u2019s own admissions, other evidence also supports Rogers\u2019s involvement during that time. Specifically, the court credited John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Mikhael\u2019s testimony that he began providing Rogers with marijuana sometime in 2004. Accordingly, because Rogers committed the instant offense while he was on probation, the court properly added two points to Rogers\u2019s criminal history score.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">A. Safety-Valve</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determinations to grant safety-valve relief. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The Guidelines\u2019 \u201csafety-valve\u201d provision permits the district court to impose a sentence below a statutory minimum sentence if it finds that the defendant meets the five requirements set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l)-(5). <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1) \u2014 (5) (same). The eligibility requirement relevant to the instant case is that \u201cthe defendant does not have more than [one] criminal history point....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(1); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The district court did not clearly err because Rogers is ineligible for safety-valve relief in light of the fact that he has three criminal history points. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">B. Obstruction of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">When a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice is imposed, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Massey, 443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th </em>Cir.2006). Section 3C1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides for a two-level sentence enhancement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-14\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">Application Note 4 in the Commentary provides a \u201cnon-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct to which this adjustment applies.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.4). Some examples to which the enhancement applies include, \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury\u201d and \u201cproviding materially false information to a judge or magistrate.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.4(b), (f)). \u201cPerjury, for purposes of applying [\u00a7 3C1.1], has been defined by the United States Supreme Court as \u2018false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Singh, </em>291 F.3d 756, 763 (11th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Dunni-gan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993)). \u201cMaterial\u201d evidence \u201cmeans evidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">The district court did not clearly err in applying the obstruction of justice enhancement. John Mikhael testified that he sold Rogers cocaine \u201con some 14 occasions.\u201d Rogers initially denied any in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>volvement with cocaine and then, at his sentencing hearing, admitted to only two occasions in which John Mikhael \u201cfronted him\u201d cocaine. Crediting John Mikhael\u2019s testimony, as was within its province to do so, the court found that Rogers had falsely denied his involvement with the cocaine-part of the conspiracy. Thus, because the issue of drug quantity was material to Rogers\u2019s Guidelines offense level calculation, and because Rogers provided false testimony concerning the matter, the district court did not clearly err by applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 &amp; comment. (n.4(b), (f); n.6); <em>Singh, </em>291 F.3d at 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">C. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1320 (11th Cir.2004). A defendant is entitled to a two-level reduction in his offense level if he \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). A defendant acts in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility when he \u201cfalsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.l(a)). Although there may be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 (obstruction of justice) and 3E1.1 may apply, \u201c[cjonduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n.4). \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. For this reason, the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The district court did not clearly err in its denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because Rogers has not demonstrated that he is entitled to the reduction. As mentioned above, Rogers obstructed justice when he testified falsely at his sentencing hearing about his involvement with cocaine. Thus, Rogers acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility, and no extraordinary circumstances exist that would justify applying adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(a); n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">\u201c \u2018In reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 750 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). The Supreme Court recently clarified the reasonableness standard as a review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Id., </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. When reviewing the sentence for procedural reasonableness, we must</p>\n<p id=\"azv-dedup-0\">ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">A sentence may be substantively unreasonable because, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) it does \u201cnot achieve the purposes of sentencing stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>in \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d; or (2) \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">\u201cGenerally, when sentencing within the advisory Guidelines range, the district court is not required to give a lengthy explanation for its sentence if the case is typical of those contemplated by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir. 2008). However, the sentencing judge should \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Although we do not apply a presumption of reasonableness, \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party challenging the reasonableness of a sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the advisory guidelines range; (5) pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Rogers has not demonstrated that his sentence is unreasonable. The district court correctly calculated Rogers\u2019s Guidelines range and was not required to give a lengthy explanation for its decision to impose a Guidelines sentence. <em>See Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1090. Nonetheless, the record reflects that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Rogers\u2019s 236-month sentence is at the mid-point of the Guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788; <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the actual prison term imposed against the statutory maximum). The court considered the parties\u2019 arguments, as well as Rogers\u2019s personal statement, and the court had a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decisionmaking authority. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. Accordingly, Rogers has not shown that the court abused its discretion by imposing an unreasonable sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594; <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In light of the foregoing, Rogers\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-6\">.

Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006) (determining that we lacked jurisdiction to review a request for a departure when nothing in the record indicated that the district court believed that it did not have authority to depart downward, and, in fact, the record indicated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>court understood it could depart, but chose not to).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
