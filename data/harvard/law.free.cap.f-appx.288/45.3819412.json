We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-26\">Appellant came to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1987. In 1990, he was convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute and sentenced to five years of probation. In 1992, he was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the aggravated sexual assault of a child less than thirteen years of age in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:14-2(a)(l) and sentenced to eight years imprisonment. In August of 1996, he was paroled and deported to the Dominican Republic, but returned to the United States without permission in 2001. In 2003, he was convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance and sentenced to four years of probation. On October 21, 2005, he was apprehended by immigration authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pled guilty to illegal reentry after deportation subsequent to a conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). The Magistrate Judge accepted the plea and issued a report and recommendation, which the District Court adopted by order dated February 9, 2007. In a Letter Memorandum submitted prior to sentencing, appellant agreed that the sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) was 46-57 months imprisonment and did not seek a downward departure. However, he requested a \u201cmodest\u201d variance from the agreed-upon range based upon, among other factors, the \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions at the Passaic County Jail (\u201cPCJ\u201d) where he had been detained for 18 months. He argued that those conditions \u201crendered his sentence harsher than necessary to satisfy the relevant purposes of sentencing,\u201d and the detention \u201cfar more punitive and less conducive to the rehabilitative purposes of sentencing.\u201d App. at 63-64. He also argued that his motivation for returning to the United States justified a \u201cmeasure of leniency,\u201d because he returned here to work and because much of his family was here, including his mother who was gravely ill. <em>Id. </em>at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the District Court confirmed that there were no departure requests and stated that it would therefore begin its analysis at step three of <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237 (3d Cir.2006), and would consider appellant\u2019s request for a variance under \u00a7 3553(a). In addition to those factors appellant had earlier asked the Court to consider, he asked the Court to take into account the fact that, despite the danger of deportation, he voluntarily registered as a sex offender under Megan\u2019s Law; his prior substance abuse; his attempts to maintain steady employment while in the United States; and his mistaken belief that he could return to the United States after five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">After hearing the parties\u2019 arguments, the District Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">[wjith respect to the Passaic County Jail, the conditions described there do apply to all the prisoners, there\u2019s nothing that indicates that they weren\u2019t typical conditions applicable to all prisoners and, therefore, I don\u2019t find that to be a basis for a variance....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">App. at 30. The Court also stated that it was sympathetic with regard to appellant\u2019s concern for his sick mother and his erroneous belief that he could return to the United States (although it noted he had been warned of the consequences of any illegal reentry), and that it was commendable that he had reported under Megan\u2019s Law. The Court concluded that it would not grant a variance, but would consider these factors within the agreed-upon Guidelines range. The Court sentenced appellant to 46 months imprisonment, the bottom of that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"ad-dedup-0\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"Al\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>We review a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Bungar, </em>478 F.3d 540, 542 (3d Cir.2007). There is a presumption of reasonableness when, as here, the sentence is within the Guidelines range. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Olfano, </em>503 F.3d 240, 245 (3d Cir.2007). \u201c[T]hose sentences that are within the Guidelines range are more likely to be reasonable than those that fall outside [the] range.\u201d <em>Olfano, </em>503 F.3d at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Appellant argues that the District Court failed to adequately consider his argument that the conditions at PCJ rendered his sentence more punitive than necessary to satisfy the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the relevant purposes of sentencing. While the Court did not explicitly rule on this specific argument, concluding instead that the conditions in which appellant was housed were not \u201csufficiently unusual,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 20, it is clear that the Court considered the issue as framed by appellant given that it had read the lengthy memoranda which discussed it, heard argument on it at the sentencing hearing, and did not find that a variance was warranted because of it. Moreover, the Court explained why it rejected appellant\u2019s other reasons in support of a variance, noting that it would take them into account in imposing a sentence within the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">We also reject appellant\u2019s argument that the record reveals the \u201cstrong possibility\u201d that the District Court held his variance request to the standard applicable to departure requests. Specifically, appellant argues that the Court\u2019s finding that the conditions were not \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201catypical\u201d suggests that the Court was applying the departure standard, because \u201cextraordinariness,\u201d which is not a prerequisite for granting a variance, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 595, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), is at the heart of the departure framework.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the Court may have used language similar to that used by courts ruling on departure requests, it is clear that the Court understood that appellant sought a variance under \u00a7 3553(a) when it confirmed that there were no departure requests, and knew that it had the discretion to grant a variance. There is no evidence to suggest that the Court relied on anything other than its discretion when it denied appellant\u2019s request for a variance and sentenced him to the bottom of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">For the above reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\">. Appellant also notes that in its Statement of Reasons, the District Court stated that \u201cthe court finds no reason to depart from the sentence called for by application of the guidelines.\u201d This statement, however, taken in the context of the Court\u2019s discussion at the sentencing hearing, does not lead us to conclude that the Court applied an improper standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
