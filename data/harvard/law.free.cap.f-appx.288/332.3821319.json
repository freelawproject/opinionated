We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-22\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) requires a district court to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cthe parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating ... departure\u201d from the applicable Guideline range \u201con a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s prehearing submission.... The notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.\u201d <em>See also Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 138-39, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991). In this case, Jones\u2019s Pre-Sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) contained language noting that the section was \u201cincluded as notice to all parties that this may be an issue warranting departure.\u201d The PSR also noted that United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l) \u201cmay constitute grounds for an upward departure.\u201d Therefore, as to the issue of the inadequacy of Jones\u2019s criminal history, the district court did not need to provide further notice that it might depart upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">A district court may depart upward from an applicable Guideline range \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(A) and 4A1.2, cmt. n. 8. Jones\u2019s initial criminal history score did not reflect either the seriousness of his criminal history or the likelihood of recidivism. <em>See United States v. Bad Marriage, </em>392 F.3d 1103, 1111-13 (9th Cir. 2004). Thus, the district court\u2019s calculation of Jones\u2019s advisory sentencing Guideline range was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The district court did not plainly err by applying the preponderance of the evidence standard rather than the clear\u2019 and convincing evidence standard. Jones failed to object to the district court\u2019s application of the preponderance standard. A district court determines the base offense level for solicitation of a crime by looking to the base offense level for the substantive offense, including \u201cany adjustments from such guideline for any intended offense conduct that can be established with reasonable certainty.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1(a); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(7). The evidence demonstrated that Jones intended to rob more than $800,000 from the Bank. The amount was not speculative. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1 cmt. n. 2. Jones was not prejudiced by the district court\u2019s use of the wrong standard of proof, and the district court did not clearly err by enhancing Jones\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The district court did not clearly err in concluding that no further hearing was necessary to determine whether the government\u2019s failure to move under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for a substantial assistance reduction was in bad faith. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the government has the discretion, but not the duty, to move for a downward departure where a defendant renders substantial assistance to the government. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). If a defendant contends that he cooperated and that the prosecutor is acting in bad faith while declining to file a motion, \u201ca factual dispute arises, and the district court can determine whether in fact the defendant did provide substantial assistance as part of the bad faith determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Mikaelian, </em>168 F.3d 380, 385 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see United States v. Quack, </em>302 F.3d 1096, 1103 n. 3 (9th Cir.2002). It is not enough for a hearing, however, for the defendant merely to argue that his assistance was substantial. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Nothing in the record suggests that the government\u2019s refusal to move for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 was arbitrary or based on an unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>tional motive. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840; <em>Quach, </em>302 F.3d at 1103 n. 3. Even Jones\u2019s own counsel acknowledged that the information provided by Jones was not current and that Jones was not \u201cat the moment in a position to give [the government] that type of information if that\u2019s what they\u2019re seeking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The district court did not impose an unreasonable sentence. When reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we (1) must ensure that there was not significant procedural error, such as an improper Guideline calculation or a failure to consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and (2) will consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When considering the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), \u201cdistrict courts must provide specific reasons for their sentencing decisions, such that the record on appeal demonstrates explicit or implicit consideration of the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Mohamed, </em>459 F.3d 979, 985 (9th Cir.2006). A district court, however, is not required to refer to each factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mix, </em>457 F.3d 906, 912 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The court specifically stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when determining Jones\u2019s sentence, and explained on the record its consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors as they applied to Jones. The district court was also aware of the cooperation which Jones claimed he had provided to the government, reviewed Jones\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion, and held a lengthy hearing in chambers. The record therefore demonstrates that the district court properly listened to and considered the arguments made by Jones concerning his history and personal characteristics, and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Nothing more was required of the district court. <em>See Mix, </em>457 F.3d at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-12\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
