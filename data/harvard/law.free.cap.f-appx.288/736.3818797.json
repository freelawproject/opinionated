Dec. 19, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 595 369 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 11, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland See., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Matter of J-Y-C-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 260, 265 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found that Bin\u2019s hesitant demeanor reflected negatively on his credibility. We have held that a fact-finder who assesses testimony together with witness demeanor is in the best position to discern \u201cwhether a witness who hesitated in a response was nevertheless attempting truthfully to recount what he recalled of key events or struggling to remember the lines of a carefully crafted \u2018script.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004). It is clear that the agency\u2019s demeanor findings merit significant deference, and the finding in this case is no exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">The IJ also expressed concern that Bin \u201cprovides nothing, by way of corroboration, as to his practice of Falun Gong, while in China.\u201d An applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony may bear on credibility because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006). In addition, an IJ need not first identify the particular pieces of missing, relevant evidence, and show that this evidence was reasonably available to the applicant before relying on a lack of corroboration to support an adverse credibility finding. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, it was proper for the IJ to rely in part on Bin\u2019s failure to corroborate his claims where the IJ had already called his testimony into question. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">Finally, the IJ noted two inconsistencies between Bin\u2019s testimony and his father\u2019s: (1) Bin\u2019s testimony that he had been practicing Falun Gong in his pajamas while his father was watching television was inconsistent with his father\u2019s testimony that his son was practicing Falun Gong in casual clothing while he was cooking; and (2) Bin\u2019s testimony that his mother had given up the practice of Falun Gong was inconsistent with his father\u2019s testimony that his wife still practiced. As to the latter find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>ing, it is plainly material to Bin\u2019s claim where it calls into question Lin\u2019s assertion that he ever practiced Falun Gong. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). As to the former, though it is a minor inconsistency, the REAL ID Act makes clear that inconsistencies need not go to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim to merit consideration. Even if we were to assume that this inconsistency finding was too insignificant to merit any weight, remand would moreover, be futile in this case because the IJ\u2019s broader credibility determination is amply supported by the record. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we can confidently predict that the IJ would reach the same decision were the case remanded. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">To the extent that Bin based his claim for withholding of removal on the same factual predicate as his asylum claim, which the IJ properly found to lack credibility, his withholding of removal claim necessarily fails. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Finally, because Bin fails to argue that the IJ erred in denying him CAT protection, we consider any such argument waived. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
