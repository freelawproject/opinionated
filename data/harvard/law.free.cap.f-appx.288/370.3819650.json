We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo due process challenges and questions of law, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir. 2003), and we review factual determinations for substantial evidence, <em>Moran v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir. 2005). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-30\">The IJ\u2019s admission of government-prepared forms did not deny Jime<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>nez due process because he did not provide probative evidence casting doubt on their reliability. <em>See Espinoza v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 308, 310-11 (9th Cir.1995) (a government-prepared form is admissible and there is no right to cross-examine its preparer when an alien produces no probative evidence casting doubt on its reliability); <em>see also Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process violation). According to the Record of Sworn Statement, Jimenez admitted to knowing that the alien he attempted to drive across the border did not have documents to enter the United States lawfully. Substantial evidence therefore supports the agency\u2019s determination that Jimenez knowingly encouraged, induced, assisted, abetted, or aided an alien\u2019s attempt to enter the United States in violation of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i); see <em>also Moran, </em>395 F.3d at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Contrary to Jimenez\u2019s contention, the BIA correctly determined that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he was granted suspension of deportation in October 1998 and his Notice to Appear was served in May 2004. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2) (requiring cancellation applicants to have resided continuously in the United States for seven years \u201cafter having been admitted in any status\u201d); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 1229b(d)(l) (period of continuous residence ends \u201cwhen the alien is served a notice to appear\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In light of our disposition, we need not reach Jimenez\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b393-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
