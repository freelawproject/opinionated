Ray, Assistant United States Attorney, Asheville, North Carolina, for Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b92-5\">Before GREGORY and DUNCAN, Circuit Judges, and WILKINS, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b92-6\">Affirmed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b92-7\">Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b92-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Juan Nunez-Tiscareno pled guilty to illegal reentry subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b) (2000), and was sentenced to seventy-one months\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals, claiming that his sentence was increased based on a prior conviction not alleged in the indictment and, therefore, was unconstitutional.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">At sentencing, the district court increased Nunez-Tiscareno\u2019s base offense level of 8 by 16 levels because a prior state court conviction for trafficking in cocaine constituted an aggravated felony within the meaning of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(l)(A)(i) (2006). After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Nunez-Tiscareno\u2019s total offense level was determined to be 21. With a criminal history category of IV, the resulting guidelines range was 57-71 months imprisonment; the district court imposed a sentence at the top of the range.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">Nunez-Tiscareno asserts that the district court\u2019s factual finding with respect to his prior conviction violates the rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Nunez-Tiscareno\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-36, 243-44, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which specifically held that, for purposes of \u00a7 1326, prior convictions need not be determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, this court has reaffirmed the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>after <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 351-54 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-16\">We therefore conclude that Nunez-Tis-careno\u2019s claim is without merit and affirm his sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b92-11\"> Under \u00a7 1326(a), an alien who illegally returns to the United States after being removed may be imprisoned for up to two years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, \u00a7 1326(b)(2) provides that, if the alien\u2019s removal was subsequent to an aggravated felony, he faces a maximum prison term of twenty years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
