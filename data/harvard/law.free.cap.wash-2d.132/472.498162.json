We conclude a child does not \"testify\u201d as referenced in the statute when she does not give testimony describing the acts of sexual contact alleged in the hearsay. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Gregory M. Rohrich was charged with two counts of First Degree Rape of a Child and two counts of First Degree Child Molestation for sexually abusing his stepdaughter, H.H. Prior to trial, nine-year-old H.H. was found competent to testify. At trial the State called H.H. to the stand as its first witness and asked her several questions including what school she went to, what she got for her birthday, and what her cat\u2019s name was.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> H.H. was not asked about and did not testify about any alleged abuse. Defense counsel did not cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The State then presented its case in chief through hearsay evidence of the alleged abuse related by four adults: H.H.\u2019s mother, a local police officer who interviewed H.H. shortly after the allegations were made, a child counselor who interviewed H.H. and a psychologist who spoke with H.H. during several counseling sessions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Nearly all of each witness\u2019s testimony concerned what H.H. had allegedly told each witness concerning the alleged abuse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such hearsay testimony constituted the sole evidence implicating Rohrich as the perpetrator. The trial court admitted the hearsay under the child hearsay statute, RCW 9A.44.120. The jury found Rohrich guilty of the first three counts but not guilty of the fourth.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on the Confrontation Clause<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to define the term \"testifies\u201d to mean \"the child testifies about the alleged sexual contact at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Rohrich, </em>82 Wn. App. 674, 676, 918 P.2d 512 (1996). The Court of Appeals concluded that because the child did not testify about the alleged sexual contact yet was available to do so, hearsay was inadmissible under the child hearsay statute. <em>Id. </em>at 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">MEANING OF \"TESTIFIES\u201d IN RCW 9A.44.120(2)(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Admissibility of child hearsay relating to alleged sexual abuse is governed by statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">A statement made by a child when under the age of ten describing any act of sexual contact performed with or on the child by another . . . not otherwise admissible by statute or court rule, is admissible in evidence ... in the courts of the state of Washington if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">(1) The court finds, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, that the time, content, and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient indicia of reliability; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">(2) The child either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">(a) <em>Testifies </em>at the proceedings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">(b) Is unavailable as a witness: PROVIDED, That when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>child is unavailable as a witness, such statement may be admitted only if there is corroborative evidence of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">RCW 9A.44.120 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The statute does not define \"testifies,\u201d which is at the heart of the issue here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ***5 Does the child \"testify\u201d when she is called to the stand yet is not asked about and does not describe the acts of sexual contact alleged in the hearsay? The State says \"yes\u201d and contends \"testifies\u201d merely means the child is available to testify regardless of whether the child ever takes the stand.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The State asserts such a reading satisfies both the statute and the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\"> We construe and apply statutes in a constitutional fashion if such can be done without straining the statutory text. <em>High Tide Seafoods v. State, </em>106 Wn.2d 695, 698, 725 P.2d 411 (1986). The Legislature intended the child hearsay statute to be constitutional and \"carefully drafted [it] to avoid any confrontation clause problems.\u201d Judy Yun, Note, <em>A Comprehensive Approach to Child Hearsay Statements in Sex Abuse Cases, </em>83 Colum. L. Rev. 1745, 1766 (1983). Therefore, we will interpret and apply the <em>child testifies </em>requirement in light of the requirements of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Turning now to the Confrontation Clause itself, we note it \" 'comes to us on faded parchment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coy v. Iowa, </em>487 U.S. 1012, 1015, 108 S. Ct. 2798, 101 L. Ed. 2d 857 (1988) (quoting <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 174, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Confrontation Clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">U.S. Const, amend. 6.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">At its core, the Confrontation Clause, like the hearsay rules, represents a preference for live testimony. <em>White v. Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 356, 112 S. Ct. 736, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1992). Live testimony is preferred because it requires the eyewitness to relate the facts herself in open court subject to cross-examination while under oath in a face-to-face setting before the watchful eyes of the jury. Such live testimony maximizes \"the accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials.\u201d <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 89, 91 S. Ct. 210, 27 L. Ed. 2d 213 (1970).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> An indispensable component of the Confrontation Clause\u2019s preference for live testimony is cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>tion because of its central role in ascertaining the truth. <em>See Green, </em>399 U.S. at 158 (characterizing cross-examination as \" 'the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 5 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law \u00a7 1367 (3d ed. 1940)). The opportunity to cross-examine means more than affording the defendant the opportunity to hail the witness to court for examination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It requires the State to elicit the damaging testimony from the witness so the defendant may cross-examine if he so chooses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Shaw v. Collins, </em>5 F.3d 128, 132 n.7 (5th Cir. 1993). In this context ''not only [must] the declarant have been generally subject to cross-examination; he must also be subject to cross-examination concerning the out-of-court declaration.\u201d <em>United States v. West, </em>670 F.2d 675, 687 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied by King v. United States, </em>457 U.S. 1124, 102 S. Ct. 2944, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1340 (1982). The State\u2019s failure to adequately draw out testimony from the child witness before admitting the child\u2019s hearsay puts the defendant in \"a constitutionally impermissible Catch-22\u201d of calling the child for direct or waiving his confrontation rights. <em>Lowery v. Collins, </em>996 F.2d 770, 771-72 (5th Cir. 1993).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In addition to requiring the State to elicit the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>and afford the defendant a real opportunity to cross-examine the complaining witness, the Confrontation Clause requires the eyewitness to give the testimony while under oath to \"impress[ ] [the witness] with the seriousness of the matter and guard[ ] against the lie by the possibility of a penalty for perjury . . . <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 158. Confrontation also requires the witness give his testimony in a face-to-face setting with the accused. <em>Coy, </em>487 U.S. at 1017 (striking down a statute allowing a screen to be placed between the child witness and the accused because \"there is something deep in human nature that regards face-to-face confrontation between accused and accuser as 'essential to a fair trial in a criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 404, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Thus, the Confrontation Clause prefers the State elicit the damaging testimony from the witness while under oath in a face-to-face confrontation. \"If the declarant is available and the same information can be presented to the trier of fact in the form of live testimony, with full cross-examination and the opportunity to view the demeanor of the declarant, there is little justification for relying on the weaker version.\u201d <em>United States v. Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 394, 106 S. Ct. 1121, 89 L. Ed. 2d 390 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The constitutional preference for live testimony may be disregarded in only two circumstances: (1) when the original out-of-court statement is inherently more reliable than any live in-court repetition would be; or (2) when live testimony is not possible because the declarant is unavailable, in which case the court must settle for the weaker version.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The first exception applies only to those firmly rooted hearsay exceptions which, by their nature, are most reliable when originally made. <em>See Inadi, </em>475 U.S. at 394 (co-conspirator statements made during the conspiracy); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>White, 502 </em>U.S. at 355-56 (spontaneous declarations and statements made to doctor in the course of receiving medical care). Statements falling within this limited class are so treated because they \"derive much of their value from the fact they were made in a context very different from trial\u201d and \"[e]ven when the declarant takes the stand, his in-court testimony seldom will reproduce a significant portion of the evidentiary value of his statements during the course of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Inadi, </em>475 U.S. at 395. <em>See also White, </em>502 U.S. at 355-56 (the reliability of a spontaneous declaration \"cannot be recaptured even by later in-court testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">For hearsay statements not falling within this small class of \"firmly rooted\u201d exceptions, the proffered hearsay is considered \"a weaker substitute for live testimony.\u201d <em>Inadi, </em>475 U.S. at 394. Under the second exception, the State may admit the hearsay if it \"either produce[s], or demonstrate^] the unavailability of the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 65, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Turning to the case at hand we note child hearsay admitted under RCW 9A.44.120 does not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. <em>See Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 817, 110 S. Ct. 3139, 111 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1990); <em>Ring v. Erickson, </em>983 F.2d 818, 821 (8th Cir. 1992).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Unlike the firmly rooted exceptions, nothing about child hearsay indicates the hearsay statement would be more reliable than an in-court declaration of the same accusation. Accordingly, the Confrontation Clause requires the testimony to be presented in court by the witness first unless the witness is unavailable, in which case the \"weaker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>substitute\u201d alone may be admitted if reliable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Here, the child was available and thus the Confrontation Clause\u2019s preference for live testimony requires that she herself testify as to the acts of sexual contact alleged in the hearsay as a condition to its admission under RCW 9A.44.120.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We conclude \"testifies,\u201d as used in RCW 9A.44.120(2)(a), means the child takes the stand and describes the acts of sexual contact alleged in the hearsay. This definition is consistent with the Confrontation Clause and comports with legislative intent that the child hearsay statute condition the admission of hearsay as previously described. It is also in accord with most authority. For example, in <em>State v. </em>Bishop, child hearsay was admissible because the child testified in detail as to the alleged sexual abuse but the court foresaw that \"if her testimony were limited to incidental details . . . the result would be different.\u201d <em>State v. Bishop, </em>63 Wn. App. 15, 23 n.6, 816 P.2d 738 (1991), <em>review denied, </em>118 Wn.2d 1015, 827 P.2d 1011 (1992). <em>See also </em>Graham, <em>supra </em>at 539 (\"To be a testifying witness under availability analysis, a witness must actually testify at trial concerning the witnessed event.\u201d); <em>State v. Segerherg, </em>131 Conn. 546, 41 A.2d 101, 102, 157 A.L.R. 1355 (1945) (\"testimony is admitted in certain types of cases, including indecent assault upon children, when the complainant first has testified, in court, to the facts of the alleged occurrence . . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We note our definition strikes a careful balance between admitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>otherwise inadmissible hearsay and safeguarding the defendant\u2019s right to be confronted by the witnesses against him. <em>State v. Jones, </em>112 Wn.2d 488, 494, 772 P.2d 496 (1989). It also allays \"the fears\u201d expressed by commentators that the child hearsay statute \"may serve as a disincentive to call the child witness.\u201d <em>State v. Ryan, </em>103 Wn.2d 165, 172, 691 P.2d 197 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The Confrontation Clause requires the term \"testifies,\u201d as used in the child hearsay statute, RCW 9A.44.120(2)(a), to mean the child gives live, in-court testimony describing the acts of sexual contact to be offered as hearsay. Because the child here did not testify as required yet was available to do so, her hearsay statements were inadmissible under RCW 9A.44.120. We affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Durham, C.J., and Dolliver, Smith, Johnson, Madsen, and Alexander, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\"> Verbatim Report of Proceedings (2RP) 18-23 (June 14, 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b463-13\">It appears the only nonhearsay evidence presented was a doctor\u2019s testimony of her examination of H.H., the results of which were \"consistent with sexual abuse.\u201d 2RP at 76.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-14\">The jury acquitted Rohrich on the second count of child rape, the only charge alleging penile penetration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-15\">U.S. Const, amend. 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> The term \"testifies\u201d can have different meanings in different contexts. <em>See Nessman v.

App. 7, 786 P.2d 810, <em>review denied, </em>114 Wn.2d 1026 (1990). <em>See </em>RAP 13.4(b)(2); Petition for Review at 8-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In <em>Borland, </em>Division One of the Court of Appeals held that RCW 9A.44.120(2) \"is satisfied when the child witness is both competent and physically available to testify. . . . Actual testimony is not required as a condition of admission of the out-of-court statements.\u201d 57 Wn. App. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Rohrich, </em>Division Three disagreed with <em>Borland </em>and held that the statutory meaning of \"testify\u201d should be interpreted to be consistent with the fundamental purpose of the Confrontation Clause. That purpose is to provide an accused with the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses. <em>Rohrich, </em>82 Wn. App. at 677-78 (citing <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>State v. Parris, </em>98 Wn.2d 140, 144, 654 P.2d 77 (1982)). The Court of Appeals also held a constitutional construction is consistent with the accepted definition of the word \"testify.\u201d As the Court of Appeals noted, \"Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1476 (6th ed. 1990) defines the term \"testify\u201d as follows: 'To bear witness; to give evidence as a witness; to make a solemn declaration, under oath or affirmation, in a judicial inquiry, for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d 82 Wn. App. at 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The language of the statute evidences an intent on the part of the Legislature to allow hearsay statements in certain child abuse cases if (1) the child <em>testified </em>as a witness or (2) the child was unavailable as a witness. Under the ordinary meaning of the word, the child would \"testify\u201d for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1476. Such testimony protects the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront witnesses, as it provides him an opportunity for cross examination related to the elements of the charge or charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision in this case and overrule <em>Borland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Talmadge, J., concurs with Guy, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
