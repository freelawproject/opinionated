Violations of these statutes are felonies under Washington state law. These statutes were the duly enacted laws of the State of Washington at the time the offenses were committed, at the time the Informations were filed, and are now in full force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-13\">7. The Statute of Limitations on prosecuting these offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>is Revised Code of Washington 9A.04.080 which states as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-4\"><em>Prosecutions for the offenses of murder, and arson where death ensues, may he commenced at any period after the commission of the offense, </em>for offenses the punishment of which may he imprisonment in a state correctional institution, committed by any public officer in connection with the duties of his office or constituting a breach of his public duty or a violation of his oath of office, and arson where death does not ensue, within ten years after their commission; for violations of RCW 9A.44.070, 9A.44.100(l)(b), within seven years after their commission; for violation of RCW 9A.82.060 or 9A.82.080, within seven years after their commission; for bigamy, within three years of the time specified in RCW 9A.64.010; for all other offenses the punishment of which may be imprisonment in the state correctional institution, within three years after their commission; two years for gross misdemeanors, and for all other offenses, within one year after their commission: Provided, That any length of time during which the party charged was not usually and publicly resident within this state shall not be reckoned within the one, two, three, five, seven, and ten years respectively: And further provided, That where an indictment has been found, or complaint or an information filed, within the time limited for the commencement of a criminal action, if the indictment, complaint or information be set aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\">8. I have reviewed the facts of these offenses and attest that the allegations in the offenses are not time barred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-6\">9. The Information charges that the defendant Martin Pang, together with another, in King County, Washington on or about January 5, 1995, while committing or attempting to commit the crime of Arson in the First Degree, and in the course of and in furtherance of said crime and in immediate flight therefrom, did cause the deaths of Lieutenant Walter Kilgore, Lieutenant Gregory A. Shoemaker, Firefighter James T. Brown, and Firefighter Randall R. Terlicker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-7\">10. According to the Certification for Determination of Probable Cause filed in this case the Seattle Fire Department responded to a fire on January 5, 1995, at the Mary Pang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>Products warehouse in Seattle, King County, Washington. While attempting to extinguish the fire, several firefighters entered the first floor of the engulfed warehouse. Without warning, the floor collapsed, dropping the firefighters to the sub-basement. Some of the firefighters were able to escape the building \u2014 four were not. Lieutenant Walter D. Kilgore, Lieutenant Gregory A. Shoemaker, Firefighter James T. Brown, and Firefighter Randall R. Terlicker died in the fire. The King County Medical Examiner has determined that Lieutenant Shoemaker died from smoke inhalation, and the other three died from suffocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-5\">On December 13, 1994, Special Agent Sheryl Bishop of the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\"ATF\u201d) was contacted by a citizen/witness who told her that Mary Pang\u2019s business, located in the warehouse, was in decline, and that the warehouse was to be \"torched\u201d sometime between December 16, 1994 and December 18, 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">On December 14, 1994, [Agent] Bishop met with another witness who stated that on several occasions in the month prior to December 14, 1994, the defendant told the witness that the warehouse was going to burn down and advised the witness to get personal items out of the warehouse. On other occasions during the month, the defendant told the witness how the warehouse would be burned down. His scenarios of how it would happen, which the witness diagrammed for [Agent] Bishop, almost exactly described how the fire actually occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">On another occasion, in the month prior to the fire, the defendant spoke with yet another witness and cryptically suggested the witness remove personal items from the warehouse. That witness also helped the defendant remove the defendant\u2019s personal items from the warehouse and transport them to storage lockers that he had rented on November 11, 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-8\">On January 21, 1995, a search warrant was served on the defendant\u2019s storage lockers. Inside the lockers, investigators found many personal items belonging to the defendant, including photographs, trophies and awards, family mementos, and financial records. The investigators, based on their training and experience, indicate that persons who intend to burn down their homes or businesses often remove items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>which cannot be replaced, such as photographs and personal momentos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-4\">In December 1994, the defendant took a close friend and confidant to the warehouse. The defendant told the witness that the business (Mary Pang\u2019s Food Products, Inc.) had lost major clients and was not doing well. He complained that his parents were old and feeble, yet would not sell the business. He went on to tell the witness that the warehouse would burn down in the next month, and that it would look like transients set the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">Yet another witness and the defendant have been friends for about six years. During the summer of 1994, the defendant told the witness that he would like to have the business burn, and that it would go up like a tinderbox. The defendant also said that he thought about doing it. The defendant also indicated to the witness that if the business burned down \"it would kill my parents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-6\">On numerous other occasions over the last six years, the defendant has told friends of his that the warehouse would be burned down. These friends have detailed the defendant\u2019s statements in their statements given to investigators. Several witnesses have given detailed, independent statements that the defendant asked them to burn the Mary Pang warehouse, as recently as last year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">During conversations with witnesses immediately after the fire, the defendant told them how a person he described as a transient must have lighted the fire in the warehouse. The defendant\u2019s description of how the fire must have been lighted describes how the fire actually occurred and was made prior to the expert\u2019s determination that the fire had been deliberately set.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-8\">After the fire, the defendant told a witness his scenarios of how the fire must have been lighted. The witness then gave the information to homicide investigators. The fire investigators assigned to identify the cause of the fire had just begun sifting the remains of the business. They did not reach, or announce, their conclusions as to how the fire started until several days after the defendant described his scenarios of how the fire must have been lighted. The fire investigators were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>not told by homicide investigators about the scenarios that the defendant described to the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-5\">The day after the fire a different witness had a conversation with the defendant in which the defendant asked the witness if a transient had started the fire at the warehouse would it be considered homicide? The defendant also attempted to throw suspicions on his ex-wife Rise Pang and her current husband, Joseph. The witness noticed throughout their conversation that the defendant appeared very nervous and worried about criminal charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-6\">The defendant later telephoned this witness and said that he had been \"framed\u201d for the fire and was going to take a \"long vacation\u201d. The defendant began crying, and told the witness that he (defendant) would never see his friends again. The defendant continued to claim that he had been set up by Joseph, and then said to the witness, in a very strained voice, \"Nobody was supposed to get hurt, the building was just supposed to burn down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-7\">The day after the fire, the ATF National Response Team, in conjunction with the Seattle Fire Department\u2019s Fire Investigation Unit, began investigating what caused the warehouse fire. The ATF National Response Team is composed of ATF agents who are Certified Fire Investigators. They have become Certified Fire Investigators by completing hundreds of hours of training in determining the cause and origin of fires. Each Certified Fire Investigator has personally investigated, in order to determine the cause and origin of fires, over one hundred fire scenes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-8\">Based upon the investigators\u2019 examination of the warehouse fire scene, including burn patterns, liquids and physical evidence, it has been determined that this fire was deliberately set.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-9\">The investigators also learned that the arsonist(s) entered the basement area either by using a key or entering a code into the alarm keypad. Firefighters who were first on the scene found that all exteriors [sic] doors not secured by the keypad were locked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-10\">Once inside the pallets area where the fire was set, the investigators found that the interior door leads to an exterior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>door which also does not have a keypad. This interior door\u2019s padlock had been pried off, as if to look like the fire-setter had entered the pallet area through the un-alarmed doors. Additionally, a gasoline can which did not belong to the warehouse was found in the room between these two doors. However, a closer examination showed that the pry marks on the interior door were made from the inside, not the outside, as someone gaining entry through un-alarmed doors from the outside would do. And, as stated above, this mirrors the defendant\u2019s statements to witnesses about how a transient was responsible for the fire that burned the warehouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-5\">In addition, the investigators found that the person who lit this fire worked rapidly. The last person to leave the warehouse basement reports leaving at approximately 6:30 p.m. He saw nothing to indicate a fire. A witness whose band rented space in the warehouse basement, entered the basement shortly before 7:00 p.m. and saw thick smoke. He removed some items from his space, then ran to a telephone booth to call 911. When fire units arrived shortly thereafter, the basement area was fully engulfed in flames. The investigators estimate, based on training and experience, that it took approximately twenty minutes from the time this fire was lit to the time the basement was fully engulfed. This indicates that the arsonist was probably familiar with the warehouse and the occupants\u2019 schedules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">The investigators have interviewed dozens of defendant\u2019s friends and business associates. Through these interviews the investigators have learned that the defendant has, for the most part, been supported by his parents. Other than a time spent working for his parent\u2019s business, the defendant has been frequently unemployed. His parents paid for defendant\u2019s short-lived auto racing career, and were helping support him while he pursued an acting career. They gave him gifts of money on all major holidays, paid for his cars; paid for his house and made his child support payments. The defendant had access to, and used checks and credit cards belonging to the business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">Additionally, as described above, the once-successful business, in the last several years, had been failing. Several major accounts, such as Safeway Stores, had been lost. Suppliers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>indicate that checks written on company accounts, some for as little as $150 would bounce. When that happened the suppliers would have to contact the defendant\u2019s parents, who would provide a personal check to cover the amounts owed. The defendant repeatedly expressed to friends and associates his frustration with both the business\u2019s decline as well as his parents\u2019 continual refusal to sell it or relinquish control to him. The defendant\u2019s parents have two children, the defendant and his sister Marlys. Marlys is estranged from the family and has not spoken with them for many years. Harry and Mary Pang, both in their 70\u2019s, have no life insurance, their policy having recently lapsed. However, the business, although failing, was well insured. Additionally, the defendant had expressed to various friends over years his plans to use the warehouse property, valued at over $400,000 for his own business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-4\">According to statements made by the defendant to numerous witnesses, he fled the state to avoid prosecution in this matter.

Martin Pang is identified as an Asian male; Date of Birth: November 12, 1955; Place of Birth: Hong Kong; Citizenship: United States citizen; Height: 6\u20190\u201d; Weight 175 lbs [sic] Black hair; Brown eyes; Scar below his throat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-6\">12.

The defendant fled the United States to avoid prosecution and was arrested by Brazilian authorities in Rio De [sic] Janeiro on March 16, 1995. Two agents from the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation accompanied Brazilian authorities during the arrest. The defendant immediately initiated conversation with Special Agent Schoenlein enroute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>to the Brazilian police station. Agent Schoenlein answered questions the defendant had about extradition and the defendant then initiated conversation about the arson of Mary Pang\u2019s in Seattle. Agent Schoenlein advised the defendant that they could discuss those matters later at the police station if the defendant chose to do so. Agent Schoenlein also advised the defendant of his Miranda rights. The defendant told Agent Schoenlein that he wanted to waive his Miranda rights to tell his \"side of the story\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">14. At the police station the defendant once again indicated his desire to speak with Agents Schoenlein and Burroughs and he signed a form that listed and waived his Miranda rights. After conversation in which the defendant attempted unsuccessfully to convince Agents Schoenlein and Burroughs he had nothing to do with the arson the defendant was advised by the agents to tell the truth. At that point the defendant admitted starting the fire on January 5, 1995 at the Mary Pang business. The defendant gave a four page statement describing his actions which was written for him by Agent Schoenlein. The defendant read and initialed each page of the handwritten statement and signed the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">15.1 have attached a true copy of the Information and Certification for Determination of Probable Cause in the case of State of Washington vs. Martin Shaw Pang, King County Superior Court Cause Number 95-1-00473-0 as Exhibit 1.

The arson statute in the State of Washington is equivalent only to Article 250 (simple arson) of the Brazil Penal code; it penalizes only the arson itself, but not the resulting deaths. As such, the Washington arson does not punish the crime in the same way that Article 258 (aggravated arson) of the Brazilian Penal Code would. Rather in the State of Washington, the only law that truly corresponds to Article 258, by taking into proper consideration the deaths of the four firefighters, is the \"felony murder\u201d law (which, although codified within the first degree homicide statute, is different from the other first degree homicides because it does not require premeditated intent to kill). Accordingly, the approval of extradition only for arson would be equivalent to granting extradition only for the offense punished under Article 250, but not the offense punished under Article 258.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>Such limitation would be significant because of the potentially minimal sentence [Mr.] Pang could receive if prosecuted only under Washington arson statute. Although the crime of arson theoretically carries a punishment of life in prison, because of the existence of mandatory sentencing guidelines under Washington State law, the presumptive sentence for [Mr.] Pang would be only 21 to 27 months in prison. Such a penalty for a crime in which four men lost their lives would be grossly unfair and disproportionate to the gravity of the offense. It is for this reason that the Government of the United States and the people of the State of Washington are so concerned about the way in which the Court\u2019s decision is framed. It would be extremely unfortunate if a merely technical difference in our respective legal systems were to result in a severe injustice. The United States therefore respectfully requests that the Court clarify its ruling, so as to permit the prosecution of Pang for the two Washington State offenses \u2014 arson and felony murder \u2014 that most closely correspond to Article 250 and 258 of the Brazilian Penal Code.[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-4\">On March 27, 1996, the Federal Supreme Court rejected the appeal, holding that its extradition order unambiguously excluded the charges of murder in the first degree from the grant of extradition.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">SUMMARY. [1.] Extradition. Appeal for clarification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">2. U.S. citizen charged, in the State of Washington, U.S.A., with the crime of arson in the first degree and with four acts of murder in the first degree, the victims being firefighters who assisted in fighting the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">3. By majority of votes, this Court, inasmuch as the acts are covered under two distinct offenses, decided that the case is one of arson in the first degree under the law of the requesting State, corresponding in the Brazilian Penal Code to the crime of arson as defined in Article 250, combined with its</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Paragraph 2, Section I, and with Article 258 of that same Code because of the resulting death of four persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">4. Appeal for clarification by the requesting State arguing the existence of contradictions and obscurities in the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">5. It is alleged in the appeal for clarification that the facts as set forth in the request for extradition describe a case of arson that resulted in the deaths of four firefighters; however, the definition of the offense adopted in the decision now being appealed does not encompass the resulting deaths, only the threat against the life of any person or firefighter. [The decision held that] the crime of arson in the first degree, according to the Revised Code of Washington, is equivalent solely to the crime of arson in Article 250 of the Brazilian Penal Code and does not include the hypothesis found in Article 258 of said Code. The appeal for clarification further argues that the crime of arson in the first degree and the crime of murder in the first degree (termed \"felony murder\u201d) are considered by the Revised Code of Washington as being independent criminal offenses and that the latter is equivalent to the crime described in Article 258 of the Brazilian Penal Code. It is also alleged in the appeal that if the terms of the decision now being appealed were upheld, the requesting State would be unable to prosecute and try the person whose extradition is being sought for the deaths resulting from the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">6. Regulatory and procedural limits on appeals for clarification according to Federal Supreme Court case law. Appeals for clarification must not infringe upon the judgment. The greater degree of flexibility that is allowed them, as an exception in cases of obvious material error or manifest nullity of the decision, does not justify their inappropriate use to challenge the correctness of a judgment on the merits and to achieve its modification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">7. <em>The absence of any doubt or obscurity as regards the denial of the extradition with respect to the charges of the four crimes of murder in the first degree is demonstrated in the terms of the decision, which did not consider the facts, as described in the request, as characterizing independent crimes of arson in the first degree and murder in the first degree. The extradition was granted without any restrictions as to the possibility of life imprisonment; but only on the crime of first-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number><em>degree arson with the results it produced (four deaths) and all the consequences thereof pursuant to United States law without, however, the added charge of four counts of murder in the first degree.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-5\">8. Nor is there any contradiction in the decision under appeal. The contradiction would have to have arisen unexpectedly among the parts of the judgment itself, in the logical composition thereof. The position of the majority of the Court, reflected in the decision, did not acknowledge the occurrence, in the case at hand, of independent crimes but only the crime of arson in the first degree with its results and consequences (four deaths) according to U.S. law. It should be noted, furthermore, that Article 258 of the Brazilian Penal Code does not define an independent crime other than the one described in Article 250 thereof. Only the results described therein (physical injury or death) were considered by the legislator [sic] to serve as qualifying circumstances in crimes of common peril, including arson, aggravating the penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-6\">9. Likewise <em>there is no mistake or obvious error in the decision now being appealed. The decision resulted from a thorough discussion by the members of this Court that took the facts and their legal context into account.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">10. The Federal Supreme Court is not insensitive to the serious concerns expressed in the appeal for clarification as regards potential restrictions on the amount of the penalty that could be imposed in the requesting State on the person whose extradition is sought, by virtue of the limits established in the granting of the request on a partial basis only. However, it is not appropriate in a decision on extradition to give primary consideration in the requested State to the aspect of the cases involving the amount of the penalty that the requesting State may, under its legislation, impose on the person being sought, unless there is a specific restriction in the requested State, as in Brazil with the rejection of the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-8\">11. Apart from that reservation, given the limited scope of the appeal for clarification, it is not possible in the appeal to evaluate the merits of the controversy regarding the penalties which the requesting State might, by application of its domestic laws, impose on the person whose extradition is be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>ing sought. <em>This position is not ascribable to a lack of interest on the part of the Court as regards the need for cooperation on the international level between the governments of different countries for purposes of combating crime.

The following are illustrative only and are not intended to he exclusive reasons for exceptional sentences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-7\">(2) Aggravating Circumstances</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-8\">(a) The defendant\u2019s conduct during the commission of the current offense manifested deliberate cruelty to the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-9\">(d) The current offense was a major economic offense or series of offenses, so identified by a consideration of any of the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-10\">(i) The current offense involved multiple victims or multiple incidents per victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-11\">(ii) The current offense involved attempted or actual monetary less substantially greater than typical for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-12\">(iii) The current offense involved a high degree of sophistication or planning or occurred over a lengthy period of time; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-13\">(iv) The defendant used his or her position of trust, confidence, or fiduciary responsibility to facilitate the commission of the current offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>(i) The operation of the multiple offense policy of RCW 9.94A.400 results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient in light of the purpose of this chapter, as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-5\">(j) The defendant\u2019s prior unscored misdemeanor or prior unscored foreign criminal history results in a presumptive sentence that is clearly too lenient in light of the purpose of this chapter as expressed in RCW 9.94A.010.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">Under RCW 9A.20.021 the maximum sentence Petitioner Pang could receive if he is found guilty of arson in the first degree, a class A felony, is \"confinement in a state correctional institution for a term of life imprisonment, or by a fine in an amount fixed by the court of fifty thousand dollars, or by both such confinement and fine[.]\u201d This was a factor considered by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil in its decision on extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">(1) <em>Does Petitioner Pang have standing to object to violation by the State of Washington of the terms of the order on extradition issued by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">The State argues that Petitioner Pang does not have standing to assert any postextradition limitations on his prosecution because the Brazilian Executive, through Minister of Justice Nelson A. Jobim, does not object to King County prosecuting Petitioner on four counts of murder in the first degree. The State correctly recognizes the exception to the doctrine of specialty which allows the requesting state to prosecute an accused for a crime other than that for which the accused was extradited when the asylum state consents.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> However, in the absence of that consent by the asylum state, an extradited person may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>raise any objections to postextradition proceedings which might have been raised by the rendering country.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The rule in at least three United States circuit courts is that an extraditee has standing \"to raise any objections which the requested nation might have asserted,\u201d subject to the limitation that \"the requested nation may waive its right to object to a treaty violation and thereby deny the defendant standing to object to such action.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> At least four other circuits have left the question of standing unanswered, with some indicating approval of the prevailing rule.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The State also asserts that a minority of United States circuit courts deny standing absent affirmative protest by the surrendering State. However, this purported split in the circuits is illusory. Two of the three cases the State cited for this proposition are not standing cases at all, but were resolved against the extraditees on the merits.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The third case merely noted the defendant\u2019s standing was questionable before reaching the merits.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The State urges this Court to find that Brazil\u2019s Execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>tive, through Minister of Justice Nelson A. Jobim, \"implicitly consented\u201d to prosecution of Petitioner Pang by the State of Washington on four counts of murder in the first degree. We agree with the rule expressed in <em>Na-john </em>that only express consent to prosecution will be considered a waiver of the doctrine of specialty.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The letter from Brazil Minister of Justice Jobim to United States Attorney General Janet Reno cannot logically be interpreted as either an implicit waiver or an explicit waiver. The subsequent letter of February 26, 1997 from Minister Jobim unequivocally explains the meaning and intent of his letter to Attorney General Reno. It completely contradicts the interpretation urged by the. State. That letter states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-5\">I\u2019d like to inform you that at no time did I provide any type of interpretation on the content and reach of the decision passed by the Federal Supreme Court. Thus, I ratify all the words used in said correspondence, its only objective being to clarify to Ms. Janett [sic] Reno, Attorney-General of the United States, some aspects of the Brazilian Constitutional system.[<footnotemark>47</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">While some United States circuit courts have questioned whether an extraditee has standing to assert limitations on post-extradition prosecution, and other courts have declined to address the issue, no court has dismissed such a claim because an extraditee did not have standing. The only firm decisions on this issue agree that an extraditee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>may raise any objection the surrendering State could make, as long as that country has not waived its right to object.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> From the entire record in this case, we cannot conclude that the United States of Brazil has said, done or implied by words, action or inaction anything which would require this Court to deny Petitioner Pang the right to make post-extradition objections to his prosecution by the State of Washington in violation of the conditions of his extradition from Brazil. We conclude that Petitioner Pang does have standing to assert limitations on his post-extradition prosecution in King County.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">\n<em>Waiver</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">(2) <em>Did the United States of Brazil explicitly or implicitly waive any objection it could have made to prosecution by the State of Washington of Petitioner Pang for murder in the first degree contrary to the specific terms of the extradition order issued by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The trial court concluded that the United States of Brazil, by not objecting when it had numerous opportunities to do so, \"implicitly waived objection,\u201d thereby defeating Petitioner Pang\u2019s standing.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The State urges this Court to adopt that implicit waiver rationale, arguing that Justice Minister Jobim\u2019s letter of September 26, 1996 to Attorney General Reno indicates that Brazil does not object to Petitioner Pang being prosecuted for four counts of murder in the first degree. Nothing in the entire record before this Court supports such a conclusion. We reject it as being completely unsound and totally contrary to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The United States of Brazil has from the outset expressed its position that Petitioner Pang should not be charged with murder in the first degree by the State of Washington. The Federal Supreme Court of Brazil fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>considered and unequivocally rejected extradition of Petitioner on the murder charges as requested by the State of Washington. That position was reaffirmed when the court uncategorically rejected the appeal filed by the United States and the motion for clarification filed by the State of Washington. Despite repeated requests through diplomatic channels, Brazil has not only affirmatively denied permission to charge Petitioner with murder, but its President and Minister of Justice affirmatively declined in no uncertain terms the request of President Clinton that Brazil waive its right to object to prosecution of Petitioner Pang by the State of Washington for murder in the first degree following the extradition order.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The State\u2019s insistence that Justice Minister Jobim waived objection on behalf of Brazil to the State of Washington charging Petitioner Pang with murder distorts the facts established in this case. The letter from Minister Jobim to Attorney General Reno merely reiterated that Petitioner Pang was extradited to stand trial \"for the crime of arson in the first degree, resulting in four deaths and the consequences thereof under U.S. law.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This is only a portion of the words used in the extradition order issued by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil. In that same statement the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil continued its words to specifically exclude \"the additional charge of four counts of first-degree murder.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">From a reading of the complete series of opinions from the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil it is evident beyond question that the point of disagreement between the majority and the dissenting minority was on the question whether the extradition order would exclude punishment beyond the 30-year maximum under Brazilian law or whether the order would allow the maximum punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>of life imprisonment for arson in the first degree as allowed under Washington law.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">We are not convinced an implied waiver, even if made, would overcome the standing of Petitioner Pang to object in this case.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that an express waiver of objection does divest an extraditee of standing.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We conclude from the record in this case that Brazil has not expressly consented to nor implicitly or explicitly waived objection to the State of Washington charging Petitioner with murder in the first degree. We therefore conclude that Petitioner Pang does have standing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">\n<em>Specialty Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">(3) <em>Does the \"specialty doctrine\u201d in international extradition law prohibit the State of Washington from prosecuting Petitioner Pang for crimes specifically excluded in the extradition order?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated \"We review de novo whether extradition of a defendant satisfies the doctrines of 'dual criminality\u2019 and 'specialty.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The specialty doctrine has been explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-9\">The requested state retains an interest in the fate of a person whom it has extradited, so that if, for example, he is tried for an offense other than the one for which he was extradited, or is given a punishment more severe than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>one applicable at the time of the request for extradition, the rights of the requested state, as well as the person, are violated.[<footnotemark>56</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Under international law, the \"specialty doctrine\u201d generally prohibits a requesting State from prosecuting an ex-traditee \"for an offense other than the one for which surrender was made.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> This doctrine \"is designed to prevent prosecution for an offense for which the person would not have been extradited.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">\" 'As a matter of international comity, \"[t]he doctrine of 'specialty\u2019 prohibits the requesting nation from prosecuting the extradited individual for any offense other than that for which the surrendering state agreed to extradite.\u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> \"To guarantee limited prosecution by nations seeking extradition of persons from the United States, the United States has guaranteed, pursuant to the treaty, that it will honor limitations placed on prosecution in the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">In <em>United States v. Rauscher,</em><footnotemark><em>61</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed the question whether the extradition treaty between England and the United States prohibited prosecution of the defendant for a crime other than that for which he was extradited. This was the first case in which the Supreme Court recognized the specialty doctrine. In that case an American merchant ship officer had been extradited from Great Britain, under an extradition treaty, to be charged with murder of a crew member. He was subsequently convicted of assault and inflicting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>cruel and unusual punishment, neither of which were listed as extraditable offenses in the treaty. The Court held the defendant could be tried only for the offense \"with which he is charged in the extradition proceedings, and for which he was delivered up.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aqo-dedup-1\">The Court in <em>Rauscher </em>was guided by principles of comity which prevailed in the absence of treaties, under which a receiving country would not prosecute a fugitive for any offense other than those for which the fugitive had been surrendered by the asylum country.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The Court rejected the argument that the treaty did not expressly limit the offenses that could be charged by the requesting country.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that there was no indication the treaty intended to depart from principles of comity.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The Supreme Court concluded that the treaty, by listing certain extraditable offenses, implicitly excluded the right of extradition for any other offenses.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The Court stated: \"[A] person who has been brought within the jurisdiction of the court by virtue of proceedings under an extradition treaty, can only be tried for one of the offences described in that treaty, and for the offence with which he is charged in the proceedings for his extradition.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The Court based its conclusion upon the terms and history of the treaty; extradition practices of states; case law; and the writings of jurists. In part, the court considered the Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5272, 5275, which dealt with this country\u2019s roles as both requested state and requesting state in extradition proceedings. Section 5275 is now codified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3192 and differs only in that the words \"crimes or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>offences\u201d have been replaced with the word \"offenses.\u201d It provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-5\">Whenever any person is delivered by any foreign government to an agent of the United States, for the purpose of being brought within the United States and tried for any offense of which he is duly accused, the President shall have power to take all necessary measures for the transportation and safekeeping of such accused person, and for his security against lawless violence, until the final conclusion of his trial for the offenses specified in the warrant of extradition, and until his final discharge from custody or imprisonment for or on account of such offenses, and for a reasonable time thereafter, and may employ such portion of the land or naval forces of the United States, or the militia thereof, as may be necessary for the safe-keeping and protection of the accused.[<footnotemark>68</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">In <em>United States v. Alvarez-Machain </em>the Supreme Court noted that federal statutes impose the doctrine of specialty upon all extradition treaties to which the United States is a party.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Under <em>Rauscher, </em>for an extradited defendant to be charged with a crime, that crime must be specified in the treaty (the approval of which is within the sole discretion of the asylum state), and be included in the extradition petition (the content of which is within the sole discretion of the requesting state). The defendant has the right to \"be tried only for the offence with which he is charged in the extradition proceedings and for which he was delivered up.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> \"It is unreasonable that the country of the asylum should be expected to deliver up such a person to be dealt with by the demanding government without any limitation, implied or otherwise, upon its prosecution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>party.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The doctrine of specialty was not explicitly stated in the treaty between the United States and Great Britain. The court in <em>Rauscher </em>interpreted the treaty with consideration of the specialty doctrine which had previously been recognized in international law.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The Court examined the treaty and the history of relations between the United States and Great Britain to determine whether the parties, in the absence of express incorporation, nevertheless intended the doctrine of specialty to be part of the treaty.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Under <em>Rauscher </em>the specialty doctrine may be implied where a treaty is silent on the issue and there is no reason to assume the signatory nations did not abide by the principles of comity.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Petitioner Pang argues that, because the extradition order specifically excluded the charges of murder in the first degree requested by the State of Washington, under the specialty doctrine the State may not prosecute him on these charges. He argues that under <em>Rauscher </em>the specialty doctrine is implied in every treaty.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The State argues that any limitations on post-extradition prosecution are defined only by the terms of the treaty and the doctrine of specialty applies only when it is expressly incorporated into the terms of the treaty. In determining whether there has been a violation to the specialty doctrine, courts have consistently examined the terms of the treaty for any limitations on prosecution.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>observed in a recent case that \"[w]e look to the language of the applicable treaty to determine the protection an extradited person is afforded under the doctrine of specialty.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">In this case, the doctrine of specialty is incorporated into the terms of the Treaty of Extradition Between the United States of America and the United States of Brazil (Treaty) through Article XXI which provides:<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-6\">A person extradited by virtue of the present Treaty may not be tried or punished by the requesting State for any crime or offense committed prior to the request for his extradition, other than that which gave rise to the request, nor may he be re-extradited by the requesting State to a third country which claims him, unless the surrendering State also agrees or unless the person extradited, having been set at liberty within the requesting State, remains voluntarily in the requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>State for more than 30 days from the date on which he was released. Upon such release, he shall be informed of the consequences to which his stay in the territory of the requesting State would subject him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">This provision, read in conjunction with Articles I and II, requires that the crime must be enumerated in the treaty and must satisfy the doctrine of dual criminality, thus incorporating the doctrine of specialty into the Treaty. Because the doctrine is codified in federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3192, federal law requires acceptance of the requirement of Brazil that an offense must be extraditable under its interpretation of applicable domestic and international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recognizes that the doctrine of specialty is embodied in all extradition treaties.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> That court has recognized <em>Rauscher </em>as providing an \"implicit rule of specialty.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> It has also recognized that, under the doctrine of specialty, an extradited person may be prosecuted only for offenses specified in the order of extradition.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">The Federal Supreme Court of Brazil specifically \"exclude[d] from the grant of extradition the charges of murder in the first degree.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> The Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\"><em>granted extradition without any restriction as to the possibility of life imprisonment; but only on the crime of first degree arson with the results it produced (four deaths) and all the consequences thereof pursuant to United States law without however, the added charge of four counts of murder in the </em>first-degree.[<footnotemark>82</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">After considering the appeal for clarification from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>United States, the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil unanimously denied it, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\"><em>The absence of any doubt or obscurity as regards the denial of the extradition with respect to the charges of the four crimes of murder in the first degree is demonstrated in the terms of the decision, which did not consider the facts, as described in the request, as characterizing independent crimes of arson in the first degree and murder in the first </em>degree.[<footnotemark>83</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">King County Superior Court Judge Jordan in his oral decision stated, \"it appears to this Court reasonably clear that Brazil did not extradite for felony murder.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> He was absolutely correct in that conclusion. But he was in error in his conclusion that Brazil had \"implicitly waived\u201d any objection to the State of Washington ignoring the order on extradition. Under the treaty and the doctrine of specialty, King County may not prosecute Petitioner Pang for any crime but arson in the first degree as specified in the extradition ruling by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil. \"The doctrine of specialty is satisfied if the extraditing country honors the limitations placed on the prosecution by the surrendering state.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">\n<em>Extradition Treaty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">(4) <em>Does the Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and the United States of Brazil prohibit the State of Washington from prosecuting Petitioner Pang for crimes not authorized in the extradition order?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">International law is incorporated into our domestic law.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Treaties are the supreme law of the land.

Especially should this be the case where the government surrendering the person has refused to make the surrender for the other offense, on the ground that such offense was not one covered by the treaty.[<footnotemark>90</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">We adopt that statement as appropriate declaration of good faith which our courts must maintain in interpreting the terms and conditions of an extradition proceeding between signatory nations to a treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The right \"to demand and obtain extradition of an accused criminal is created by treaty.\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> The treaty must ordinarily list the offense complained of in a request for extradition as an extraditable offense.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Additionally, under the doctrine of dual criminality, an accused person may be extradited only if the conduct complained of is considered criminal by the jurisprudence or under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>laws of both requesting and asylum states.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> The doctrine of dual criminality is specifically incorporated into the Treaty between the United States and Brazil through Article I, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">Each Contracting State agrees, under the conditions established by the present Treaty and each in accordance with the legal formalities in force in its own country, to deliver up, reciprocally, persons found in its territory who have been charged with or convicted of any of the crimes or offenses specified in Article II of the present Treaty and committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the other, or outside thereof under the conditions specified in Article IV of the present Treaty: provided that such surrender shall take place only upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his commitment for trial if the crime or offense had been there committed.[<footnotemark>94</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">Article II of the Treaty states in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">Persons shall be delivered up according to the provisions of the present Treaty for prosecution when they have been charged with, or to undergo sentence when they have been convicted of, any of the following crimes or offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">1.

From the extensive record in this case, we cannot conclude that the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil misinterpreted its own laws in rendering its decision on extradition of Petitioner Pang under the Treaty.

The court noted by contrast that \"[t]he operative treaty in [the] case con-tainted] the following language: 'A person surrendered can in no case be [prosecuted] . . . for any other crime or offence, or on account of any other matters, than those for which the extradition shall have taken place.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">(5) <em>Is the State of Washington obligated to follow the de-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number><em>cisi\u00f3n of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil which ruled that, as a condition for extraditing Petitioner Pang the State, he can be prosecuted only \"for the crime of arson in the first degree resulting in four deaths . </em>. . <em>without the additional charge of four counts of first degree murder \u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Under all the established facts in this case and the application of international law, treaty law, United States law, Washington law, and common logic, we must give good faith recognition to the lawful determination of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil, the highest court of that sovereign democracy, that Petitioner Martin Shaw Pang was extradited only for prosecution in the State of Washington for the crime of arson in the first degree, resulting in four deaths, but not for prosecution for the four charges of murder in the first degree. We therefore answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">\n<em>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">(1) Petitioner Pang has standing to object to violation by the State of Washington of the terms of the order on extradition issued by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil. The only firm decisions on the issue of standing agree that an extraditee may raise any objection the surrendering State could make, as long as that country has not waived its right to object. From the entire record in this case, we cannot conclude that the United States of Brazil has said, done or implied by words, action or inaction, anything which would require this Court to deny Petitioner Pang the right to make postextradition objections to his prosecution by the State of Washington in violation of the conditions of his extradition from Brazil.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">(2) The United States of Brazil did not explicitly or implicitly waive any objection it could have made to prosecution by the State of Washington of Petitioner Pang for murder in the first degree contrary to the specific terms of the extradition order issued by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil. We are not convinced an implied waiver, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>made, would overcome the standing of Petitioner Pang to object in this case. We conclude from the record in this case that Brazil has not expressly consented to nor implicitly or explicitly waived objection to the State of Washington charging Petitioner with murder in the first degree. We therefore conclude that Petitioner Pang does have standing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">(3) The \"doctrine of specialty\u201d in international extradition law prohibits the State of Washington from prosecuting Petitioner Pang for crimes specifically excluded in the extradition order. In this case the doctrine is incorporated into the Treaty through Article XXI. The doctrine of specialty is satisfied if the extraditing country honors the limitations placed on the prosecution by the surrendering state.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">(4) The Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and the United States of Brazil prohibits the State of Washington from prosecuting Petitioner Pang for crimes not authorized in the extradition order. Good faith must be maintained in interpreting the terms and conditions of an extradition proceeding between signatory nations to a treaty. We conclude that under the Treaty, Brazil, as the requested state, has sole authority to determine whether a particular offense is extraditable.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">(5) The State of Washington is obligated to follow the decision of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil which ruled that, as a condition for extraditing Petitioner Pang to the State of Washington, he can be prosecuted only \"for the crime of arson in the first degree resulting in four deaths .... without the additional charge of four counts of first degree murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">We reverse the King County Superior Court which denied the motion of Petitioner Martin Shaw Pang to dismiss or sever four counts of murder in the first degree from one count of arson in the first degree. The trial court erroneously concluded that the record in this case establishes Brazil Minister of Justice Nelson A. Jobim implicitly waived the provisions of Article XXI of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>Treaty, thus depriving Petitioner Pang of standing to assert a violation of Article XXI and allowing the State of Washington to proceed to trial on all counts, including the four counts of murder in the first degree. The State may proceed to trial only on Count I of the second amended information which charges Petitioner Martin Shaw Pang with the crime of arson in the first degree alleged to have been committed in King County, Washington on or about January 5, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Guy, Johnson, Madsen, and Sanders, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-11\"><em>See </em>Certification for Determination of Probable Cause, Clerk\u2019s Papers at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-12\"><em>See </em>Warrant for Arrest, United States District Court Case Number 95-38m, signed by Judicial Officer David E.

After fire investigators determined that the fire had been deliberately set, a fugitive warrant was issued for Martin Pang, who fled to Brazil. Pang was charged with first degree arson and four counts of first degree felony murder, and the United States requested that Brazil extradite him on these charges. However, the Brazilian Supreme Court determined that Pang\u2019s alleged act would be classified in Brazil as the single crime of aggravated arson. Therefore, Brazil granted extradition on the arson count alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The question before us is whether the State may prosecute Pang for the felony murder given that Brazil extradited him only for arson. The plain language of the United States/Brazil extradition treaty expressly permits prosecution for offenses included in the extradition request. Yet, the majority erroneously concludes that a doctrine of international law called specialty prohibits the State from prosecuting Pang for anything other than the arson count for which he was extradited. The majority\u2019s conclusion is based on a misunderstanding of the specialty doctrine and is inconsistent with the vast weight of authority, which holds that the scope of any specialty limitations on prosecution is determined solely by the language of the applicable treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Unless Pang is prosecuted for murder, he cannot be punished for the firefighters\u2019 deaths because the codification of the \"real facts doctrine\u201d in our state sentencing laws excludes from sentencing consideration facts that establish the elements of a more serious crime. Thus, the majority\u2019s decision not only violates the State\u2019s unambiguous rights under the treaty, but also fails even to effectuate Brazil\u2019s expectation that Pang will be held accountable for the deaths he may have caused</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">THE SPECIALTY DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Absent a treaty, the obligation to surrender a fugitive has never been recognized as a principle of international law.<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> In order to ensure that criminal fugitives are brought to justice, many nations, including the United States, have entered into extradition treaties to facilitate the surrender and prosecution of fugitives. In order to guard against indiscriminate prosecution, particularly of political crimes, extradition treaties usually include provisions that limit prosecution for separate crimes unrelated to the extradition request.<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> Such limitations on prosecution are collectively referred to as the \"specialty doctrine\u201d and serve to discourage nations from requesting extradition for one offense as a ruse for obtaining jurisdiction on a different offense. However, the precise form of the specialty doctrine varies because nations have negotiated different limits on postextradition prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">For example, some extradition treaties prohibit prosecution for any offenses other than those for which extradition is specifically <em>granted. </em>In this most restrictive version of the specialty doctrine, the asylum country dictates the scope of permissible prosecution by its grant of extradition. It was this version of the rule that was applied in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s first specialty doctrine case, <em>Rauscher, </em>and the rule that the majority erroneously suggests is implied in every extradition treaty to which the United States is a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Although some nations adhere strictly to this version of specialty in all extradition matters, \"[i]n other states, including the United States, the prosecution may go forward if it is based on the same facts as those set forth <em>in the request for </em>extradition.\u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> Nations adopting this variation of the specialty doctrine retain control over the scope of prosecution rather than allowing the asylum country to dictate its scope. It is this version of the specialty doctrine that is expressly incorporated into the United States/Brazil extradition treaty: \"A person extradited by virtue of the present Treaty may not be tried or punished by the requesting State for any crime or offense committed prior to the request for his extradition, other than that <em>which gave rise to the request. </em>\u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> But both versions of the rule accomplish the purpose of the specialty doctrine: protection against indiscriminate prosecution of separate crimes unrelated to the extradition request.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">In suggesting that the specialty doctrine must be implied into the United States/Brazil extradition treaty, the majority assumes, without support, that the specialty doctrine is solely defined as limiting prosecution to offen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>ses for which extradition was granted. But, as the First Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-5\">Specialty ... is not a hidebound dogma, but must be applied in a practical, commonsense fashion. Thus, obeisance to the principle of specialty does not require that. . . the prosecution always be limited to specific offenses enumerated in the surrendering state\u2019s extradition order . . . .[<footnotemark>113</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">In the present case, the specialty doctrine does not need to be implied for it is already expressly incorporated into the United States/Brazil extradition treaty, albeit in a form that is not conducive to the majority\u2019s desired result. Thus, the question is not whether the specialty doctrine should be implied in the United States/Brazil extradition treaty, but whether this court can imply additional limitations on prosecution beyond the express specialty provisions agreed upon by the United States and Brazil.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">A COURT MAY NOT IMPLY ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON PROSECUTION IN THE FACE OF EXPRESS LIMITATIONS INCLUDED IN THE TREATY</p>\n<p id=\"AxY\">The majority relies on <em>United States v. Rauscher, </em>119 U.S. 407, 7 S. Ct. 234, 30 L. Ed. 425 (1886) for the proposition that an implied term of every extradition treaty is that an extradited fugitive may be prosecuted only for crimes for which he was surrendered. Yet, the majority, by its own analysis, demonstrates that <em>Rauscher </em>is not applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">In <em>Rauscher, </em>an American merchant ship officer who was accused of murdering a crewmember fled to Great Britain. The United States, pursuant to its first extradition treaty, requested the fugitive\u2019s extradition for murder; the request was subsequently granted. The defendant, however, was subsequently tried and convicted of inflicting cruel and unusual punishment instead of murder. The Supreme Court vacated the sentence and held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>defendant could be tried only for an offense \"with which he is charged in the extradition proceedings and for which he was delivered up . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court rejected the State\u2019s argument that the treaty\u2019s silence on the issue indicated that the United States and Great Britain intended that there be no limitations on prosecution. Instead, the Court implied such a limitation into the treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">At first blush, it might appear as though the Court had announced a rule that such a limitation is implied in all extradition treaties as a matter of course. Yet, the Court strictly limited its holding as an interpretation of the extradition treaty with Great Britain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">\"The right of one government to demand and receive from another the custody of an offender who has sought asylum upon its soil, depends upon the existence of treaty stipulations between them, and in all cases is derived from, and is measured and restricted by, the provisions, express or implied, of the treaty. \u201d[<footnotemark>115</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Consistent with the rule that the treaty defines the scope of the specialty doctrine, the Court initially looked to the text of the treaty itself.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> It was only after determining that the treaty was silent on this issue that the Court looked beyond the express treaty terms to determine whether the parties intended to limit the scope of post-extradition prosecution. Thus, it was only in the absence of express specialty provisions that the Court turned to the comity principles in general, the specific history between the United States and Great Britain on this issue in particular, and the statutory references to limitations on prosecution, in order to resolve this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">The majority correctly identifies a treaty\u2019s silence on the issue as an essential prerequisite for the Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>inquire beyond the language of the treaty itself. \"The Court examined the treaty and the history of relations between the United States and Great Britain to determine whether the parties, <em>in the absence of express incorporation, </em>nevertheless intended the doctrine of specialty to be part of the treaty.\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> Crucial to the Court\u2019s decision was the fact that the very issue had been the subject of much dispute between the nations, with Great Britain making very clear that it expected that the scope of prosecution would be limited by the grant of extradition.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> The Court also looked to a statute, now codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3192, that authorizes the President to provide for an extradited fugitive\u2019s transportation and safekeeping \"until the final conclusion of his trial for the crimes or offences specified in the warrant of extradition, . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> Yet, the court resorted to this language only to resolve \"any doubt upon this <em>construction of the treaty.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>120</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Thus, <em>Rauscher </em>stands for the proposition that a court\u2019s overriding task is to determine what the signatory nations to the extradition treaty intended to include in the way of limitations on prosecution. Only when the text of the treaty fails to provide expressly for such limitations is the court then authorized to look beyond the treaty. Lastly, when there is evidence that the signatory nations expected that prosecution would be limited to charges for which surrender is granted, the court may then imply this term into the treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Curiously, the majority concedes that <em>Rauscher </em>autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>rizes courts to imply prosecution limitations only when the treaty fails to provide expressly for such limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-5\">Under <em>Rauscher </em>the specialty doctrine may be implied where a treaty is silent on the issue and there is no reason to assume the signatory nations did not abide by the principles of comity.[<footnotemark>121</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Indeed, the majority must concede this point. Were it the case that <em>Rauscher </em>prohibits the prosecution of any extradited fugitive for offenses other than those for which extradition was granted, the majority would need to explain, and indeed has failed to offer any explanation for, the numerous circuit court decisions upholding such convictions against alleged specialty doctrine violations.<footnotemark>122</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Unlike the treaty at issue in <em>Rauscher, </em>most United States extradition treaties, including the one with Brazil, now expressly define the limits of postextradition prosecution. Again, the majority concedes that \"[i]n determining whether there has been a violation to the specialty doctrine, courts have consistently examined the terms of the treaty for any limitations on prosecution.\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> Indeed, the majority cites a formidable list of federal extradition cases in which the courts, rather than implying limitations into the applicable treaties, had confined themselves to the specialty doctrine as expressly provided for in the treaties at issue.<footnotemark>124</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">The majority, having identified an overwhelming</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>number of cases in which the courts confined their specialty doctrine analysis to the express limitations in the relevant treaties, fails to offer a single case in which a court implied prosecution limitations beyond the express limitations included in the relevant treaty. This failure is understandable since it is well settled that the only limitations on post-extradition prosecution are those contained in the applicable extradition treaty. \"To determine the nature and extent of the right we must look to the treaty which created it.\u201d<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Although the majority is correct that international law is incorporated into domestic law,<footnotemark>126</footnotemark> \"extradition is 'not</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>uniformly recognized as part of customary international law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>127</footnotemark> \"[B]ecause United States extradition practice is based solely on the existence of a treaty,\u201d the Supreme Court has rejected the suggestion that extradition cases are governed by customary international law and has \"limited the practice to a strict interpretation of the applicable treaty.\u201d<footnotemark>128</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">This view comports with Brazil\u2019s understanding with respect to any limitations on prosecution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-6\">[LJegally binding international acts are the only legal instruments capable of binding two or more sovereign States together. Thus, provided that the terms of the Treaty of Extradition . . . are respected, it will be incumbent upon the justice system of the United States of America to establish a suitable punishment for the crime of arson in the first degree, resulting in four deaths and the consequences thereof, under U.S. law.[<footnotemark>129</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Thus, the question of whether the State may prosecute Pang for felony murder depends on the express specialty provisions of the United States/Brazil extradition treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">THE UNITED STATES/BRAZIL EXTRADITION TREATY PROHIBITS PROSECUTION ONLY FOR CHARGES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE EXTRADITION REQUEST</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">The United States/Brazil extradition treaty provides that: \"A person extradited by virtue of the present Treaty may not be tried or punished by the requesting State for any crime or offense committed prior to the request for his extradition, other than that <em>which gave rise to the</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>request.... \u201d<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> \"[T]reaties are to be interpreted in accordance with the plain meaning of the words.\u201d<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> The State requested Pang\u2019s extradition on arson and first degree felony murder charges arising out of his act of intentionally setting a fire that resulted in death. It is undisputed that this act is an extraditable offense. Since Pang is not being prosecuted for any offenses other than those that gave rise to the request for extradition, the State\u2019s prosecution of Pang for murder does not violate the United States/Brazil extradition treaty and fully complies with the express limitations negotiated by the United States and Brazil.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Giving effect to the plain language of the treaty and refusing to imply additional limitations finds ample case support. The majority itself concedes that two circuit court decisions have affirmed convictions on charges other than those for which extradition was granted based on the express language of the treaties at issue.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> The majority never explains how these cases could have been decided consistent with a rule that purportedly prohibits such prosecutions in every extradition case.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">For example, in <em>Fiocconi </em>the defendants were extradited from Italy to the United States on charges of conspiring to import narcotics. They were later additionally charged and convicted of substantive narcotics crimes. They appealed their convictions, arguing that under <em>Rauscher </em>there was an implicit prohibition against prosecution for charges other than the conspiracy charge for which they were extradited. In upholding their convictions the circuit court looked to the United States/Italy extradition treaty, which provided, much like the United States/Brazil extra-</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>dition treaty, that: \"the person . . . delivered up for the crimes enumerated . . . shall in no case be tried for any . . . crime, committed previously to that for which his . . . surrender <em>is asked.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>133</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">If the countries had intended that the requesting government could not try the accused for any crime committed .before the time of his surrender other than the crime <em>for which he was extradited, </em>they could have accomplished this by adopting one of the standard clauses to that endJ[<footnotemark>134</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">In doing so, the court expressly rejected the suggestion that under <em>Rauscher </em>greater limitations on prosecution may be implied in the face of express treaty limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Another example is <em>United States v. Sensi, </em>879 F.2d 888 (D.C. Cir. 1989), in which the defendant was convicted of charges other than those for which he was extradited. The court upheld the convictions on the basis that the treaty prohibited prosecution only for offenses other than those <em>\"established by the facts </em>in respect of which his extradition has been granted.\u201d<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> The court acknowledged that the crimes charged were not those for which extradition was granted. The crimes were based, however, on the same underlying facts and, therefore, complied with the specialty provisions in the treaty. Thus, there was no violation of the specialty doctrine.<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> Similarly, had the United States and Brazil intended to limit prosecution of fugitives to crimes for which the asylum country agrees to extradite, they could have used language to that end. Such limitation is included in many of our extradition treaties.<footnotemark>137</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>Indeed, the majority cites only a single <em>post-Rauscher </em>case in which a court held that a fugitive cannot be prosecuted for offenses other than those for which extradition was granted. Yet, that case was based on the express language of the treaty, which included just such a limitation. In <em>United States v. Khan, </em>993 F.2d 1368 (9th Cir. 1993), the United States requested that Pakistan extradite a fugitive charged with conspiracy to import heroin and with using a communication facility to facilitate the conspiracy. Pakistan directed that the defendant could be \"surrendered . . . for trial under the relevant American Law,\u201d<footnotemark>138</footnotemark> yet the Pakistani extradition materials referred only to the conspiracy charge.<footnotemark>139</footnotemark> The court held that because Pakistan did not unambiguously agree to extradite the defendant on the communications facility charge, the specialty doctrine had been violated and the conviction on that charge should be reversed.<footnotemark>140</footnotemark> Yet, the court did so because \"[t]he operative treaty in this case contains the following language: 'A person surrendered can in no case be [prosecuted] . . . for any other crime or offence, or on account of any other matters, than those <em>for which the extradition shall have taken place.\u2019 </em>\u201d<footnotemark>141</footnotemark> The court acknowledged that the <em>Sensi </em>court had held that the specialty doctrine is satisfied as long as the defendant is charged with crimes arising out of the same facts for which his extradition was granted. However, the court clarified that that holding was based on the more expansive version of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>specialty doctrine expressly incorporated into the treaty at issue in that case.<footnotemark>142</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Thus, an extraditee may challenge his prosecution for crimes other than those for which extradition was granted when the express specialty provisions limit prosecution to those offenses. When the extradition treaty expressly provides for lesser protection, however, the extraditee may assert only the limits of any rights as expressed in the treaty. Since the United States requested that Pang be extradited on four felony murder counts as well as arson, and the extradition treaty with Brazil limits the offenses that may be prosecuted only to those \"which gave rise to the request,\u201d there is simply no violation of the treaty terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">A GOOD FAITH READING OF THE UNITED STATES/BRAZIL EXTRADITION TREATY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PLAIN MEANING OF THE EXPRESS SPECIALTY TERMS</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">I agree with the majority that we must interpret treaties in good faith.<footnotemark>143</footnotemark> However, the <em>Johnson </em>Court\u2019s admonition that we construe extradition treaties in good faith is fully met by giving effect to the plain language of the United States/Brazil extradition treaty.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant was indicted on federal charges of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud; yet, the United States proceeded upon only the conspiracy charge. After the defendant was convicted, he fled to Canada and the United States requested his extradition. Canada refused to extradite, having determined that conspiracy to commit fraud was not an extraditable offense. The United States recharged the substantive fraud count, requested extradition for that offense, and Canada extradited the fugitive. The United States then imprisoned the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>for the conspiracy conviction. In affirming a lower court order discharging the defendant, the Supreme Court emphasized that an extradition treaty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-5\">should be construed in accordance with the highest good faith, and that it should not be sought by doubtful construction of some of its provisions to obtain the extradition of a person for one offense and then punish him for <em>another </em>and <em>different </em>offense.[<footnotemark>144</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">The Court was rightly concerned with the government\u2019s blatant manipulation of the extradition process to obtain extradition for one offense as a ruse for obtaining jurisdiction for another that \"is <em>entirely different </em>from the one for which he was extradited.\u201d<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> As discussed earlier, this is the unifying purpose underlying the various versions of the specialty doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">In the present case, however, the United States requested and Brazil granted extradition for the same criminal act: the intentional burning of a building that resulted in death. The majority mistakenly assumes that the relevant inquiry is whether the two nations criminalize the act in the same way. Yet, the Supreme Court has made clear that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-8\">The law does not require that the name by which the crime is described in the two countries shall be the same; nor that the scope of the liability shall be coextensive, or, in other respects, the same in the two countries. It is enough if the particular act charged is criminal in both jurisdictions.[<footnotemark>146</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Extradition treatises universally recognize this distinction.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">Thus, allowing the State to prosecute Pang for murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>does not find us engaging in \"doubtful construction\u201d in order to allow prosecution for \"another and separate\u201d offense from that for which Pang was extradited. Pang is accused of intentionally setting a fire that resulted in death. Under both Washington and Brazilian law this act is criminal and is more severely punished than simple arson because of the resulting death. Although the act is differently codified in the two countries, as <em>Collins </em>makes clear, the dispositive inquiry is whether the act is criminal in both jurisdictions. Therefore, giving effect to the plain meaning of the United States/Brazil extradition treaty does not violate our obligation to construe treaties in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">THE \"REAL FACTS\u201d DOCTRINE PROHIBITS THE TRIAL COURT FROM CONSIDERING THE DEATHS AS AGGRAVATING FACTORS IN SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The majority attempts to mitigate the injustice of its decision with the suggestion that, whether or not Pang is convicted for the felony murders, the trial court could depart from the standard range arson sentence and impose the statutory maximum of life imprisonment.<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s unstated assumption is that the firefighters\u2019 deaths could be used as aggravating factors justifying the imposition of an exceptional sentence. Indeed, as the majority points out, the Brazilian Supreme Court assumed that Pang could be as severely punished whether the firefighters\u2019 deaths served as the basis for an exceptional arson sentence or separate felony murder sentences.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">However, despite the trial court\u2019s discretion to depart from the standard range based on the presence of aggravating circumstances, this discretion is sharply limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>by the \"real facts doctrine.\u201d As Justice Smith pointed out in <em>State v. Johnson, </em>124 Wn.2d 57, 71 n.33, 873 P.2d 514 (1994): \"The 'real facts\u2019 concept of RCW 9.94A.370(2) excludes consideration of either uncharged crimes or crimes charged but later dismissed.\u201d<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> RCW 9.94A.370(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">Facts that establish the elements of a more serious crime or additional crimes may not be used to go outside the presumptive sentence range except upon stipulation or when specifically provided for in RCW 9.94A.390(2)(c), (d), (f), and (g)[<footnotemark>151</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">In the present case, the arson deaths cannot be used to depart from the standard range because they establish an essential element of first degree felony murder.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> And there can be no dispute that felony murder is both a separate and more serious crime since it is precisely because Washington penalizes Pang\u2019s alleged act as two separate crimes that we are deciding this case at all. With the murder charges dismissed and the trial court\u2019s inability to otherwise consider the deaths, the trial court will have no choice but to enter a standard range sentence for first degree arson, which, as the majority points out, would be approximately two years in Pang\u2019s case.<footnotemark>153</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A7z\">The majority\u2019s decision to dismiss the murder charges defeats the very purpose of extradition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-5\">The law of extradition is . . . founded upon the broad principle that it is to the interest of civilized communities that crimes, acknowledged to be such, should not go unpunished, and it is part of the comity of nations that one state should afford to another every assistance towards bringing persons guilty of such crimes to justice.[<footnotemark>154</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Yet, under the majority\u2019s holding, the deaths of four innocent victims will go unpunished, even though the laws of both Brazil and Washington recognize arson resulting in death as a more serious crime than arson alone. Thus, rather than furthering the ends of justice, the majority rewards Pang\u2019s calculated flight and ensures that neither nation\u2019s will is done by immunizing Pang from any liability for the deaths he may have caused. Because Pang\u2019s prosecution for murder would be wholly consistent with both our treaty obligations toward Brazil and the overwhelming weight of authority, Pang should stand trial for murder and arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Dolliver and Talmadge, JJ., concur with Durham, C.J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"109\">\n<p id=\"b905-9\"><em>United States v.

I write this concurrence simply to express my view that the dissent and majority opinions should not speculate on whether or not the real facts doctrine would preclude the trial judge from imposing a sentence on Pang for first degree arson that would exceed a standard range sentence for that of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>fense. In my view, it is entirely inappropriate for this court to pass judgment on the propriety of a sentence that has not yet and may never be imposed.

Any speculation about the validity of a sentence that has not or may never be imposed is dicta of the first order and should not be a part of either the majority or dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">\n<em>Opinion Appendix \u2019A\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ArkK\">FEDERAL SUPREME COURT</p>\n<p id=\"AQh\">11/30/95 FULL SESSION</p>\n<p id=\"A7f\">EXTRADITION No. 00006541 / 120</p>\n<p id=\"AKh\">ORIGIN: UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>\n<p id=\"AWh\">ASSIGNED: JUSTICE N\u00c9RI DA SILVEIRA</p>\n<p id=\"apa-dedup-0\">REQUESTED BY: THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>\n<p id=\"AxmE\">PERSON SOUGHT: MARTIN SHAW PANG</p>\n<p id=\"A1g\">REPORT</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">JUSTICE N\u00c9RI DA SILVEIRA (ASSIGNED): -The Embassy of the United States of America contacted the Brazilian Government through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and citing Diplomatic Note No. 083, of March 7,1995, as well as The Brazil-United States Extradition Treaty of January 13, 1961 Article VIII and Additional Protocol of June 18, 1962, requested the provisional arrest, for extradition purposes, of MARTIN SHAW PANG, a.k.a. MARK WONG, a.k.a.

While fighting the fire several firemen got to the first floor in the flooded warehouse. Without any warning whatsoever, the floor gave in, tumbling the firemen to the basement. Four firemen died in the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-6\">On December 13, 1994 an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) was contacted by a witness who said that the \"Mary Pang\u201d warehouse was going to be \"burned\u201d. The witness told the agent that Pang was advised to remove his personal belongings from the warehouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-7\">On another occasion, Pang told the witness, in detail, how the fire would occur and it really happened that way. On another occasion, Pang also removed his personal belongings from the building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-8\">In December, Pang took a close friend to the warehouse and told him that the food company was not doing well. He said that the warehouse would burn down in January and that it would look like transients set the fire. Pang told a number of other people that the warehouse would burn down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-9\">After the fire Pang told another witness that it looked like some transient had set the warehouse on fire and described how it had happened. Pang described how the fire happened even before the information had been announced by the investigators. Inevitably, Pang\u2019s statements to his friends came very close to a confession. Arson Investigators announced that the fire had been intentionally set, causing the death of four fire-fighters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-10\">Murder is described in Article II Paragraph I of the Treaty of Extradition Between the United States of America and the United States of Brazil. Seizure of Assets is described in Article XX of the [same] treaty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Because the request for the provisional arrest for purposes of extradition of MARTIN SHAW PANG, a.k.a. MARK WONG, a.k.a. SUEN HING WAH, had been sufficiently documented, I ordered the provisional arrest of the above mentioned alien, according to Article 81 - Estatuto do Estrangeiro [Foreign National Statutes] and according to what had been decided on the Question of the Order for Extradition Request No. 478-6, which determined that an arrest warrant be issued, to be executed by the Federal Police Department, according to fls. 12 of writ, PPE documents No. 217-3 / 420, attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">On May 15, 1995, the Minister of Justice, through Dispatch / GM / MJ / No. 00435, expedited probable cause and other formal documents for the extradition of Martin Shaw Pang, which had been sent by the American Embassy, through diplomatic channels, according to Diplomatic Note No. 169 fls. 6/7, where it reads (fls. 6):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-13\">Pang is sought by the State of Washington to be tried for Intentional Homicide and Arson.

PANG in King County, Washington on or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>about January 5, 1995, did knowingly and maliciously cause a fire or explosion located at 811 Seventh Avenue South (the Mary Pang Warehouse), Seattle, which was manifestly dangerous to any human life, including firemen;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-5\">Contrary to ROW 9A.48.020 (1) (a), and against the peace and dignity of the State of Washington.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Therefore, according to the amended Information, the person sought is charged with four counts of Murder in the First Degree and one count of Arson in the First Degree. These crimes, [now] under scrutiny, correspond [to crimes] found in the Brazilian Criminal Law Code, in Arts. 121, as to Murder, \"caput\u201d [first sentence] - Intentional Homicide, and 250, \"caput\u201d Intentional Fire-Setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">In a preliminary manner, after the fire and death of the fire-fighters, who intervened while carrying out their duties, occurred, at the beginning of January of the year mentioned, there is no [reason] here to talk about extinction of punishment, through the imposition of punitive action, whether according to State of Washington legislation, or Brazilian criminal law. The State of Washington sentencing guidelines, according to the Revised Code of Washington are found in fls. 356-358. References concerning the Brazilian Criminal Law Code, are found in Article 109, I, as to the homicide found in Article 121, \"caput\u201d, and in Article 109, III, for Intentional Fire-Setting (Article 250).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Arson in the First Degree has the following definition in Section 9A.48.020 (fls. 135):</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">9A.48.020. Arson in the First Degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">(1) A person is guilty of Arson in the First Degree if he knowingly and maliciously:</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">(a) Causes a fire or explosion which is manifestly dangerous to any human life, including firemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">Murder in the First Degree is defined in Section 9A.32.030, cited (fls. 134):</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">(1) A person is guilty of Murder in the First Degree when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-14\">(c) He or she commits or attempts to commit the crime of either: (1) Robbery in the First or Second Degree, (2) Rape in the First or Second Degree, (3) Burglary in the First Degree, (4) Arson in the First or Second Degree, or (5) Kidnapping in the First or Second Degree, and in the course of or in furtherance of such crime or in immediate flight therefrom, he or she, or another participant, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants: except that in any prosecution under this subdivision (1) (c) in which the defendant was not the only participant in the underlying crime, if established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, it is a defense that the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABg\">(i) Did not commit the homicidal act or in anyway solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>(ii) Was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any instrument, article; or substance readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-5\">(iii) Had no reasonable grounds to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon, instrument, article or substance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-6\">(iv) Had no reasonable grounds to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Counsel for the person sought states that deferment of extradition for Arson in the First Degree with risk of life is impossible, because it would result in double punishment for the same act, a bis in idem. [The Defense] states that extradition [should] be granted only for Arson in the Second Degree. And states (fls, 287):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-8\">It is understood, then, that we are dealing with a <em>bis in idem. </em>How can someone be accused, simultaneously, of causing damage to a person\u2019s health, and also of bringing him / her into danger? Obviously, damage always involves risk, which is a necessary step to accomplish the other. <em>Mutatis mutandis, </em>it would be the same as to attempt to convict someone of murder and of hodily injury, because before killing someone, damage was done to the physical integrity of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-9\">In fact, there is an apparent conflict of norms in this case, which can be solved by the \"principle of absorption.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Further, the Defense adds (fls. 288):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-11\">If deaths occurred and if the charge deals, equally, with the crimes of Murder, it seems clear that this more serious event absorbs the crime of endangerment. Otherwise, one act would be generating double punishment, which is inadmissible, according to Brazilian law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Furthermore, counsel for the person sought understands that the Federal Supreme Court Jurisprudence has ruled that bis in idem cases are barred in extraditions, quoting what happened in Extradition No. 543, assigned to the Honorable Justice Moreira Alves, where it was decided that the crime of illegal coercion would be absorbed by the crime of Robbery. Therefore, the request for extradition was granted for the crime of Robbery only.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">Moreover, concerning Intentional Homicide, it is important to mention that \"the absolute inexistence of elements as to the intent to kill renders the request faulty in that respect unless, according to American Law, the intent has no bearing (. . .). In this event, however, it would be a case of objective responsibility, which would render the agent\u2019s action atypical, according to Brazilian Law and therefore, it would impede the granting of extradition\u201d (fls. 293). Along the same lines, the Defense finishes, by citing (fls. 295):</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">Therefore, the motion is for granting partial extradition for the crime of Arson in the Second Degree and denial [of extradition] for the charges of Murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>Finally, the Defense states, that the requesting State must stipulate that the Defendant must not receive a sentence of more than thirty (30) years, according to the Criminal Law Code, Article 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">As to granting extradition, \"only for the crime of Arson in the Second Degree\u201d, the opinion of the Brazil\u2019s Attorney General reads (fls. 370): \"Now, Arson in the Second Degree is not an issue [here].</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">According to document (fls. 302), not translated, attached by the Defense Attorney, one can infer that Arson in the Second Degree is that which results only in material damages\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Further, regarding Non-Intentional Homicide, the Federal Attorney General\u2019s opinion reads (fls. 370 / 371):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-8\">The Attorney\u2019s proposition that the extradition must be granted only for Non-Intentional Homicide and not for Intentional Homicide is also irrelevant. The Federal Supreme Court is not judging the extradites at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Therefore, I don\u2019t think it is possible, in this particular case, to lower the charges against the person sought at the extradition hearing, [charges] brought by the Justice System in King County, Seattle, State of Washington, from Intentional Homicide to Non-Intentional Homicide and from Intentional Fire-Setting to Negligent Fire-Setting, according to the Brazilian criminal [law] system, as the Defense intends.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">Charged as Arson in the First Degree and Murder in the First Degree (four counts), based on legislation [now] in force in the requesting State, the requested State, which has the corresponding crimes of Intentional Fire-setting and Intentional Homicide has no right to condition the granting of extradition, so that the trial process of the person sought in the Requesting State, occur in conformity with the specific legal parameters of the Requested State\u2019s legislation, i.e., according to Article 258 of the Brazilian Criminal Law Code, as cited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-11\">Article 258. If serious bodily harm results from an intentional crime of common danger, the prison sentence is increased by half; if it results in death, it is doubled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-12\">In the case of negligence, if bodily harm results from the act, the penalty would be increased by half, if it results in death, the sentence imposed for Non-Intentional Homicide is increased by one third.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">Concerning the above, Celso Delmanto remarks in the Criminal Law Code Annotated, pgs. 449-450: \"It is a case of <em>praeter dolus, </em>because the results are not desired by the agent, in which case there may be formal conflict of Article 121 or 129 with the crime of common danger. (. . .) In the case of injury or death of several persons, the enhancement is applied Only once, and it is not applied in formal conflict. Therefore, if the crime of Intentional Fire-Setting results in four deaths, due to the agent\u2019s negligence, it will be classified as only one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">I understand, however, that the debate of what we call, among ourselves, the \"classified forms of common danger crimes\u201d, cannot take place during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>extradition process, if it results in dual criminality, where the facts are typical not only in the laws of the requesting State hut also in the laws of the requested State.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The analysis of the <em>quaestio juris </em>is also recommended in this case, concerning the impracticality of granting extradition, as to crimes of Murder in the First Degree, because it deals with the hypothesis of objective responsibility, prohibited within the Brazilian criminal law system, according to Article 19 of the criminal law code, citing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-6\">Article 19. The agent only answers for the result that specifically aggravates the penalty if [he] is, at least, negligent in causing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Celso Delmanto comments on this device introduced by Law No. 7209 / 1984 (Op. Cit., pg. 34):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-8\">With Article 19, the criminal [law] revision of '84 wanted to impede the punishment of someone for mere objective criminal responsibility. It determined that the agent is responsible for the result that \"specifically\u201d aggravates the penalty, only when he caused it, \"at the very least by negligence\u201d. It is explained by the [following] example: In the crime of Robbery, Article 157 Par. 3 determines that, if serious injury or death results from the violence, the penalty is especially aggravated. In implementing Article 19, the aggravating [clause] will only apply to the agent if he has caused that result (serious injury or death), at least by negligence. Therefore, if the result of the aggravating act was not due to the agent\u2019s intent or negligence he will he responsible for the Robbery, but not for the aggravating result in Article 157 Par. 3, because of the restriction in Article 19. However, it is important to note that the objective of the device in Article 19 is to limit the penalty. It should not be used to unduly exacerbate it. Therefore, intent cannot be dispensed with (substituting it for negligence) in the other qualifying and aggravating clauses, which must be present due to the agent\u2019s intent (direct or circumstantial).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">The Explanation of Motives which accompanies the new Revised Criminal Law Code remarks that \"the rule covers all enhancement clauses found in the causal separation of the action\u201d (No. 16). Celso Delmanto observes, in turn: \"It is important to notice that it only affects crimes qualified (or aggravated) by the result, i.e., the ones with a result that especially aggravate the penalty. It is not applied to qualifying or aggravating clauses that are covered by the agent\u2019s intent (and not only by negligence)\u2019 \u201d (op. Cit., pg. 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">It is important to observe that, in this particular case, the charge of Murder in the First Degree in the Court of origin, against the person sought for extradition, is found in Section 9A.32.030 (1) (c), which states as guilty of Murder in the First Degree the person who commits or attempts to commit the crime of either: (1) to (3) - omitted; (4) Arson in the First Degree, (. . .) and in the course of or in furtherance of such crime or in immediate flight therefrom, he or she, or another participant, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants: except that in any prosecution under this subdivision (1) (c) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>which the defendant was not the only participant in the underlying crime, if established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, it is a defense that the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-5\">(i) Did not commit the homicidal act or in anyway solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-6\">(ii) Was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any instrument, article; or substance readily capable of causing death or serious physical injury; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-7\">(iii) Had no reasonable grounds to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon, instrument, article or substance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-8\">(iv) Had no reasonable grounds to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Therefore, it is understood that the law of the Requesting State considers as autonomous the crime of Murder in the First Degree, the death of a person during the practice of the crimes of Robbery, Rape, Burglary with Felonious Intent, in the First Degree, Arson in the First Degree or Kidnapping, and in furtherance of said crime and in immediate flight therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">In our system, <em>praeter dolus </em>crimes are compounded, as Celso Delmanto writes in the above mentioned work, pg. 36 \"because the agent is punished due to criminal intent, for he acted with that end in mind. And he is sanctioned for negligence, for having caused a result other than what he wanted. Example: Article 129, Par. 3, in which the agent is punished for criminal intentional conduct (injury) and for the non-intentional result (death)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Regarding the crime of Arson, according to Article 250, \"caput\u201d, of the Criminal Law Code, among the causes that increase penalties by one third, listed in the above mentioned Article (1) there is no express mention of resulting serious injury or death. There is, however, [mention] that the subject is defined in the CC [Criminal Code] Article 258 in the same Chapter \"Of Common Danger Crimes\u201d (Article 250 to 259), with this general rule concerning \"qualified forms of crimes of common danger\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-12\">Article 258. If serious bodily injury results from an intentional crime of common danger the prison sentence is increased by half, if it results in death, it is doubled. In the case of negligence, if it results in bodily injury, the penalty is increased by half; if it results in death, the penalty imposed is the one used for Non-intentional Homicide, increased by one third.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">Celso Delmanto observes that it is a case of praeter dolus, \"because the results are not desired by the agent, in which case there could be formal conflict with Article 121 or 129 with the crime of common danger. According to CC, Article 19, it is essential that the resulting injury or death was caused by the agent, at least by negligence. If the result was not due to negligence, but only because of a causality relation, only the simple sentence for crimes [of common] danger will apply and not the qualifying enhancement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">One can see then, that in our system, the resulting death in the case of a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>of common danger, among them, Arson, acts as an enhancement, aggravating the penalty; but in the Requesting State\u2019s system, it is [an] autonomous [crime].</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">However, I do not see this difference in the legal system, as an obstacle in granting extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Still we need to evaluate whether the principle of subsidiarity, admitted in our jurisprudence should be applied here in such a way that the crime of Arson be absorbed by the [crime] of Murder in the First Degree, for which, in this case, it is supposed to be the Arson which occurred in the commercial building [that belonged] to the parents of the person sought for extradition, charging him with the responsibility for the criminal wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">In Extradition No. 543 - Federal Republic of Germany, assigned to the Honorable Justice Moreira Alves, this court decided, applying the principle of subsidiarity which His Honor analyzed in the following manner in his learned opinion (RTJ 138-428):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-8\">5. The Defense is equally correct, when it states that the extradition request cannot further be granted for the crime of illegal imprisonment contained in the German Criminal Code Par. 239 (1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">In fact, concerning crimes of Robbery and Illegal Coercion (which would be how the charged deed could be framed by the prison sentence, as a crime of deprivation of freedom), there is an apparent conflict of rules solved by the implied principle of subsidiarity, because it deals with compounded Robbery, one of its elements being Illegal Coercion, as Heleno Cl\u00e1udio Fragoso writes (Ligoes de Direito Penal) [Criminal Law Lessons], General Part, No. 361, pgs. 352 - 353, Fo-rense, Rio de Janeiro (1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-10\">Subsidiarity is implied when the crime defined by one of the rules is an element or a legal circumstance of another crime. There is subsidiarity in the case of a complex crime (CC, Article 103). It is said to be complex a crime which has as element or aggravating circumstance, a fact which on its own constitutes a crime. So, Robbery (CC, Article 157) includes Theft (Article 155) and Illegal Coercion (CC, Article 146) or Threat (CC, Article 147) . . . these rules leave no room for formal conflict, because there is an implied subsidiarity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">It happens that, in this case, the crime of Arson in the First Degree is an element of the crime of Murder in the First Degree, according to Section 9A.32.030 (1) (c) of the Revised Code of \"Washington [RCW],</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">Also, it must be considered that the Original Information did not mention a charge for Arson in the First Degree, but only four counts of Murder in the First Degree, according to the attached transcript. Only in the Amended Information, fls. 178 - 179, there appears \"Count V\u201d in which the accused Martin S. Pang is accused of the crime of Arson in the First Degree. The Amended Information considered such \"crime of the same or similar character and based on a series of acts connected together with another crime charged herein, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>crimes were part of a common scheme or plan, and which crimes were so closely connected in respect to time, place and occasion that it would he difficult to separate proof of one charge from proof of the other, committed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-5\">(omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">It is my opinion, however, that in this particular case, we cannot invoke the subsidiarity principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">In fact, if the extradition is granted without including the crime of Arson in the First Degree, due to the subsidiarity rule, the eventual characterization of Murder in the First Degree in the Requesting State, will not be possible, because there wouldn\u2019t be a way to have the extraditee as the perpetrator of the crime of Arson in the First Degree, an element of the crime of Murder in the First Degree. If the criminal responsibility of the person sought is not definitely ascertained by Arson in the First Degree, the charge of Murder in the First Degree is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">It is then, like the case now being examined: The subsidiarity rule cannot be invoked, in order to exclude a certain crime from the extradition deferment, when its examination is the basis for trying another crime, which is the object of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">If the charge of Arson in the First Degree is upheld or not, or if it will be reduced to Arson in the Second Degree - which is what the Defense wants - cannot be taken into consideration in this extradition hearing. The competent Court in the Requesting State must rule on this issue. What I understand here is that it is not possible to frustrate the trial of extraditee in the Requesting State for the basic crime of Arson in the First Degree, invoking, in this case, the principle of subsidiarity, in order to remove the base crime from the extradition grant, i.e., Arson in the First Degree. If it [the crime of Arson in the First Degree] cannot be investigated, because the extradition would not include it, its consequence would be the eventual infeasibility of also imputing responsibility to the extraditee for the crimes of Murder in the First Degree, according to Section 9A.32.030, which assumes guilty of Murder in the First Degree, one who commits or attempts to commit, among others Arson in the First Degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">Well, in this particular case, if Extradition will not be granted to allow the ex-traditee to stand trial also for Arson in the First Degree, according to the Amended Information, it is certain that the trial for Murder in the First Degree will not be possible, which, in this particular case, is intimately connected with the crime of Arson in the First Degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">Therefore, I feel that in this situation, the crimes which are the object of the Information and the Amended Information in the Requesting State, cannot be separated, in order to grant the extradition as to some and deny it as to the other, [which] is the basis of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">Finally, concerning the sentences to be imposed for crimes with counterparts in the laws of both States, the only matter of consequence, is to keep in mind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>limitations rendered sacred in our jurisprudence, where the extradition is not conditioned to the non-imposition of a life sentence. I have stressed this in a hearing of December 2, 1993, Extradition No. 599 -5/120, where I was the Assigned Justice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-5\">6. Nor is there room for any restriction as to the fact that the law of the Requesting State allows for a life sentence as a maximum punishment for the crime charged against the extraditee (Extradition No. 426, RTJ [expansion unknown] 115 (3): 969, Mar. 86 (\"leading case\u201d); Extradition No. 429 assigned to Just. Djaci Falcao, RTJ 119 (1): Jan. 22, 87; Extradition No. 472, 1, 72, assigned to Just. Moreira Alves, DJU [expansion unknown] .05.89; Extradition 486, assigned to Just.

(DJU 09.03.93)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">Moreover, fls. 391 makes it clear that the gradual increase or decrease of the penalty is possible under the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-10\">6. In the case of Murder in the First Degree, the scope of the standard sentencing range, established by the State of Washington Sentencing Guidelines is from 240 to 320 months. In fact, the judge can depart from this standard only if he decides that there are special aggravating circumstances. To order a sentence beyond the standard range the judge must conclude that there are compelling and substantial reasons to do so. Any sentence beyond this range cannot be excessive and must be established by strong evidence. All sentences for Murder in the First Degree will run consecutively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Therefore, once the difficulties presented by the Defense are removed and taking into consideration that the arrest warrant against the person sought for extradition was issued by a competent Judge, and the request [for the extradition] was well documented, and the charges against the person sought for extradition have corresponding laws in the Brazilian Criminal Law Code, and it is true that the alleged criminal acts occurred in the requesting State\u2019s territorial jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>tion, and if it is inappropriate to speak of penalties, it must be concluded that the extradition can be granted, without restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Based on the above, I grant the request for extradition, without restrictions, therefore affirming the opinion of the Office of Brazil\u2019s Attorney-General.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">[signed] J.

I thought it would be prudent to ponder on the <em>quaestio juris, </em>regarding the restriction issue, as to the life sentence allowed by the criminal laws of the Requesting Member-State.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">To refresh the memory of the [members] of the Plenary as to the facts, I indulge in reading Diplomatic Note No. 83, contained in fls. 5-6 of PPE 217, enclosed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-12\">The facts of this case indicate that on January 5th, 1995, a little after 19:03, the Seattle Fire Department responded to a fire at the Mary Pang Food Warehouse, Inc. While fighting the fire several firemen got to the first floor in the flooded warehouse. Without any warning, whatsoever, the floor gave in, tumbling the firemen to the basement. Four firemen died in the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-13\">On December 13, 1994 an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) was contacted by a witness who said that the \u201cMary Pang\u201d warehouse was going to be \"burned\u201d. The witness told the agent that Pang was advised to remove his personal belongings from the warehouse. On another occasion, Pang told the witness, in detail, how the fire would occur and it really happened in that manner. Pang also removed his personal belongings from the building on another occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-14\">In December, Pang took a close friend to the warehouse and told him that the food company was not doing well. He said that the warehouse would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>burn down in January and that it would look like transients set the fire. Pang told a number of other people that the warehouse would burn down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">After the fire Pang told another witness that it looked like some transient had set the warehouse on fire and described how it had happened. Pang described how the fire happened even before the information had been announced by the investigators. Inevitably, Pang\u2019s statements to his friends came very close to a confession. Arson investigators announced that the fire had been intentionally set, causing the death of four fire-fighters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">Murder is described in Article II Paragraph I of the Treaty of Extradition Between the United States of America and the United States of Brazil. Seizure of Assets is described in Article XX of the [same] treaty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Due to the commission of these crimes, an arrest warrant was issued for Murder in the First Degree and Arson in the First Degree (fls. 133, 134 and 163). The crimes answerable by the person sought for extradition are punishable with a life sentence in Washington, American territorial jurisdiction, where the crimes were committed (fls. 134-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">After stressing the issue of restriction, which the evolution of this Court\u2019s jurisprudence no longer allows, the Assigned Justice concluded, as to the question of a life sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-9\">Therefore, once the difficulties presented by the Defense are removed and taking into consideration that the arrest warrant against the person sought for extradition was issued by a competent Judge, and that the request for the extradition was well documented, and that the charges against the person sought for extradition have corresponding laws in the Brazilian Criminal Law Code, and being true that the alleged criminal acts occurred in the requesting State\u2019s territorial jurisdiction, and since it is inappropriate to speak of penalties, it must be concluded that the extradition can be granted, without restrictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Based on the above, I grant the request for extradition, without restriction, therefore affirming the opinion of the Office of Brazil\u2019s Attorney-General.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">I have tried to follow, as much as possible, the predominant jurisprudence of this Court, especially concerning internal economy, outside the realm of laws that deal with citizens\u2019 freedom, due to the inconvenience and uneasiness that a change of direction can cause in the lives of people, budgets, criteria and organizational charts of state agencies, and activities of private enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">In this case, the situation reveals that the person sought for extradition, and not yet tried, only with an arrest warrant issued against him, came to live in Brazil. It seems to me that due to the above, I have an opportunity to state what I think about the <em>thema decidendum. </em>Especially because, as far as I know, there is a difference of opinion about this subject, in view of what Justice Pertence himself stressed, in extradition Hearing No. 598 (RTJ 152) (431-438), underlining that \"safeguarding my opinion in the [above] referred preceding case overruled by Justice Paulo Brossard, until conditions exist for the reexamination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>the problem - and I refer to the demand of the commutation of life sentences - according to our jurisprudence. I agree with the Honorable Justice Assigned [to this case], not granting extradition\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Justice N\u00e9ri da Silveira also voted for the restriction in that Hearing, alleging that in Extradition 507, \"I also adopted the position of establishing a restriction in granting the request, so that the life sentence be commuted to a maximum sentence of thirty years\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">In Extradition Hearing No. 426 of May 22, 1985 requested by the United States, where the assigned Justice Rafael Mayer was overruled, Just. Rezek observed that the law dealing with extraditions at no time restricts a life sentence from an extradition decree. It [the law] refers specifically to death penalty cases. And even if that were the case, says His Honor, because the treaty with the United States dates from the 60\u2019s, the treaty and the supervenient law would be placed in conflict. And [he] ends [by saying], \"I ask myself if we would not be led by logic to one day deny extradition, if we ascertained that during the process in which the person sought for extradition was convicted, [later] there was evidence that there had been a breach of the confidentiality rule (being that Par. 9 of the same constitutional Article prohibits that; or because in the requesting State there is no guarantee of a contradictory criminal element; or because there [in that State] there is no provision for [trial by] jury for intentional crimes against life.\u201d The list in Article 153, with all due respect, does not seem to be feasible to me as a set of parameters to be imposed on the requesting State in the extradition process.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Once the Assigned Justice was overruled in that extradition, all the other Justices voted along with Justice Rezek, and this resulted in the new direction adopted by the Court, which no longer restricts a life sentence. I would like to point out that there were some opposing votes, because it dealt with the issue that the person sought for extradition had already been sentenced to life in prison in the requesting Country. This happened, for instance, in the case of Justice Passarinho, who added: \"However, the situation before us is extremely unique. The person to be extradited received a life sentence, escapes to Brazil and attempts to get his sentence changed. Based on that, I do not believe that he can find himself under our protection in that case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">I cannot, Mr. President, lend to a treaty or to an ordinary law the greatness and import of the constitutional rule. The Federal Constitution of '88, as an example of the old text, reaffirmed as dogma, in its Article 5, clause XLVII (b), that there will be no life sentence in Brazil, and CC, Article 75 decreed that a prison sentence cannot go beyond thirty years. This Article limits the prison sentence time, conforming exactly with the present constitutional dictamen, as it was the case with the Constitutions of '37 (Article 122, 13), '46 (Article 41 Par. 31 and '69 Article 153 Par. 1) which prohibited life sentences. Now, if that is the case, how can we give up a constitutional precept in face of a request for the extradition of an individual who one way or another, subjects himself to Brazilian Laws?</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">It is not a matter of doing a favor to an escaping criminal, but preserving the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>tegrity of Brazilian sovereignty, whose Greater Law established, in a solid clause, the inexistence of life sentences within [our] national territory to all Brazilians and to all who live in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">It is true that Law No. 6.815 of 08.19.80, in Article 91, clause III, restricts the handing over of the person sought for extradition to the Requesting Country, unless it is conditioned to a stipulation of commutation of the physical punishment or death sentence. It does not speak of a life sentence, and because of that omission I do not see that implicitly it [life sentence] is being contemplated, due to the origin of the same constitutional guarantees which do not reinstate the penalties of life sentence or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">I do not think that if the Constitution did not speak of forced labor or death penalty, that our jurisprudence could be interpreted as putting its seal of approval on extraditions so that sentences of that nature could be served. Under the 'aegis\u2019 of the constitution, there is no distinction between them. Because the death penalty (except in case of declared war, according to Art. 84, XEX), forced labor, exile and cruel [punishment], are irrelevant and inapplicable, just like life sentences, the former as to chronological scale, the latter, [because it is] mentioned in the list of exceptions. Because the ordinary law did not mention life sentences, that does not mean that it can be included in the extradition hearing, in order to be implemented in the requesting Country. It is because the Federal Constitution prohibits life sentences, in the list of penalties that do not exist in Brazil.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">I\u2019m not worried about the treaty. It can say what it wants, but it cannot override the constitutional ban, which does not allow life sentences in this Country, and for that very reason the Alien who lives here [is protected by it], and extradited he may be, but it will have to be with the restriction of a life sentence in the Country where he will serve his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">I do not see where a comparison can be made concerning identity of situations, [or] if we can argue about breach of confidentiality, when it caused someone to be convicted, or on another aspect, [if we can debate] the right of cross examination in criminal procedures, or why there is no provision for a trial by jury in a given State. U cannot see how] such cases equally compare with the issue of life imprisonment. While those are concepts which, no doubt, can be elevated to constitutional decisions, just the same they cannot be defined individually, as life imprisonment, which touches, by its very nature, on the status libertatis of persons. These other principles are of constitutional nature, but they are not intrinsically invested with the form and physical characteristics of the penalty, thus comprised by genesis, and banned, repeatedly by the last Federal Constitutions, as they have been expunged from our penal tradition. I would say it is true that they are more rites of process, solemn and of a higher legislative degree, [as they] deal with human rights, but they do not directly and in a straight forward manner refer to the type of penalty, as defined by Article 5 clause XLVH (b) of the Public Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">It is one thing to respect the working mechanism of constitutional guarantees - the Jury, the precepts of confidentiality and cross examination - and another [to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>respect] the penalty to be implemented. \"While those are implemented in the fulfillment of prerogatives inherent to all citizens, the penalty is the result of State interference to punish the perpetrator. The State that guarantees the practice of law is different from the State that repeals the death penalty. Brazilian Law repeals life imprisonment, thus its elevation to the heights of constitutional dogma.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">A citizen who is being judged for extradition purposes is under the protection of the constitutional guarantee clause that does not allow life imprisonment, and to grant it under those conditions, in my opinion, would be to attack an absolute precept resulting from this constitutional guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">In Extradition Hearing No. 426 a \"leading case\u201d which established a divisory line on the restriction, it must be emphasized that the extradition mentioned dealt with an American Escapee who was serving a life sentence, and in this procedure we verified that the person sought for extradition was only under deferred provisional arrest, but subject to a life sentence penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">As this subject has been discussed and reiterated a number of times, so that everyone is familiar with it, I refrain from expounding on it in greater detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">With the above considerations [in mind] I vote with the Hon. [Justice] Assigned [to the case], concerning the portion related to granting the extradition request. I oppose him, with all due respect, only with the proviso that the Requesting State, in the event that the person sought for extradition is condemned to life in prison, that his prison sentence be limited to a maximum of thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">[Signature illegible]</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">12/18 / 95 FULL SESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">EXTRADITION No. 654-1 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">VOTE</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">THE HONORABLE JUSTICE FRANCISCO REZEK - In opening, with all due respect, I would like to disagree with the Honorable Justice Mauricio Cor-r\u00e9a where His Honor disagrees with the Assigned Justice as to the 30 year restriction, in lieu of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">Try as I might, the philosophical distinction established by His Honor in his learned vote, makes no sense to me. I cannot fully comprehend what could be this intrinsic virtue of the constitutional rule which prohibits life sentences in Brazil, to the point of differentiating such rule from others that, in the very same Constitution, talk about other characteristics of the criminal process, of punishment and imprisonment of persons within the jurisdictional territory of this Republic.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>The Brazilian legislature provides a long list of guarantees in the name of the Brazilian State. It promises the people certain guidelines of criminal procedure and consequences for criminal acts, assuming that in Brazil, due to our jurisdiction and action of our [law enforcement] authorities, someone is being judged. I do not know under what pretext the Brazilian Constitution can make guarantees of a constitutional level to the person undergoing a [legal] procedure in another sovereign [State]. I also do not know on what technical, scientific or moral grounds, a certain person, because he / she was in a given moment of his / her life in Brazilian territory, would be covered by the [same] guarantees that the Federal Constitution allows a Defendant going through the criminal process in Brazil, even if [this person] is sent to another sovereign State, due to a decision of this Court, so that notwithstanding, the jurisdiction [of that Country] be imposed and not ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Our legal system is clear when it says what needs to be asked of the Requesting State as a compromise, when the Extradition Act is brought to completion: That it [the Requesting State] abstain from imposing the death penalty, physical punishment and degrading or humiliating penalties; that it give credit for the time served in Brazil, and certain other things. Absolutely not, the commutation of a life sentence; absolutely not, overseas, under another flag, a prison restriction that the Brazilian legislature established to be valid only among us.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">It seems to me that in this case, the Court should preserve its jurisprudence, established the moment the opinion of the Attorney-General, Professor Cl\u00e1udio Fontelles was refused, in the sense that the 30 year limit should be imposed on the foreign sovereignty as a condition of the extradition, because it dealt with a rule somehow vested with transcendence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">I would like to ponder [the fact] that, in this case, the Defendant is being accused by the Justice [System] of the State of Washington, in the United States of America, of Arson, which occurred in the city of Seattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">The laws are clear that the penalties are severe. Arson in the First Degree, as described in the report, may lead in itself, to a life sentence. Murder in the First Degree, only one charge may lead, in itself, to a life sentence. As valid as the accusation of the United States of America may be, we would have a possibility of an accumulation of five life sentences, being that the Information, after univocal description of the facts says, however, that he is guilty of Arson, but that he is also guilty of Murder in the First Degree - four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">He is being accused of having caused the fire of his own store, in order to obtain certain security or insurance advantages. There is a candid aspect in the report: The very Arsonist would have leaked out, ahead of time, that the store would burn down at that time, in order to avoid that [the lives] of innocent persons be exposed. But it is clear that whoever causes Arson, assumes the risks of his deed. And it happened that, in rendering assistance, four firemen who were on the top floor of the building saw the wooden floor collapse under them and died in the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">For a long time the Court is aware that I oppose the practice of imposing restrictions on an extradition. I have been saying this since the seventies. It seems to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>me that it was never the intention of the Brazilian legislature to maintain a restrictive posture. What the law wants, as I was saying, is that no one be extradited due to acts that are not criminal, according to our [law] or if the acts are not punishable, according to general rules. But when the main fact, when the brunt of the accusation justifies the extradition, I believe we should not scrutinize valid criminal process of the requesting Country as to accidental events, parallel crimes, in order to detect, in the perimeters of the charges, a lack of dual criminality rules or irrelevancy, [therefore] opposing restrictions to the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">I was overruled here. The Court decided, unanimously that these restrictions can and should be applied, under the pretext of a clearer, more detailed view of lack of dual criminality. The accusation must be examined considering its entire context; and we will do so, step by step, number by number, topic by topic, detecting the occurrence of dual criminality without which extradition cannot be granted, or it is only partially granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Overruled, I must obey the jurisprudence which for years has prevailed by the majority rule. What grieves me in this particular case, and renders the decision difficult is not the issue of the thirty year restriction, but [the manner which] the conduct of the person sought for extradition fits the criminal law of the Requesting State and our own legal system. What the charge does, in this case, after describing the human conduct to be studied, is to say that it falls under Arson in the First Degree and also in Murder in the First Degree, once, twice, three and four times. Concerning the severity of the penalties expected by the Prosecution in its charging efforts, this does not make a lot of difference, being that each one of the five charges herein accumulated would justify, in itself, a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">What I cannot see is dual criminality in the case of Murder in the First Degree. State of Washington Law says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-8\">Arson in the First Degree: A person is guilty of Arson in the First Degree if he knowingly and maliciously causes a fire or explosion which is manifestly dangerous to any human life, including firemen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">This is exactly what happened. And for Arson in the First Degree, depending on the circumstances, and obviously, on the consequences, the prison [term] can be either moderate in its chronological duration, or life, according to the law of the Requesting State.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">Brazilian law, in Article 250 says with respect to Arson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-11\">To cause a fire, risking life, physical integrity or property of another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-12\">Penalty - confinement from three to six years, and fine (. . .).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-13\">Penalty enhancement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-14\">Par. 1 - Penalties increase by one-third:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-15\">I - If the crime is committed with the intent of gaining monetary advantage for personal or third party gain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>We have here exactly the hypothesis described on the report. Finally, Brazilian law, in Article 258 says that, if death results from the intentional crime of personal danger the penalty doubles.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">According to Brazilian law the hypothetical case presented in the documents would lead to something like sixteen years of confinement. But I am not worried about the question of quantity. I agree with the extradition, aware that the Arson, which resulted in death, can accrue, according to American law, a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">But it is true that, on the other hand the law of the Requesting State talks about Murder in the First Degree: 1. A person is guilty of Murder in the First Degree when: (here we have many possibilities) c. He or she commits or attempts to commit the crime of either: (item IV) Arson in the First Degree, and in the course of or in furtherance of such crime or in immediate flight therefrom, he or she, or another participant, causes the death of a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">This is the picture I cannot see mirrored, in any way, in the narrative that the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office of Seattle itself has written.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">What I see is an impeccable hypothesis of Arson in the First Degree, according to American law, which fits, like a glove, Article 250 of our Criminal Law Code, combined with Par. 1, clause I and with Article 258, because the result was death.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Completely omitting the penalty issue, which varies greatly from country to country and keeping in mind that I do not place this restriction in relation to the length of the prison sentence, with all due respect, I am unable to see in the narrative, a crime other than Arson in the First Degree, which resulted in the death of four people. In the scene described herein we cannot speak of a case of Intentional Fire [arson] followed by death, added to four separate Murders in the First Degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">My vote grants the extradition, without any restriction whatsoever as to the possibility of a life sentence, only for the crime of Arson with its results, with all its consequences, according to American law; however, without the added charge of four counts of Murder in the First Degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">[Signature illegible]</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">12 /18 / 95 FULL SESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">EXTRADITION No. 654-1 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">VOTE</p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">THE HONORABLE JUSTICE MARCO AUR\u00c9LIO - Mr. President, as was well reported by the Honorable Justice N\u00e9ri da Silveira, the American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Government is asking us for the extradition of the person sought, following precise charges against him. He is being accused of having set fire to a commercial facility, maybe, who knows, to escape civil demise. Having acted in that manner, once the fire-fighters arrived at the scene, according to American law, he would have caused the death of four of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">In opening, Mister President, I see, just like you, Your Honor, that the Diplomatic Note contains a double heading, occurring from the same facts. The first, alluding to Arson in the First Degree, which, in itself once charged as a class \"A\u201d felony, in itself is enough to accrue a sentence of life in prison. The second, concerns the four other crimes of Murder in the First Degree. Therefore, there are five charges against the Person Sought for Extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Mr. President, the extradition, according to Law 6.815, of August 19, 1980, assumes the symmetry, and I take this legal precept to mean what it says. Article 77 decrees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-7\">Article 77 - Extradition will not be granted when the fact motivating the request is not considered a crime in Brazil or in the Requesting State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">The question is: Can we fit Murder in the First Degree on the heading of our Criminal Law Code, Article 121, Intentional Homicide?</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">In my opinion, as to symmetry, the vital dual criminality does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">The Honorable Justice Francisco Rezek underlined perfectly, with great acumen, that the facts in the narrative lead to the charges, according to the Criminal Law Code, Article 250:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-11\">... to cause a fire, exposing to risk of life, the physical integrity or the property of another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-12\">Penalty - confinement, from three to six years, . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">In considering the resulting \"death\u201d, there is the qualifying [clause] included in the first portion of Article 258, which says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-14\">... If serious bodily harm results from an intentional crime of common danger, the prison sentence is increased by half - the penalty of Article 250 - if it results in death, it is doubled. In the case of non-intentional [crime] [illegible] and then by lack of prudence, negligence and lack of skill - if bodily harm - as it relates to fire - results from the act, the penalty would be increased by half, if it results in death, the sentence imposed for Non-Intentional Homicide is increased by one third.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">Now, looking at the facts in the narrative, my opinion is that the case, from the point of view of dual criminality, taking into consideration Brazilian legislation, fits in the first portion of Article 258 of our Criminal Law Code. Therefore I agree, on this, with Justice Francisco Rezek.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">There is the issue of life sentence. The established jurisprudence of this Court, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>believe, unless I am mistaken, is to lay down conditions for granting the Extradition, when there is the risk of the Person Sought being sentenced to death. Therefore, we proceed with the utmost care in clause XLVII of the list of basic guarantees, as included in the Constitution, Article 5\u2019s \"caput\u201d, pertaining to foreign nationals living in Brazil. The question is: Is it possible to distinguish; is it possible to establish the application of the clause, obstructing certain procedure, if it implies in \"death\u201d, and not proceed in exactly the same way, when there is risk of a life sentence? What would be the basis for the divergence, if guarantees are placed in the same clause of Article 5?</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Article 5 is categorical, in clause XLVII:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-6\">XLVII - there will be no sentences:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-7\">a) of death, unless war has been declared, according to Article 84, XIX;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-8\">b) of life [in prison];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-9\">c) of forced labor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-10\">d) of exile;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-11\">e) of cruelty;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">I do not see how this Court\u2019s Jurisprudence can make a stand as to the restriction, concerning paragraph \"a\u201d and not continue in the same vein, since the basis is the same, as to paragraph \"b\u201d, concerning the impossibility of a life sentence, as it exists in American law.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">First, I am unable - and in this respect I am one of Justice Francisco Rezek\u2019s disciples - to place the Treaty above the Political Document of the Republic [Constitution]. I look at its content and I place the treaties at the same level as our ordinary laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">Second, concerning specific law, which some think it is demanded by constitutional rule, we do have that. Our Criminal Law Code states that no one will remain in prison for more than thirty years. Thus, the requirement defined in our jurisprudence is being echoed by the very Brazilian Criminal Law Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">Therefore, in this case, I remove the possibility for the Person sought for Extradition to answer for Murder in the First Degree - having in mind the material conflict, the four counts, the four Murders - and, further, I also exclude the possibility of [this person] receiving a life sentence, therefore establishing that he cannot remain under the State\u2019s custody for more than thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">I grant the Request [for Extradition] on these terms, therefore, partially.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-17\">[Signature illegible]</p>\n<p id=\"b944-18\">EXTRADITION No. 654-1 USA FULL SESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b944-19\">VOTE</p>\n<p id=\"b944-20\">JUSTICE CARLOS VELLOSO: Mr. President, in examining the request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>extradition, the Brazilian judge must verify if the mentioned criminal acts, according to the laws of the Requesting State, are also typical here, [dual criminality] i.e., if they equally conform, in object, to Brazilian Criminal Law. This is the task we must perform, as to the Request for Extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">In this [particular] case, according to what I was able to discern from the dehates, the description is as follows: The person sought caused a fire, which resulted in four deaths. Is that an objective act the same as in Brazilian Criminal law? I have no doubt, in this case, that the objective conduct described in Article 250 of the Penal Code took place in the qualified form described in Article 258 of the same Code. It seems to me that there is no way to escape that. In other words, you cannot have, according to Brazilian law, a crime of Arson and a crime of Murder independently. I cannot fail to exert this control, in view of the request for extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Therefore, I would like to apologize to the Assigned Justice, whose votes I have the habit of following to grant the extradition, exactly as it was done by Justice Francisco Rezek, concerning the crime of qualified Arson (Criminal Law Code, Article 250 with qualifying clauses from Article 258 - Arson followed <em>by </em>death).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Following I review the second issue in debate: The question of restricting a life sentence. In Extraditions Nos. 426 and 486, the Federal Supreme Court implicitly dispensed with the restriction. In Extradition No. 507 - Argentina, my vote was following that [same] jurisprudence. I do not know if we should alter a jurisprudence already stratified and ratified in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Therefore, with all due respect to the Honorable Justices who believe otherwise, especially Justice Mauricio Corr\u00e9a, who opened this debate, I vote in this case, with the Assigned Justice, except for the restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">I grant the extradition request.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">[Signature illegible]</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">12 /18 / 95</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">EXTRADITION No. 654-1 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">FULL SESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">VOTE CORRECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">THE HONORABLE JUSTICE MAUR\u00cdCIO CORREA - Mr. President, I examined the documentation, particularly from the point of view of a life sentence and I thought it would be prudent to explain my position after my first vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-16\">I confess that during the debates I was somewhat convinced that I should grant the extradition in its merit, except for the restriction, according to Justice N\u00e9ri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>da Silveira\u2019s vote. However, I see that this deals with an autonomous crime, and the Foreign National Law demands [the existence] of dual criminality in Brazil. Indeed, the request concerning this point does not specifically conform with Article 250, specially when combined with CC, Article 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Because of this, with all due respect to the Honorable Justice N\u00e9ri da Silveira I will follow the vote of Justice Francisco Rezek, only as it pertains to that, granting partial extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">[Signature illegible]</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">12 /18 / 95</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">EXTRADITION No. 654-1 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FULL SESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">VOTE</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">THE HONORABLE JUSTICE CELSO DE MELLO - The crimes that motivated this extradition request - Murder and Arson in the First Degree - are wrongful acts subject to a penal sanction constitutionally barred in our legal system (life sentence). Thus, the criminal acts in question within the legal system currently in use in the State of Washington, justify the legal possibility of imposing the penalty qualified by a life sentence on the extraditee.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">The issue now being raised by Justice Mauricio Corr\u00e9a assumes indisputable legal relevance, because it consists in defining the theme pertinent to the relationship between two regulation standards, within the emerging context of the present cause, - one, intimately joined in international treaties, and another based on constitutional statute - standard regulations that are clearly revealed as unmatched in degree of validity, efficacy and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">It is necessary to accentuate, in this respect, that the standard derived from international treaties, within the Brazilian legal system, allows the placement of these acts of public international law, in the hierarchy of sources, in the same plane and degree of efficacy given to internal laws of an infra-constitutional character.

The Constitution does not regulate extradition. And, when it restricts sentences of death and life in prison, it is obviously regulating what should happen within the Brazilian territory. Yet, it does not impede, nor can it impede that other nations have their own opposing rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">On the other hand, Brazilian law, which regulates extradition, is explicit in considering it inadmissible, when the requesting State prescribes the death penalty to a crime. Now, as to a life sentence it does not have any prohibition, whatsoever. Thus, I apply the Brazilian law which regulates extradition and which is not incompatible with our Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">As to the remainder, I believe the crime in question is a qualified form of a common danger crime, Fire-Setting, resulting in death. Therefore, the fact described is a crime in Brazil, and it is enough for me.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">Concerning classification, if it is a matter that enhances the penalty or if it is a separate crime, I believe that the issue must be resolved, according to the law of the Requesting State.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">It does not seem possible, for instance, that this Tribunal can deny an extradition, just because in Brazilian law there is a provision of trial by jury, according to the Federal Constitution, while in the requesting State the trial can be a bench trial or by jury, of a different nature and composition. Nor demand that, in this or that situation, the Requesting State has to concede \"sursis\u201d, shelter detention or house arrest, just because in our Law such measures exist, inspired by constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">I am not prepared to extend our competence that far, unless the Court\u2019s juris-, prudence changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Therefore, I grant the extradition in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah2S\">[Signature illegible]</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">12 /18 / 95</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">EXTRADITION No. 654-1 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FULL SESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">VOTE</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">THE HONORABLE JUSTICE MOREIRA ALVES: - Mr. President, in this case, keeping in mind the peculiarities described by the assigned Justice, it does not seem to me that they can be applied to the precedents invoked as to the issue of dual criminality raised in the requesting State.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Therefore, I follow The Honorable Assigned Justice, including as to the issue of a life sentence, observing in this manner our current jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">I grant the extradition in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">[Signature illegible]</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">12 /18 / 95</p>\n<p id=\"b949-14\">EXTRADITION No. 654-1 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FULL SESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">VOTE</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">THE HONORABLE JUSTICE SEPULVEDA PERTENCE (PRESIDENT): My vote, with the utmost respect to the Assigned Justice and all the others who voted with him, follows the Honorable Justice Mauricio Correa\u2019s vote, His Honor\u2019s corrected vote, that is.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-19\">Concerning the object of the extradition, I do not doubt this Court\u2019s power to restrict it in this case. The dual criminality decision, the most basic one, [and] one of the first tasks of this hearing\u2019s passive judgment, is applied to the fact described in the charge to which it answers, or to the sentence imposed on the person sought. Not on the coincidence of legal systems, taken in abstracts (v.g. Extr. 605, Celso de Mello).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-20\">\"What do we know about the case? Clearly, in the note requesting extradition, it says that, having committed the crime of Arson, during this fire, the collapsing of one of the slabs caused the death of four firemen. The case, to me, is typical of Arson, with the special enhancement clause - the resulting death, mentioned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>the Penal Code, Article 258. And, furthermore, it seemed to me during the discussion, that not even in American Law there would be the concurrence of Arson with Murder in the First Degree. It is much more than clear, that in American Law, Murder in the First Degree, in the event of Intentional Fire-Setting, presupposes that the agent kill someone to commit the Arson, or in escaping, after setting the fire. A typical case would be someone who wants to gain entry into a building to set a fire and kills the watchman; or, after setting the fire [the agent] kills the watchman who tries to arrest him, when he was leaving. Obviously, this is not the case, as described by the Requesting State in its Diplomatic Note, now the object of this extradition hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">But, I am not going to venture into the extremely delicate area - although [a matter over which] the passive extradition court has competence to verify dual criminality in the original State; the Brazilian Law is sufficient for me, where, besides Arson qualified by the resulting death, there can also be Arson concurrent Homicide; if Homicide is committed, according to Article 121, Par. 2, no. 5 \"to ensure the execution, cover-up, impunity or advantage of another crime\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">The other question - eligibility or not of the commutation of a life sentence - expected to be exciting, wasn\u2019t, because the Court\u2019s majority preferred to maintain its established jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">My position is known. I was overruled, and I reaffirm my opinion. I understand that we must demand commutation of penalties forbidden by the Constitution in Brazil. I am not going to debate the entire issue over again, but I understand that the problem does not conform with the other constitutional guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">An extradition is an international cooperation for penal suppression and, according to me, the imposition of penalties that were found to be offensive to human dignity or to the very function of the penalty as conceived by the Constitution, which for this reason, clearly forbade it, must be excluded from this cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">Therefore, agreeing with the votes of the Honorable Justices Mauricio Corr\u00e9a, Marco Aur\u00e9lio and Celso de Mello, I also would demand the commutation of the penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">[Signature illegible]</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">\n<em>Opinion Appendix \"B\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b950-12\"><em>Treaty of Extradition Between the United States of America and the United States of </em>Brazil<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">The United States of America and the United States of Brazil, desiring to make more effective the cooperation of their respective countries in the repres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>sion of crime, have resolved to conclude a treaty of extradition and for this purpose have appointed the following Plenipotentiaries:</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The President of the United States of America: His Excellency John Moors Cabot, Ambassador of the United States of America to Brazil, and</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The President of the United States of Brazil: His Excellency Horacio Lafer, Minister of State for External Relations,</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Who, having communicated to each other their respective full powers, found to be in good and due form, agree as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Article I</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">Each Contracting State agrees, under the conditions established by the present Treaty and each in accordance with the legal formalities in force in its own country, to deliver up, reciprocally, persons found in its territory who have been charged with or convicted of any of the crimes or offenses specified in Article II of the present Treaty and committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the other, or outside thereof under the conditions specified in Article IV of the present Treaty: provided that such surrender shall take place only upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall he found, would justify his commitment for trial if the crime or offense had been there committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Article II</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Persons shall be delivered up according to the provisions of the present Treaty for prosecution when they have been charged with, or to undergo sentence when they have been convicted of, any of the following crimes or offenses:</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">1.
