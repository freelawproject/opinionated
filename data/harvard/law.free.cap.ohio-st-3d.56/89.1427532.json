Respondent asked for and received a thirty-day extension to file his objections to the recommendation and a brief in support. On May 2, 1990, respondent filed an \u201cObjection to Order to Show Cause,\u201d maintaining that he had not received notice adequately delineating his responsibility to file an answer to the complaint or object to the motion for default judgment and that he has a right to a hearing. However, respondent does not have a right to a hearing without first filing an answer to the original complaint. Furthermore, respondent had a second opportunity to be heard when he received notice of the motion for default judgment. Respondent\u2019s argument is without merit. Therefore, we hereby indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law. Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
