Appellant submits that the only condition allowed is \u201c[hjerniated nucleus pulposes L5-S1 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>right.\u201d Since the medical reports consistently referred to \u201clumbar strain\u201d and \u201clow back pain\u201d with respect to claimant\u2019s condition, appellant argues that claimant\u2019s condition is not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\">In our view, the commission did not abuse its discretion in refusing to hear appellant\u2019s appeal and, thus, we uphold the granting of temporary total compensation to claimant, because there was \u201csome evidence\u201d to support such a decision. See <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">A review of the record indicates that the commission was apparently satisfied that claimant\u2019s condition was basically the same condition that had been previously compensated. As we stated in <em>Burley, supra, </em>at 20, 31 OBR at 72, 508 N.E. 2d at 938:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u201c* * * [T]he party which challenges the Industrial Commission\u2019s determination as to the extent of disability bears the burden of demonstrating that the commission\u2019s determination manifests an abuse of discretion and, in this context, abuse of discretion has been repeatedly defined as a showing that the commission\u2019s decision was rendered without some evidence to support it. <em>State, ex rel. Elliott, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 76, 79, 26 OBR 66, 68, 497 N.E. 2d 70, 72; <em>State, ex rel. Milburn, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 119, 121, 26 OBR 102, 103, 498 N.E. 2d 440, 441; <em>State, ex rel. Rouch, </em>v. <em>Eagle Tool &amp; Machine Co., supra </em>[(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 197], at 198, 26 OBR [289] at 290, 498 N.E. 2d [464] at 466.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Since the medical reports of Dr. Matrka do indeed appear to constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s decision, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 denial of appellant\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b131-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Douglas, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b131-10\">Holmes and Wright, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b131-11\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnR\">dissenting. I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s finding that there was \u201csome evidence\u201d in the record to support the Industrial Commission\u2019s awarding the claimant, King, temporary total disability compensation and that therefore the court of appeals was correct to deny the employer\u2019s application for a writ of mandamus. Because I believe there was simply no evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s awarding temporary total disability compensation to King for the time period covering September 30, 1986 until June 10, 1987, and because the employer has effectively been denied an adequate remedy at law, I would grant the employer\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus and reverse the commission\u2019s finding that King was entitled to temporary total disability compensation for the above time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">On February 4, 1987, the Columbus Regional Board of Review heard the employer\u2019s appeal and issued its order \u201c* * * based on the employers\u2019 [sic] Appeal, evidence in the file and/or evidence adduced at the hearing * * Contained within King\u2019s file at that time were medical reports from the three physicians who had examined him during the pendency of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">Dr. Paul J. Matrka, King\u2019s attending physician, noted on the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation Physician\u2019s Report Supplemental form that King\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>\u201c[l]umbar strain/low back pain\u201d represented a \u201cchronic condition,\u201d after he had examined King on April 28, 1986. This form was dated May 5, 1986 and was duly filed with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Dr. R. B. Larrick, a physician whom the employer had requested to examine King, conducted an examination and in a September 16, 1986 report concluded: \u201cUnquestionably Mr. King has achieved maximum medical recovery which by objective evaluation has been complete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Dr. Robert Turner, an Industrial Commission specialist who was appointed to examine King pursuant to the district hearing officer\u2019s July 8, 1986 order, stated in his Specialist Report to the commission: \u201c* * * I think it safe to say at this point in time that the condition is permanent. The man is not going to improve without a change in treatment and I see no change in treatment that is available. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The record then clearly indicates that <em>all </em>of these physicians agreed that King\u2019s condition had either become permanent or had completely cleared up by September 30, 1986, the date upon which Dr. Turner conducted the physicians\u2019 last examination of King. Although Dr. Matrka refers to King\u2019s condition as \u201cchronic,\u201d the repeated use of this term over a number of years of treatment clearly demonstrates that the condition was, in reality, permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The commission is charged with knowledge of the contents of an applicant\u2019s file and indeed expressly stated that it relied on those contents as a basis for its determination. It is settled that where there is no evidence upon which the commission could base its factual conclusions, then an abuse of discretion is present and mandamus will lie. <em>State, ex rel. Paragon, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 72, 74, 5 OBR 127, 128, 448 N.E. 2d 1372, 1374, citing <em>State, ex rel. Kramer, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St. 2d 39, 42, 13 O.O. 3d 30, 31, 391 N.E. 2d 1015, 1017. Since neither the physicians\u2019 reports nor any other evidence in King\u2019s file constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d upon which the commission could base its conclusion that King was only temporarily disabled, I believe the commission abused its discretion by affirming the hearing officer\u2019s award of temporary total disability compensation for the time period covering September 30, 1986, the date of King\u2019s last physical examination, to June 10, 1987, the date when the district hearing officer finally terminated King\u2019s temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">I also believe the employer has been denied an adequate remedy at law, because the Industrial Commission\u2019s hearing officer refused to hear the employer\u2019s duly filed appeal. This refusal comes in the face of the Columbus Regional Board of Review\u2019s failure to terminate King\u2019s temporary total disability compensation where there was no evidence in the record to support such a continuation. I believe the denial of an appeal under such circumstances is an abuse of discretion. Additionally, because the employer had duly filed its appeal from the board of review\u2019s decision, the employer could reasonably conclude that it would have been useless<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>from the hearing officer\u2019s later decision at the reset hearing, since all of the evidence available at the reset hearing was also available to the board of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Because there was no evidence in the record to support the board of review\u2019s determination and because the Industrial Commission has denied the employer an adequate remedy at law, I would grant the employer\u2019s application for a writ of mandamus and deny King temporary total disability compensation for disability occurring after September 30, 1986.</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-6\">Holmes, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\"> The purpose of a reset hearing is to consider new evidence and new developments. In the case before us, all of the evidence available to the hearing officer at the reset hearing had already been placed in King\u2019s file to be examined by the Columbus Regional Board of Review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
