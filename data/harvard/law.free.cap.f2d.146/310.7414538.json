It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-24\">\u201c5. A flexible tubular structure comprising an inner tube of rubber, a surrounding sleeve of braided glass fibers, and an external coating of a chlorinated vinyl polymer penetrating through the interstices of said sleeve and individually coating the fibers thereof and cushioning them against mutual severing contact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-25\">The references are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-26\">Schnabel, 2,053,112, September 1, 1936;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-27\">Miller, 2,211,147, August 13, 1940;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-28\">Farrar et al., 2,256,386, September 16, 1941 ;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-29\">Vohrer, 2,257,355, September 30, 1941.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-30\">As appears from quoted claim 5, appellant\u2019s structure comprises an inner tube of rubber, a surrounding sleeve of braided glass fibers, and an external coating of a chlorinated vinyl polymer which penetrates through the interstices of the glass sleeve and coats the glass fibers, thereby cushioning them against \u201cmutual severing contact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The chlorinated vinyl polymer is a flexible plastic material, which, according to appellant\u2019s specification, penetrates the interstices of the glass sleeve to the extent that the sleeve is completely embedded in the plastic material, thereby preventing the glass fibers rubbing together during flexing of the tube.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Claim 5 differs from claims 2 and 4 in that it calls for an external coating of \u201ca chlorinated vinyl polymer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Claim 4 calls for an external coating of a \u201cvinyl polymer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Claim 2 is broader than claims 4 and 5 in that it calls for an external coating of a \u201cflexible plastic\u201d material.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Claims 2 and 4 were rejected by the tribunals of the Patent Office on the patent to Schnabel in view of the patents to Miller and Farrar et ah, and claim 5 was rejected on the patent to Schnabel in view of the patents to Miller, Farrar et ah, and Vohrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The patent to Schnabel relates to a flexible hose or tube, and discloses, among other forms, one comprising two layers of fabric. In this form, one layer of fabric is on the outside and the other layer is \u201cwithin,\u201d as stated in the patent, a' wall \u201cmade of polyvinylic alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">In his statement to the board, the Primary Examiner referred to figure 3 of the Schnabel patent and stated that it \u201cshows a bose having an inner tube of poly-vinylic alcohol * * *, a layer of textile fabric * * *, and a second layer of polyvinylic alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">In the disclosure in figure 3, the hose, as explained in the patentee\u2019s specification, is composed of two layers of fabric. One layer being on the outside and the other \u201cwithin\u201d an inner wall made of polyvinylic alcohol. Accordingly, the patentee\u2019s hose may be considered as having either two or four layers of material, depending upon the construction placed upon his explanation of figure 3. If the hose is considered as being composed of two layers, the inner layer of fabric would be impregnated with the polyvinylic alcohol and become a part thereof, and the outer wall would be a fabric material. If it is considered as being composed of four layers, the inner layer would he polyvinylic alcohol, the next would be a fabric material, the next would be another layer of polyvinylic alcohol, and the outer layer or covering would be a fabric material.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-12\">So far as the issues here are concerned, it is immaterial which of the two constructions is placed upon that disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">In example 4 of the Schnabel patent it is stated that the flexible hose may be produced \u201cby applying a layer of polyvinylic alcohol on fabric or working it into the material, after which the hose is provided with a covering of simple fabric or an impregnated fabric.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-14\">The patent to Miller relates to a flexible hose, and was cited because it discloses an inner layer or tube composed of \u201cNeoprene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-15\">The Primary Examiner stated that counsel for appellant conceded that the \u201cNeoprene\u201d disclosed in the Miller patent was the equivalent of rubber. That statement is not challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-16\">It appears from appellant\u2019s application that a flexible hose usually comprises an inner layer of rubber or synthetic rubber, an intermediate tube of braided fabric, and an outside covering of thin rubberized fabric.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-17\">The patent to Farrar et al. relates to a flexible hose, and discloses the use of fabricated glass either woven or braided into cloth or tape as one or more of the layers or sleeves in a flexible tube construction. The patent also discloses the use of fibered or spun glass in the form of thread twisted into yarn. The patentee states that the fabricated spun glass <em>cloth </em>or <em>tape </em>is \u201cspirally wound to form a substantially continuous wall structure, or the <em>glass thread or yarn </em>may be directly woven upon the lacquer wall\u201d in such manner that it will not be impregnated with the lacquer (italics ours) ; that the air spaces between the glass fibers serve to increase the insulating properties of the fabricated glass; and that \u201ceven when the glass fabric is applied to the lacquer wall while the lacquer is in plastic or semi-fluid condition the glass fabric will not be impregnated with the lacquer to any substantial degree.\u201d The patentee also discloses another embodiment of his invention, illustrated in figure 2. In that embodiment, a cord of \u201cfabricated glass is provided as a packing for the convolutions of the metal core,\u201d and the patentee states that <em>\"If desired, it </em>[the cord] <em>can be impregnated with a sealing substance to fill the voids or spaces between the glass fibers whereby to form a more effective seal.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.) Nothing is said in the patent about impregnating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>either of the patentee\u2019s other layers of fabricated glass cloth or tape with a sealing material.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The patent to Vohrer relates to flexible tubes or hose, and was cited because it discloses the use of \u201ca chlorinated vinyl polymer,\u201d as called for by appealed claim 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The tribunals of the Patent Office held that in view of the disclosure in the Farrar et al. patent and the disclosures in the Schnabel and Miller patents it would not involve invention to employ, as does appellant, an external coating of flexible plastic material and impregnate the sleeve of braided glass fibers so as to prevent the fibers rubbing together.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">It is contended here by counsel for appellant that the disclosure in the Farrar et al. patent of impregnating the fabricated glass cord in order to form a more effective seal does not suggest that a sleeve of braided glass fibers might be impregnated with an outer coating of a plastic material, as called for by the appealed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Each of the tribunals of the Patent Office disagreed with that argument of counsel, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">In view of the teaching in the Farrar et al. patent of impregnating a cord of spun glass, we think it would be obvious to one skilled in the art that a cloth or tape of spun glass could be impregnated with a plastic material, such as called for by the appealed claims, so as to prevent the glass fibers rubbing together.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that the claims here on appeal are not patentable over the references of record, and that the tribunals of the Patent Office reached the right conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
