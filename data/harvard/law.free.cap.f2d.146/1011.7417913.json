The drawing of that involved in appeal No. 4935 consists of the hyphenated word \u201cMid-West\u201d only, while that in appeal No. 4936 consists of that word shown above a representation of some animal (possibly a beaver, or perhaps a wolverene) which is referred to in the decision of the commissioner as \u201ca relatively insignificant design.\u201d It is noted that the specimens, supposed to show the style of the marks as actually used, filed in both cases, include the design referred to. The goods named in the respective cases are identical \u2014 \u201cCoated Abrasive Papers and Cloths, and Abrasive Stones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-26\">Appellant places no stress whatever upon the design, and the controversy in both cases is confined strictly to the word, \u201cMid-West.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-27\">The decisions of the Commissioner of Patents were rendered on the same day (May 5, 1943) in substantially identical phraseology (see 57 USPQ 328) and we here quote that rendered in (our) appeal No. 4935 in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-28\">\u201cThis is an appeal from the refusal of the Examiner of Trade-Marks to grant applicant registration of the mark \u2018Mid-West\u2019 for coated abrasive papers and cloths and abrasive, stones, on the ground that he considers the word \u2018Mid-West\u2019 is geographical in view of my decision in Ex parte Western Stove Co., Inc., 538 O.G. 751, 163 Ms. D. 919, 53 U.S.P.Q. 316.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-29\">\u201cThat case involved the mark \u2018Western Holly\u2019. Holly is a tree or shrub and the adjective \u2018Western\u2019 designates the species whose geographical distribution is west of the Mississippi and disclaimer of the word \u2018Western\u2019 of the mark \u2018Western Holly\u2019 was required on the ground that as\u2019 used in the mark the word \u2018Western\u2019 was geographical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-30\">\u201cIn the present case the mark consists of the word \u2018Mid-West\u2019 alone. According to Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, a definition of the word Mid-West (Middle West) is as follows: \u2018That part of the United States occupying the northern half of the Mississippi River basin; roughly, the section extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Alleghenies, north of the Ohio River and the southern boundaries of Missouri and Kansas; the North Central States.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>\u201cThis is the predominant meaning of the word in the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-4\">\u201cApplicant calls attention to Champion Spark Plug Company v. Globe-Union Manufacturing Company, 88 F.2d 970 [972], 24 C.C.P.A. 1088, 484 O.G. 742, in which the word \u2018Globe\u2019 was held to be not merely geographical. However in that case Judge Garrett stated with respect to the word \u2018Globe\u2019 as follows: \u2018 * * * it identifies no particular geographical location, nor is its proper use as a trademark likely to interfere with or embarrass any public or private right.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-6\">\u201cThe same cannot be said with regard to the word \u2018Mid-West.\u2019 This word not only identifies a geographical location with considerable particularity but also every one has the right to use the word for purposes of geographical designation and registration of the mark for any specific goods would tend to interfere with or em-barass the\u2019rights of others to the free use of the word in connection with products identified with the mid-west.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-7\">\u201cThe above-stated geographical meaning of the word \u2018Mid-West\u2019 is at least so predominant over any other meaning the word may have that in my opinion the word must be considered to be merely geographical and therefore its registration under the Act of February 20, 1905 is prohibited by section 5 of that Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-8\">\u201cThe refusal of the Examiner of TradeMarks to grant the registration for which applicant has applied is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">It is thus to be seen that appellant\u2019s applications were denied solely upon the ground that the word \u201cMid-West\u201d is merely a geographical name or term, the only authority cited being the definition given in the second (1935) edition of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-10\">Section 5, subsection (b), third proviso, of the Trade-Mark Registration Act of February 20, 1905, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85(b), provides that no mark which consists of \u201cmerely a geographical name or term, shall be registered under the terms of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-11\">So far ks we are able to determine, this particular provision was embraced in the act at the time of its passage and has remained unaffected by any subsequent amendment. This we say because it is evident that the decisions in the cases before us are contrary to the long continued practice of the Patent Office relative to registration of the term \u201cMid-West,\u201d except as that practice may have been modified by implication in the case of Western Stove Co., Inc., referred to in the commissioner\u2019s decision, 53 USPQ 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-13\">The brief on behalf of appellant states: \u201cInsofar as we can ascertain, the Patent Office in the past has never denied registration of the term \u2018mid west\u2019 on the ground that it is geographical; Nor can we find any case where a Court held the <em>term </em>\u2018mid west\u2019 geographical, and thus not a valid trade mark. On the contrary, the Patent Office has granted in excess of 25 registrations in which the term \u2018Mid West\u2019 is the sole or dominating part of the mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-14\">A list of the registrations so alluded to was brought to the attention of the commissioner in the brief of appellant before him (made a part of the appeal record here) and is repeated in its brief before us. The commissioner made no allusion to such prior registrations, nor to the prior Patent Office practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-15\">So far as the record shows, the earliest registration of the term under the 1905 act (there was one in 1902 before passage of the 1905 act) was granted November 19, 1912 (registration No. 89,194), for use as a trade-mark on \u201cSteel Wool Journal &amp; Machinery.\u201d The lastest was granted under date of September 20, 1938 (registration No. 360,487), fpr use on \u201cElectric Locomotives.\u201d The many registrations between those dates were for use on various types of goods, descriptions of which are unnecessary in view of the issue here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-16\">It must be assumed that for more than a quarter of a century (1912 to 1938) the term \u201cMid-West\u201d (or its equivalent, \u201cMiddle West\u201d) was not regarded by the commissioners of patents as being \u201cmerely a geographical name or term\u201d; otherwise, its registration would not have been so frequently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-17\">Appellant contends that \u201cMid-West\u201d is not geographical; that \u201clisting\u201d it in a dictionary cannot make it geographical; that it has never before been denied registration on the ground that it is geographical; that if the commissioner\u2019s' decision in these cases is correct the many prior registrations of the term are invalid and should never have been granted, and that doubt will be cast upon the validity of many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>other registrations embracing terms such as \u201cWestern,\u201d \u201cNorthern,\u201d \u201cEastern,\u201d \u201cSouthern,\u201d \u201cNor\u2019-East,\u201d \u201cNorth,\u201d \u201cDeep South,\u201d and Various others containing words having geographical suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">The brief for appellant states, in substance, that it is difficult, if not impossible, to find a case exactly in point because neither the registrability nor the validity of marks such as \u201cMid-West,\u201d \u201cWestern,\u201d etc., has ever been raised (except to the extent that \u201cWestern\u201d was involved in the ex parte cases of Western Stove Co., Inc., supra.) and Western Supply Co., 58 USPQ 489, the latter decided by the commissioner July 14, 1943, subsequent to his decisions in the instant cases. It is insisted by appellant that the decision in the latter case \u201csubstantially modifies\u201d the decision in the former case and in the instant cases \u201cas to his interpretation of the word \u2018geographical\u2019 as it appears in the Trade Mark Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Appellant, however, cites decisions in the cases of Champion Spark Plug Co. v. Globe-Union Mfg. Co., 88 F.2d 970, 24 C.C.P.A. 1088, 33 USPQ 207 (discussed in the decision of the commissioner, supra), in which we held that the word \u201cGlobe\u201d is not merely a geographical name or term; Hamilton Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers &amp; Co., 240 U.S. 251, 36 S.Ct. 269, 60 L.Ed. 629, in which the Supreme Court held the words \u201cThe American Girl,\u201d as applied to women\u2019s shoes not to be a geographical or descriptive term; Southeastern Brewing Co. v. Blackwell, 80 F.2d 607, 609, in which the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit held that the words \u201cOld South\u201d or \u201cOld South Brew\u201d \u201c * * * do not constitute a term that is geographical or descriptive * * and Century Distilling Co. v. Continental Distilling Corporation, 38 USPQ 105, in which the United States District Court (E. D. Pennsylvania) upheld the validity of the word \u201cDixie\u201d as a trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">The brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office cites no cases but discusses some of the decisions cited by appellant. It may be added that the brief makes no reference to any definition of the term except that from Webster quoted in the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">In passing upon the registrability of a claimed trade-mark we do not consider the validity or invalidity of prior registrations of the same marks. No citation of authorities is necessary in support of this well established and long followed rule. No reason is found for making any exception to it here. Should a case involving prior registration of the term come before us it will be considered, in the light of the statute, upon the facts disclosed by the record in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-11\">We have not been able to ascertain when \u201cMid-West\u201d became a term of common usage, but it is certain that it had become such at the time the applications here involved were filed and that it then had, and now has, nothing other than a geographical significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">The definition quoted by the commissioner from Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary appeared in the 1935 edition of that work. It was repeated in the 1939 edition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-13\">There are other defining and describing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-14\">In the 1942 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica \u201cMiddle West\u201d is defined as \u201cthe northern portion of the central United States and more specifically the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-15\">The Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles, 1942, Vol. 3, defines the term as follows: \u201cNorth central portion of the United States embracing approximately the area north of the Ohio River and its latitude from the Rocky Mountains to the Alleghenies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-16\">American Red Cross, for its work, maps the United States by areas. As shown on its map of February 27, 1943, in the Division of Maps, Library of Congress, there is a \u201cMidwestern Area\u201d which includes several states, some of them east and some of them west of the Mississippi River.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-17\">A map of American Sociological Society in the Division of Maps, Library of Congress, shows a \u201cMidwest Society\u201d covering numerous states, some of them east and some of them west of the Mississippi River.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-18\">It is clear that \u201cMid-West\u201d is a geographical term, relating to an area within the United States, which area has no definite boundaries. There is no \u201cofficial\u201d or statutory designation of the area and so, strictly speaking, it is not a legally recognized name, but in common usage it is a term which has no meaning or significance other than geographical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>Therefore, we feel constrained to agree with the commissioner\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">For the purpose of formal judgment we treat the cases as being consolidated, and, in both appeals, 4935 and 4936, the decisions of the commissioner ar\u00e9 affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
