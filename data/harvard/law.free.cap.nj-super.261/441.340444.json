On the morning of October 23, 1991, the assistant prosecutor- assigned to the case advised the court that her office was having difficulty locating the victim of the alleged attempted burglary. The prosecutor told the court that police officers had been sent to the victim\u2019s home but that she was not there, and that a prosecutor\u2019s representative had called her place of employment but that she was not there either. The prosecutor also stated that there were no reports of automobile accidents or hospital admissions which might explain the witness\u2019s absence. The prosecutor then requested the court to continue the trial for one day so that the whereabouts of this victim could be determined. However, the court denied the prosecutor\u2019s application. At 10:35 a.m. the court discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the jury and declared a mistrial. Defendant preserved his right to make an appropriate motion regarding the declaration of a mistrial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Defendant made a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that a retrial was barred by double jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion. We granted defendant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. V. The New Jersey Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall, after acquittal, be tried for the same offense.\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. 1, \u00b6 11. The protection against double jeopardy provided by these federal and state constitutional provisions \u201chave been held coextensive in application.\u201d <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>395, 404, 360 <em>A.2d </em>362 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>It is firmly established that jeopardy attaches when a jury is selected and sworn. <em>Crist v. Bretz, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>28, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978); <em>State v. Lynch, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>327, 341, 399 A.2d 629 (1979). Therefore, if the court declares a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent after a jury is sworn, a retrial is barred by double jeopardy unless there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial or the \u201cends of public justice\u201d would be defeated by an acquittal. <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>600, 606-07, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1075, 1079, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>267, 273 (1976); <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 405, 360 A.2d 362. \u201cThe underlying hypothesis\u201d of this rule is that \u201cthe trial once started should proceed to its conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406, 360 A.2d 362. A trial court\u2019s failure to consider less drastic alternatives than the declaration of a mistrial is one circumstance which has led reviewing courts to conclude that there was an absence of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jorn, </em>400 <em>U.S. </em>470, 485-87, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>547, 557-58, 27 L.Ed.2d 543, 557-58 (1971); <em>United States v. Bates, </em>917 <em>F.2d </em>388, 396 (9th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. McKoy, </em>591 <em>F.2d </em>218, 222 (3d Cir.1979); <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 415, 360 A.2d 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Although the sudden serious illness or unexpected disappearance of a critical witness could create a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the declaration of a mistrial which would allow the State to retry a defendant, <em>see State v. Modell, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 244, 615 A.2d 1264 (App.Div.1992), the temporary absence of a witness is an insufficient basis. <em>See Downum v. United States, </em>372 <em>U.S. </em>734, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1033, 10 L.Ed.2d 100 (1963); <em>Mizell v. Attorney General of New York, </em>586 <em>F.2d </em>942 (2d Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 <em>U.S. </em>967, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1519, 59 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>783 (1979); <em>State v. Stani, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>146, 484 A.2d 341 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Thus, in <em>State v. Stani, supra, </em>the victim of the alleged offense, who apparently was disinclined to cooperate with the State for personal reasons, failed to respond to a subpoena. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Defense counsel acceded to the court\u2019s request to move for a mistrial, which the court then granted. We held that the empaneling of a new jury and retrial of defendant under these circumstances was barred by double jeopardy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">The State could not produce the victim of and the only witness to the alleged robbery to testify and could not prove a <em>prima facie </em>case with only the testimony of the one available witness, a detective. The defendant had been placed in jeopardy and he did nothing to spark the mistrial or dismissal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">If there be any essence to the doctrine of jeopardy, it must be that the State may not retreat from the field when its case turns sour and then be permitted to sally forth on a future day before a new jury when its case is refreshed and reinforced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 150-51, 484 <em>A.2d </em>341.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Similarly, in <em>Mizell v. Attorney General of New York, supra, </em>one prosecution witness left the State subsequent to the empaneling of a jury due to the death of a family member and another simply failed to appear in court. The prosecutor requested a continuance of the trial. However, the trial court denied that request and declared a mistrial <em>sua sponte. </em>A new jury was subsequently empaneled and defendant was convicted. Based on these facts, the federal district court held that the defendant\u2019s rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause had been violated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">There was no indication that either of the two witnesses would be unavailable by Monday. In fact, the request would indicate that the State could reasonably predict their attendance at that time. ... The only reason given by the court for the failure to grant a continuance was the convenience of the jury. The jury, however, had not been sequestered and a continuance would not have required them to serve beyond their appointed term. This fact is of special significance since \u201c[t]he discretion to discharge the jury before it has reached a verdict is to be exercised \u2018only in very extraordinary and striking circumstances\u2019....\u201d <em>Downum v. United States, supra, </em>372 <em>U.S. </em>at 736, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1034, quoting <em>United States v. Coolidge, </em>25 Fed.Cas. No. 14,858, pp. 622, 623 (Cir.Ct.D.Mass.1815). Under these circumstances neither the \u201cends of public justice\u201d nor \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d required a mistrial. A continuance should have been granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABi\">[586 <em>F.2d </em>at 947].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">There was a similar absence in this case of the kind of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d which could justify the declaration of a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent. The court took this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>drastic action solely because an important prosecution witness failed to appear within the first hour and a half of the court day. The court was given no reason to believe that this witness was seriously ill or that her absence was more than temporary. Therefore, the court should have anticipated that the witness could be produced if the State\u2019s motion for a brief continuance were granted. Alternatively, the court could have insisted that the State proceed with the remainder of its case. We note in this connection that the State\u2019s proof of the charge of aggravated assault upon a law enforcement officer was not in any way dependent upon the testimony of the missing witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Finally, we reject the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant acquiesced in the declaration of a mistrial. To the contrary, when the court declared a mistrial <em>sua sponte, </em>defendant expressly reserved his right to move for a dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the court\u2019s order denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges against him and remand for entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> The only record of the proceedings on October 23, 1991 is a two-page transcript reflecting the court\u2019s summary discharge of the jury and <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial. The facts described in this opinion are taken primarily from the briefs filed in connection with defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. It appears from those briefs that the assistant prosecutor advised the court in chambers that she was having difficulty locating the victim of the attempted burglary. However, the trial court did not require the assistant prosecutor to present evidence or even to make representations on the record regarding the efforts of the prosecutor\u2019s office to locate this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\"><em>Rule </em>1:2-1 requires all trials, hearings of motions and other applications to be conducted in open court, and <em>Rule </em>1:2-2 requires those proceedings to be recorded verbatim. In those unusual circumstances where a matter of substance relating to a trial or motion is discussed in chambers off the record, the full record of those discussions must be placed on the record. <em>Fehnel v. Fehnel, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 217, 452 A.2d 209 (App.Div.1982). Therefore, if a trial court conceives that difficulty in locating a witness may require the declaration of a mistrial or other remedial measure, the court should require a complete record of the relevant facts to be placed on the record before it acts. The trial court failed to properly discharge this responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
