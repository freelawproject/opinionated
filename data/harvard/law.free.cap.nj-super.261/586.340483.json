Mr. Tozzo was seriously injured and Mrs. Tozzo died as the result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">At the time of the collision, Mr. Santiago was employed by the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency. The automobile he was driving was owned by the federal government, but he was not using it on government business. The government denied liability. Mr. Santiago is said to have no personal liability insurance and no significant assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">Mr. Tozzo filed a personal injury action in federal court against the United States and a declaratory judgment action in the New Jersey Superior Court against his automobile insurer, defendant Universal Underwriters Insurance Company. In the federal action he sought damages for his own personal injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>and for his wife\u2019s death, and in the state action, indemnification under the uninsured motorist coverage of his automobile insurance policy. Universal Underwriters intervened in the federal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Mr. Tozzo\u2019s policy afforded him the coverage required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1. The statute provides for payment to the insured of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">all or part of the sums which the insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the operator or owner of an <em>uninsured motor vehicle ... </em>because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such <em>uninsured ... motor </em>vehicle....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(a) (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">However, \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d is defined so that it <em>excludes </em>a \u201cmotor vehicle which is owned by the United States or Canada or a state, political subdivision or agency of those governments or any of the foregoing....\" <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(e)(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Universal Underwriters denied coverage on the ground that the tortfeasor was not driving an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d because his automobile was owned by the United States. Mr. Tozzo moved for summary judgment. Judge Peter B. Cooper granted his motion and ordered Universal Underwriters to submit his uninsured motorist claim to arbitration, but provided that the insurer would \u201chave no obligation to pay ... the amount awarded at arbitration until a reasonable time after the judicial resolution of the [personal injury] case now pending in Federal Court____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">Mr. Tozzo appealed from the provision of the order deferring payment until disposition of the suit against the United States. Universal Underwriters cross-appealed from the ruling that its insured was entitled to recover under his uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\"> The primary rule for construing a statute is to read it so as to effectuate the probable purpose with which it was enacted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>A thing which is within the object, spirit and meaning of the statute is as much within the statute as if it were within the letter. Conversely, a thing which is not within the intent and spirit of a statute is not within the statute, though within the letter. When the general intent is found, general words may be restrained accordingly, and those of a narrower significance expanded to effectuate that intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\"><em>[Glick v. Trustees of Free Public Library, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>579, 584, 67 A.2d 463 (1949) (Citation omitted.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The New Jersey legislature had two purposes for requiring uninsured motorist coverage in every automobile liability policy insuring an automobile registered or principally garaged in New Jersey. The first purpose was to reduce the amount of claims against the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-61 <em>et seq.; Motor Club of America Ins. Co. v. Phillips, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>277, 293, 330 A.2d 360 (1974). The second was to protect persons injured in motor vehicle accidents from being unable to obtain compensation because their tortfeasors were uninsured, financially irresponsible drivers. <em>Fernandez v. Selected Risks Ins. Co., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>236, 240, 412 A.2d 755 (1980); <em>Gorton v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>563, 571, 391 A.2d 1219 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Mr. Tozzo was insured under a policy which included uninsured motorist coverage. His ownership of that policy disqualified him from obtaining any recovery from the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-62 (defining \u201cqualified person\u201d to exclude an insured under a policy providing uninsured motorist coverage). If we were to hold that Mr. Tozzo is not entitled to recover from his own insurer under his uninsured motorist coverage because his tortfeasor was driving a car owned by the United States, we would be making <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(a) irrelevant to preserving the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund and inimical to its purpose of protecting injured motorists, and we would be adopting a construction of his insurance policy which would be contrary to his reasonable expectations as an insured. If indemnification is not available, the effect of the statute requiring him to purchase uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>motorist coverage will have been to cost him premiums and to make him ineligible for redress from the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund. Consequently, we agree with Judge Cooper that to effectuate the purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1, the statutory exclusion of \u201ca motor vehicle ... owned by the United States\u201d from the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d should be understood to refer to a motor vehicle owned by the United States only in a case in which the United States has not denied that it would be vicariously liable for damages which have resulted from the driver\u2019s tort.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We also hold that arbitration and payment of any arbitration award should not be stayed until disposition of Mr. Tozzo\u2019s action against the United States. In the insurance policy which it issued to its insured, Universal Underwriters agreed to \u201cpay the sums the INSURED is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of an UNINSURED MOTOR VEHICLE.\u201d The arbitration provision of the uninsured motorist coverage reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">If WE and an INSURED can\u2019t agree whether the INSURED is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or driver of an UNINSURED MOTOR VEHICLE or do not agree as to the amount of damages, either party may make a written demand for arbitration. In this event, each party will select an arbitrator. The two arbitrators will select a third arbitrator. If they cannot agree within 30 days, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">There is nothing in these provisions which should lead to the deferral of arbitration or of payment of any award. <em>Travelers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Indemnity Company v. Mongiovi, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 459, 343 A.2d 750 (App.Div.1975); <em>N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co. v. Haran, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 319 A.2d 768 (App.Div.1974); <em>see Parks v. Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>42, 51, 484 A.2d 4 (1984). If Mr. Tozzo should prevail in his federal court suit against the United States, Universal Underwriters will be subrogated to his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">We therefore hold that the car Mr. Santiago was driving is not excluded from the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d in Mr. Tozzo\u2019s policy and in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1(e)(2)(c) merely because it was owned by the United States. Universal Underwriters is therefore obligated to submit Mr. Tozzo\u2019s claim to arbitration, and the pendency of the personal injury action in federal court does not entitle Universal Underwriters to defer payment of any arbitration award until that action has been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The case is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.1e(2)(b) defines \"uninsured motor vehicle\u201d to include \u201ca motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, maintenance, or use of which there is bodily injury liability insurance in existence but the liability insurer <em>denies </em>coverage....\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>See Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Mongiovi, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 343 A.2d 750 (App.Div.1975) (if the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer denies coverage, the tortfeasor\u2019s car is an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d and the victim is entitled to payment under her UM coverage \"without [the liability insurer's] right to disclaim having first been adjudicated\u201d). In the present case, we analogize the government to the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurer and its denial of vicarious responsibility to the liability insurer\u2019s denial of coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
