Following a jury trial, defendant was found guilty of second-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>degree conspiracy with Harold Garcia<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(1), b(1) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2.

The prosecutor retained the services of a \u201cso-called informer\u201d to set up drug deals and to sell cocaine at less than market rates. The \u201cso-called informer\u201d was a cocaine broker hired by the prosecutor, and he was paid a percentage of the cash received. The trial judge described Capola as a paid, professional confidential informer, <em>State v. Florez, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>54, 61, 589 A.2d 1382 (Law Div.1991), who \u201cwas, in effect, a State\u2019s agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The purpose of the operation was to identify and arrest mid-level cocaine dealers in the New York metropolitan area, who were interested in purchasing large quantities of cocaine at wholesale prices. Many of these dealers were believed to reside outside of Somerset County. The present case involves a transaction that was negotiated in defendant\u2019s home county of Union and finalized in Somerset County. The role of regular law enforcement personnel was to act as backup surveillance to arrest the buyers when a sale with the \u201cso-called informer\u201d was consummated. The present case involves a sale of drugs which occurred on January 4, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">About one and one-half years prior to January 1990, the Somerset County Prosecutor\u2019s Office hired Nicholas Capola (a pseudonym) as a confidential informer. They instructed him to disseminate information in the New York metropolitan area that he knows a person who will sell large quantities of cocaine at less than the usual wholesale prices. The usual price varied between $18,000 to $22,000 per kilogram of cocaine, but Capola disseminated information that he knew a seller willing to accept only $16,000 per kilogram. Capola was that seller. Capola\u2019s responsibility was to arrange a meeting at which the buyers would bring cash to a predetermined location to purchase cocaine. Once the drug deal was closed, the buyers would be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Capola was rewarded rather well for his services when an arrest was made which resulted in the seizure of cash. He would receive a commission of 10% of all cash seized up to $100,000, and 15% in excess of $100,000. Capola has been enormously successful. As the result of his efforts, 13 indictments have been returned against 27 defendants and cash of $1,300,000 has been seized. Consequently, Capola has earned about $145,000 in commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">On January 2, 1990, Orizon De La Boche also became an informer for the Somerset County Prosecutor following his arrest during a drug transaction arranged by Capola. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>not a paid informer; instead he worked as an informant in the hope of receiving a favorable disposition of his criminal case. On January 4, 1990, De La Roche provided Capola with the names of defendant Florez and co-defendant Garcia as potential cocaine buyers. The first meeting between defendant, Garcia, De La Roche and Capola occurred on January 6, 1990 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. This meeting was the outcome of other discussions about the sale and purchase of one kilogram of cocaine for $16,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">At the meeting, defendant approached a car, which Capola and De la Roche occupied, while Garcia remained about 200 feet away in the defendant\u2019s car. Capola and defendant discussed the one kilogram of cocaine. After that conversation, Garcia and Florez drove to a diner in Roselle, New Jersey, where the two of them, Capola and De la Roche had coffee. They agreed that after breakfast, Garcia and Florez would follow Capola and De la Roche to a certain area of the parking lot for the Blue Star Shopping Center in Watehung, Somerset County, New Jersey, to finalize the sale for one kilogram of cocaine for $16,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">When Capola and De La Roche arrived at the parking lot, Capola got out of his car leaving De La Roche behind. Pursuant to a predetermined plan, a surveillance team of regular law enforcement personnel had parked a decoy automobile (a third car) in the designated parking area at the mall into which they had placed one kilogram of cocaine in the trunk. Capola walked from his car to the decoy car with Florez. Garcia followed in their car and parked next to the decoy car. After Garcia showed Capola the money, they got into the decoy car. The money ($16,000) was given to Capola by Garcia. Capola then obtained the cocaine from the trunk of the decoy car, and it was placed into a gym bag. Garcia took possession of the cocaine, while Florez was standing beside the decoy car. Garcia told Capola that the money bag contained one or two checks which were good. As Garcia and Florez were walking back to their car, the surveillance team of law enforcement officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>arrested everyone and seized the cocaine as well as the money. Later, Capola was paid about $1,700 in commissions for this drug deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">First we turn our attention to defendant\u2019s contentions that the denial of certain pretrial discovery motions deprived him of a fair trial. The trial court\u2019s rulings on some of these motions have been reported in <em>State v. Florez, supra, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>54, 589 A.2d 1382. More specifically, defendant argues that the failure of the trial court to require disclosure of the true identity and address of Capola precluded any effective cross-examination of him, thereby depriving defendant of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">During the pretrial phase, the prosecutor took the position that Capola was the only informer involved in the cocaine sale to defendant. Capola submitted a certification to the court stating that his life would be jeopardized if his identity, address and facial features were disclosed. Based on this certification, the prosecutor made an application to permit Capola to testify with a hood over his head. This motion was denied because the judge regarded that \u201cas a violation of defendant\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right to confront all witnesses against [defendant].\u201d <em>State v. Florez, supra, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 58, 589 A.2d 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Thereafter, defendant made a motion to compel the prosecutor to disclose the true name and address of Capola to enable defendant to conduct a meaningful investigation of his accuser. The request was made pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 <em>U.S. </em>83, 87, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1194, 1196, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218 (1963) and the Sixth Amendment confrontation clause. In response, the prosecutor gave defense counsel a redacted copy of Capola\u2019s arrest record. That record allegedly revealed that he was arrested in Seattle, Washington, on a charge of selling cocaine which was dismissed. The record also revealed that Capola <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>was arrested on March 30, 1990, by federal authorities in Brooklyn, New York on a charge of theft of government funds. That charge was still pending in March 1991 when the present motion was decided by the trial court. Since the prosecutor had redacted Capola\u2019s name and address from the arrest record, defendant was unable to conduct an <em>independent </em>investigation of Capola.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The trial judge declined to require disclosure of the name and address of Capola, finding that disclosure was not <em>necessary. State v. Florez, supra, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 62, 589 A.2d 1382. The judge concluded that the fear of potential harm to him and/or his family outweighed the necessity for disclosure of Capola\u2019s true name and address. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 589 A.2d 1382. The judge concluded further that a redacted copy of Capola\u2019s \u201crap sheet\u201d provided defendant\u2019s counsel with enough information with which to impeach Capola\u2019s credibility, enabling defense counsel to conduct a proper cross-examination of Capola. Thus, Capola was permitted to testify at trial under that pseudonym, and defendant was prohibited from obtaining his real name and address.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his motion to compel disclosure of Capola\u2019s true name and address. Under both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the New Jersey Constitution, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, par. 10, a defendant accused of a crime has both the right to a face-to-face confrontation of his or her accusers and the right to conduct a proper cross-examination of the witnesses against him or her. <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>836, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>3157, 111 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>666 (1990); <em>Coy v. Iowa, </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>1012, 1017, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857, 864 (1988); <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>400, 403, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1065, 1067, 13 L.Ed.2d 923, 925 (1965); <em>State v. Crandall, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>649, 577 A.2d 483 (1990); <em>State in the Interest of B.F., </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>153, 158, 553 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has distinguished between these two rights in the following manner. The Court has expressed the desirability of a \u201cpreference\u201d for face-to-face courtroom confrontation; whereas, the Court has recognized the right of cross-examination as a \u201csecured\u201d right. <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>56, 63, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 2537, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>597, 606 (1980); <em>State v. Washington, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 191, 494 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1985). Cases such as <em>Maryland v. Craig, supra, Coy v. Iowa, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Crandall, supra, </em>have acknowledged that in some limited circumstances the \u201cpreference\u201d for face-to-face courtroom confrontation may have to give way to the need for obtaining testimony from young victims in child abuse cases. But even in those cases, the \u201csecured\" right to cross-examination was not compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">This case involves the informer\u2019s privilege as defined by <em>Evid.R. </em>36. That rule provides that the identity of an informer need not be disclosed and evidence respecting the identity of an informer \u201cis inadmissible, unless the judge finds that (a) the identity of the person furnishing the information has already been otherwise disclosed or (b) disclosure of his identity is essential to assure a fair determination of the issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The plain language of <em>Evid.R. </em>36 evinces a purpose to protect the identity of \u201ca person who has furnished information purporting to disclose a violation of a provision of laws of this State or the United States to a representative of the State or the United States or a governmental division thereof.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he purpose of the privilege is the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective law enforcement____ [B]y preserving their anonymity [the informers], encourages them to perform [a citizen\u2019s] obligation\u201d ... \u201c... [and] to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforcement officials.\u201d <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>53, 59, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>623, 627, 1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>639, 644 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Roviaro </em>held that where, in an actual trial of a criminal case, \u201cThe disclosure of an informer\u2019s identity ... is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\u201d 353 <em>U.S. </em>at 60-61, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 628, 1 L.Ed.2d at 645. Even though the informer was not called as a witness by the government in <em>Roviaro, </em>disclosure was required in the trial of the criminal charges because he could assist the accused with his defense of entrapment. Ten years later, the <em>Roviaro </em>rule was reaffirmed in <em>McCray v. Illinois, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>300, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1056, 18 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>62 (1967), which was a Fourth Amendment case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><em>Evid.R. </em>36 is based upon <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-28 which codified case law and reflects the holding in <em>Roviaro. </em>The rule makes clear that the privilege is not absolute. <em>Roviaro v. United States, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 60, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 627, 1 L.Ed.2d at 644-645; <em>State v. Milligan, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>373, 383, 365 A.2d 914 (1976). We must assay the fairness of nondisclosure in the context in which it arises \u2014 the trial of criminal charges in which the State relied on testimony from the informer as its principal witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">It is now well settled that the privilege is normally inapplicable where the informer \u201cis an active participant in the crime for which defendant is prosecuted.\u201d <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 383-384, 365 A.2d 914; <em>State v. Oliver, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>39, 42 and 45, 231 A.2d 805 (1967); <em>State v. Roundtree, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 31-32, 285 A.2d 564 (App.Div.1971). This proposition also holds true \u201cwhere a defense of entrapment seems reasonably plausible.\u201d <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 365 A.2d 914; <em>Roviaro v. United States, supra, </em>353 <em>U.S. </em>at 64, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 629, 1 L.Ed.2d at 647; <em>State v. Dolce, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>422, 435-436, 197 A.2d 185 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Unlike the facts in cases such as <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Varona, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>474, 480, 577 A.2d 524 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>386, 585 A.2d 389 (1990), where the informer was a mere tipster, here Capola and De La Roche were active participants. They negotiated, set up and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>consummated the sale of the drugs. There could never be any greater participation in a drug deal by an informer than occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>129, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>748, 19 L.Ed.2d 956 (1968) is quite similar to the present case, and it controls the disposition in this case. There, the primary witness against the defendant in a drug case testified that the name he used during the trial was not his real name. During cross-examination defense counsel asked him to state his real name and his address. The trial judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection. In overturning the conviction, the Supreme Court observed that \u201cwhen the credibility of a witness is at issue, the very starting point in \u2018exposing falsehood and bringing out the truth\u2019 through cross-examination must necessarily be to ask the witness who he is and where he lives. The witness\u2019s name and address open countless avenues of in-court examination and o\u00fat-of-court investigation. <em>To forbid this most rudimentary inquiry at the threshold is effectively to emasculate the right of cross-examination itself.\u201d Smith v. Illinois, supra, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>at 131, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 750, 19 L.Ed.2d at 959 (emphasis supplied) (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>Pointer v. Texas, supra, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>at 404, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d at 926). <em>See also Alford v. United States, </em>282 <em>U.S. </em>687, 692-693, 51 <em>S.Ct. </em>218, 219-220, 75 <em>L.Ed. </em>624, 628 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The State argues that <em>State v. Postorino, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>98, 105, 601 A.2d 223 (App.Div.1991) recognized that there are exceptions to the <em>Smith v. Illinois </em>rule requiring that a defendant be permitted to ask a witness his or her name during cross-examination. Although the <em>Postorino </em>court did recognize that the constitutional right to confrontation is not unlimited, <em>id. </em>at 104, 601 A.2d 223, <em>Postorino </em>is of little or no support for the State\u2019s position in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\"><em>Postorino </em>was not an informants\u2019 privilege case because the witness\u2019s true name and identity were already known to the defendant. Indeed, the court acknowledged that it was \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>dealing with an issue of informant privilege,\u201d and that the witness was not \u201ca paid, professional confidential informant with a continuing law enforcement relationship and his real identify has been disclosed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 107, 601 A.2d 223. The issue in <em>Postorino </em>was whether the defendant should be permitted to ask the witness\u2019s <em>new </em>name and <em>new </em>address which the witness had had for the three years after the criminal event and prior to the trial. During this time, the witness\u2019s family remained at the prior address which was known to defendant. Defendant was aware that no \u201crap sheet\u201d existed under the witness\u2019s new name.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Defendant\u2019s application to compel disclosure of the witness\u2019s new name and address was granted in the trial court, and we granted leave to appeal. Expressly relying on the fact that defendant was aware of the witness\u2019s true name and prior residence, and the fact that defendant had enough information to conduct an independent investigation of the witness\u2019s prior background, we remanded to conduct an <em>in camera </em>Rule 8 proceeding to ascertain what testimony the witness might offer respecting his current background over the last three years without disclosing his latest name and address. <em>Id. </em>at 108, 601 A.2d 223. Following the <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing, the judge was directed to reconsider whether defendant still needed the witness\u2019s <em>new </em>name and address. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Thus, it is clear that the facts in <em>Postorino </em>distinguish it from the present case. Postorino knew the witness\u2019s true name and his address up to three years earlier. That information alone can be of substantial assistance to a trained investigator, thereby enabling Postorino to conduct an independent investigation. Moreover, the <em>Evid.R. </em>8 hearing is designed to lead to additional information which may result in disclosure of the witness\u2019s new name and address. In contrast, defendant Florez has never known Capola\u2019s real name or address.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">We are persuaded that where the informer was an active participant in the criminal event and has testified for the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>as its principal witness, the balancing of the defendant\u2019s need for disclosure against the public interest in protecting the flow of information articulated in <em>Roviaro </em>should generally result in disclosure. <em>See Smith v. Illinois, supra; United States v. Silva, </em>580 F.2d 144, 146-147 (5th Cir.1978); <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 383, 365 A.2d 914; <em>State v. Oliver, supra; State v. Infante, </em>116 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 257, 282 A.2d 44 (App.Div.1971). This proposition highlights an important distinction between <em>Roviaro, McCray </em>and <em>Smith. </em>In both <em>Roviaro </em>and <em>McCray, </em>the informant did not testify for the government; however in <em>Smith, </em>the informant did testify for the government. Additionally, the majority in <em>Smith </em>rejected the idea expressed by Justice White in a concurring opinion that the personal safety of a principal witness for the prosecution should be the basis for nondisclosure of the witness\u2019s true name and address. <em>See Smith v. Illinois, supra, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>at 133, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 750, 19 L.Ed.2d at 960, n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Defendant Florez has always contended that disclosure of Capola\u2019s identity was essential because the entire defense rested upon credibility. Defendant and Capola testified and gave entirely different versions of what happened. As was observed in <em>Smith v. Illinois, supra, </em>where credibility is a significant issue and the informer is a direct participant in the crime and has testified for the prosecution, identification of the informer\u2019s true name and address is essential to a proper exercise of the right to cross-examination of the prosecution\u2019s key witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">We recognize that the informer is a vital part of society\u2019s defensive arsenal, and the basic rule protecting his or her identity rests upon that belief. But where the informant becomes the primary witness against a defendant in the trial of the criminal charges, \u201cthe need for a truthful verdict outweighs society\u2019s need for the informer privilege.\u201d <em>State v. Burnett, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>377, 386, 201 A.2d 39 (1964). Here, defendant sought disclosure of Capola\u2019s true name and address because he anticipated correctly that Capola would present testimony for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>State as the State\u2019s primary witness in the trial of the criminal charges where the fundamental issue of guilt or innocence was to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Under the circumstances surrounding this case, a proper balancing of the interests of the State against defendant\u2019s rights to prepare for his defense and to conduct a meaningful cross-examination, renders nondisclosure of Capo-la\u2019s true name and address a mistaken exercise of discretion. Without Capola\u2019s true name and address a \u201chood\u201d or \u201cshield\u201d still covered the witness in terms of the right to conduct a proper cross-examination. The physical removal of the \u201chood\u201d or \u201cshield\u201d satisfied only part of the need for face-to-face confrontation in the courtroom. Capola was still shielded from the type of investigation required by <em>Smith v. Illinois, supra, </em>without which defendant was deprived of his \u201csecured\u201d right to conduct a proper cross-examination of the key prosecution witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">We are compelled to reemphasize that this case involves a \u201creverse sting\u201d operation. Capola was paid well for his services which concededly involved dangerous activities. The danger to him and, perhaps, his family was undoubtedly a substantial factor in determining the brokerage commission. We believe that a program such as the federal Witness Protection Program, 18 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3521-3528, was designed to protect informers and their families who work and give testimony for the government in areas involving high risk to life or limb. On balance, defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a proper confrontation may not be sacrificed for the safety of a highly paid informer who is an active participant in the crime, rather than merely a tipster, and who testifies as the State\u2019s primary witness. We perceive no reason why Capola should be treated any differently than a police officer who works undercover in drug trafficking as an agent of the government. The undercover agent must give testimony while using his or her true name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>and disclose information, if requested, identifying the witness with his or her environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">We therefore reverse the order denying the motion to compel disclosure of Capola\u2019s true identity and address. If Capola is in a federal witness protection program, defendant should be so informed. His new name and address since being in the program may not need to be disclosed. Any arrest or conviction under any new name, however, must be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Defendant contends further that he was prejudiced in his defense of entrapment by the nondisclosure by the prosecutor during pretrial motions that De La Roche was an informer in this case. The defense of entrapment was submitted to the jury. Defendant contended that the State supplied the money and the drugs. We believe a substantial issue of entrapment was presented. <em>State v. Milligan, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 365 A.2d 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Prior to trial, counsel for defendant learned that De La Roche also acted as an informer in this case. Defense counsel sought discovery including his address so that De La Roche could be subpoenaed. He was not living at the last known address provided. As an alternative, defense counsel requested the prosecutor to produce him as a witness. The prosecutor represented to the court and counsel that De La Roche was not an informer in this case. This turned out to be an inaccurate representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">At the beginning of the second day of trial, just prior to the opening statements, the prosecutor informed the court and counsel that De La Roche was an informer in this case, and in that capacity, he introduced Capola to defendant and co-defendant. The prosecutor stated that he had been unable to locate De La Roche. Counsel for defendant then urged the court to dismiss the indictment because, according to the defense, De La Roche provided the money involved in this transaction, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>he was needed to support the defense of entrapment. The judge concluded that the prosecutor had not purposefully failed to produce De La Roche and that the defense had not been prejudiced by De La Roche\u2019s absence. The judge denied all of defendant\u2019s applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We agree that the prosecutor delayed for an unreasonable period of time in supplying information that De La Roche was a participant in the criminal event. Disclosure of that information in a timely fashion was required by <em>Brady v. Maryland, supra. </em>Our reversal of the conviction eliminates any prejudicial effect since the required disclosure has been made. Should there be a retrial, however, the prosecutor must make a diligent effort to locate the whereabouts of De La Roche. <em>See United States v. Suarez, </em>939 <em>F.2d </em>929, 932 (11th Cir.1991); <em>United State v. Cervantes, </em>542 <em>F.2d </em>773, 775 (9th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Defendant contends, still further, that the jury charge on entrapment was erroneous. As noted before, the entrapment defense was based on the contention that the State supplied both the drugs and the money. The judge charged statutory entrapment, based on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-12. There was a request to charge only due process entrapment under <em>State v. Talbot, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>160, 168, 364 A.2d 9 (1976). See <em>State v. Johnson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>458, 606 A.2d 315 (1992) for a comprehensive discussion of both statutory and due process entrapment. In the event of a retrial, the judge should only charge the jury based on the form of entrapment requested. <em>See also Jacobson v. United States, </em>503 U.S. -, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1535, <em>118 L.Ed.2d </em>174 (1992); <em>State v. Fogarty, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>59, 65-66, 607 A.2d 624 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Defendant raises another issue which is interrelated to the entrapment defense. He contends that the use of special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>interrogatories deprived him of fair trial. The following special interrogatories were submitted to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">1. How do you find the defendant Alex Florez, of a charge of Conspiracy to Possess Cocaine With Intent to Distribute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">2. How do you find the defendant Harold Garcia, of a charge of Conspiracy to Possess Cocaine with Intent to Distribute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">NOTE: If you answer <em>both </em>questions 1 and 2 Not Guilty do not answer question 3 and go to question 4. But if you answer either or both questions 1 and 2 Guilty, please answer question 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">3. Did defendants prove by a preponderance [of] the evidence that the money and cash totaling $16,019.27 used for that incident was supplied to them by law enforcement officers or their agents or informants?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">The jury answered the first two questions by finding defendant guilty, and it answered the third question with a \u201cNo.\u201d The purpose of the third question was to obtain from the jury its factual findings so that the judge could determine the legal significance of the police conduct. <em>State v. Talbot, supra, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>at 168-169, 364 <em>A.</em>2d 9; <em>State v. Medina, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 578, n. 3, 493 A.2d 623 (App.Div.1985). Once the jury answered the third question \u201cNo,\u201d there was no factual basis for the judge to conclude that there was entrapment. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, the third question did not submit an improper question to the jury. The three questions submitted were not violative of <em>State v. Simon, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>191, 398 A.2d 861 (1979), or <em>R. </em>3:19-1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">We have considered the remaining issues raised by defendant and find they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">The judgment of conviction is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-12\"> Harold Garcia has filed a separate appeal under A-5288-90T4. That appeal is not ready for calendaring.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
