Petitioner claims he suffered from aluminum toxicity as a result of his employment, as well as a traumatic stress disorder arising from his perception that he suffered from the disease. The judge of compensation found that petitioner had not suffered from aluminum poisoning, and consequently dismissed both petitioner\u2019s physical and psychiatric claims. We affirm in part and reverse in part. We conclude that petitioner\u2019s claim of total or partial permanent disability attributed to his stress disorder must be reconsidered even though he failed to establish he suffered from a physical disability associated with his exposure to aluminum during his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Petitioner worked for Continental Can from January 1971 to July 1986. He described the condition at the plant as \u201cvery misty, cloudy\u201d and observed dust particles on his clothing and skin on a daily basis. On occasion he detected silver dust particles in his mucus. In the early 1980\u2019s, he developed nausea, migraine headaches and dizziness. He began to suffer weight loss and a numbness on the left side of his body. In October 1985, petitioner sought medical help from Dr. Milton Bronstein, an internist.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Dr. Bronstein conducted a series of blood tests which disclosed elevated aluminum levels which he attributed to petitioner\u2019s occupation. On June 23, 1986, petitioner\u2019s aluminum level reached ninety-two micrograms per liter, with the normal range being from two to twenty-five. Dr. Bronstein advised petitioner that he should not be working with aluminum. Consequently, petitioner left his employ with Continental Can on July 14, 1986. Subsequent blood-serum results disclosed aluminum levels of forty-six micrograms to less than five micrograms per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>liter. Dr. Bronstein concluded that petitioner was totally disabled because of aluminum toxicity and associated anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Dr. Samuel Pollock, petitioner\u2019s psychiatrist, testified that petitioner suffered from \u201cneurological residuals\u201d and brain damage, attributable to his exposure to noxious aluminum fumes and dust. He fixed petitioner\u2019s disability at seventy-five percent partial total, neuropsychiatric. Dr. Roland Goodman, an internist, was of the view that the aluminum toxicity and petitioner\u2019s \u201csevere neuropsychiatric condition\u201d rendered him totally and permanently disabled. Respondent\u2019s expert, Dr. Howard Kippen, an internist, found no evidence of aluminum toxicity. He thus concluded that petitioner\u2019s depression and stress disorder were not associated with his place of employment. Respondent\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Allen Josephs, was of the same view, noting that although petitioner was \u201cpreoccupied\u201d with the diagnosis of aluminum poisoning, he was neurologically \u201cnormal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In dismissing petitioner\u2019s claim, the judge of compensation focused primarily on whether plaintiff had suffered from aluminum toxicity as a result of his employment. The judge rejected Dr. Bronstein\u2019s opinion that petitioner suffered from the disease, in part because the doctor did \u201cnot know what the air quality was at the plant.\u201d The judge found the blood-serum tests of little significance, and attributed \u201cgreat value\u201d to Dr. Kippen\u2019s testimony that, although petitioner may have had elevated aluminum levels in his blood, there was no evidence of aluminum poisoning. Implicit in the judge\u2019s findings is that, in the absence of competent proof that petitioner suffered from aluminum toxicity, his psychiatric disability was not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">We are satisfied that the judge\u2019s determination that petitioner did not suffer from aluminum toxicity as a result of his employment with Continental Can is supported by substantial credible evidence in the record as a whole. <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965); <em>De </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>Angelo v. Alsan Masons, Inc., </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 89-90, 299 A.2d 90 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>581, 303 A.2d 883 (1973). However, that finding is not dispositive of petitioner\u2019s stress disorder claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The question is whether petitioner\u2019s psychiatric disability is a \u201ccompensable occupational disease.\u201d That term is defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-31:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">a. For the purpose of this article, the phrase \u201ccompensable occupational disease\u201d shall include all diseases arising out of and in the course of employment, which are due in a material degree to causes and conditions which are or were characteristic of or peculiar to a particular trade, occupation, process or place of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">It is now settled that compensable personal injuries include psychiatric as well as physical injuries to the person, and hence \u201cpsychiatric disability apart from physical disability may be an independent compensable workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d <em>Saunderlin v. E.I. Dupont Co., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>402, 406-07, 508 A.2d 1095 (1986). Nevertheless, \u201cclaims of psychiatric disability, like those of physical disability, must be based upon demonstrable objective medical evidence,\u201d rather than on purely subjective factors. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 412, 508 A.2d 1095. The objective/subjective distinction is not resolved by determining whether the petitioner suffers physical manifestations of psychiatric disability; the distinction is between \u201cindependent professional analysis and the bare statement of the patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411-12, 508 A.2d 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The compensability of a psychiatric injury is also not dependent upon whether the petitioner has suffered a work-related \u201cphysical\u201d accident or trauma. The modem trend is to shed the \u201cold-fashioned legal insistence upon something \u2018physical\u2019 \u201d and to hold compensable a \u201cnervous\u201d injury arising from a work-related mental or emotional stimulus. 1B Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 42.23 (1987). Professor Larson categorizes these cases as \u201cmental-mental.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, in <em>Simon v. R.H.H. Steel Laundry, Inc., 25 N.J.Super. </em>50, 60-61, 95 A.2d 446 (Cty.Ct), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>598, 98 A.2d 604 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>13 <em>N.J. </em>392, 99 A.2d 859 (1953), the County Court held that despite the absence of a physical disability, petitioner\u2019s complete psycho-neurotic disability following an explosion at his work site was compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Moreover, \u201cthat the stimulus is gradual, in the form of sustained stress, tension, worry, strain, frustration, or harassment, does not ... make nervous injury any the less compensable than if it were caused by sudden shock.\u201d Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 42.23(b). For example, in <em>Williams v. Western Elec. Co., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 585, 429 A.2d 1063 (App.Div.1981), we held that mental illness caused by repetitive mental stress or stimuli may be compensable if there is objective evidence \u201cwhen viewed <em>realistically, ... </em>that the alleged work exposure was to a material degree a contributing factor.\u201d In pronouncing the \u201cobjective\u201d and \u201cmaterial degree\u201d criteria, <em>Williams </em>drew from an analogous heart case which required proof that the heart attack was \u201cdue in some realistic sense and material degree to a risk reasonably incidental to the employment....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 429 A.2d 1063 (quoting <em>Walck v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>533, 556, 267 A.2d 508 (1970)). We found no compensability in <em>Williams </em>because the evidence consisted primarily of petitioner\u2019s subjective, neurotic reaction to the demands of his job, particularly the requirements of the assembly line. 178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585-86, 429 A.2d 1063. We added \u201c[i]t was petitioner\u2019s unfortunately diseased mind which turned this environment into an abnormal situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 429 A.2d 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">In <em>Goyden v. State Judiciary, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>438, 445-46, 607 A.2d 651 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>54, 607 A.2d 622 (1992), we recently reaffirmed the <em>Williams </em>\u201cobjective-material degree\u201d standard, but added that the \u201cobjectively stressful working conditions must be \u2018peculiar\u2019 to the particular work place, and there must be objective evidence supporting a medical opinion of the resulting psychiatric disability....\u201d <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-31. Citing Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 42.23(b), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>cautioned that claims of mental injuries caused by stress in the work place \u201crepresent[] the broadest reach of compensability.\u201d 256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 443, 607 <em>A.</em>2d 651. We concluded that the underlying condition from which petitioner suffered, his compulsive personality, created his stress on the job, and that his own retirement decision, combined with his personality, triggered his depression. <em>Id. </em>at 458, 607 A.2d 651. Thus, it was not a condition \"peculiar\u201d to the work place, but an idiosyncratic, preexisting mental disorder which caused Goyden\u2019s psychiatric disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">What is clear from the above-cited cases is that the employee need not show he or she suffered some physical disability before a psychiatric injury is deemed compensable. The issue is whether there is objective evidence that the repetitive stimuli, viewed realistically, were \u201cpeculiar\u201d to the work place. If so, there must be competent objective, medical evidence that the psychiatric disorder is \u201cdue in a material degree\u201d to the repetitive work-place stimuli. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-31. Regrettably, the judge of compensation did not apply these principles. The question here is not, as the judge viewed the issue, whether petitioner suffered from aluminum poisoning. The judge must apply the <em>Williams </em>\u201cobjective-material\u201d test by focusing on petitioner\u2019s <em>perception </em>that he suffered from the disease, not whether he suffered from it. A remand for new findings is therefore necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We do not hesitate to conclude on the facts as presently developed that the condition that allegedly caused petitioner\u2019s stress disorder was \u201cpeculiar\u201d to his work place. For fifteen years he worked in an environment where he was exposed to and inhaled aluminum dust and fumes. According to petitioner, the ventilation was poor, the air was \u201cvery misty, cloudy,\u201d and at the end of the day his clothing and skin were covered with aluminum particles. As such, the work-place \u201cstimuli\u201d allegedly causing petitioner\u2019s stress disorder are unquestionably more discrete and defined than those advanced in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Goyden. </em>Thus, it cannot be disputed that the repetitive expo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>sure to the aluminum dust was an objectively verified work condition peculiar to petitioner\u2019s work place. <em>See Goyden, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 458, 607 A.2d 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">The issue therefore is whether there is objective evidence, realistically viewed, which sustains petitioner\u2019s burden of proving that his mental disorder was \u201cdue in a material degree\u201d to the repetitive work-place exposure at Continental Can. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-31. Petitioner\u2019s substantial weight loss, migraine headaches, dizziness and nervousness, are undisputed, as is the history of elevated aluminum levels found in his blood. Also not disputed is that Dr. Bronstein told petitioner about the blood serum test results, and advised him that he suffered from aluminum poisoning. The psychiatrists for both petitioner and respondent acknowledged that petitioner had become depressed, concerned for his well-being and preoccupied with how he could rid his body of what he deemed to be a poisonous substance. Thus, unlike the alleged \u201cmental-mental\u201d claim in both <em>Williams </em>and <em>Goyden, </em>here we have a psychiatric disorder arising from the employee\u2019s perception of a \u201cphysical\u201d stimulus, the increased levels of aluminum in his blood system.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">On the other hand, there is evidence that after petitioner left his employment the aluminum level in his blood normalized. Nevertheless, his stress disorder worsened. Dr. Pollock acknowledged that petitioner\u2019s mental disorder continued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGz\">even though he knows that he has a normal level of aluminum ... and that\u2019s obsessive, and in a way delusive. It\u2019s not a true belief, but it\u2019s psychologically important, because it is part of the anxiety state, and it is due to stress at work in my opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Based on this testimony Continental Can argues that petitioner\u2019s \u201cbelief was not caused by anything in the work environment; but rather, by Petitioner\u2019s subjective interpretations of the independent medical advice he received.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">However, petitioner\u2019s subjective reaction is not to be completely disregarded. <em>Williams, </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585, 429 A.2d 1063. Whether petitioner sustains his burden of proof in satisfying the <em>Williams </em>\u201cobjective-material degree\u201d criteria is a fact issue which must be resolved after considering the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>factors, including the nature of petitioner\u2019s work, the duration and extent of his actual exposure to aluminum, the reasonableness of his psychological response to his condition, and whether any unrelated cause or event may have triggered his disorder. For example, Continental Can\u2019s experts testified that petitioner\u2019s mental state may have been caused by unrelated factors such as excessive use of codeine, prescribed by Dr. Bronstein, or petitioner\u2019s exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam. This evidence may have some bearing on whether petitioner\u2019s stress disorder was \u201cdue to a material degree\u201d to his exposure to aluminum at the work place.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We leave it to the judge of compensation to decide whether the parties may present additional proofs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
