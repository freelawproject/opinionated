Kyc, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 603, 608 A.2d 1013 (Law Div.1992). The judge, therefore, concluded that the defendant was in a position similar to a participant in the Intensive Supervision Program (ISP) and was \u201cfree in the community\u201d and not subject to \u201cofficial detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603-04, 608 A.2d 1013. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>He concluded that, under the authority of <em>State v. Clay, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 553 A.2d 1356 (App.Div.1989), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>251, 571 A.2d 295 (1990), the charge could not stand against the defendant as an absconding participant in the HCP under either subsection a or b. <em>Kyc, supra, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 604-05, 608 A.2d 1013. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Defendant had been sentenced to State Prison on June 8, 1990, to serve a term of five years, with a twenty-month term of parole ineligibility as mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7, there being no agreement from the prosecutor to permit a lesser mandatory term of parole ineligibility. Thereafter, defendant\u2019s original sentence was amended to four years of confinement with sixteen months of parole ineligibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 1, 1991, less than eleven months after the initial sentencing and while still ineligible for parole, defendant was permitted to leave the institution to stay with his family after being advised of his responsibilities and duties under HCP. According to the policy manual of the New Jersey Department of Corrections, all participants in the program are required to sign an agreement acknowledging that \u201cunauthorized absence from my approved residence may be deemed to be an escape under the criminal code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Defendant was given an electronic wristlet to wear, the purpose of which was to monitor whether he was at his home during the times when he was required to be there as he was not allowed to leave without permission. He was given curfews sufficient to permit him to go to work and then return home immediately. Participants in the program are further advised and must sign an agreement that any attempt to remove a monitoring device \u201cmay be considered an attempt to escape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>While defendant was still ineligible for parole and within the strictures of the \u201cPre-Parole Home Confinement Program,\u201d he was found to have \u201ca positive urine for drugs.\u201d The person supervising his program participation was a parole officer employed by the Department of Corrections. On August 1, 1991, the officer advised defendant of the test results and that his case would have to be reviewed by one of the program supervisors. Defendant had been on his way to work that morning, and he asked if he could return his boss\u2019s tools to him at a location not far from the officer\u2019s office. Defendant was to \u201ccome right back\u201d to the office; however, he did not return. The monitoring device revealed that he left the office and went straight home for about half an hour and then fled, missing his 6:30 p.m. curfew. He was declared an escapee, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested some time later in Michigan and returned to the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5a, Escape, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">A person commits an offense if he without lawful authority removes himself from official detention or fails to return to official detention following temporary leave granted for a specific purpose or limited period. \u201cOfficial detention\u201d means arrest, detention in any facility for custody of persons under charge or conviction of a crime or offense, or committed pursuant to chapter 4 of this Title, or alleged or found to be delinquent, detention for extradition or deportation, or any other detention for law enforcement purposes; but \u201cofficial detention\u201d does not include supervision of probation or parole, or constraint incidental to release on bail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In <em>State v. Clay, supra, </em>we concluded that a participant in ISP who fails to abide by the rules and leaves New Jersey is not guilty of the crime of escape under the above statute. ISP was adopted by amendment to <em>R. </em>3:21-10(e). Under that rule, ISP participants required a change of their custodial sentence for entry into the program. This change was \u201caddressed entirely to the sound discretion of the three-judge panel assigned to hear them.\u201d The three-judge panel also was vested with \u201cthe authority to resentence offenders ... in the event they fail to perform satisfactorily following entry into the program.\u201d <em>R. </em>3:21-10(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>In <em>Clay </em>we noted that ISP operated under \u201ca concert of traditionally separated powers,\u201d being funded by the Legislature, endorsed by the Executive branch, and operated by the Judiciary. <em>Clay, supra, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 513, 553 A.2d 1356. We rejected the State\u2019s position that ISP is within the scope of the language \u201cany other detention for law enforcement purposes\u201d for several reasons and found \u201cno textual support\u201d for the position that ISP participants were under detention for law enforcement purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 553 A.2d 1356. ISP participants were not under a custodial sentence or detained in any sense as they were in effect on probation and free in the community, albeit under strict supervision. We were unable to find any specific intent by the Legislature to classify \u201cfailure in ISP\u201d as an \u201cescape from official detention.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We noted that the record provided no documentation that defendant was warned that failing ISP would leave him exposed to indictment for escape or other criminal penalties. We observed that the integrity of ISP would be preserved by resentencing defendant to prison with a possible consequence of being required to serve out his maximum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 524, 553 A.2d 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Subsequent to our decision in <em>Clay </em>and its affirmance by the Supreme Court, the Legislature, perhaps not satisfied with the lesser consequences of absconding from ISP, amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5 by adding subsection b, entitled \u201cAbsconding from parole.\u201d The Legislature declared that if a person subject to parole \u201cgoes into hiding or leaves the State with a purpose of avoiding supervision,\u201d the parolee commits a crime of the third degree. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5b. It further provided that \u201cparole\u201d includes participation in ISP. The Legislature made no specific reference to HCP, nor did it amend the language of subsection a pertaining to escape to in any way alter the classification of \u201cofficial detention.\u201d It is clear that the Legislature in amending <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5 intended that there be two classifications of absconding persons subject to prosecution, i.e., under subsection a, those persons subject to official detention who without lawful authority remove themselves and, under subsection b, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>those persons subject to parole who abscond or otherwise attempt to avoid supervision. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5a, b.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We conclude that, depending on their status and classification, participants in HCP may fall into either category. Under HCP, pre-parole inmates are eligible for participation though not eligible for parole, whether or not serving a mandatory term, but \u201c[u]pon achieving his/her parole date, the inmate shall be issued a Parole Certificate and given a parole class\u201d after which the \u201cnow parolee\u201d is discharged from the inmate program and is subject to established policies and procedures of parole. Further parolees, both juvenile and adult, may also be admitted to or retained in the program where it appears that use of the strictures of the program will reduce the likelihood that the parolee will commit a crime, or even in special circumstances where it is appropriate to impose HCP in lieu of revocation of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">We are fully satisfied that, under the HCP as administered by the Department of Corrections during defendant\u2019s participation, prior to parole an individual sentenced to a custodial term and participating in the program remains an inmate and until granted parole status, remains subject to the \u201cofficial detention\u201d of the Department of Corrections. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5a. Pre-parole HCP participants are in fact inmates. They are referred to as such throughout the policy manual of the program. They must be electronically monitored and confined to an approved residence, unless constructively engaged in activity approved by their supervising officer. While a participant is unemployed or not in a vocational/educational program, unrestricted activities are not permitted to exceed more than three hours per day and then only to engage in \u201cverifiable, constructive activities.\u201d The program is structured in such a manner as to be consistent with the intent of the Department of Corrections that pre-paroled participants remain inmates and that the inmate remains in \u201cofficial detention\u201d within the contemplation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5a.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>We think it is clear that where a participant in the program has parole status, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5b, relating to absconding from parole, would be applicable. It would be an anomalous and absurd result, clearly unintended by the Legislature, if parolees whether in HCP, ISP, or merely on parole were subject to a third-degree crime if they abscond, but that non-paroled inmates placed in HCP, who might not even be eligible for parole, could place themselves outside of the reach of the Department of Corrections or program officials by leaving their place of detention or the jurisdiction and yet face no criminal consequence. We are not compelled to arrive at such a result. <em>See State v. Gill, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>441, 444, 221 A.2d 521 (1966); <em>State v. Pavao, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>206, 210, 570 A.2d 1285 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>138, 584 A.2d 211, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>898, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>251, 112 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>209 (1990); <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>25, 29, 412 A.2d 1359 (Law Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The order dismissing the indictment is therefore reversed; the indictment is reinstated, and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-12\"> The indictment refers only to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-5 without a subsection designation. However, it is clear from the language of the indictment and a review of the grand jury transcript that the charge was intended to be under subsection a entitled, Escape, rather than subsection b, Absconding from parole, which became effective February 25, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> This amendment is significant as an inmate may not be referred to the HCP unless he or she is within six months of either an established parole date, an actual parole eligibility date, an expiration of maximum sentence, or an anticipated parole date established by the State Parole Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
