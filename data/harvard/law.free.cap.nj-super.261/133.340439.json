Smith and indemnify him for any loss resulting from an action brought by plaintiffs Robert and Diane Mroz for sexual harassment and numerous harassing telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The motion judge decided the matter on cross-motions for summary judgment in the third-party portion of the litigation in which Smith sought to compel Continental to provide him with a defense and indemnification for any recovery against him by the Mrozes.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">On its appeal Continental argues that (1) the motion judge erroneously disregarded the policy exclusion for injury or loss caused by a violation of a penal law or ordinance; (2) the injuries alleged in the Mrozes\u2019 complaint are not covered since they were intended or expected from the standpoint of its insured; (3) the judge violated public policy in ordering it to defend and indemnify Smith for a loss or damages incurred as a result of his willful wrongdoing in violation of a criminal statute; and (4) in any event, the judge should have excluded coverage for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">Due to the numerous harassing and annoying telephone calls to the residence of the Mrozes from 1981 through 1990, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Mrozes obtained a \u201ccaller I.D. device\u201d and retained the services of a private investigator. As a result it was determined that Smith had made the telephone calls. Smith had been a co-employee of Diane Mroz and had assertedly made unsolicited sexual advances towards her.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">On September 19, 1990, the Mrozes filed a complaint against Smith which alleged that he had made \u201cunsolicited sexual advances toward her which she rebuffed.\u201d The complaint also alleged that Smith made \u201cthousands of harassing and annoying telephone calls\u201d to plaintiffs\u2019 residence from 1981 until 1990. It asserted that the actions of Smith caused shock, emotional distress and mental anguish for which the Mrozes sought compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">After being served with the complaint, Smith turned it over to his insurer, Continental, and requested it to defend the action under his homeowner\u2019s policy which included a provision for extended coverage. Continental declined coverage, taking the position that the homeowner\u2019s policy did not provide coverage for what had been alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In the meantime, Smith\u2019s personal attorney filed an answer to the complaint and a counterclaim. He also successfully moved to add Continental as a third-party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The pertinent policy provisions in Continental\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy are set forth below. In a subsection entitled \u201cCoverage E-Personal Liability,\u201d the following provision specifies the coverage for claims made against the insured, and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies, we will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">1. pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-12\">2. provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice, even if the suit is groundless, false or fraudulent. We may investigate and settle any claim or suit that we decide is appropriate. Our duty to settle or defend ends when the amount we pay for damages resulting from the occurrence equals our limit of liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as: \u201can accident, including exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period in: (a) bodily injury or (b) property damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">After setting forth the coverage provisions, the policy lists exclusions in Section 11-Exclusions. Subsection (1) of the exclusion provision for personal liability states that coverage does \u201cnot apply to bodily injury or property damage: a. which is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Smith\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy had an added provision which provided for a liability extension which amended the definition of personal liability for which Continental would defend its insured. That provision provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">PERSONAL LIABILITY is amended as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">A. The definition of bodily injury is amended to include \u201cPersonal Injury\u201d. \u201cPersonal injury\u201d means injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">1) False arrest, detention or imprisonment or malicious prosecution; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">2) Libel, slander or defamation of character; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">3) Invasion of privacy, wrongful eviction or wrongful entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">Among the exclusions to the liability extension is one that provides: \u201cThis coverage does not apply to ... Injury or loss caused by violation of a penal law or ordinance committed by or with the knowledge or consent of any insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">In granting Smith\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying Continental\u2019s cross-motion for declaratory judgment, the motion judge concluded that there was an inconsistency in the policy because, as he viewed it, the acts for which the policy liability extension provided coverage were necessarily intentional acts, and the policy excludes coverage for intentional acts of the insured. The motion judge further determined that due to the inconsistency, under established case law, the policy was to be interpreted to afford coverage to the insured. The judge also decided that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint essentially amounted to one for invasion of privacy, which is listed in the liability extension. He found that the exclusion of coverage for acts that constituted a violation of penal law, was inconsistent since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the extension of liability provision included acts which he described as all being violations of state statutes, and therefore, \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with the coverage limitations. We note initially that the acts included in the extension of coverage do not all constitute violations of state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We deal initially with the more obvious problem of punitive damages. Regardless of the judge\u2019s ruling on the cross-motions for summary judgment, it is clear that the policy does not provide coverage for punitive damages. Indeed, Smith\u2019s attorney conceded this to be so at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">We turn then to the question of whether the policy provides coverage for the acts alleged in the complaint filed by the Mrozes against Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">It is clear that the policy extends no coverage for a violation of penal laws and there should be no coverage to Smith as a result. On its face, the complaint against Smith alleges not merely a simple act of invasion of privacy, but intentional harassment, which is a violation of penal law. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4. It is not necessary to a determination of coverage that Smith be charged with or convicted of any crime before a penal law exclusion or intentional act exclusion can be applied. <em>See Atlantic Employers Insurance Co. v. Tots &amp; Toddlers Pre-School Day Care Center, Inc., </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 282, 571 A.2d 300 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>147, 584 A.2d 218 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The policy provisions in the liability extension section only expand the definition of bodily injury to include certain specified acts, described as \u201coffenses,\u201d which are now considered \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d Nonetheless, although the definition of personal injury is extended, this does not automatically extend coverage to such \u201coffenses,\u201d including those set forth in subsection (3), <em>i.e., </em>\u201cinvasion of privacy.\u201d In addition to considering the policy exclusion for violations of penal law, in order to determine whether there is coverage, it is still necessary to refer back to the initial language of the policy which defines an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>occurrence. As previously indicated, an occurrence is \u201can accident\u201d resulting in \u201cbodily injury or property damage.\u201d The exclusion provision further provides that coverage does not apply to bodily injury or property damage expected or intended by the insured. Hence, any \u201cbodily injury\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d must be an \u201caccident\u201d and cannot be an event which was \u201cexpected or intended by the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The focus of inquiry in deciding what is an accident, and therefore a covered occurrence is on whether the insured intended the injury, not the act which caused the injury. <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mutual Insurance Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 183, 607 <em>A.</em>2d 1255 (1992). Where, as here, the actions are \u201cparticularly reprehensible,\u201d an intent to injure can be presumed from the act without an inquiry into the actor\u2019s subjective intent. <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mutual Insurance Co., supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 184, 607 A.2d 1255; <em>Atlantic Employers Insurance Co. v. Tots &amp; Toddlers Pre-School Day Care Center, Inc., supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 283, 571 A.2d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">It is clear, under the bare allegations of the complaint, that not only was there no accidental occurrence or negligent tort, but considering the allegations of the numerous occurrences involved, Smith\u2019s actions, if the allegations are true, could only have been intentional both in purpose and result. Accordingly, there is no coverage under the homeowner\u2019s policy. <em>See S L Industries v. American Motorists, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>188, 212, 607 A.2d 1266 (1992); <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mutual Insurance Co., supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 184, 607 A.2d 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Accordingly, we reverse the order of the trial court and remand for entry of a judgment dismissing the third-party complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
