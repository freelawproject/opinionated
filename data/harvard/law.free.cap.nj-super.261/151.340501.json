Defendant was sentenced to seven years in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections for aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b(1), and to a consecutive seven year term with three years of parole ineligibility for the \u201cGraves Act\u201d possession for unlawful purpose offense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a. Concurrent sentences were imposed on the other convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">On this appeal defendant argues, among other things, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\"><em>Point I </em>\u2014 Defendant\u2019s convictions must be reversed because his confession, which resulted from the assistant prosecutor\u2019s impermissible plea bargaining with an uncounselled defendant and his promise of specific sentences for defendant and his brother, was involuntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">We conclude that, as a matter of State law, any statement given in exchange for a prosecutor\u2019s promise of sentence during uncounselled plea negotiations on an indictable offense is inadmissible. Hence, we reverse the judgment of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The evidence at trial revealed that defendant and his brother assaulted Roland Lee, who had a romantic relationship with defendant\u2019s ex-girlfriend. Defendant stabbed the victim three times. In order to understand the principal issue before us, however, we must detail only the essential facts developed at the motion to suppress (more properly considered an <em>Evid.R. </em>8(3) hearing, <em>State v. Robinson, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 540 A.2d 1313 (App.Div.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">After defendant\u2019s arrest, he gave a taped confession in which he admitted stabbing Lee. Defendant stated that when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>went home after the first confrontation with Lee, he obtained the knife used in the stabbing, as well as a .38 caliber handgun. The gun was not observed by the victim and was never found by the police. Defendant also confessed to an unrelated series of car thefts and armed robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Detective Anthony Crokus, the arresting officer, testified that at headquarters defendant was read and waived his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 694 (1966), but was initially reluctant to give any information necessary to process the arrest. However, at some point defendant asked Crokus if he could make a deal to help his brother. Crokus relayed defendant\u2019s inquiry to Detective Everingham, who in turn called the First Assistant Cumberland County Prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The prosecutor arrived at headquarters and commenced plea discussions with defendant concerning the stabbing and weapons possession charges, as well as the unrelated crimes. The prosecutor promised defendant a package deal of \u201c20 years, must do 7 years without parole\u201d if defendant \u201ccooperated truthfully.\u201d He also promised defendant that his brother would receive the minimum mandatory of three years under the \u201cGraves Act.\u201d After the <em>Miranda </em>rights were readministered, defendant confessed to the crimes after the prosecutor left.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In his testimony the prosecutor acknowledged that his purpose in going to headquarters was \u201cto go down there and cut a deal with [defendant] at that point.\u201d The prosecutor testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQX\">The agreement was that if he cooperated truthfully, and I explained to him that truthfully meant that he wouldn\u2019t implicate anybody that wasn\u2019t involved in the crime, that he wouldn\u2019t take out or exculpate someone who was involved, and that he didn\u2019t, and that he would tell the actual roles of the players in the crimes, that as long as he wasn\u2019t involved in a murder, for every crime that he told us about truthfully, he would get 1 sentence; <em>in other words, for the armed robbery, he would receive 20 years, must do 7 years without parole, and that for every other additional crime that he was involved in, that he would receive a concurrent sentence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">I also told him, I explained to him what the Graves Act was and I explained to him when you commit a crime with a gun or your accomplice is involved in using a gun, that you know about that, your sentence has to include at least a third without parole, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The prosecutor also testified that defendant told him \u201cif it wasn\u2019t for me, my brother wouldn\u2019t have been involved [in the stabbing],\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about the amount of time my brother has to do than what I have to do.\u201d In response, the prosecutor told defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">[Ejven if you got [your brother] involved in [the aggravated assault], as long as he knew there was a gun involved, he\u2019d be subject to the Graves Act and would have to get at least 3 years without parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The prosecutor also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">I said that if his brother cooperated fully, the same conditions: that 1 <em>would give his brother </em>the minimum allowed by law, which was 3 years without parole, and I also told him that if the police or I suspected that he wasn\u2019t being fully candid, that he would agree to take a polygraph test, and I said that he would of course \u2014 this would be in return after cooperation for a guilty plea to the various crimes involved, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">According to defendant, the First Assistant Prosecutor was called to police headquarters when defendant would not cooperate, and advised him \u201cnot to get [his] own attorney\u201d; said that \u201che would appoint [defendant] a public defender\u201d; that \u201che had control over the judge and counsel\u201d; and threatened that \u201che would see to it\u201d that his brother, a teacher, \u201cnever taught in the State of New Jersey.\u201d Defendant further testified that the prosecutor never explained or answered his questions regarding what an attorney would do for him, but said that, between defendant and his brother, \u201che had to get 10 years out of us\u201d; that \u201cI would serve 7 years and my brother would serve 3\u201d; and that \u201che would see to it that we were kept together the entire time that both of us were serving time.\u201d According to defendant, the prosecutor also made clear that, if defendant did not cooperate, \u201che would see to it that me and my brother each serve a minimum of 25 years each before we were eligible for parole\u201d and that \u201cthe judge would agree because he was a prosecutor.\u201d After speaking with the prosecutor for \u201ca minimum of an hour,\u201d he decided to give a statement to the detectives because \u201cmy future was in his hands ... and my brother\u2019s, too.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>In finding the statement admissible, the motion judge rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the confession was involuntary because it was induced by impermissible, uncounselled plea negotiations and promises of leniency by the prosecutor. Citing <em>State v. Starling, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 456 A.2d 125 (Law Div.1983), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 504 A.2d 18 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>481, 511 A.2d 658 (1986), the judge rejected the <em>per se </em>rule that a confession induced by a promise is involuntary, reasoning that a promise of leniency is only one factor to be considered in light of the totality of the circumstances when determining whether a statement was given voluntarily. Relying on <em>Starling, supra, </em>the judge concluded that here the confession was voluntary in the totality of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Defendant argues that his confession was coerced by the First Assistant Prosecutor\u2019s promise that defendant and his brother would receive specific sentences if defendant cooperated and confessed. Defendant asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d rendered his confession involuntary in violation of both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In support of his argument, defendant cites <em>Bram v. United States, </em>168 <em>U.S. </em>532, 542-43, 18 <em>S.Ct. </em>183, 186-87, 42 <em>L.Ed. </em>568, 573 (1897), in which the United States Supreme Court endorsed the view that for a confession to be voluntary, it must not have been \u201c \u2018extracted by any sort of threats or violence, nor obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight.\u2019 \u201d But as Judge Havey develops in his concurring opinion, the <em>per se </em>rule in <em>Bram </em>does not state the present federal constitutional standard for determining the voluntariness of a confession. <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>-, -, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1246, 1251, 113 L.Ed.2d 302, 315 (1991). <em>See also State v. Di Frisco, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>253, 257-58, 571 A.2d 914 (1990). We therefore reject defendant\u2019s <em>per se </em>argument advanced as a matter of federal constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">We need not decide if there was sufficient credible evidence to sustain the trial judge\u2019s legal conclusion that the confession was not involuntary under federal constitutional principles, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>and compare, e.g., Miller v. Fenton, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>104, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>445, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>405 (1985); <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 174-75, 329 A.2d 75 (App.Div.1974), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>267, 337 A.2d 371 (1975), because recognized State values require implementation of \u201cbright line\u201d principles in order to enhance fundamental fairness and predictability of criminal practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Here, incident to the discussion the prosecutor told defendant the sentence he \u201cwould receive\u201d and the sentence the prosecutor \u201cwould give\u201d his brother. However, our Rules of Court expressly detail prosecutorial authority with respect to plea bargaining, <em>R. </em>3:9-3, and authorize neither such promises nor binding sentence recommendations. <em>See e.g., State v. Warren, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>433, 558 A.2d 1312 (1989); <em>State v. Spinks, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>568, 334 A.2d 23 (1975); <em>R. </em>3:9-3(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This case involves neither a discussion about what the prosecutor would recommend, by way of sentence or otherwise, to a judge incident to a plea, or how the prosecutor would exercise his own jurisdiction in the filing of charges, if defendant cooperated in the investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, this case involves a statement made on the basis of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>promise of a specific sentence which the prosecutor could not guarantee. In any event, while in this case the judge ultimately imposed the sentence which the prosecutor promised, we do not believe that the voluntariness of a statement when given should turn on whether the trial judge subsequently follows a prosecutor\u2019s sentence recommendation. Given the Judiciary\u2019s responsibility for sentencing and our State\u2019s firm policy concerning the impact of a sentence recommendation by the prosecutor, we adopt a \u201cbright line\u201d approach to the admissibility against a defendant of a statement made in exchange for a sentence recommendation by the prosecutor, and hold such statements inadmissible in the absence of counsel on an indictable charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In a recent decision our Supreme Court, after noting \u201cthat the Sixth Amendment is more demanding than the Fifth Amendment,\u201d held that our State Constitution, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. I, \u00b6 10, gives more protection to a defendant, at least after indictment, than does the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel. <em>See State v. Sanchez, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>261, 273, 609 A.2d 400 (1992).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Sanchez </em>held inadmissible a post-indictment confession made, even though with waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, in the absence of counsel. While the pre-indictment, post-indictment distinction may be significant in other contexts, it is insignificant in the context of such communications incident to plea negotiations which must be culminated, with counsel or after express waiver thereof, before the Superior Court. <em>See e.g., Sanchez, supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 277, 609 A.2d 400, (referring to the need for counsel with respect to plea negotiations); <em>State v. Crisafi, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>499, 509, 608 A.2d 317 (1992) (\u201c[i]t is for the court to determine whether an accused has knowingly and intelligently waived\u201d his right to counsel in criminal prosecutions); <em>see also State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Ciba-Geigy Corp., </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 320-21, 589 A.2d 180 (App.Div.1991), <em>app. dis. </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>585, 617 A.2d 1213 (1992). The policies which require counsel at the taking of a post-indictment statement also require counsel whenever the prosecutor negotiates with a defendant to elicit a statement in exchange for a sentence recommendation on an indictable offense. An uncounselled statement made as part of negotiations relating to the proper sentence upon disposition of the criminal charges should not be admitted against the defendant if the case is not disposed of by plea. <em>Cf. State v. Boyle, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 486 A.2d 852 (App.Div.1984); <em>see also State v. Boone, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>38, 327 A.2d 661 (1974); <em>Evid.R. </em>52(2); <em>R. </em>3:9-2 (if plea is refused, no statement is admissible at trial). And note <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 effective July 1,1993.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We thus hold that an uncounselled statement made incident to, or in exchange for, a sentence recommendation or sentence promise by the prosecutor to the defendant on an indictable offense, is inadmissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s uncounselled admission in this case thus was inadmissible as a matter of State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">This is not the occasion to examine the scope of the \u201charmless error\u201d doctrine when a confession is admitted in violation of a State \u201cbright line\u201d rule. <em>See, e.g., </em>and <em>compare, Arizona v. Fulminante, supra, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>---, ---, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1253-1254, 1257-1259, 113 L.Ed.2d at 317-322, 329-333; <em>United States v. Hasting, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>499, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1974, 76 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 96 (1983); <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>18, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>824, 17 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>705 (1967); <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 273 <em>A.</em>2d 1 (1971). We so conclude because here the defendant\u2019s confession provided the direct proof on the handgun counts, and we cannot hold it had no impact on the judge\u2019s other findings. The State argues that because the proofs corroborated defendant\u2019s confession in other respects, there was sufficient evidence to uphold the handgun convictions. The State does not suggest, however, that there was sufficient evidence to sustain those convictions if defendant\u2019s confession is inadmissible. We therefore vacate the convictions for the handgun offenses under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b and direct entry of a judgment of acquittal on those offenses. However, as we find defendant\u2019s waiver of jury trial unimpeachable,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we leave for initial resolution by the trial judge whether he can make new findings and conclusions on the trial record made, without consideration of defendant\u2019s confession, or whether a plenary new trial is warranted on the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The judgment of conviction is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> We note that defendant ultimately received an aggregate of 20 years with 5 years parole ineligibility for all offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\"> There are special circumstances where the prosecutor can make a binding recommendation under a statute, but even then the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation can be subject to challenge before the judge. <em>See e.g., State v. Vasquez, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>189, 609 A.2d 29 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lagares, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>20, 601 A.2d 698 (1992); <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>254 <em>N.J.Super. </em>300, 603 A.2d 516 (App.Div.1992); <em>State v. Alvarez, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 586 A.2d 1332 (App.Div.1991). Because this case involves a \u201cGraves\u201d offense, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c, and other charges, we are not dealing with a prosecutor\u2019s pre-indictment promise or decision about the charges he would or would not <em>file.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> This case is quite different from <em>State v. Starling, supra, </em>where, in writing, the prosecutor in exchange for defendant's cooperation \"agreed not to ask the court for Mr. Starling to be treated as a persistent offender [which requires the State\u2019s motion and proofs, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a] even though his prior record justifies such a request.\u201d The written agreement further provided that \u201d[t]he Prosecutor\u2019s Office further agrees not to ask the court for parole disqualifier even though it could. Mr. Starling understands that this does not mean that there will be no parole disqualifier as the court may impose a parole disqualifier as a condition of sentence if found guilty.\" 188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 129 n. 1, 456 A.2d 125. The defendant\u2019s statements following repeated waiver of rights, including the right to counsel, was found admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\"> Justice Pollock pointed out in <em>Sanchez </em>that the United States Supreme Court held in <em>Patterson v. Illinois, </em>487 <em>U.S. </em>285, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>2389, 101 L.Ed.2d 261 (1988), that waiver of the right to counsel post-indictment in response to <em>Miranda </em>warnings constituted a waiver of the Sixth as well as the Fifth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\"> Adoption of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410 would expand the \u201cscope of the exclusion [and constitute] a change in current New Jersey practice\u201d and might overrule <em>State v. Boyle, supra. Report of the New Jersey Supreme Court Committee on the Rules of Evidence, </em>comment to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>410. While examining the issue of voluntariness, <em>Boyle </em>involved a defendant with counsel at the time of the plea discussions and did not examine the right to counsel issue. Further, it involved a defendant\u2019s unilateral decision to \u201cabrogate a previously negotiated plea agreement.\u201d 198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 73, 486 <em>A.</em>2d 852. For present purposes, we note that <em>Boyle </em>may be read to permit the introduction of a voluntary statement made during plea negotiations where counsel was present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> We do not intend to apply this holding to a prosecutor\u2019s promise to advise the judge of cooperation or to recommend leniency or to other promises which do not involve specific sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b192-9\"> Defendant claims that the waiver of his right to jury trial was \"conditional\" because it was to assure an earlier trial date which did not materialize. He does not otherwise substantively or procedurally claim prejudice because he received a bench trial while his brother was simultaneously tried to a jury. We do not address the propriety of that procedure. Nor need we address the other issues raised by defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b192-7\">HAVEY, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKJ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">I concur with the majority that defendant\u2019s statement must be suppressed. However, I hesitate to join in adopting the majority\u2019s holding that \u201cany statement given in exchange for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s promise of sentence during uncounselled plea negotiations on an indictable offense is inadmissible.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 159, 618 A.2d at 362. In my view, we need not go as far as establishing such a bright-line rule. I would hold that on the specific facts before us, and in the totality of the circumstances, defendant\u2019s confession was not the \u201cproduct of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.\u201d <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamante, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>218, 225, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2041, 2046, 36 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>854, 862 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Defendant asserts that the first assistant prosecutor\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d rendered defendant\u2019s confession involuntary in violation of both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In support of his argument, defendant cites <em>Bram v. United States, </em>168 <em>U.S. </em>532, 542-43, 18 <em>S.Ct. </em>183, 186-87, 42 <em>L.Ed. </em>568, 573 (1897), where the United States Supreme Court endorsed the view that for a confession to be voluntary, it must not have been \u201cextracted by any sort of threats or violence, nor obtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Under current federal precedent, the unqualified rule in <em>Bram </em>does not state the standard for determining the voluntariness of a confession. <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>-, -, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1246, 1251, 113 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>302, 315 (1991). Rather, to determine voluntariness, a court must consider the effect that the totality of the circumstances had upon the will of the defendant. <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>at 233, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2050, 36 L.Ed.2d at 866; <em>State v.

The inquiry is whether the investigator\u2019s \u201c \u2018statements were so manipulative or coercive that they deprived [defendant] of his ability to make an unconstrained, autonomous decision to confess.\u2019 \u201d <em>Di Frisco, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>at 257, 571 A.2d 914 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Miller v.

The State has the burden of proving that a statement was voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Miller, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 404-05, 388 A.2d 218. Further, although we generally defer to a trial court\u2019s findings of fact, \u201cthe ultimate issue of \u2018voluntariness\u2019 is a legal question\u201d requiring an independent appellate determination. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1252, 113 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 316 (quoting <em>Miller v. Fenton, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>104, 110, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>445, 449, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>405, 411 (1985)); <em>see also State v. Tassiello, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>282, 294, 188 A.2d 406 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Thus, despite the apparent per se rule suggested by <em>Bram, </em>the federal courts have recently treated promises as part of the totality of the circumstances in assessing the voluntariness of confessions. <em>Fenton, </em>796 F.2d at 608. For example, in <em>Green v. Scully, </em>850 <em>F.2d </em>894, 901 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>945, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>374, 102 L.Ed.2d 363 (1988), the Second Circuit observed that \u201cthe presence of a direct or implied promise of help or leniency alone has not barred the admission of a confession where the totality of the circumstances indicates it was the product of a free and independent decision.\u201d <em>See also Fenton, </em>796 <em>F.</em>2d at 608 <em>(Bram </em>\u201chas not been interpreted as a <em>per se </em>proscription against promises made during interrogation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Nevertheless, a close analysis of the federal cases reveals generally that the upheld confession was offered merely in defendant\u2019s hope of leniency, rather than in response to an expressed promise of leniency or a shorter jail term. For example, in <em>Fenton, </em>the detective\u2019s statement to defendant that he was not a criminal, but rather a mentally-ill individual needing psychiatric help, and the promise by the detective that he would \u201chelp\u201d defendant was held not to have overborne defendant\u2019s will because there was no express promise defendant would not be prosecuted or that he could successfully avail himself of the insanity defense. 796 F.2d at 609. <em>See also Miller, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>at 404-05, 388 A.2d 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Similarly, in <em>Green, </em>a detective\u2019s promise of psychiatric help which held out the prospect of more lenient treatment was not, in the totality of the circumstances, sufficient to support suppression of the defendant\u2019s confession because nothing the detective said \u201ccould be construed as holding out the hope of leniency in the courts or a shorter sentence.\u201d 850 F.2d at 903. <em>See also United States v. Shears, </em>762 F.2d 397, 403 (4th Cir.1985) (alleged promise of leniency was not supported by the record); <em>Rachlin v. United States, </em>723 F.2d 1373, 1377-78 (8th Cir.1983) (agent\u2019s statement to defendant that it was in his best interest to cooperate was not a \u201cpromise\u201d); <em>United States v. Glasgow, </em>451 F.2d 557, 558 (9th Cir.1971) (officer\u2019s representation to defendant that he would inform trial court and prosecutor of defendant\u2019s cooperation does not render confession involuntary). Thus, the common thread in most of the federal cases is that \u201c[gjeneral encouragement to cooperate is far different from specific promises of leniency.\u201d <em>United States v. Pelton, </em>835 <em>F.2d </em>1067, 1073 (4th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>486 <em>U.S. </em>1010, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>1741, 100 L.Ed.2d 204 (1988). In contrast, the District Court in <em>United States v. Shears, </em>614 <em>F.Supp. </em>1096, 1100 (D.Md.1985), after remand by the Circuit Court (762 F.2d 397), suppressed a confession given after federal agents promised defendant he would be released on bail and could plead to reduced charges. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>These promises constituted the principal and determinative factor motivating the defendant to give the statements now challenged. These assurances of lenient treatment, viewed in the totality of the circumstances, were improperly coercive and rendered the resulting statements involuntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">[614 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1100.]</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Thus, the federal cases apparently focus, at least in part, on the clarity and certainty of the promise in determining whether, in the totality of the circumstances, the promise had the capacity to overbear the will of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Whether a statement by the interrogating officer amounts to a promise must be viewed from the defendant\u2019s, not the prosecutor\u2019s perspective, applying a reasonableness standard. <em>Grades v. Boles, </em>398 F.2d 409, 412 (4th Cir.1968); <em>see also Ferguson v. Boyd, </em>566 <em>F.2d </em>873, 876 (4th Cir.1977). Also, when considering what impact a promise had in overbearing the will of a suspect, courts must give qualitative, rather than quantitative weight to the promise. The court does not simply weigh each factor under <em>Schneckloth </em>against one another on a balance scale. <em>Green, </em>850 <em>F.2d </em>at 902. Even a single factor \u201cmay inevitably lead to a conclusion that under the totality of circumstances a suspect\u2019s will was overborne and the confession was not therefore a free and voluntary act.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, when a defendant is in custody, alone and unrepresented by counsel,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">even a mild promise of leniency [might be] deemed sufficient to bar the confession, not because the promise was an illegal act as such, but because defendants at such times are too sensitive to inducement and the possible impact on them too great to ignore and too difficult to assess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\"><em>[Brady v. United States, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>742, 754, 90 <em>S.Ct </em>1463, 1472, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>747, 759 (1970).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">The trial court here relied on <em>State v. Starling, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 133-34, 456 A.2d 125 (Law Div.1983), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 504 A.2d 18 (App.Div.1985), <em>certif. denied, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>481, 511 A.2d 658 (1986), a Law Division case upholding a confession induced by an assistant prosecutor\u2019s promise. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Starling asked to see an assistant prosecutor to discuss his knowledge regarding a series of crimes. He had already given two inculpatory statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>regarding burglaries prior to the prosecutor\u2019s arrival at the police station. The prosecutor refused defendant\u2019s request to limit his term of imprisonment for the series of burglaries to five years, and to have the prosecutor assist in a possible parole violation. <em>Id. </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 128-29, 456 <em>A.</em>2d 125. However, the prosecutor agreed not to move for an extended term under the persistent offender statute, nor to press for a parole ineligibility period. <em>Id. </em>at 129 n. 1, 456 A.2d 125. Defendant thereupon confessed to the crimes. The Law Division, applying the totality of the circumstances test, denied defendant\u2019s suppression motion, noting that defendant had waived his rights, initiated the plea discussions and was not physically or mentally abused during the interrogation. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 456 A.2d 125. It also observed that defendant had extensive prior experience in the criminal justice system and was \u201cobviously familiar with police procedure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Examining the record here in the context of the totality of the circumstances, I would conclude that defendant\u2019s confession should have been suppressed. This case does not involve an idle comment by a detective causing a defendant to conclude, without an objectively reasonable basis, that the State was offering leniency in return for his cooperation. Eather, a first assistant prosecutor undertook wholesale plea negotiations with an uncounselled defendant immediately after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">According to defendant, Detective Everingham told him he had just called the \u201cbig man,\u201d after which the first assistant prosecutor arrived at police headquarters. The prosecutor acknowledged that his purpose in coming to headquarters was \u201cto go down there and cut a deal with\u201d defendant. After explaining the potential aggregate sentence defendant faced for all the crimes, as well as Graves Act implications, the prosecutor told defendant in no uncertain terms that defendant \u201cwould get\u201d a maximum of twenty years with a seven-year mandatory minimum term if he cooperated.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>When defendant told the prosecutor \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about the amount of time my brother has to do than what I have to do,\u201d the prosecutor promised he \u201cwould get\u201d Kelvin the minimum sentence under the Graves Act. The prosecutor made these statements despite the fact he knew the trial court would not be bound by such promises, and that if the court rejected the plea, defendant would face trial on all of the charges, during which his confession would no doubt be admissible against him. <em>See State v. Boyle, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 70-72, 486 A.2d 852 (App.Div.1984); <em>cf. State v. Boone, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>38, 45-46, 327 A.2d 661 (1974) (a withdrawn plea of guilty is not admissible in evidence in a subsequent criminal proceeding). This factor alone distinguishes this case from <em>Starling, </em>where the assistant prosecutor made clear that his promise not to ask for a parole ineligibility period \u201cdoes not mean that there will be no parole disqualifier as the court may impose a parole disqualifier as a condition of sentence if found guilty.\u201d 188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 129 n. 1, 456 A.2d 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Moreover, unlike the federal cases, here the prosecutor did not simply imply that defendant\u2019s cooperation would benefit defendant and Kelvin in the ultimate prosecution of the crimes. The deal struck by the prosecutor, objectively viewed, was absolute, and intended to induce defendant into cooperating and giving a confession. Further, there is little question that the prosecutor\u2019s promises and explanation of the potential exposure defendant and Kelvin faced were the principal and singular factors that induced defendant to confess. This is particularly true with respect to the promise concerning Kelvin\u2019s sentence, in view of defendant\u2019s paramount concern about the potential penal consequences to Kelvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">There is another factor implicated here which, in my view, is part of the totality of the circumstances analysis. A first assistant prosecutor, not a police detective, conducted this plea negotiation. I believe that a clear capacity to overbear the will of a suspect exists when the second most powerful figure in the prosecutor\u2019s office packages a deal during negotiations with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>recently-arrested defendant, particularly when the prosecutor conveys the message in no uncertain terms that he has complete authority to consummate the deal as negotiated. The prosecutor\u2019s authority here was obviously significant to defendant. After the prosecutor explained the potential aggregate sentence defendant faced for all the crimes, defendant recognized he was exposed to an aggregate term far in excess of twenty years. The prosecutor stated \u201cI\u2019d be willing to give you 20 years, must do 7 on everything, does that sound reasonable?\u201d Defendant, who had no prior record, testified, \u201cI never knew anything about a plea bargain or deals. I never dealt with the system before.\u201d He was convinced that the prosecutor \u201chad total control over [everything]\u201d because the prosecutor had told him the judge would go along with the plea agreement \u201cbecause I was a prosecutor.\u201d I have little doubt that the aura of the prosecutor\u2019s position and the certainty of his expressed authority influenced defendant to a material degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">There is an obvious imbalance when a prosecutor, trained in the law, conducts unrestrained plea negotiations with an uncounselled suspect. Plea bargaining, of course, \u201chas become firmly institutionalized in this State as a legitimate, respectable and pragmatic tool in the efficient and fair administration of criminal justice.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>353, 360-61, 403 A.2d 889 (1979); <em>see also State v. Barboza, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>415, 420, 558 A.2d 1303 (1989). However, the system \u201cpresuppose[s] fairness in securing agreement between an accused and a prosecutor.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>257, 261, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>495, 498, 30 L.Ed.2d 427, 432 (1971). \u201c \u2018If plea bargaining is to fulfill its intended purpose, it must be conducted fairly on both sides and the results must not disappoint the reasonable expectations of either.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Warren, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>433, 443, 558 <em>A.</em>2d 1312 (1989) (quoting <em>State v. Thomas, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>314, 321, 294 A.2d 57 (1972)). Accordingly, the \u201cprosecutor and <em>defense counsel </em>may engage in discussions relating to pleas and sentences. . . .\u201d <em>R. </em>3:9-3(a) (emphasis added). Moreover, our rules are designed to assure that a guilty plea entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>pursuant to a plea negotiation (1) contains a factual basis; (2) is voluntary; and (3) is given with the understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. <em>R. </em>3:9-2; <em>Barboza, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 420-21, 558 A.2d 1303. The plea agreement, of course, cannot bind the trial judge to a particular sentence. <em>R. </em>3:9-3(e); <em>Warren, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 441-42, 558 A.2d 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Although this case concerns a motion to suppress a confession, rather than the withdrawal of a guilty plea, the obvious imbalance in the plea negotiation process between a legally-trained prosecutor and a newly-arrested defendant sheds all indicia of fairness. The uncounselled defendant may not know what defenses are available, the strength of the State\u2019s case or the possible consequences of a plea, when negotiating a sentence or plea with a prosecutor who has conveyed his certain authority to reach a binding agreement. In such a circumstance, the prosecutor holds all the cards. The result is a \u201cspecies of plea bargaining shorn of any of the essential safeguards mandated for true plea bargaining.\u201d <em>Grades, </em>398 <em>F.2d </em>at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">This regrettable imbalance was significant here. For example, the prosecutor advised defendant that he was faced with a Graves Act sentence when in fact there was a serious question as to whether a firearm had been involved in any of the crimes. Defendant was also told that his brother faced a Graves Act sentence, despite the absence of any convincing evidence that Kelvin was an accomplice who had the purpose to commit the crimes with the use of a firearm. <em>See State v. White, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>122, 130, 484 A.2d 691 (1984). Indeed, Kelvin was never even charged with the Graves Act offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor also did not advise defendant that his confession and plea to the Graves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Act offense would trigger an extended term if defendant was later convicted for the armed robberies to which he also confessed. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c. In short, defendant accepted the prosecutor\u2019s representations regarding potential sentencing consequences at face value, relied upon them and agreed to give a confession. In my view, the conclusion is inescapable that the unacceptable conditions of this procedure weighed heavily in overbearing defendant\u2019s will. I would therefore conclude that, in the totality of the circumstances, defendant\u2019s capacity for self-determination was \u201ccritically impaired.\u201d <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>at 225-26, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2046-47, 36 L.Ed.2d at 862. Therefore, his confession was involuntary and should have been suppressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> Kelvin was charged only with and convicted of conspiracy and aggravated assault arising from the stabbing. His conviction is the subject of a companion appeal. <em>See State v. Watford, </em>No. A-5523-90T4 (App.Div.1992) (unreported). The opinion in that appeal is being filed contemporaneously with this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
