New Jersey pays it for providing medical services to New Jersey Medicaid patients. In accordance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52\u2014 1.17(b), the rate at which it is compensated for providing those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>services is the pertinent Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) rate established by the appropriate Pennsylvania administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Children\u2019s Hospital was a party to federal court litigation in which Pennsylvania\u2019s system for establishing DRG rates for its hospitals was held to violate federal law because the system resulted in compensating hospitals at rates that were not \u201creasonable and adequate to meet costs incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities,\u201d particularly those serving disproportionate numbers of low-income patients with special needs. <em>Temple University v. White, </em>729 <em>F.Supp. </em>1093 (E.D.Pa.1990) (holding that plan did not comply), 732 <em>F.Supp. </em>1327 (ordering interim relief), <em>aff'd </em>941 <em>F.2d </em>201 (3rd Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>873, 116 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>778 (1992). As the result of that litigation, to which New Jersey was not a party, Pennsylvania retroactively increased Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s DRG rates. Children\u2019s Hospital then applied to the New Jersey Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services to be paid the difference between the compensation that it had received for services which it had provided to New Jersey Medicaid patients during its 1989, 1990, and 1991 rate years, calculated at the DRG rates then prevailing, and the compensation to which it would be entitled on the basis of its retroactively increased rates. Relying on <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, the Division declined to consider the application on its merits because Children\u2019s Hospital had filed its claim more than 20 days after the close of the rate years during which the services were rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Children\u2019s Hospital has appealed. We hold that the Division\u2019s regulations do not justify its ruling. We therefore reverse the decision appealed from and remand this matter to the Division for consideration on the merits. An explanation of our ruling requires a discussion of the framework of federal law within which our State\u2019s Medical Assistance Program operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Pursuant to the New Jersey Medical Assistance and Health Services Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-1 <em>et seq., </em>New Jersey compensates approved hospitals for providing necessary services to indigent, medically eligible New Jersey residents. Under the federal Medicaid Act, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396 <em>et seq., </em>the Federal Government reimburses the State for part of the cost. By accepting this financial assistance, New Jersey obligates itself to comply with the terms of the Medicaid Act and the pertinent regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. <em>Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>498, 502, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2510, 2513, 110 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>455, 462 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">A state participating in the Medicaid program must compensate hospitals for services provided to Medicaid patients at rates that are \u201creasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities,\u201d that \u201ctake into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs,\u201d and that \u201cassure that individuals eligible for medical assistance have reasonable access (taking into account geographic location and reasonable travel time) to inpatient hospital services of adequate quality. . . . \u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A); <em>Temple University v. White, </em>941 <em>F.</em>2d 201, 207 (3rd Cir.1991) A participating state must also provide a review procedure \u201cto ensure the proper and efficient payment of claims and management of the program. . . . \u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(37). Federal regulations implementing these statutory provisions require a participating state to \u201cpay for services furnished in another State [to an eligible resident of the participating state] to the same extent that it would pay for services furnished within its boundaries,\u201d 42 <em>CFR </em>\u00a7 431.52(b), and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>provide hospitals dissatisfied with their compensation the opportunity to obtain review of \u201cpayment rates.\u201d 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(c); <em>see West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, </em>885 F.2d 11, 30-2 (3rd Cir.1989), <em>aff'd </em>499 U.S. -, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1138, 113 L.Ed.2d 68 (1991) (considering and affirming only the Circuit Court\u2019s limitation of the award of experts\u2019 fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\"><em>West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, supra, </em>demonstrates that a state participating in the Medicaid program is responsible for assuring that its compensation to out-of-state hospitals is \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d in accordance with Federal law and that out-of-state hospitals dissatisfied with their compensation must have an opportunity to obtain review. Like New Jersey, Pennsylvania used a DRG system to determine charges for hospital care. Its procedure for formulating rates for in-state hospitals \u201ct[ook] into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs,\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A), by assigning each hospital to one of seven rate groups; an in-state hospital with a disproportionate share of low income patients was assigned to a group whose members were paid at a higher rate. But every out-of-state hospital was compensated at the average compensation rate for all in-state hospitals; no consideration was given to whether the out-of state hospital cared for a disproportionate share of low income patients. The Court of Appeals held that this aspect of Pennsylvania\u2019s program was invalid because it resulted in compensation to out-of-state hospitals that was not \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d within the meaning of Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">The United States District Court, <em>West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, </em>701 <em>F.Supp. </em>496 (M.D.Pa.1988), whose decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, ruled that the Pennsylvania Medicaid program was also invalid on two other grounds. It found that if Pennsylvania continued to pay inadequate compensation, West Virginia University Hospitals would be unwilling to treat Pennsylvania Medicaid patients. As a consequence, \u201ctheir ready access to quality care will be im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>paired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518. On appeal, the Court of Appeals recognized that federal law prohibited the State from compensating out-of-state hospitals in a way that would cause them to be unwilling to treat Pennsylvania Medicaid patients, but the Court held that further findings would be required to sustain the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Pennsylvania program was about to have that result on the admission policy of West Virginia University Hospitals. <em>West Virginia University Hospitals, supra, </em>885 A.2d at 25. The district court also ruled that Pennsylvania\u2019s review system failed to comply with federal requirements because hospitals could challenge only the result of the State\u2019s rate-making, not the validity of its methodology. <em>West Virginia University Hospitals, supra, </em>701 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 520-23. The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the Pennsylvania\u2019s review procedure satisfied the requirements of federal law because appeals were permitted on some issues, including the calculation of rates. <em>West Virginia University Hospitals, supra, </em>885 <em>F.2d </em>at 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, supra, </em>is not binding on us, but the opinion is persuasive. We consider that it is an authoritative statement of federal law and has two significant implications for the present case. First of all, although Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia is an out-of-state hospital, New Jersey is legally obligated to compensate it at rates which are \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d within the meaning of federal law for the services it rendered to eligible New Jersey Medicaid patients. Since New Jersey relied entirely on Pennsylvania rates, New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid compensation system is, as applied to Children\u2019s Hospital, also violative of federal law and invalid. Secondly, New Jersey\u2019s system must include provision for review that will enable out-of-state hospitals, including Children\u2019s Hospital, a meaningful opportunity to challenge the rates at which it was compensated. Under the facts of this case, the construction of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e)(2) that has been adopted by the Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>would violate federal law by failing to provide Children\u2019s Hospital with the required opportunity to obtain a review of its rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The pertinent portions of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e)(2) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">(c) The following procedures must be followed when an appeal is filed by an out-of-state hospital:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">1.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">2. <em>If the appeal concerns issues relating to the rate of reimbursement, the appeal must be filed within 20 days after the close of the rate year in the state in which the hospital is located. </em>The following limitations shall apply to matters involving hospital rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">i. The hospital must demonstrate an appeal has been filed with [the Medicaid] agency in the state in which the hospital is located;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">ii. If the hospital has not filed an appeal in their own state, then the interim payment made by the Division\u2019s fiscal agent will be considered as final. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">After the Federal Court invalidated Pennsylvania\u2019s hospital rate-making system on January 24, 1990, the process of establishing new rates took more than a year. On May 29,1991, the Pennsylvania Medicaid agency was held in contempt for failing to establish new rates in compliance with the court\u2019s prior order. As the result of that ruling, the agency and the hospitals entered into a stipulation fixing new retroactive rates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Children\u2019s Hospital asserts that the Pennsylvania agency notified it on July 9,1991 of its revised Medicaid rates for the three prior years. Thus July 9, 1991 was the earliest date at which the hospital could effectively challenge New Jersey\u2019s reimbursement rates that were based on the invalid Pennsylvania rates. The hospital filed its challenge on July 25, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">Relying on the twenty-day provision of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e)(2), the New Jersey Medical Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services contends that the hospital should have asserted its claim by July 20, 1991. This interpretation of 1.17(e)(2) allowed the hospital eleven days in which to file its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>appeal of the 1991 rates. Even if we assume that eleven days was an adequate period within which to file a claim for the rate year ended June 30,1991, it would obviously have been impossible for Children\u2019s Hospital to assert its claims for 1989 and 1990 within twenty days after the end of those rate years. To entirely preclude the hospital from obtaining a substantive review of its claim with respect to those years would be contrary to the federal requirement that a state participating in the federal Medicaid program afford all hospitals, including out-of-state hospitals, an opportunity for a meaningful review. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(37); 42 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 447.253(c). Our obligation is to construe <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e)(2) so as to avoid that result if possible. <em>Cf. Smith v. Director, Division of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 25-26, 527 A.2d 843 (1987) (despite substantial deference due agency\u2019s construction of its own regulations, a court will invalidate a regulation if it is inconsistent with the statute it purports to interpret).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The Division argues that the review which Children\u2019s Hospital seeks would not have been barred if it had notified the Division when the litigation challenging Pennsylvania\u2019s rate-making process was initiated. We assume that such a requirement would have been a valid condition for review if it had been established by statute or regulation. <em>Cf. Matter of Emmanuel Nursing Home, </em>411 N.W.2d 511, 516 (Minn.App.1987) (affirming Medicaid agency\u2019s refusal to adjust closed rate years where facility failed to file a timely appeal); <em>Golden Five, Inc. v. Nebraska Dept. of Social Services, </em>229 <em>Neb. </em>148, 425 <em>N</em>.W.2d 865, 870 (1988) (denying retroactive monetary relief where operators of health care facility had obtained a federal district court judgment but had not filed a timely administrative appeal). However, we find no such requirement. Certainly, none is stated with the clarity that out-of-state hospitals are entitled to expect in the light of the federal requirements that New Jersey afford them \u201creasonable and adequate\u201d compensation and provide them with the opportunity to obtain a review of rates which fail to comply with that standard. In our view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number><em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e)(2) can and should be interpreted to comply with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e)(6) states, \u201cAn out-of-state provider who requests a hearing [with respect to rates] would have the <em>same rights, </em>duties and obligations as an in-state provider.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In the light of that regulation, New Jersey\u2019s review procedure for rate appeals by out-of-state hospitals should be construed to accord those hospitals \u201cthe same rights\u201d of review as are provided to in-state hospitals. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:31b\u2014 3.52(c), the rule of limitations for in-state hospitals, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">A hospital which believes that the proposed rates are inadequate to support operation of an efficient and needed institution may request a full rate review as defined in N.J.A.C. 8:31B-3.51. A hospital must submit a request for a full rate review, together with all information required in (e) below, <em>within 30 days of receipt of the proposed Schedule of Rates. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Since <em>N.J.A. C. </em>10:52-1.17(e)(6) gives an out-of-state hospital the \u201csame rights\u201d with respect to a rate appeal as an in-state hospital, we interpret the clause, \u201cwithin 20 days after the close of the rate year in the state in which the hospital is located,\u201d in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e)(2), as having substantially the same meaning, except for the difference in the number of days, as the requirement for the submission of \u201ca request for a full rate review ... <em>within 30 days of receipt of the proposed Schedule of Rates\u201d </em>in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:31b-3.52(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. In other words, since New Jersey rates for an out-of-state hospital depend on those established by the foreign state, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e)(2) means that a proceeding challenging a rate in an out-of-state hospital\u2019s home state keeps open or reopens the relevant rate year for the purpose of a possible New Jersey appeal until the hospital is notified of the final rates fixed by its home state. This construction of the regulation preserves the federal-law right of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>out-of-state hospital to a meaningful New Jersey review of its rates and the adequacy of its compensation in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">By virtue of our interpretation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(e), the rate years at issue in Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s pending claim did not close until it received notice of the retroactively revised final DRG rates established by the Pennsylvania Medicaid agency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, that regulation does not bar the hospital\u2019s claim. That is the only issue we have decided. All other issues affecting the disposition of the hospital\u2019s claim for retroactive reimbursement remain open for consideration by the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The decision appealed from is vacated and this matter is remanded to the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b651-9\"> In the New Jersey Code of Administrative Regulations, the regulation is designated as <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:52-1.17(c); however, it follows -1.17(d) and there is another section -1.17(c) in its proper sequence. The section which is pertinent to this case should have been designated -1.17(e) and we will refer to it by that designation. The designation under which it appears in the Code is obviously a typographical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b655-13\"> A copy of the stipulation has not been supplied to us and the parties disagree whether the rates which it affected include those for the year ended June 30, 1989 or only for the rate years ended June 30, 1990 and 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b657-9\"> We express no opinion on whether according out-of-state hospitals fewer days than in-state hospitals within which to file rate appeals has any legal significance. That difference does not appear to be material to the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b658-11\"> While federal regulations provide for a twelve-month limitation on Medicaid claims in most instances, \"[t]he agency may make payments at any time in accordance with a court order____\u201d 42 <em>CFR </em>\u00a7 447.45(d)(4)(iv). We were told during oral argument that claims paid pursuant to court order would be eligible for federal reimbursement to the same extent as if they had been timely paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
