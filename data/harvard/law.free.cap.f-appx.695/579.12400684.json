The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the District Court\u2019s bench verdict, post-trial relief order, and final judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">From early 2002 to early 2007, Saima Ashraf-Hassan was employed by the Embassy of France in the United States, (the \u201cEmbassy\u201d). Ashraf-Hassan, a practicing Muslim and French citizen born in Pakistan, alleged that she was subjected to a hostile work environment at the Embassy because of her race, religion, and national origin, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. After a four-day bench trial, the District Court concluded that Ashraf-Hassan \u201cha[d] satisfied her burden of proving a hostile work environment,\u201d and awarded her $30,000 in damages, along with attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Verdict Tr. at 15:16-17, J.A. 764; <em>id. </em>at 18:18-20, J.A. 767; Final J., J.A. 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">The Embassy appealed, arguing that the District Court abused its discretion and erred in a variety of ways. We disagree, and affirm the District Court largely for the reasons articulated in its bench verdict and subsequent memorandum opinion denying post-trial relief. We will briefly address the Embassy\u2019s principal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\"><em>First, </em>the Embassy contends that the District Court abused its discretion by permitting Ashraf-Hassan to offer trial testimony that was inconsistent with her pretrial statement. In April 2002, Ashraf-Hassan was terminated (and reinstated) after she informed her supervisor that she was pregnant. The date she learned of her pregnancy\u2014March or April 2002\u2014was \u201cmuch disputed.\u201d Verdict Tr. at 7:13-14. According to Ashraf-Hassan, both she and her supervisor learned of her pregnancy in March, and she was terminated a month later. According to the Embassy, Ashraf-Hassan learned of her pregnancy in April, lied that she informed her supervisor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>March, and was justifiably terminated for both lying and failing to disclose her pregnancy sooner. The District Court observed, \u201cThe testimony on this issue ha[d] been confused and ha[d] gone back and forth in different pleadings in discovery during the whole context of the case.\u201d Verdict Tr. at 3:17-20, J.A. 752. This observation is supported by the record, as demonstrated by the following bookends: Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s Amended Complaint\u2014 filed four years before trial\u2014alleged that she \u201clearned that she had become pregnant\u201d on March 15, 2002, Am. Compl. \u00b6 61, J.A. 30; but her pretrial statement\u2014filed two months before trial\u2014stated that she \u201cdid not learn she was pregnant until April 16, 2002,\u201d Joint Pretrial Statement at 2, J.A. 277. Because the confusion was not new to the case, the District Court found that the Embassy suffered no surprise or prejudice by Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s trial testimony, and held that the inconsistent pretrial statement \u201cdoes not preclude her side from arguing that she learned [of her pregnancy] actually in March 2002.\u201d Verdict Tr. at 3:14-15, J.A. 752. The District Court did, however, \u201cconsider the [inconsistent] statement in the pretrial statement when [it] weighted] all the evidence in terms of finding the facts.\u201d Verdict Tr. at 4:6-7, J.A. 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">According to the Embassy, the District Court should have held Ashraf-Has-san to her pretrial statement, despite the ongoing confusion. As an initial matter, several of the cases cited by the Embassy regard statements memorialized in pretrial orders, <em>see, e.g., Smith v. Wash. Sheraton Corp., </em>135 F.3d 779, 784 (D.C. Cir. 1998), but one was not issued here. This distinction is significant because, although a district court should typically issue a pretrial order following a pretrial conference, Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(d), D. D.C. R. 16.5(a)(3), it is the order\u2014not necessarily the parties\u2019 statements\u2014that \u201ccontrols the course\u201d of the trial, absent modification. Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(d). Moreover, even when a court <em>does </em>issue an order, \u201cthe binding effect of pretrial orders ... does not mean that the order is rigidly and pointlessly adhered to at trial.\u201d 6A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Jane, Federal Practice And Procedure \u00a7 1527, at 397 (3d ed. 2010). Otherwise, \u201ca pre-trial order or pre-trial statements would hold the parties in a vise, and the result might be just about as bad as a return to the old sporting theory of justice.\u201d <em>Clark v. Penn. R.R. Co., </em>328 F.2d 591, 594 (2d Cir. 1964); <em>see also </em>6A Wright et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1527.1, at 404-07 (\u201cThe. philosophy behind [Rule 16(e)] was aptly summed up in <em>Clark </em>.... \u201d). That is precisely the concern here: as a result of \u201cnatural confusion or sloppiness by counsel,\u201d Verdict Tr. 9:12-13, J.A. 758, Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s account of events went back and forth over time, and the Embassy understandably sought to capitalize on the opposing party\u2019s latest misstep. But the Embassy\u2019s proposed no-exceptions approach to pre-trial statements clashes with the \u201cbroad discretion\u201d afforded district judges in managing trials. <em>See Wash. Hosp. Ctr. v. Cheeks, </em>394 F.2d 964, 965 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (\u201cThe District Judge must, of course, have broad discretion since he is in a far better position to evaluate the situation than are we.\u201d). In light of these principles, we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to permit trial testimony that was inconsistent with a pretrial statement, especially where that statement was not memorialized in a pretrial order, and the inconsistency was plain and repeated throughout the life of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\"><em>Second, </em>the Embassy contends that the District Court erred when it determined that the Embassy could be held liable for the conduct of Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>final \u201csupervisor,\u201d Christian Tual. Even if the Embassy were correct that Tual does not satisfy the Title VII definition of \u201csupervisor,\u201d <em>see Vance v. Ball State Univ., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2434, 2443-52, 186 L.Ed.2d 565 (2013), Ashraf-Hassan \u201ccould still prevail by showing that [the Embassy] was negligent in failing to prevent harassment from taking place,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2453. \u201cAn employer may be held liable for the harassment of one employee by a fellow employee (a non-supervisor) if the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate corrective action.\u201d <em>Curry v. District of Columbia, </em>195 F.3d 654, 660 (D.C. Cir. 1999). The District Court found that Ashraf-Hassan repeated ly complained of harassment, including Tual\u2019s conduct, to higher-ups at the Embassy. The record supports this finding: for example, Ashraf-Hassan testified at-length that she reported the hostile work environment to a variety of officials from the Embassy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The District Court found this testimony credible, and we hold that it was not clear error to find that the Embassy \u201cknew or should have known of the harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate corrective action.\u201d <em>See Curry, </em>195 F.3d at 660; <em>see also </em>FED. R. CIV. P. 52(a)(6) (\u201cFindings of fact, whether based on oral or other evidence, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court\u2019s opportunity to judge the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d). Therefore, the District Court did not err in holding that the Embassy could be held liable for Tual\u2019s conduct. <em>See Vance, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2453.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><em>Third, </em>the Embassy contends that there was insufficient evidence to find a hostile work environment, raising three arguments that we will address in turn. \u201cWe note at the outset that an appellant seeking reversal of a trial court\u2019s findings of fact in a bench trial faces a daunting task.... Cases addressing the question of the sufficiency of evidence to support a trial court\u2019s findings are similar.\u201d <em>Overby v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, </em>595 F.3d 1290, 1293-94 (D.C. Cir. 2010). The Embassy first argues that Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s testimony is incredible as a matter of law, specifically as it related to the events surrounding her March 2002 pregnancy disclosure. This incident was \u201chard to get a handle on,\u201d Verdict Tr. at 8:10, J.A. 757, but the District Court \u201cultimately f[ou]nd that the plaintiffs account is more believable,\u201d <em>id. </em>8:23-24, J.A. 757. We \u201cmust give due regard to the trial court\u2019s opportunity to judge the witnesses\u2019 credibility,\u201d <em>Overby, </em>595 F.3d at 1294 (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 52(a)(6)), and consequently find no clear error. Furthermore, the cases cited by the Embassy are inapposite because Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s testimony was neither squarely contradicted by other evidence, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Prokupek, </em>632 F.3d 460 (8th Cir. 2011) (contemporaneous statements in a video recording), nor \u201cstrongly at variance with the way in which we would normally expect a similarly situated person to behave,\u201d <em>Jackson v. United States, </em>353 F.2d 862, 867 (D.C. Cir. 1965). As the District Court explained, Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s inconsistent testimony \u201cseem[s] explainable as natural confusion or sloppiness by counsel.\u201d Verdict Tr. 9:12-13, J.A. 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">The Embassy next argues that it was clear error for the District Court to find that Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s April 2002 termination, one of the episodes upon which the Court relied for its conclusion that there was a hostile work environment, was motivated by animus. The District Court made that finding as a result of its determination that the supervisor\u2019s purported rationale for the termination was not credible. The Court found that, even if Ashraf-Hassan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>had lied about having previously informed the supervisor that she was pregnant, \u201ctermination would have been a disproportionate response to such a lie.\u201d Mem. Op. at 15, J.A. 915. The District Court found it more plausible that the supervisor fired Ashraf-Hassan because she was pregnant, and that the harsh treatment was \u201can event based on race, national origin and/or religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Two sets of evidence sufficiently support the latter finding: in the months preceding the termination, the supervisor who terminated Ashraf-Hassan twice equated terrorist attacks with Ash-raf-Hassan\u2019s \u201cpeople;\u201d and the same supervisor treated Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s pregnancy much more negatively than the pregnancies of white, non-Muslim, French-origin employees. The Embassy would like us to disregard the reaction to Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s pregnant colleagues because, according to the Embassy, she had not proven that she was \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to those colleagues, such that she could prevail on a Title VII claim for the adverse employment action (termination) itself. <em>See, e.g., Wheeler v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., </em>812 F.3d 1109, 1115-20 (D.C. Cir. 2016). But the claim that Ashraf-Hassan took to trial was hostile work environment, not unlawful termination, and the fact that the evidence of disparate treatment is perhaps insufficient to be actionable on its own does not mean that it cannot support the District Court\u2019s finding that the April 2002 termination was motivated by animus. <em>Cf. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 115, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (a single act of harassment may make up part of a hostile work environment claim even though it \u201cmay not be actionable on its own\u201d). Therefore, the District Court\u2019s finding was not clear error. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6); <em>Halberstam v. Welch, </em>705 F.2d 472, 486 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (\u201c[The clear error] standard applies to the inferences drawn from findings of fact as well as to the findings themselves.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Finally, the Embassy argues that the District Court erred by considering the conduct of two of Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s \u201csupervisors\u201d\u2014Chantal Manes and Tual\u2014together. Ashraf-Hassan reported to Manes from 2002 to 2004, and then to Tual from 2004 to 2007. There is no categorical bar to considering the conduct of Manes and Tual together, as one series of acts. <em>Vickers v. Powell, </em>493 F.3d 186, 199 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\u201c[R]outine personnel actions such as [a change in supervisors] cannot be the type of intervening actions by the employer that would sever the earlier incidents from the more recent incidents constituting [a plain-tiffj\u2019s hostile environment claim.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration omitted)). Rather, separate acts may be treated collectively to constitute one \u201cunlawful employment practice,\u201d <em>ie. </em>a hostile work environment, if those acts are \u201cadequately connected to each other.\u201d <em>Baird v. Gotbaum, </em>662 F.3d 1246, 1252 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Here, the record contains evidence that Manes and Tual subjected Ashraf-Hassan to the same type of employment actions\u2014 harassment and termination motivated by race-, religion-, and national origin-based animus\u2014and did so with relative frequency over four years. Accordingly, the District Court did not commit clear error by treating the conduct of Manes and Tual as \u201cadequately connected to each other,\u201d and properly considered the conduct together in evaluating Ashraf-Hassan\u2019s hostile work environment claim. <em>See Vickers, </em>493 F.3d at 197-200.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Ashraf-Hassan prevailed on her hostile work environment claim. Pursuant to D.C. Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
