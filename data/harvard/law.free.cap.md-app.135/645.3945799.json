The ultimate and unwitting purchasers of that lot were appellants, Thomas and Deborah Carven.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>In 1986, appellants built their home on the lot in question, and in 1995 they discovered that they were not the only ones who occupied it. In approving the plans for appellants\u2019 home in accordance with the property\u2019s restrictive covenants, the owner developer, Louis J. Hickman, and his wife and alleged partner, Vivian M. Hickman,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had failed to mention the graveyard or that Mr. Hickman had left no headstone unturned in preparing their property for sale. In 1997, Mr. Hickman passed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">On December 16, 1997, appellants filed suit in the Circuit Court for Worcester County against Vivian M. Hickman, individually and as personal representative of the estate of her deceased husband, Louis J. Hickman, appellees, for deceit, breach of covenant of special warranties, and negligence. In response, appellees filed an answer and later an amended answer and a motion for summary judgment. From the granting of that motion, appellants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On February 29, 1944, Louis J. Hickman acquired the \u201cWarrington Farm\u201d, a 200-acre farm near Bishopville, Maryland. From that raw parcel of farmland, Hickman and his wife and alleged partner, Vivian M. Hickman, developed a 200-acre residential subdivision with over 150 lots now known as Holiday Harbor. Pursuant to a development plan, the Hickmans dug canals, built roads, installed underground electric service, granted rights of way for utilities and roads, and subdivided the property through a series of plats to create lots that could be conveyed separately. Those plats were recorded among the land records of Worcester County.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Restrictive covenants were placed on the lots of the development by deed. One such covenant prohibited a \u201cgraveyard\u201d from being \u201cerected, permitted, maintained or operated\u201d upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>any portion of the subdivision. Another required that the Hickmans first approve the construction plans of a lot owner before he or she could proceed with construction. In 1964, appellants claim, Mr. Hickman \u201cremoved the tombstones, markers, and other surface evidence of the graveyard with the use of a bulldozer, while leaving the graves underground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">On June 80, 1964, Plat No. 2 was recorded among the land records of Worcester County. That plat created Lot No. 96, but gave no indication of the presence of a graveyard on that property. Moreover, the Hickmans, according to appellants, failed to advise the county of its existence when they sought county approval of their plat.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The Hickmans later conveyed Lot No. 96 to Preston L. Tubbs, Louis P. Tubbs, and Louise T. Lynch by deed dated August 25, 1975. They, in turn, conveyed it by deed dated June 11, 1984 to Edward J. Bryant and Betty B. Bryant, who thereafter conveyed it to their son-in-law and daughter, Thomas and Deborah Carven (\u201cCarvens\u201d), by deed dated April 2, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Hickmans had had no contact with the Bryants or the Carvens before the Carvens acquired title to Lot No. 96. After acquiring title to that lot, however, the Carvens met with the Hickmans to obtain the Hickmans\u2019 approval of their home construction plans as they were required to do by the covenants. At that meeting, Mr. Hickman reviewed and approved the Carvens\u2019 plans. At no time, however, did either Hickman inform the Carvens of the existence of a graveyard on their lot. That same year, the Carvens began constructing their family residence. They did not discover the graveyard on their property during construction, but, nine years later, on January 11, 1995, they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">On September 29, 1997, Mr. Hickman died. Several months, later, on December 16, 1997, the Carvens filed their complaint in the Circuit Court for Worcester County against appellees, alleging deceit, breach of covenant of special warranty, and negligence. In response, appellees filed an answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>and then later an amended answer and a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">On June 30, 1999, the circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to the breach of covenant of special warranties claim on the ground that the special warranty in question did not extend to subsequent owners, but denied it as to the remaining claims, stating that \u00a7 5-108 (the statute of repose) did not apply to the conduct alleged in the complaint. Appellees filed a motion for reconsideration of that ruling. Upon reconsideration, the circuit court, in a written opinion dated September 27, 1999, granted summary judgment as to the remaining counts of the complaint on the ground that they were barred by the statute of repose. Appellants then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in'granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that appellants\u2019 claims were time barred by the statute of repose. That statute, \u00a7 5-108, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">(a) <em>Injury occurring more than 20 years </em>later:\u2014Except as provided by this section, no cause of action for damages accrues and a person may not seek contribution or indemnity for damages incurred when wrongful death, personal injury, or injury to real or personal property resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property occurs more than 20 years after the date the entire improvement first becomes available for its intended use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Citing that statute, the circuit court found that the creation of the subdivision and preparation of lots for sale constituted an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d and that \u201cthe injury [to appellant] accrued more than 20 years after the date the improvement first became available for its intended use,\u201d which, according to that court, was the date on which Plat No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>2 was recorded. On that basis, it granted summary judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In evaluating appellants\u2019 contention that the trial court erred in so ruling, we observe that summary judgment is appropriate only when, after viewing the motion and response in favor of the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>127 Md.App. 255, 269, 732 A.2d 912, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>359 Md. 513, 754 A.2d 1030 (2000); Md. Rule 2-501(e). The standard of review we are to apply \u201cis whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990). In making that determination, \u201cwe do not accord deference to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Lopata v. Miller, </em>122 Md.App. 76, 83, 712 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 286, 718 A.2d 234 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">As the facts pertinent to the motion for summary judgment are not in dispute, we turn to the question of whether the circuit court was \u201clegally correct\u201d in applying \u00a7 5-108 to these facts. In deciding that question, we shall consider the purpose and intent of the Legislature in enacting that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to effectuate and cany out legislative intent.\u201d <em>Rose v. Fox Pool Corp., </em>335 Md. 351, 358, 643 A.2d 906 (1994). Because every statute furthers some underlying purpose, we must construe a statute according to its general purposes and policies. <em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 643 A.2d 906. In interpreting a statute such as the one before us, we look first to the words of the statute, giving them their \u201cnatural and ordinary signification, bearing in mind the statutory aim and objective.\u201d <em>Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 262, 604 A.2d 483 (1992). \u201cIf the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Even if the statute is clear and unambiguous, however, \u201cwe are not \u2018precluded from consulting legislative history as part of the process of determining the legislative purpose or goal\u2019 of the law.\u201d <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 604, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990). Moreover, \u201cthe legislative history of a statute, including amendments that were considered and/or enacted as the statute passed through the Legislature, and the statute\u2019s relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation are \u2018external manifestations\u2019 or \u2018persuasive evidence\u2019 of legislative purpose that may be taken into consideration.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>335 Md. at 360, 643 A.2d 906. We next address the question of what is a statute of repose and then what purpose does it serve?</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Generally, a \u201cstatute of repose creates a substantive right in those protected to be free from liability after a legislatively-determined period of time,\u201d which is \u201ctypically an absolute time limit beyond which liability no longer exists and is not tolled for any reason.\u201d <em>First United Methodist Church of Hyattsville v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>882 F.2d 862, 866 (4th Cir.1989). It is a substantive grant of immunity derived from a legislative balance of economic considerations affecting the general public and the respective rights of potential plaintiffs and defendants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">A statute of repose is different from a statute of limitations, which is \u201ca procedural device that operates as a defense to limit the remedy available from an existing cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 865. Unlike a statute of limitations, a statute of repose is not triggered by the discovery rule. <em>Id. </em>at 865-66. Nor is it tolled by a defendant\u2019s fraudulent concealment of the cause of a plaintiffs injury. <em>Id. </em>at 866. Instead, it \u201cshelter[s] legislatively designated groups from property and personal injury actions after a period of time has elapsed ... and is unrelated to when an accident or discovery of damages occurs.\u201d <em>See </em>Susan C. Randall, Comment, <em>Due Process Challenge to Statutes of Repose, </em>40 Sw.L.J. 997, 998 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The catalyst for.enacting such statutes in many jurisdictions, including Maryland, was the dramatic expansion in the</p>\n<p id=\"ALF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>liability of builders, contractors, architects, engineers, and developers resulting from three developments: 1) the elimination of the \u201cprivity of contract\u201d doctrine<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a defense, <em>see Rose, </em>335 Md. at 362, 643 A.2d 906; <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Coupard, </em>304 Md. 340, 349, 499 A.2d 178 (1985); and <em>Randall, supra, </em>at 1000; 2) the declining acceptability of \u201cthe completed and excepted rule,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>see Randall, supra, </em>at 1000-01; and 3) the application of the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to state statutes of limitations. <em>See Rose, </em>335 Md. at 362, 643 A.2d 906; <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>304 Md. at 349, 499 A.2d 178; and <em>Randall, </em>supra, at 1001. \u201cTaken together these three legal developments meant that architects, engineers, contractors, and others involved in construction could be held liable indefinitely for property damage and personal injury caused by their work.\u201d <em>See </em>Randall, <em>supra, </em>at 1001. Thus, \u201c[ajrchitects and engineers, particularly concerned by these developments, turned to state legislatures for protection from this expanded liability.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>335 Md. at 362, 643 A.2d 906. The possibility that seemingly endless liability would deter such professionals from experimenting with new materials, designs, or procedures spurred the state legislatures into action. <em>See </em>Randall, <em>supra, </em>at 1000-02; Josephine Herring Hicks, <em>The Constitutionality of Statutes of Repose: Federalism Reigns, </em>38 Vand.L.Rev. 627, 633 (1985); <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>304 Md. at 354, 499 A.2d 178 (agreeing with the Supreme Court of Michigan that legislation was needed to \u201c \u2018reduce the potential liability\u2019 \u201d of professionals to \u201c \u2018encourage experimentation\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number><em>O\u2019Brien v. Hazelet &amp; Erdal, </em>410 Mich. 1, 299 N.W.2d 336, 342 (1980)). In Maryland, the Legislature responded by enacting Ch. 666 of the 1970 Laws of Maryland, formally codified in Article 57, \u00a7 20 of the Maryland Code, the precursor to \u00a7 5-108.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 5-108 indicates that the purpose of this statute was to impose a limit on the expansion of liability for professionals involved in making improvements to real property. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">This section is new language derived from Art. 57, \u00a7 20. It is believed that this is an attempt to relieve builders, contractors, landlords, and realtors of the risk of latent defects in design, construction, or maintenance of an improvement to realty manifesting themselves more than 20 years after the improvement is first put in use. The section is drafted in the form of a statute of limitation, but, in reality, it grants immunity from suit in certain instances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">According to that note, therefore, the purpose of \u00a7 5-108 was to protect builders, contractors, realtors, and landlords from suits for latent defects in design, construction, or maintenance of an improvement to real property that are brought more than twenty years after the improvement is first put to use. In granting immunity from such suits after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>twenty years has elapsed, the Legislature appeared to be striking a balance between encouraging innovation in the construction industry and ensuring public safety. One thing, however, is abundantly clear: the Legislature did not intend for \u00a7 5-108 to encompass a developer\u2019s desecration of a graveyard and his subsequent concealment of its existence to facilitate its sale as part of a residential lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The purpose and intent of the statute of repose was considered by the Court of Appeals in <em>Rose, </em>335 Md. at 361-74, 643 A.2d 906. In that case, the principal issue before the Court was \u201cwhether \u00a7 5-108(a) applies to a cause of action brought against the manufacturer of a residential, in-ground swimming pool for injuries caused by an alleged defect in the pool\u2019s design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354, 643 A.2d 906. The trial court held that it did and granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant manufacturer on the ground that \u00a7 5-108(a) barred the plaintiffs suit. <em>Id. </em>at 358, 643 A.2d 906. The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that the statute of repose applied to the facts of that case but nonetheless reversed the judgment of that court on the ground that \u201cthere [was] a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiffs injury occurred more than 20 years after the date the entire improvement first became available for its intended use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354-55, 643 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In reaching that conclusion, the Court of Appeals stated that \u201c[t]he specific statutory language of \u00a7 5-108(a) precludes all actions which meet two requirements: (1) the plaintiffs injuries must have resulted from the alleged defective and unsafe condition of \u2018an improvement to real property\u2019; and (2) 20 years must have passed since the \u2018entire improvement first bec[ame] available for its intended use.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 643 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The first requirement\u2014that \u201cthe plaintiffs injuries must have resulted from the alleged defective and unsafe condition of \u2018an improvement to real property\u2019 \u201d\u2014has three components: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>1) an improvement to real property, 2) a defective and unsafe condition of that improvement, and 3) injuries resulting from the defective and unsafe condition. Unfortunately, neither the language of the statute nor its legislative history provides much assistance in defining these three components. Indeed, as to the first component, the Court of Appeals observed that \u201cSection 5-108 itself does not define \u2018improvement to real property\u2019 and there is no clear indication in the legislative history of the statute as to what the term was meant to encompass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375, 643 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In defining that term, the Court of Appeals then prescribed a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d and adopted the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary definition of \u201can improvement to real property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 643 A.2d 906. That text defines such an improvement as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">A valuable addition made to property (usually real estate) or an amelioration in its condition, amounting to more than mere repairs or replacement, costing labor or capital, and intended to enhance its value, beauty or utility or to adapt it for new or further purposes. Generally has reference to buildings, but may also include any permanent structure or other development, such as a street, sidewalks, sewers, utilities, etc. An expenditure to extend the useful life of an asset or to improve its performance over that of the original asset. Such expenditures are capitalized as part of the asset\u2019s cost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 757 (6th ed.1990). The Court then set forth the factors that should be considered in determining whether something qualifies as an \u201cimprovement to real property.\u201d They are \u201cthe nature of the addition or betterment, its permanence and relationship to the land and its occupants, and its effect on the value and use of the property.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>335 Md. at 376-77, 643 A.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Although the decisions of our sister state courts are not binding on us, we find their definitions of this term to be helpful to our analysis. Other state courts have defined this term to mean \u201cerection of a building; replacing old buildings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>with new ones; substantial repairs to a building necessary to preserve a building; the making of substantial additions to or changes in existing buildings; construction of sidewalks; erection of fences; and the preparation of land for building sites,\u201d <em>Noll by Noll v. Harrisburg Area YMCA, </em>537 Pa. 274, 643 A.2d 81, 87 (1994) (internal citations omitted), as well as a circuit box and transformer that provided power to equipment in a computer room, <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Guardian Alarm Co. of Michigan, </em>231 Mich.App. 473, 586 N.W.2d 760, 762 (1998), and the construction of a road. <em>Milligan v. Tibbetts Engineering Corp., </em>391 Mass. 364, 461 N.E.2d 808, 809 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Equally helpful are the things that these courts have found not to be improvements to real property: temporary gas meters installed in a newly constructed shopping mall, <em>Allentown Plaza Assoc. v. Suburban Propane Gas Corp., </em>43 Md. App. 337, 346, 405 A.2d 326 (1979), demolition work to gut a building to prepare it for renovations, <em>Brandt v. Hallwood Management Co., </em>560 N.W.2d 396, 399-400 (Minn. Ct.App. 1997),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201ca survey [of land] and a plan dividing property into lots, at least where the plan is unrelated to any proposed construction or changes in the topography of the land,\u201d <em>Raffel v. Perley, </em>14 Mass.App.Ct. 242, 437 N.E.2d 1082, 1083 (1982),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>and \u201cthe removal of an underground storage tank.\u201d <em>Pitsch v. ESE Michigan, Inc., </em>233 Mich.App. 578, 593 N.W.2d 565, 577 (1999), <em>appeal denied, </em>459 Mich. 990, 595 N.W.2d 844 (1999).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The common denominator in all of these examples is that an improvement to real property is a tangible thing that is constructed, added, or developed as a permanent structure or part of a permanent structure on property. These examples are therefore consistent with the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary definition of \u201can improvement to real property,\u201d adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Rose, </em>which states that an improvement to real property \u201c[generally has reference to buddings, but may also include any permanent structure.... \u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In developing the farmland in question, appellees dug canals, built streets, and installed underground electrical service so that the property could be subdivided into individual lots for sale. While each of these items alone (canals, streets, and underground electrical service) may qualify as an improvement to real property, none of these improvements is relevant to our consideration of the applicability of the statute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>instant case; appellants do not allege that they suffered any injury resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of any of those improvements. While appellees\u2019 efforts in preparing Warrington Farm for sale improved the condition of that property and adapted it for new purposes, these efforts were not challenged as the ones creating a defective and unsafe condition, causing appellants\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Instead, the change in the land at issue here was the removal of headstones from a graveyard to conceal its existence from potential buyers. This act hardly qualifies as an improvement. It did not alter the status of that property; it merely concealed it. It certainly did not constitute \u201ca valuable addition to property ... or an amelioration in its condition, amounting to more than mere repair or replacement, costing labor or capital, and intended to enhance its value, beauty or utility or to adapt it for new or further purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nor did it constitute a \u201cpermanent structure\u201d or part' of one. <em>Id. If </em>we place it in the context of prevailing caselaw, it is moi\u2019e akin to the type of activity that other state courts have declined to define as improvements, such as demolition work inside a building to prepare it for renovations, see <em>Brandt, </em>560 N.W.2d at 399-400, or \u201cthe removal of an underground storage tank.\u201d <em>Pitsch, </em>593 N.W.2d at 577. But even these actions, which have been rejected by other courts as \u201cimprovements\u201d to real property, were at least arguably steps taken in the direction of improving a property. The removal of headstones, without any intention of removing the graves themselves, does not even rise to that level, let alone constitute an improvement itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Even if we were to find that appellees\u2019 conduct amounted to an improvement to real property, we find that that improvement was not in a \u201cdefective and unsafe condition\u201d as that term has been defined by caselaw and the statute of repose or its legislative history. The principal injury claimed by appellants is that \u201ctheir realty and improvements\u201d to that realty \u201care worthless\u201d because of the existence of a graveyard on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The legislative history cited above indicates that the Legislature intended a defective and unsafe condition to cover latent defects in parts that were used in the improvement, flaws in design that were relied upon in constructing the improvement, or defects in workmanship in the construction of the improvement. <em>See Hilliard &amp; Bartko Joint Venture v. Fedco Systems, Inc., </em>309 Md. 147, 161, 522 A.2d 961 (1987) and Revisor\u2019s Note to \u00a7 5-108(a). For example, the defective and unsafe condition to real property found by the Court of Appeals in <em>Rose </em>was a design flaw in the construction of the swimming pool, which was alleged to have caused Rose\u2019s personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Here, it is difficult for us to ascertain what the defective and unsafe condition is under the statute of repose because it is unclear what the improvement is. But whether we find that the alleged \u201cimprovement\u201d at issue here was the removal of the headstones or, as the circuit court asserted, the creation of a subdivision and preparation of lots for sale, the defective and unsafe condition can only conceivably be the graves remaining underground on appellants\u2019 property. These graves do not amount to an <em>unsafe </em>or even defective condition of an improvement, as all graveyards by definition have graves. On the other hand, if by \u201cdefective\u201d the parties are referring to the effect that an unmarked and unrecorded graveyard has on the title, we observe that there is no precedent for finding that a defective title constitutes \u201ca defective and unsafe condition\u201d under the statute of repose. Moreover, we note that as a condition of applicability, the statute of repose requires the improvement be both defective and unsafe. There is no evidence that the graveyard in question is unsafe, only unmarked.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">We now turn to the question of whether the injury alleged by appellants is one that the statute of repose was intended to address. Appellants assert that the principal injury they sustained was a diminution in the value of their property because of the presence of the graveyard on their lot or the cost of disinterment. This injury does not fall within the purview of the statute of repose for two reasons. First, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>injury did not result \u201cfrom the defective and unsafe condition\u201d of an improvement to real property, at least not the improvement identified by the circuit court, namely, the creation of a subdivision and the preparation of lots for sale. As noted earlier, the presence of the graveyard on appellants\u2019 property may not have enhanced the value of their property but it did not constitute a \u201cdefective and unsafe condition.\u201d Consequently, there is no connection between the improvement identified by the circuit court and the injury claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Second, a financial injury of the kind suffered by appellants is not covered by the statute of repose. Although no Maryland appellate court has yet addressed this issue, the Court of Appeals of Mississippi recently did. <em>Air Comfort Systems, Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>760 So.2d 43 (Miss.App.2000). In considering a statute of repose similar to our own,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that court held that a financial injury caused by correcting an alleged defect in a building, not because of its unsafe condition but because a subcontractor used an incorrect part, is not the type of injury contemplated by the statute of repose because it \u201cis not damage to property or personal injury under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48. In arriving at this conclusion, the Mississippi court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>pointed out that what the plaintiff was really seeking there was contract damages arising out of a breach of contract, not out of an injury to person or property as contemplated by the Mississippi statute of repose. <em>Id. </em>at 47-48. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">The obvious problem for [plaintiff] is that what it is seeking are contract damages for an alleged breach, not damages arising out of an injury to person or property. True, the contract concerned real property. Yet if the claim relating to construction of a building is solely for failure to place the contracted-for quality of shingles on a roof, or to'use the correct brand of plumbing fixtures, or to meet the contract schedule for completion, that is a contract claim and not a personal injury or property damage claim____However, if water damage inside the structure proximately resulted from using a lower quality shingles on a roof than was required under the contract, the statute of repose would be relevant to a claim for that property damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">We find the reasoning of that court sound. We therefore conclude that a purely financial injury, such as that claimed by appellants, does not fall within the purview of the Maryland statute of repose. The diminution in the value of a residential property caused by the discovery of the presence of a cemetery on that property and the cost of disinterring the bodies of that graveyard are not the injury to personal or real property, or personal injury, contemplated by the Maryland statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">Because we find that none of the elements of the first requirement set forth in <em>Rose </em>for statute of repose coverage are satisfied, we need not consider the second requirement (\u201cwhether 20 years passed since the \u2018entire improvement first bec[ame] available for its intended use.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">In sum, we find that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment based on the statute of repose, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>cause appellants\u2019 claims did not involve a personal injury or an injury to personal or real property resulting from a defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property.
