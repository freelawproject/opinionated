The new question presented by this case is whether a receiver with a charging order against limited partnership interests has a right to be notified of a partnership opportunity-in this case, an opportunity to purchase the partnership\u2019s debt. Affirming the trial court, we hold that general partners of a limited partnership do not have a duty to notify a charging creditor about that partnership opportunity, and that the charging creditor does not have standing to assert the debtor partners\u2019 management rights to participate in or object to such a purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">FACTS AND BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">In 1988, Arnold D. Wolfe co-founded Bellerive Condominiums Limited Partnership (\u201cBellerive\u201d or the \u201cPartnership\u201d), appellee. A corporation controlled by Wolfe, U.S. Investment Group, Inc. (\u201cUSIG\u201d), was one of Bellerive\u2019s three general partners. The other two general partners were Capital Management and Development Corporation (\u201cCapital Management\u201d), a Delaware corporation controlled by its president, Bechara Nammour, and Express Development Corporation, a New York corporation controlled by its president, Richard J. Seikaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Wolfe borrowed $50,000 from Richard C. Beavers and Richard P. Beavers, and contributed the funds to the Partnership. In turn, the Partnership used the funds to put a deposit on real property in Anne Arundel County. The Partnership\u2019s business plan was to develop and sell the property as condominiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>As a result of the $50,000 capital contribution, Wolfe also became one of eight limited partners in Bellerive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the terms of Bellerive\u2019s Partnership Agreement, as amended (the \u201cPartnership Agreement\u201d), Wolfe had priority to the first $50,000 in Partnership profits. Like Wolfe, Nammour and Seikaly also held both general and limited partnership interests through their business entities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">To complete the purchase and develop the property, the Partnership borrowed from the National Bank of Washington (\u201cNBW\u201d). A $300,000 loan was evidenced by a September 24, 1988 note and deed of trust on the property (the \u201cLoan,\u201d \u201cNote,\u201d and \u201cDeed of Trust\u201d). The Loan was increased to $400,000 in November 1989. But the development plans did not proceed as the Bellerive partners had planned. The Partnership operated at a loss, despite capital calls and loans from its partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">With no Partnership profits from which to pay the Beavers, Wolfe defaulted on his repayment obligation. In May 1991, the Beavers obtained a judgment against Wolfe and USIG, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>the amount of $124,040.74. Attorney Carlton M. Green, appellant, represented the Beavers in that action. In his collection efforts, Green became aware that Wolfe\u2019s priority right to Partnership profits might be used to satisfy the judgment, and that there might be profits if the Partnership\u2019s development and sale plans were successful. Green sought a charging order against Wolfe\u2019s interest as a limited partner and USIG\u2019s interest as a general partner. On October 28, 1993, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County entered a charging order (the \u201cCharging Order\u201d) appointing Green as the receiver for any share of Partnership profits payable to either Wolfe or USIG, and lor \u201cany other money that is or becomes due to said judgment debtors by reason of their partnership interest.\u201d In November, the Partnership was advised of the Charging Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Meanwhile, unable to develop and sell the property as planned, the Partnership defaulted on the Note. At about the same time, NBW was dissolved, and the FDIC acquired the Note. By April 1994, the Loan balance exceeded $590,000. The FDIC scheduled a foreclosure sale for July 19, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Seeking to avoid foreclosure, Seikaly and Nammour negotiated with the FDIC to purchase the Note at a discount. The FDIC agreed to sell the Note for $375,000. On May 31, 1994, Seikaly and Nammour entered into an agreement to purchase the Note from the FDIC. The scheduled settlement date was July 15th. If settlement did not occur by July 19th, the FDIC planned to proceed with foreclosure scheduled for that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Seikaly and Nammour then invited all of the Bellerive partners to participate in the purchase of the Note. In a letter dated June 11, 1994, they informed the partners about the opportunity to purchase the Partnership\u2019s Note at a discount, and invited each partner to participate <em>pro rata </em>in the purchase. The letter specified the amount each partner would have to contribute, and included payment instructions. At the end of the letter, there were lines to indicate whether the partner \u201cacknowledged, accepted and agreed\u201d or \u201cdecline[d] the offer to purchase a share of the Note.\u201d The letter further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>stated that if payment was not made by July 1, Messrs. Nammour and Seikaly \u201cshall assume you choose not to participate in the Note purchase----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">By this time, neither Wolfe nor USIG was active in Partnership affairs. Seikaly testified that USIG \u201cwent out of business so they ceased to be a general partner.\u201d The notice letters for Wolfe and USIG were sent via certified mail to the most recent address specified for Partnership correspondence. But both letters were returned, marked \u201cmoved, not forwardable.\u201d No notice of the opportunity to purchase the Note was sent to the receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\u25a0The FDIC required the consent of the Partnership to the purchase and assignment of the Note. The partners other than Wolfe and USIG consented to the Note purchase. All but three of the partners participated in purchasing the Note at the discounted price.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With the Note and Deed of Trust now held in friendly hands, the Partnership continued efforts to develop and market the property. Those efforts included redesigning the development concept as townhomes, and re-marketing the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In January, April, and October, 1995, the receiver wrote to the Partnership\u2019s counsel to inquire about the status of the Partnership, but received no response. In June 1996, the receiver filed a complaint for dissolution of the Partnership. He alleged that it was not reasonable to carry on the business at a loss, and that Capital Management had acted unreasonably and had failed to account to the Partnership for any income or expenses. The purpose of the petition was to force a sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. Shortly after filing the complaint, the receiver learned about the discounted Note purchase.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By Consent Order dated December 20, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the receiver agreed to stay his dissolution effort. \u25a0 in order to give the Partnership more time to sell the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In December 1997, the Partnership was able to sell the property under the redesigned development concept, at a contract price of $825,000. A Consent Order authorized the sale, but required escrow of $60,000 of the settlement proceeds pending judicial determination of the receiver\u2019s claims. On December 30, 1997, $676,374.45 of the settlement proceeds was used toward paying off the Note at its full face value, with none of the loan discount passed through to the Partnership. There was an additional balance due on the Note. As a result of the discount purchase, the sale of the property, and repayment of the Note three and a half years later, each of the Purchasing Partners benefitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">After settlement, the receiver sought repayment of the $50,000 owed to Wolfe from the $60,000 in escrowed funds. He complained that the Purchasing Partners had breached their fiduciary duties by (1) failing to notify him of the opportunity to purchase the Note; and (2) failing to obtain the consent of Wolfe or USIG to the purchase. He asserted that because Wolfe and USIG had not consented to the Note purchase, the Purchasing Partners held any monies they made on the Note for the benefit of the Partnership. If the amount of the Loan discount were credited back to the Partnership, the receiver argued, there would be ample Partnership profit from which to make the priority repayment of Wolfe\u2019s $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">After an evidentiary hearing, Judge Joseph P. Manck of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County rejected the receiver\u2019s contentions in a written Memorandum Opinion and Order dated June 18, 1998 (the \u201cOrder\u201d). The court ruled <em>inter alia </em>that the receiver was not entitled to notice of the Note purchase, that the Purchasing Partners were not obligated to credit any proceeds from the Partnership\u2019s repayment of the Note back to the Partnership, and that any benefit that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Purchasing Partners made on the Note was not \u201cPartnership profit.\u201d The court also ruled that $37,500 in settlement proceeds had been improperly paid to Express Development for work to redesign the project concept, and ordered that amount to be credited back to the Partnership. The receiver\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the Order was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The court subsequently ordered an accounting. On July 14, 1999, Tim Murphy, CPA, submitted his report' and recommendations (the \u201cMurphy Report\u201d). Murphy recommended that the escrowed $60,000, plus the $37,500 credited back to the Partnership as a result of the Order, should be used <em>inter alia </em>to pay the remaining debt to the Purchasing Partners on the Note. Because the debt on the Note exceeded the total amount available for distribution, Murphy concluded that there were no Partnership profits, and thus, that there was no \u201cprofit\u201d with which to pay the receiver\u2019s priority claim. On October 14, 1999, the court ordered distribution of the escrowed funds as recommended in the Murphy Report and entered a final order in accordance with its previous Order. The receiver filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">In an appeal from a bench trial, we \u201creview the case on both the law and the evidence.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c). If the issue to which appellant excepts, and on which the court ruled, is a purely legal issue, our review is expansive. <em>See In re Michael G., </em>107 Md.App. 257, 265, 667 A.2d 956 (1995). \u201cThe clearly erroneous standard for appellate review ... does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based on findings of fact.\u201d <em>See Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990). Because there is no dispute over the trial court\u2019s findings of fact in this case, and the issues raised by appellant involve only legal questions, we must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>whether the trial court was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 592, 578 A.2d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Receiver\u2019s Rights Under The Charging Order</p>\n<p id=\"AMV\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Collection Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">A charging order is a unique tool. Although it has some characteristics of both an assignment and an attachment, it is neither. <em>See Bank of Bethesda v. Koch, </em>44 Md.App. 350, 354, 408 A.2d 767 (1979). Charging orders originated as a statutory solution to cumbersome common law collection procedures \u201cthat were ill-suited for reaching partnership interests.\u201d <em>91st Street Joint Venture v. Goldstein, </em>114 Md.App. 561, 567, 691 A.2d 272 (1997) (detailing development of charging orders and relevant case law and commentary). They are purely statutory tools that judgment creditors use to reach partnership interests of indebted partners. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, we have characterized a charging order against a limited partnership interest as \u201cnothing more than a legislative means of providing a creditor some means of getting at a debtor\u2019s ill-defined interest in a statutory bastard, surnamed \u2018partnership,\u2019 but corporately protecting participants by limiting their liability as are corporate shareholders.\u201d <em>Bank of Bethesda, </em>44 Md.App. at 354, 408 A.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Charging orders against a limited partnership interest are governed by Title 10 of the Corporations and Associations Article (\u201cCA\u201d), known as the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under section 10-705, judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>creditors may obtain a charging order against the partnership interest of either a general or limited partner of a limited partnership. <em>See Lauer Construction v. Schrift, </em>123 Md.App. 112, 116, 716 A.2d 1096, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Gibson\u2019s Lodging v. Lauer, </em>352 Md. 310, 721 A.2d 989 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">A charging order gives the charging creditor only limited access to the partnership interest of the indebted partner. Section 10-705 restricts the rights conferred under a charging order against an interest in a limited partnership.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner, the court may charge the partnership interest of the partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an. assignee of the partnership interest....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW-\">CA \u00a7 10-705 (emphasis added). Under section 10-702, the rights of an assignee of a limited partnership interest are also explicitly limited by design.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become a partner or, unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement, exercise any rights of a partner. Unless otherwise provided in the partnership agreement, an assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distributions to which the assignor would be entitled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">CA \u00a7 10-702 (emphasis added). An assignee of a limited partnership interest generally cannot become a partner without the consent of all other partners. <em>See </em>CA \u00a7 10-703(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">In two recent decisions, this Court has examined limitations on the rights conferred by a charging order against a partnership interest. In <em>91st Street Joint Venture, supra, </em>we addressed for the first time the scope of judicial authority to fashion relief under a charging order. <em>See 91st Street, </em>114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Md.App. at 570, 691 A.2d 272. We outlined the two basic methods by which a creditor may proceed to collect from an indebted partner. <em>See id. </em>at 572, 691 A.2d 272. The preferred collection method is to use a charging order to divert the debtor partner\u2019s right to partnership profits to the judgment creditor. <em>See id. </em>\u201c \u2018If this method is ineffectual there is another more drastic course of action....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Gose, <em>The Charging Order Under the Uniform Partnership Act, </em>28 Wash.L.Rev. 1, 10 (1953)). That alternative is \u201cthe ultimate transfer of the debtor partner\u2019s interest....\u201d <em>Id. </em>We recognized that the court\u2019s powers to appoint a receiver, to order an accounting, and to make other orders as \u201cthe circumstances of the case may require\u201d are merely \u201csubsidiary aids to the collecting process,\u201d which the court may exercise in its discretion. <em>Id. </em>(quoting Gose, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Examining cases from other jurisdictions, we held that under section 9-505 of the Revised Uniform Partnership Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cthe ordering of a sale is [also] something that the trial court may do as a supplement to charging the interest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>partnership and appointing a receiver for profits,\u201d but that \u201cany transfer of the debtor partner\u2019s interest is to take place pursuant to the rules governing judicial sales.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577, 691 A.2d 272. Accordingly, we held that a receiver must obtain judicial permission for such a forced transfer of the debtor partner\u2019s interest, and that a receiver with a charging order against an interest in a general partnership is not entitled to assign the charged partnership interest without court order or the consent of the remaining partners. <em>See id. </em>at 573, 576-78, 691 A.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">But we also noted in <em>91st Street </em>that under section 10-705, the rights of a creditor against a limited partnership interest are \u201cmore limited ... than that provided for in the UPA and ULPA\u201d governing general partnerships. <em>Id. </em>at 570 n. 2, 691 A.2d 272. The next year, in <em>Lauer Construction, supra, </em>we addressed for the first time the nature and extent of those rights. We held that creditors with a charging order against a limited partnership interest are entitled to the same collection remedy as creditors with a charging order against a general partnership interest, with the same limitations. <em>See Lauer Construction, </em>123 Md.App. at 119, 716 A.2d 1096. We based our decision on the absence of explicit enforcement or collection mechanisms in section 10-705 and similarities in the right to receive partnership distributions under both RULPA and RUPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">But our holdings in both <em>91st Street </em>and <em>Lauer Constniction </em>addressed only the scope of a creditor\u2019s \u201ccollection remedy,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a creditor\u2019s right to \u201cliquidate\u201d the debtor partner\u2019s financial interest in the partnership, because that partner\u2019s right to partnership distributions \u201ccollateralizes\u201d the judgment debt as a result of a charging order. Both cases considered how a creditor could use his unique charging order tool to collect the debt by reaching the indebted partner\u2019s financial interest in the partnership. Both cases concluded that these collection rights may be exercised only through the courts, and must be judicially determined on a case by case basis. In examining these judicially supervised collection methods, we were not presented with, and therefore did not address, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>whether a creditor also could use the same charging order as a tool to demand information about partnership debt, partnership opportunities, or other partnership affairs, or to participate in the partnership\u2019s decisions regarding those matters. In addressing the collection rights of a charging creditor, neither case addressed whether the charging creditor may exercise the management rights of the debtor partner. We address that question now.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Management Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In this case, the receiver seeks more than the collection rights that we addressed in <em>91st Street </em>and <em>Lauer Construction. </em>In the trial court, he asserted that by virtue of the Charging Order, he had the same right as USIG and Wolfe to be notified of the opportunity to purchase the Note, and that he was entitled to \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of Wolfe and USIG to demand that the amount of the loan discount be credited back to the Partnership because the Purchasing Partners did not obtain their consent to the Note purchase. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court concluded that the receiver \u201cwas not entitled to any notice\u201d of the Note purchase or any credit for the difference between the amount that the Purchasing Partners paid for the Note and the amount they received at the December 1997 settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The receiver moved to reconsider, arguing that the real issue was not whether the receiver received notice of the opportunity, but whether the debtor partners had consented to the Note purchase. As authority for his consent argument, he relied on section 9-404, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac5\">[e]very partner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Alr\">CA \u00a7 9-404. At a hearing on the motion to reconsider, counsel for the Partnership responded that the duty of general partners under section 9-404 is to \u201cfully disclose and give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>opportunity to the partners,\u201d and that is exactly what the Bellerive general partners had done. The Partnership argued that the partners\u2019 fiduciary duty was to disclose and offer the opportunity to the other partners, that section 9-404 does not require \u201cliteral consent,\u201d and that even if it did, the receiver had no standing to assert the rights of the debtor partners under section 9-404. The trial court issued a second written opinion and order, finding <em>inter alia </em>that \u201cthe partners discharged their fiduciary duty to Mr. Wolfe and USI[G] by offering [them] the opportunity to join in the purchase of the note.\u201d The court also stated that it was \u201cnot convinced that [p]laintiff, as receiver, has a right to challenge the purchase of the note.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">On appeal, the receiver renews his notice and consent arguments. Relying on section 9-404 and language in <em>Rector v. Azzato, </em>74 Md.App. 684, 539 A.2d 1162 (1988), and <em>Leventhal v. Five Seasons Partnership, </em>84 Md.App. 603, 581 A.2d 449 (1990), the receiver repeatedly asserts that he was entitled to notice of the purchase and to assert the debtor partners\u2019 rights under section 9-404, because the Charging Order placed him \u201cin the shoes of the debtor\u201d and entitled him \u201cto do that which the debtor/partner could have done.\u201d <em>See Leventhal, </em>84 Md.App. at 606, 581 A.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The receiver\u2019s reliance on this language is misplaced. Neither <em>Rector </em>nor <em>Leventhal </em>defined the nature and scope of the charging creditor\u2019s rights so broadly. Neither case held that a receiver with a charging order against limited partnership interests stands in the debtor partners\u2019 shoes for all purposes. Neither case involved the debtor partner\u2019s right to receive information about limited partnership opportunities, or to participate in limited partnership affairs. In fact, neither case involved a partnership opportunity, and <em>Leventhal </em>did not even involve a limited partnership. <em>Cf. Rector, supra </em>(judgment creditor of assignee of limited partnership interest may obtain charging order against that interest); <em>Leventhal, supra </em>(receiver with charging order against interests in general partnership' may petition for dissolution of general partnership).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Like the trial court, we reject the receiver\u2019s \u201csubstituted shoes\u201d argument, because it is contrary to unambiguous statutory limitations on a charging order against a limited partnership interest and to sound principles of limited partnership law. Distilled to its essence, the receiver\u2019s argument is that the Charging Order operated as either a judicial assignment of the debtor partners\u2019 management rights in the Partnership, or as a judicial substitution of the receiver for the debtor partners for all purposes. We decline the receiver\u2019s request to expand the rights conferred by a charging order beyond the collection rights we discussed in <em>Lauer Construction </em>to include the management rights of a debtor partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">As reflected in the unambiguous language of sections 10-702, 10-703, and 10-705, a charging order against a limited partnership interest does not operate as an unlimited assignment of all partnership rights, or as a judicial \u201cswap\u201d of the creditor for the debtor partner. When read <em>in pan materia, </em>these sections make it clear that a charging order against a limited partnership interest does not entitle the creditor <em>\u201cto become a partner, or </em>... <em>exercise any rights of a partner. \u201d </em>\u00a7 10-702 (emphasis added). The \u201crights of a partner\u201d include the right to information and the right to participate in partnership decisions that the receiver is demanding in this instance. These rights are not analogous to \u201cdistribution\u201d or \u201ccollection\u201d rights, nor are they merely incidental or ancillary to the receiver\u2019s right to receive the debtor partner\u2019s distributions. Instead, we conclude that these rights are fundamental \u201cmanagement rights of a partner\u201d that were not transferred to the receiver by the Charging Order. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\"> The Charging Order in this case covered the limited partnership interests of both a general partner (USIG) and a limited partner (Wolfe). The Partnership Agreement reflected the characteristic management relationship between general and limited partners. It provided that the three general partners \u201cha[d] full power and authority to manage the business, property and affairs of the Partnership,\u201d and that they would \u201ckeep all partners reasonably informed, upon their request, as to the business of the Partnership.... \u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Agreement, however, also prohibited the limited partners from voting on or participating in \u201cmajor decisions.\u201d It specifically provided that no \u201c \u2018Major Decisions\u2019 ... will be made, taken or implemented by the general partners ... without the prior concurrence of two-thirds of the general partners.... \u201d (Emphasis added). All matters relating to the Partnership\u2019s debt were defined as \u201cMajor Decisions.\u201d Thus, in the context of this dispute, USIG, as one of Bellerive\u2019s three general partners, had the right to request information about Partnership debt and opportunities, and a right to participate in making decisions regarding those matters as a minority of the three general partners. As a limited partner, Wolfe had only the right to request information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The question raised by the receiver is whether the Charging Order entitled him to exercise any of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the receiver had no right to demand or receive notice of the opportunity to purchase the Note. Under RULPA, among those \u201crights of a partner\u201d that may not be exercised by a creditor with a charging order against a limited partnership interest is the right to demand and receive information about partnership transactions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our construction of RULPA is based on language in its statutory predecessor. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1975), \u00a7 10-118 of the Corporations and Associations Article; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ULPA \u00a7 19. The RULPA drafters\u2019 official comment to section 10-702 states that the language prohibiting transferees from \u201cexercis[ing] the rights of a partner\u201d is derived from the following sentence in ULPA: \u201cAn assignee who does not become a substituted limited partner has <em>no right to require any information or account of the partnership transactions </em>.\u00a7 10-118, <em>supra </em>(emphasis added); <em>see </em>ULPA \u00a7 19 (official comment). Information regarding partnership transactions includes information regarding partnership property and partnership opportunities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the receiver had only the rights of an assignee, and such rights do not include the right to demand or receive information regarding partnership opportunities, the trial court was legally correct in ruling that the receiver was not entitled to separate notice of the opportunity to purchase the Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We also conclude that the receiver had no standing to assert any right that the debtor partners may have had to consent to or challenge the Note purchase under section 9-404.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We think that, like rights to obtain partnership information, rights under section 9-404 are fundamental \u201crights of a partner\u201d that are not transferred to a creditor by a charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>order. Under sections 10-702 and 10-705, partners whose partnership interests have been assigned or charged remain partners and may continue to exercise their rights as a partner. Prohibiting a third party creditor from exercising the debtor partner\u2019s management rights reflects the fundamental principle that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">partners should be able to choose their associates. The principle is not violated by the transfer of purely financial rights through the assignment of a partner\u2019s interest in the partnership, but it would be violated by the admission of a new speaking and voting member into the closely knit arrangement that typifies the ... partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\"><em>Bromberg and Ribstein, supra, </em>\u00a7 3.05(c)(3)(vi)(4), at 3:86.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In the context of a proposal to purchase partnership debt, the right to consent under section 9-404 is essentially a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>to participate in the decision regarding whether the partnership should commit its resources to pursue the partnership opportunity. Like the right to information about partnership opportunities, a partner\u2019s right to consent to another partner\u2019s pursuit of a partnership opportunity is a management right of a partner that remains with the indebted partner after his right to receive distributions in the limited partnership has been transferred via a charging order. Here, the debtor partners neither objected to the Note purchase nor sought to assert rights under section 9-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">We recognize the heightened fairness concerns when the partnership opportunity at issue is the purchase of the partnership\u2019s debt,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that decisions regarding the partnership\u2019s debt may have a substantial impact on the financial interests of all partners. But we decline to create an exception to section 10-702 and 10-705 that would allow a receiver with a charging order to assert the rights of the indebted partner under section 9-404 in matters involving information and decisions about the Partnership\u2019s debt and about opportunities and plans to purchase that debt. We are not free to simply ignore that RULPA prohibits a charging creditor from exercising such fundamental rights of a partner. Adopting exceptions for partnership debt or partnership opportunity cases would be nothing less than judicially amending the language of sections 10-702, 10-703, and 10-705. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Even if we could create a partnership debt/partnership opportunity exception for charging orders, we would not, because such an exception would \u201cswallow the rule\u201d and undermine the important purpose of RULPA\u2019s limitation on the rights conferred by a charging order. Indeed, it could be argued that most management decisions involve a \u201cpartnership opportunity\u201d of one sort or another. Similarly, most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>management decisions have the potential to affect the partnership\u2019s debt. Thus, a \u201cpartnership debt/partnership opportunity\u201d exception would be difficult to interpret, enforce, and limit. By expanding the rights conferred by a charging order beyond the judicially supervised collection rights of a creditor that we have addressed in our previous decisions, we would defeat one of the primary purposes and benefits of having a uniform limited partnership act\u2014to provide the clarity, predictability, and certainty that facilitate limited partnership investment and business.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Instead, restricting the rights conferred by a charging order under section 10-705 promotes the general purpose of limited partnership acts, which is not primarily to protect or assist creditors, but to encourage investing by enabling limited partners to invest money and to share in the profits, but without risking more than the amount they contributed. <em>See Gilman Paint &amp; Varnish Co. v. Legum, </em>197 Md. 665, 670, 80 A.2d 906 (1951); <em>Klein, </em>284 Md. at 51, 395 A.2d 126. In <em>Lauer Construction, supra, </em>we explicitly recognized that limiting a creditor\u2019s rights under a charging order \u201cprotect[s] the partnership business and prevent[s] the disruption, that would result if creditors of a partner executed directly on partnership assets.\u201d <em>Lauer Construction, </em>123 Md.App. at 115, 716 A.2d 1096. By limiting a creditor\u2019s right to exercise the debtor partner\u2019s management rights, we ensure that creditors of a limited partner cannot disrupt partnership business or interfere with the management rights of other partners. In particular, this limitation prevents third party creditors from using a charging order as a license to \u201csqueeze\u201d other limited partners into paying off obligations of the debtor partner, as the necessary cost of eliminating the risk of such interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">These reasons for excluding third party creditors from a seat at the partnership\u2019s management table are no less applicable\u2014and perhaps are even more applicable\u2014when the issue under consideration is what to do about partnership debt or about a partnership opportunity. If a charging creditor is permitted to exercise management rights of the debtor partners in matters pertaining to partnership debt or partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>opportunities, that third party creditor is in an enhanced position to wield any of the debtor partner\u2019s management rights as a tool to obtain payment of the judgment debt. Undoubtedly, investors contemplating a limited partnership opportunity would be discouraged by the possibility of having to satisfy or deal with creditors of each partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The receiver complains that the general partners failed to make a capital call, and that they were obligated to do so when the Partnership had insufficient funds to make the mortgage payments. We are not convinced that the provision of the Partnership Agreement cited by the receiver mandates a capital call. The Partnership Agreement allows the general partners to \u201clend to the partnership\u201d any amount required for \u201cadditional funds for partnership purposes,\u201d and to \u201ccharge interest therefore at such rate of interest as the general partners may from time to time determine.\u201d The Agreement also provides that \u201cif the general partners do not elect to lend such funds to the Partnership, or to borrow such funds, ... all as determined by the affirmative vote of two-thirds <em>(%) </em>of the general partners ... the Managing Partner shall call upon all of the partners (general and limited) to invest proportionately....\u201d Thus, it is clear that the general partners could choose to lend to the partnership themselves, rather than make a capital call on all the partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In this context, we do not see a difference between lending directly, and purchasing an outstanding loan made by a third party. Not only did the general partners have authority under the Partnership Agreement to assume the Loan, but their decision to do so benefitted the Partnership. The purpose of the purchase was to avoid the scheduled foreclosure of the Partnership\u2019s sole asset, and the Note purchase \u201cbought time\u201d for the Partnership to obtain a return on its investment by having the Purchasing Partners hold the Partnership\u2019s debt and assume all risk of nonpayment for a period of more than three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">We have also considered the receiver\u2019s argument that the Purchasing Partners knew about the receiver and the Charg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ing Order before they sent notice of the purchase opportunity, knew that the receiver had asked for information regarding Partnership developments, and knew that the notices sent to the debtor partners had been returned. None of these factors changes our analysis or our decision. The fact is that the receiver held only a charging order against limited partnership interests, and not a full partnership interest with its concomitant management rights. As RULPA and the Partnership Agreement make clear, if the receiver wished to become a substituted partner, he was obligated to apply for and obtain the consent of all other partners. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-703. There is no evidence that he even attempted to do so. Moreover, the receiver seems to forget that a charging order does not prevent indebted partners from participating in partnership affairs, at least to the extent an applicable partnership agreement allows. Nor does it prohibit the indebted partner from keeping the charging creditor informed about partnership affairs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">We do not think that the receiver or judgment creditors are burdened unfairly by the denial of these management rights. Like other well-informed creditors, they presumably knew that partnership interests are notoriously poor security for the repayment of a debt. \u201cCredit extenders who look to a partner\u2019s interest in a partnership as a possible source of satisfaction are well advised to take and perfect a security interest rather than rely on a charging order ... [because a] partner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ship interest is not very good collateral.... \u201d IV <em>Bromberg and Ribstein, supra, </em>at \u00a7 13.07(a), at 13:43. Simply stated, lenders should not rely on a charging order as a <em>post hoc </em>substitute for other forms of security that might have been available at the time credit was extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The trial court was legally correct in ruling that the receiver had no right to notice of the opportunity to purchase the Loan. The receiver had no standing to assert any right that the debtor partners may have had to challenge the Note purchase under section 9-404. As a result of our holding regarding the receiver\u2019s limited rights and standing under the Charging Order, we will not address the receiver\u2019s derivative contentions of error regarding the escrowed funds, the interest rate, and the trial court\u2019s adoption of the Murphy Report, except to affirm that distribution of the escrowed funds, as recommended m the Murphy Report and approved by the trial court, may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Vector was indebted to the Partnership, apparently as a result of its failure to meet the Partnership\u2019s capital calls. Under the Partnership Agreement, Vector's partnership interest was diluted due to the debt. In May, 1990, Vector's Partnership interest, and its debt to the Partnership, were split among its three principals, including Wolfe, and assigned to them with the consent of the other partners.
