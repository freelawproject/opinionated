Welsh was granted a Judgment of Absolute Divorce from appellee Timothy E. Welsh in the Circuit Court for Carroll County on September 27, 1999. Appellant initially filed an action for divorce on grounds of adultery in the spring of 1994 in the Circuit Court for Howard County. The case was subsequently transferred to the Circuit Court for Carroll County in June 1994 because all of the circuit court judges sitting in Howard County recused themselves.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee filed a counterclaim for divorce on grounds of a two-year separation. The court ordered that appellee pay appellant $500 per week as pendente lite alimony and permit her use of a condominium owned by the parties. On December 6, 1996, appellant filed an interlocutory appeal protesting three rulings on motions made by the court. We filed an unreported opinion in the matter, <em>Welsh v. Welsh, </em>117 Md.App. 756, No. 103, September Term 1996, (October 15, 1997), and thereafter the case proceeded to trial on the merits on each parties\u2019 amended complaint in March 1999 and again in June 1999. The circuit court\u2019s Judgment of Divorce was issued on Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>tember 27, 1999 and both parties filed separate Motions to Alter or Amend Judgment on September 6 and 7, 1999, respectively.

In 1972, the couple purchased a twenty-two acre property with a twenty-two room manor home known as Font Hill Manor Farm (Font Hill), with accompanying buildings, one of which is known as the Dairy Bam/Chilling House, which appellee uses as an office.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Appellee is sixty-one years of age and holds an undergraduate accounting degree and a law degree. From 1961 to 1966 he worked for the Internal Revenue Service while earning his law degree and thereafter he opened his own. law practice. From 1969 to 1973, appellee was employed as an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Howard County and, from 1979 through 1987, he was the Howard County Solicitor. He taught business, law, and accounting courses from 1968 to 1996 at Catonsville Community College in Baltimore County. Additionally, he holds a real estate broker\u2019s license and is president of the Welsh Company, of which he owns eighty-five percent; the couple\u2019s only daughter owns fifteen percent. The value of appellee\u2019s stock in that company is a reported $1,062.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Appellant is fifty-nine years of age and holds a high school degree with one year of practical nursing training. She has not worked in the nursing field for thirty-five years and primarily cared for the children and marital home throughout the marriage. After leaving Font Hill on April 10, 1994, appellant filed for divorce. The case was subsequently transferred from the Circuit Court for Howard County to the Circuit Court for Carroll County. In May 1996, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ordered that appellee pay appellant $500 per week in <em>pendente lite </em>alimony and also provided that she occupy a condominium, known as Vantage Point, owned by the couple, with expenses for that dwelling to be paid by the court-appointed trustee. Appellee continued to reside in the Font Hill home.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In 1993, the marital property was rezoned into three parcels. The first parcel (Section One) consisted of ten single-family dwelling lots; the second parcel (Section Two) consisted of twenty-six single-family dwelling lots, including the Dairy Barn/Chilling House; the third parcel (Section Three) consisted of 3.32 acres on which the Font Hill home was located. The parties entered into a contract in 1994 to sell the lots in Section One and received a total of $923,927.50. In February 1999, the parties entered into a contract to sell the lots in Section Two, for which they received a total of $1,812,-500.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Additional facts will be provided as they become relevant to our discussion of the issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Appellant first contends that the court erred when it denied her request for permanent alimony. She explains that, despite the proceeds received from the sale of the lots on the Font Hill property and from the eventual sale of the Font Hill marital home, she is not in a position to become self-supporting. Additionally, she contends that appellee is in a superior financial position due to various tax benefits he will receive and, therefore, the parties\u2019 financial status will be unconscionably disparate, thus warranting an award of alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Appellant first argues that the court could have awarded appellant the divorce based on her claims of adultery because she provided sufficient evidence to prove appellee\u2019s adulterous activities. In its opinion, however, the court specifically states that appellant\u2019s evidence \u201cfailed to establish the disposition and opportunity to commit adultery required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>Pohzehl v. Pohzehl, </em>205 Md. 395, 109 A.2d 58 (1954) and its <em>progeny.\u201d We note </em>that the court went on to conclude specifically that, at trial, appellee conceded that his relationship with a woman had progressed to a sexual one after the parties had separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">It is ultimately up to the court, based on its fact finding, to declare the grounds for divorce. It is not reasonable that the court be obligated to grant the divorce on the grounds requested when the judge is more persuaded that it is more likely than not that other grounds for the divorce are more justified. The court explained in its opinion that it found that the relationship between appellant and appellee had deteriorated long before appellant actually left the marital home in April 1994. Indeed, the court comments that the couple did not have sexual relations for nearly two decades and opines that the marriage evolved into one \u201cof convenience.\u201d Although appellee acknowledged having sexual relations with another woman while the couple was separated, it is clear that the court was not satisfied by the evidence presented that appellee had engaged in adulterous activities while the couple was still living together. Even more significant, the court did not believe that appellee\u2019s relations with another woman were, in fact, the reason for the break up of the marriage. Based on the evidence presented, we do not perceive any error in the court awarding appellant the divorce based on a two-year separation, rather than adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Appellant apparently argues the issue of adultery in the hopes that a divorce based on those grounds would favor an award of indefinite alimony. The Court of Appeals, however, has specifically held that alimony is \u201cnever a punitive measure.\u201d <em>Danziger v. Danziger, </em>208 Md. 469, 474, 118 A.2d 653 (1955). Adultery is merely one factor to be considered when the court addresses an award of alimony in determining the circumstances that contributed to the breakup of the marriage. Md.Code (1999 Repl.Vol.), Fam. Law (F.L.) \u00a7 11-106(b)(6). What is significant in the instant case is the court\u2019s evaluation of this factor. Its opinion states that \u201c[tjestimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>revealed that the parties\u2019 relationship had deteriorated long before [appellant] left the marital home in April of 1994.\u201d Despite appellant\u2019s attempts to emphasize appellee\u2019s adulterous behavior, the court was convinced that the relationship between the parties did not end because of any adulterous activities on the part of appellee. The trial court is in the best position to observe the witnesses and judge their credibility; as we see it, the court\u2019s analysis of the deterioration of the parties\u2019 relationship was not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>Mix Rule 8-131 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Appellant additionally contends that the court erred in failing to award alimony because it ignored the criteria set forth in F.L. \u00a7 11-106. To the contrary, the court separately enunciated each of its findings under a heading for each factor to be considered. The court stated that, \u201c[a]fter careful consideration of all the factors necessary for a fair and equitable alimony award determination, including the above factors, the [e]ourt declines to award [appellant] rehabilitative or indefinite alimony, primarily due to the significant amount of assets involved in this case.\u201d It is not mandatory that the court provide a formal checklist of each factor, as was provided in the instant case. <em>Gallagher v. Gallagher, </em>118 Md.App. 567, 586, 703 A.2d 850 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. 495, 709 A.2d 139 (1998). The court must, however, demonstrate consideration of the required factors. <em>Id. </em>The court clearly made the proper considerations as mandated by the statute and beyond. We cannot say it abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In its evaluation of factor one\u2014\u201cthe ability of the party seeking alimony to be wholly or partly self-supporting\u201d\u2014the court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">The parties to the actions have substantial personal assets. Both parties received a significant amount of money from the Pulte Contract of Sale, and will receive additional large sums of money from the sale of the marital home and [CJhilling [H]ouse. The [c]ourt therefore finds that [appellant] has the ability to be wholly self-supporting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The court found under factor two\u2014\u201c[t]he time necessary for the party seeking alimony to gain sufficient education or training to enable that party to find suitable employment\u201d\u2014 that, \u201cbased upon the substantial assets involved in this case, [appellant] may not need to seek employment.\u201d The court also observed that appellant\u2019s financial statement revealed that her monthly expenses were minimal. Appellant contends that these findings are erroneous and that the court did not properly take into consideration the tax benefits derived by appellee, not available to appellant, and that the evidence showed that she is clearly not self-supporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Appellant explains that, because appellee continued to occupy the marital home, he will be entitled to a significant tax benefit. That benefit, in combination with other tax benefits, will result in appellee realizing a tax exemption of about $600,000, whereas appellant will not receive any such tax exemptions for the money she received or will receive for the sale of the marital home or the other income generated to her for the sale of the couple\u2019s marital real property. Appellant contends that, as a result of these tax benefits, her income will be unconscionably disparate from appellee\u2019s income and he will be able to afford alimony and, therefore, she is entitled to an award of indefinite alimony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Family Law Article \u00a7 ll~106(c) provides that the court may award indefinite alimony in only two circumstances. The first addresses the infirmity or disability of one of the parties, which is inapplicable here. The second applies when the party seeking alimony makes as much progress as possible toward becoming self-supporting and, despite those efforts, the parties\u2019 respective standards of living will be unconscionably disparate. The fact that appellant -will not receive the same tax benefits as appellee does not necessarily mean that their standards of living will be unconscionably disparate. Nor does the fact that appellant would be in a position to afford alimony mean the court will order it.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The court determined that the amounts appellant received in the contract for the development of Section Two of the Font <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Hill marital property, in addition to the proceeds that she will receive from the sale of the marital home at Font Hill and the Dairy Barn/Chilling House, will place her in a position to sustain her standard of living. In other words, with or without tax benefits, the amounts received are sufficient for the parties to sustain their standards of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Appellant provided the court with evidence of the tax benefits of which appellee could take advantage and we assume that the court correctly weighed that evidence in the context of determining if the parties\u2019 standards of living would be unconscionably disparate. Moreover, the court evaluated the income in relation to the parties\u2019 financial reports, which showed appellee made no income in 1995,1996,1997, and 1998, and showed that appellant, while also earning no income in those years, had minimal expenses. In <em>Holston v. Holston, </em>58 Md.App. 308, 323, 473 A.2d 459 (1984), we observed that a large disparity in the standards of living will not necessarily mandate an award of indefinite alimony; rather, the court has the discretion to make such an award upon such a finding. Appellant clearly did not prove to the court\u2019s satisfaction that the parties\u2019 standards of living would be so different that it would warrant an award of indefinite alimony under F.L. \u00a7 11\u2014106(c)(2) and we do not find the court\u2019s ruling to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">As we explain <em>infra, </em>however, it is clear from the record that the monetary award and alimony may have been affected by the court\u2019s imposition of potential liability of the Bassler Hunt Partnership on appellant. Accordingly, we remand this case for reconsideration of the monetary award, which will also require a redetermination of alimony. <em>Rogers v. Rogers, </em>80 Md.App. 575, 588, 565 A.2d 361 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Both parties dispute the trial court\u2019s decision not to award either party attorney\u2019s fees. Concerning appellant\u2019s legal fees of more than $200,000, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>[T]he [c]ourt <em>does </em>find that [appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] bill is unreasonable because [appellant] was billed for two attorneys at nearly every stage of this case, thus making the hourly rate $350____ The [c]ourt wholeheartedly agrees with the following assertion by [appellee\u2019s] counsel in his closing argument: \u201cMany of [appellant\u2019s] attorney\u2019s fees were incurred as a result of her own counsel\u2019s refusal to make a good faith effort at settlement and his desire to obstruct all attempts at an amicable resolution of any issue which has arisen in this case over the last five (5) years.\u201d Thus, many of [appellant\u2019s] legal bills should not have been incurred <em>at all, </em>regardless of their hourly rate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The court went on to conclude that appellant\u2019s counsel became inappropriately personally involved in the instant case and, as a result, unnecessarily protracted the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The court proceeded to consider the factors required F.L. \u00a7 11\u2014110(c): 1) the financial resources and financial needs of both parties, and 2) whether there was substantial justification for prosecuting or defending the proceeding. The court concluded that there was substantial justification, although it made a point to state that \u201cthe [c]ourt falls just short of finding a lack of substantial justification on [appellant\u2019s] part in prosecuting and defending (against [appellee\u2019s] counterclaim) the proceeding.\u201d Concerning both parties, the court observed that' the substantial assets involved created several discovery disputes and recognized that, when one party makes allegations, the other party must defend. Consequently, the court declined to award attorney\u2019s fees to either party for the divorce proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Appellant argues that she met the two criteria required of F.L. \u00a7 11-110(e) and is, therefore, entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Appellant\u2019s disagreement with the findings of the court, however, does not warrant a reversal. Appellant points out that appellee also had two counsel working on his case, in addition to his own appearance entered on his behalf and that the case was vigorously defended, which added to the necessary legal expenses. According to the record, this was a contentious and bitterly fought proceeding. Appellant accuses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the trial court of being biased against appellant, alleging that appellee\u2019s aggressive conduct throughout the litigation also unnecessarily protracted the litigation, including two years for appellant to receive a hearing on her <em>pendente lite </em>alimony request.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">It is clear from the court\u2019s opinion that it was convinced that appellant created most of the delays in this case. We note, however-, that, despite these observations, the court took pains to review objectively the criteria required of F.L. \u00a7 11\u2014110(c) and, indeed, it concluded that there was substantial justification for prosecuting and defending the case, albeit just short of a finding of lack of substantial justification. The court\u2019s finding, however, appears to apply to both parties. In other words, both parties had substantial justification for prosecuting and defending the case. Accordingly, the more crucial factor is the financial resources and needs of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Appellant points to the court\u2019s observation that appellant was at a financial disadvantage in the beginning of this litigation to demonstrate that she had a financial need. The court\u2019s observation, however, does not consider the subsequent proceeds appellant received and will receive as a result of the sale of the marital properties at Font Hill. The court, after careful evaluation, did not perceive either party at a significant financial disadvantage to warrant an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Appellee claims that he is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees because he properly demonstrated his financial need. He explains that his financial statement reflected a deficit each month and that appellant is in a better position to pay his attorney\u2019s fees. While appellee asserted that appellant is in a better \u201cposition\u201d to pay his attorney\u2019s fees, the court determined that his financial resources or needs were insufficient to warrant an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Despite the court\u2019s acknowledgment that appellant generated unnecessary litigation in the instant case, the court additionally noted that there were several discovery disputes initiated by both sides. The court found that both parties contributed to delays and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>both parties were in a financial position where they could independently afford their attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">It is within the court\u2019s sound discretion to award such fees and we shall only disturb the court\u2019s ruling upon a showing of an abuse of that discretion. <em>Holston, </em>58 Md.App. at 326, 473 A.2d 459. The court\u2019s opinion demonstrates a careful evaluation of the statutory criteria and we see no abuse of discretion in its final determination that neither party is entitled to legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The court ordered that the trustee sell the Font Hill home and that the proceeds of the sale be equally divided among the parties after certain expenses were met. Additionally, a monetary award of $16,441.25 was made to appellant as an adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties. Appellant contends that the monetary award is insufficient and does not constitute an equitable adjustment between the parties. Appellee counters that the court erred in granting appellant any monetary award because it incorrectly weighed the efforts he made to increase the value of the marital property at Font Hill. As explained, <em>infra, </em>we remand this case for reconsideration of the monetary award in light of the potential Bassler Hunt Partnership liability. We will, however, address the parties\u2019 other concerns relating to the monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Appellant bases her contention on the fact that the court\u2019s lack of award of alimony was in error and because the award of alimony must be adjusted, so must the monetary award. It is well established that, if there is an adjustment of alimony on appeal, the monetary award must also be reconsidered. <em>Rogers, </em>80 Md.App. at 588, 565 A.2d 361; <em>Prahinski v. Prahinski, </em>75 Md.App. 113, 138, 540 A.2d 833 (1988), <em>aff'd, </em>321 Md. 227, 582 A.2d 784 (1990). Because of the error in the determination of the monetary award based on other factors, the lower court will have an opportunity to reconsider it on remand. We further address appellee\u2019s contention that the court erred in granting any monetary award at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>He particularly points to factor eight of the eleven factors that the court must consider in determining a monetary award. Factor eight reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">(8) how and when specific marital property or interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, was acquired, including the effort expended by each party in accumulating the marital property or the interest in the pension, retirement, profit sharing, or deferred compensation plan, or both;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b)(8). Appellee posits that he exerted all the effort to prepare the Font Hill property for subdivision and development and it was those efforts that reaped the purchase prices for the two sections. He contends that much of his effort in preparing and selling Section Two was made after the parties separated and that appellant made no contributions\u2014 monetary or non-monetary\u2014to the process. Appellee points out that the statute specifically requires consideration of <em>how </em>and <em>when </em>the marital property was acquired and suggests that, since his effort after the separation of the parties is what increased the value of the property, the court improperly divided the value of the property equally among the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">We observed in <em>Wilen v. Wilen, </em>61 Md.App. 337, 354-55, 486 A.2d 775 (1985), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">[t]he extent to which the efforts of one spouse may have led to acquisition of property or an increase in its value <em>without any monetary or non-monetary contribution by the other spouse </em>after the parties separated can, and should, be taken into account in determining what would constitute an equitable monetary award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">(Emphasis added.) The Court of Appeals, in <em>Alston v. Alston, </em>331 Md. 496, 507, 629 A.2d 70 (1993), stated that \u201cthe eighth factor should be given greater weight than the others.\u201d The Court further noted, however, that the circumstances of each case will dictate when more emphasis on this factor is warranted. <em>Id.; see also Skrabak v. Skrabak, </em>108 Md.App. 633, 654-56, 673 A.2d 732, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 584, 678 A.2d 1048 (1996). In <em>Alston, </em>the Court emphasized factor eight because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>[wjhere one party, wholly through his or her own efforts, and without any direct or indirect contribution by the other, acquires a specific item of marital property after the parties have separated and after the marital family has, as a practical matter, ceased to exist, a monetary award representing an equal division of that particular property would not ordinarily be consonant with the history and purpose of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><em>Alston, </em>331 Md. at 507, 629 A.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The circumstances of this case, however, are wholly distinguishable from <em>Wilen, Alston, </em>and <em>Skrabak. </em>In all three of those cases, there was no dispute that the efforts of the party who acquired the property or increased the value of existing marital property were solely his or her own and that the other party made no direct or indirect contribution to the acquisition or increase in value. The question for the trial court to answer in deciding how heavily it should weigh factor eight, therefore, is whether the increase in value was \u201cdependent in any way on the joint effort of the parties or their shared life, past or present.\u201d <em>Alston, </em>331 Md. at 508, 629 A.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>the trial court found that appellee\u2019s efforts were not so independent that appellant made no contributions to the increase in the value of the Font Hill property. The court noted that the property was acquired by the parties in 1972 and there is no dispute that Font Hill is marital property. The court also observed that the funds appellee used in handling the rezoning and ultimate purchase by developers were marital funds. In his discussion concerning the court\u2019s error in granting the monetary award, appellee fails to address the development fees he was awarded by the court. Appellee received a judgment of $135,937.50 against appellant for payment of development fees for his efforts in having the Font Hill property rezoned and subsequently bought by developers. This award was specifically for his efforts in rezoning and ultimately selling the property. Appellee argues that he should receive a monetary award as consideration for his actions that resulted in an increase in the property\u2019s value. Although the court\u2019s award of $135,937.50 to appellee is in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>form of a separate judgment and is not labeled a \u201cmonetary award,\u201d it nonetheless compensates appellee for his efforts in preparing the property for development.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We hasten to add that the court\u2019s consideration of factor eight was not in error in that the marital property was acquired in 1972 and, in 1993, before the couple separated, they executed a contract for the sale of Section One. The parties were in agreement and appellee had willingly made efforts during the marriage to rezone and sell off portions of the property, which occurred in part before appellant left the marital home. Additionally, the funds used to help appellee\u2019s efforts in preparing the sections for sale were marital funds, which is further evidence that the preparation to sell Section Two was a joint effort between the parties. Although it is true that appellee participated in the day-to-day efforts necessary to prepare the property for sale, appellant did not have the expertise to participate in every aspect of the transaction. Appellant did not prevent the marital funds from being used and she executed the necessary paperwork to complete the transaction. We hold, therefore, that the court appropriately weighed factor eight in the context of the other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">As discussed, <em>supra, </em>appellee received a judgment of $135,937.50 against appellant for payment of development fees for his efforts in having the Font Hill property rezoned and subsequently bought by developers. Appellant argues that the court erred in calculating the amount because the court based the fee on a percentage of the total purchase price, but appellee only performed one-half of the work necessary for the development of the lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Appellant does not dispute the court\u2019s use of a development fee of seven and one-half percent of the price, based on expert testimony as to how much such fees run, but instead takes issue with the amount, claiming the court erroneously calculated the fee based on the total purchase price. She explains that the contract entered into with Pulte Homes for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>purchase <em>of </em>Section Two called for \u201cunfinished\u201d lots, which meant that all physical development of the property was to be performed by the purchaser, Pulte Homes, and not appellee. Appellant posits that a fee based on the total purchase price would have only been appropriate if appellee had participated and executed the full development of the property. Because appellee only performed one-half of the development work (getting it prepared for physical development), and he also received one-half of the proceeds of the sale, appellant claims that the court erred and the maximum fee to which appellee is entitled is twenty-five percent of the purchase, which would total $33,984.37. Appellant states that a developer fee is normally charged when the developer is working on behalf of a third party, but in this case, appellee was working for his own benefit and received one-half of the purchase price. Therefore, he is not entitled to the full developer\u2019s fee because 1) he did not perform full development services, and 2) he received one-half of the proceeds of the sale. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The expert testimony reveals that the amount of the development fee will vary depending on the job, averaging from five to ten percent of the purchase price. The court\u2019s opinion indicated that, in making the award of development fees to appellee, it considered the testimony of David Carney, the trustee in the case, and Kevin Rodgers, a developer who bid on the Section Two property of Font Hill and was familiar with the efforts expended by appellee to develop the property. Rodgers testified that the development process is often seen as a three-step process: 1) from raw ground to obtaining proper zoning, 2) from zoning to engineering, and 3) the development. The Pulte contract states that the \u201csale involves the responsibility of the Buyer to undertake and complete all of the development work as required by the Developer Agreements and necessary to deliver finished single family building lots consistent with the construction drawings prepared by Benchmark Engineering ...\u201d which included sediment control, grading, storm water management, sewer and water installation and public road and storm drain construction. During his direct examination, Rodgers stated that a ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>percent fee would be a reasonable fee to develop fully Section Two of Font Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">The court ultimately settled on awarding appellee a development fee of seven and one-half percent. It did not award a fee of ten percent for full development, but decreased it in consideration of his contributions to prepare the property for physical development. Appellee and another witness, Garnett Y. Clark, Jr., testified that appellee\u2019s efforts included extensive meetings with Howard County zoning officials and members of the neighborhood to address their concerns about development, including private meetings and public hearings before the county zoning board, writing contracts, coordinating and accepting bids for the development work, and various other matters. Appellant does not dispute that appellee actually performed these functions, but argues that he is not entitled to the full amount awarded by the court because he owned the property and, therefore, received payment for his efforts through his half of the purchase price. The only fee he is due under appellant\u2019s approach is seven and one-half percent of her half of the proceeds from the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The court\u2019s determination that appellee was entitled to a fee of seven and one-half percent was not an abuse of discretion. The evidence revealed the various efforts expended by appellee in preparing the property for development. The court did not award him the maximum fee of ten percent for full development of the lots, but reduced it based on his development of the property from raw land through the engineering process. This was a reasonable assessment based on the evidence presented. Additionally, appellee would not be entitled to a separate fee because he additionally received proceeds from the sale of the property. The fact that he owned the property did not diminish the various duties he accepted and carried out to develop the property. The expert testimony did not indicate that the fees were only paid to third parties. We, therefore, perceive no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to award appellee a separate development fee based on the full purchase price of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>y</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The circuit court\u2019s order provides for a judgment against appellee in favor of appellant for $37,000, which represented reimbursement to her for one-half of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees appellee expended in a separate lawsuit using marital funds. Appellee argues that, absent a finding that appellee intentionally dissipated the marital funds, the court lacks the authority to make such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The $37,000 awarded by the court represents one-half of $74,000 that appellee expended in \u00e1 lawsuit against appellant\u2019s counsel. The Montgomery County office of appellant\u2019s counsel was burglarized on November 9,1995. The attorney\u2019s case file for <em>Welsh v. Welsh </em>was missing following that incident. In the course of the police investigation, the police report reflected that appellant\u2019s counsel stated to police, \u201cNo one would want those files except for Tim Welsh.\u201d Thereafter, appellee filed a defamation suit against appellant\u2019s counsel. The case ultimately settled for $22,500, but the legal fees expended by appellee totaled $74,000. Appellee conceded that marital funds were used for the payment of those fees. Accordingly, the trial court found that appellant was entitled to reimbursement for one-half of the marital funds expended in that litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Appellee, citing <em>Jeffcoat v. Jeffcoat, </em>102 Md.App. 301, 311-12, 649 A.2d 1137 (1994), states that, in order to receive reimbursement for these expenditures, appellant had the burden to show that appellee expended the funds with the primary purpose of reducing marital funds that would be divided equitably among the parties. He contends that no such intent was proven; therefore, the court erred in the award of $37,-000. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">In <em>Jeffcoat, </em>we primarily discussed the burden of proof requirements for a claim of dissipation of marital funds. <em>Id. </em>at 306-12, 649 A.2d 1137. We acknowledged that the party alleging dissipation of funds initially bears the burden to show dissipation has occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 649 A.2d 1137. After that party establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of dissipation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>burden shifts to the party who spent the money to prove appropriate use of the funds. <em>Id. </em>We stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">[t]he court must determine whether joint funds have been spent for other than family purposes with the intention of reducing the amount of money available to the court lor equitable distribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 312, 649 A.2d 1137. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court does not make a specific finding of dissipation. Rather, the court\u2019s discussion of appellee\u2019s expenditure of the $74,000 in legal fees is under the main heading entitled \u201cMARITAL PROPERTY/MONETARY AWARD\u201d and the subheading \u201cLiabilities/Adjustments/Offsets.\u201d The court, in making the award to appellant of $37,000, exercised its general authority under the Maryland Marital Property Act to make \u201can adjustment of the equities and rights of the parties concerning marital property----\u201d F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">There is no dispute that the funds appellee expended on the lawsuit against appellant\u2019s attorney were marital. In <em>Jeffcoat, </em>we evaluated several jurisdictions\u2019 approaches to dissipation and noted that, in <em>Sharp v. Sharp, </em>58 Md.App. 386, 401, 473 A.2d 499, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 795, 481 A.2d 240 (1984), we cited <em>Klingberg v. Klingberg, </em>68 Ill.App.3d 513, 25 Ill.Dec. 246, 386 N.E.2d 517, 521 (1979), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">Dissipation may be found where one spouse uses marital property for his or her own benefit for a purpose unrelated to the marriage at a time where the marriage is undergoing an irreconcilable breakdown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\"><em>Jeffcoat, </em>102 Md.App. at 308, 649 A.2d 1137. Although our final conclusion in <em>Jeffcoat </em>appears to establish that a <em>prima facie </em>case of dissipation includes a finding that one spouse spent or otherwise depleted marital funds or property with the principal purpose of reducing the amount of funds that would be available for equitable distribution at the time of the divorce, the consideration enunciated in <em>Sharp </em>and <em>Jeffcoat </em>is an appropriate one for the court in balancing the equities among the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>While there may not have been a <em>prima facie </em>ease of dissipation established or a specific finding of dissipation, the court, in evaluating the various marital assets and properties of the parties, determined that the $74,000 expended by appellee for his defamation lawsuit was for a purpose unrelated to the marriage and was paid from marital funds at a time when the parties were separated and pursuing divorce proceedings. Additionally, the nature of the lawsuit was such that it solely benefitted appellee and did not confer any benefit to appellant. Accordingly, we hold that the court\u2019s award was within its authority granted by the Maryland Marital Property Act and is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Appellant also received an award of one-half of appellee\u2019s retirement benefits from the State for his work with Catonsville Community College on an \u201cas, if, and when\u201d basis. Appellee opposes the court\u2019s award on that basis and contends that he provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate good cause for the court to disburse the retirement benefit in a lump sum distribution. He does not dispute the court\u2019s finding that appellant is entitled to any of his pension benefits, but instead appeals the method of distribution chosen by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Appellee relies on <em>Ohm v. Ohm, </em>49 Md.App. 392, 406-410, 431 A.2d 1371 (1981), in which we examined various jurisdictions and how they value and distribute pension benefits. Appellee points in particular to several guidelines set forth by an Oregon court to follow when making a determination as to what the proper distribution of pension benefits would be. <em>Id. </em>at 408, 431 A.2d 1371. One of the enunciated guidelines there was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">[t]he courts should continue to strive to disentangle the parties as much as possible by determining, where equitable, a sum certain to be paid rather than a percentage based upon expected future contingencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-9\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rogers v. Rogers, </em>45 Or.App. 885, 609 P.2d 877, 882 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Appellee states that he presented evidence which established the present value of his pension and that, given the parties\u2019 lack of communication and long term separation, the court erred in not awarding a lump sum distribution. The Oregon guidelines we observed in <em>Ohm, </em>however, were those of just one of many jurisdictions. There we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">On remand, the chancellor, in valuing the appellant\u2019s pension, and in making a monetary award, should give some consideration to the guidelines set forth above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 409, 431 A.2d 1371. The guidelines set forth in our opinion included guidelines from four different jurisdictions. We did not place the guidelines of one jurisdiction over another as any more important to consider. While appellee may have attempted to persuade the court that a lump sum distribution was preferable because it would serve to disentangle the parties, the court, in considering the other required factors and the evidence before it, was not convinced that a lump sum distribution would best serve to balance the inequities of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Appellee also argues that, given the substantial marital property involved, the court could have awarded appellant a larger distribution of marital property, thereby offsetting any inequities created by a lump sum distribution of the pension. In determining the proper monetary award to be given in a case, the court is required to \u201creach a fair and equitable award after consideration of each of the factors set forth in [F.L. \u00a7 8-205(b) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405, 431 A.2d 1371. In Maryland, we recognize three methods of pension valuation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Imagnu v. Wodajo, </em>85 Md.App. 208, 214, 582 A.2d 590 (1990); <em>see also Deering v. Deering, </em>292 Md. 115, 131, 437 A.2d 883 (1981). Which method is appropriate depends on the circumstances of the individual case. <em>Id. </em>As appellee properly points out, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>if a pension payment on an \u201cas, if, and when received\u201d basis is available, this does not mandate that the court adopt that method. <em>Cotter v. Cotter, </em>58 Md.App. 529, 540-41, 473 A.2d 970, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 794, 481 A.2d 239 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">At trial, appellee presented evidence as to why he thought the lump sum distribution was the most appropriate. Appellant did not express a preference in her testimony but did present evidence concerning the \u201cas, if, and when\u201d distribution method. Ultimately, the court awarded appellant one-half of appellee\u2019s pension based on the \u201cas, if, and when\u201d method. The court was obviously persuaded by appellant\u2019s evidence that the \u201cas, if, and when\u201d method would yield the greater benefit to the parties. It found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">evidence produced by [appellant] (in [appellant\u2019s] Ex. # 49) revealed that the maximum projected monthly retirement benefit paid by the retirement programs would be greater than if the money were withdrawn and invested in a similar investment vehicle. The court will therefore order that the proceeds be distributed on an if, as, and when basis [sic] and will prepare the appropriate Qualified Domestic Relations Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">From the court\u2019s finding, it is clear that an award to appellant of additional marital property from the couple\u2019s assets would be too speculative to compensate her for potential earnings from appellee\u2019s pension plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Additionally, we recognize that the court has broad discretion in evaluating pensions and retirement benefits, and in determining the manner in which those benefits are to be distributed. <em>Imagnu, </em>85 Md.App. at 216, 582 A.2d 590. Considering that every issue in this case was bitterly contested, we believe the court wisely divided the couple\u2019s property as evenly as possible in an effort to minimize the various disputes that could arise from its ruling. While division of marital property in Maryland is not always equal, but rather equitable, <em>Ohm, </em>49 Md.App. at 405, 431 A.2d 1371, the court clearly attempted to divide the property as evenly as possible to resolve the issues and come to a final disposition and distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tion of the marital property. The court was not required to award a lump sum pension distribution simply because appellee preferred that method. We hold that the court did not abuse its discretion and appropriately determined that appellee\u2019s pension benefits shall be awarded on an \u201cas, if, and when\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Appellee had a business relationship with the Bassler Hunt Partnership concerning the purchase of a property. According to the testimony adduced at trial, appellee entered into a written contract with the Bassler Hunt Partnership and received funds in connection with the transaction. The court apparently found that those funds were subsequently deposited as marital funds and used by both parties. A dispute eventually arose between Bassler Hunt Partnership and appellee concerning the monies paid to him, and the court found appellant liable for any future judgment or settlement relating to possible litigation with the Bassler Hunt Partnership.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite the trial court\u2019s lengthy and meticulously detailed Memorandum Opinion, it does not contain any discussion of the liability issue involving the agreement with the Bassler Hunt Partnership. The court\u2019s order merely states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">[Sjhould litigation ensue involving the Bassler Hunt Partnership, and such litigation pertains to the monies paid by the Bassler Hunt Partnership to [appellee] during the parties\u2019 marriage, each party shall bear equal responsibility for the payment of any judgment or settlement amount resulting from said litigation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Appellant claims that the court erroneously made her liable for any debts arising from litigation involving appellee and the partnership. Neither party cites any authority relating to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Appellant contends that, when appellant\u2019s counsel was examining appellee concerning his potential liability to the Bassler Hunt Partnership, the trial court limited his examination and from the bench announced that any liability relating to this issue was too speculative, thereby depriving appellant from providing further evidence of appellee\u2019s or appellant\u2019s liability in the matter. The following colloquy occurred at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">THE COURT: Well, Mrs.\u2014is there a chance that [appellant] will be co-defendant in that case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">[APPELLEE]: If I\u2019m sued, Your Honor, I\u2019m gonna [sic] bring her in as the third party defendant because she received the benefits of the marital funds that they\u2019re claiming ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">THE COURT: Well, the contract was entered into by the two of you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">[APPELLEE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-10\">THE COURT: And, the first right of refusal was ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No. No, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-12\">THE COURT: ... part of that contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-13\">[APPELLEE]: No, that ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Excuse me, Judge.

Who knows?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: That\u2019s my point. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-4\">THE COURT: Far too speculative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">When the court calculates a monetary award, it must first follow the mandates of F.L. \u00a7\u00a7 8-203-8-205. This involves, 1) deciding what property is or is not marital, 2) determining the value of all property deemed marital, and 3) calculating if a division of the marital property according to its title will be fair. <em>Innerbichler v. Innerbichler, </em>132 Md.App. 207, 228, 752 A.2d 291 (2000). If such a division would be unfair, the court is authorized to grant a monetary award to balance any inequities. <em>Id. </em>Whether property is marital property is a question of fact and we will only disturb the trial court\u2019s factual finding concerning marital property if it is clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 752 A.2d 291. If the court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence, it cannot be found to be clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 230, 752 A.2d 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In making a determination as to the value of marital property, the amount of marital debt associated with that marital property must be taken into consideration. <em>Schweizer v. Schweizer, </em>301 Md. 626, 636-37, 484 A.2d 267 (1984). \u201c[A] \u2018marital debt\u2019 is a debt which is directly traceable to the acquisition of marital property. Conversely, a \u2018nonmarital debt\u2019 is a debt which is not directly traceable to the acquisition of marital property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Schweizer, </em>the Court of Appeals explained that a nonmarital debt may be considered in the third step of determining a monetary award. <em>Id. </em>at 637, 484 A.2d 267. The Court remanded the case, directing the trial court to 1) determine what portion of the husband\u2019s indebtedness was a marital debt, directly traceable to the acquisition of marital property, 2) redetermine the value of all marital property in relation to any marital debt; and 3) redetermine the monetary award, based on the statutory factors, F.L. \u00a7 8-205(a), specifically the impact of any non-marital debt on the economic circumstances of the husband. <em>Id. </em>at 638, 484 A.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the potential liability appellee faced from this transaction was listed on his financial statement. It is, therefore, a potential debt, albeit speculative. In our review of the record, however, we can find no determination by the trial court of whether this potential debt is marital or nonmarital. Based on the court\u2019s order, which imposed one-half of the liability on appellant, it obviously concluded that it was marital property. The record, however, contains absolutely no consideration by the trial court of this potential liability. Aside from the sole testimony of appellee that the proceeds from the transaction were marital proceeds, and the subsequent protestations from appellant\u2019s counsel that they were not, the court had no substantial evidence before it concerning this transaction to determine if the potential debt resulting therefrom was marital or nonmarital. The three-step analysis to determine what property is marital or non-marital is not discretionary with the court, but is a requirement. <em>Caccamise v. Caccamise, </em>130 Md.App. 505, 515, 747 A.2d 221 (citing <em>Alston v. Alston, </em>331 Md. 496, 629 A.2d 70 (1993)), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 29, 753 A.2d 2 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Upon our review of the record, there is no such analysis by the court. The court itself, however, after hearing the limited testimony provided on this issue, concluded from the bench that the liability with the Bassler Hunt Partnership was \u201cfar too speculative.\u201d In our recent opinion, <em>Innerbichler v. Innerbichler, supra, </em>we held that the court did not err in refusing to consider a potential tax liability when determining the monetary award because, based on the evidence, the liability was merely a possibility and too speculative to make it a valid consideration in adjusting the equities between the parties. <em>Innerbichler, </em>132 Md.App. at 237-39, 752 A.2d 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the court was clearly erroneous in imposing one-half the liability of the potential lawsuit against appellant from the Bassler Hunt Partnership because the court\u2019s ruling was not based on substantial evidence. The contract in dispute was not placed into evidence; the only testimony relating to the funds being marital came from appellant, who clearly had an interest in identifying the funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>as such; and, dispositive of the issue, the trial court expressed its.reservations from the bench that the liability involved was too speculative, and indicated to appellant\u2019s counsel that it would not take appellee\u2019s claimed liability into account in deciding the case. The court\u2019s ruling that the liability was too speculative should have removed the potential liability from consideration as marital debt. We, therefore, reverse the court\u2019s order imposing one-half of any liability on appellant for any litigation or ultimate settlement that would come from appellee\u2019s property transaction with Bassler Hunt Partnership. We remand the case for further consideration by the trial court of what effect this error may have had on its calculation of the monetary award or alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Appellant next disputes the trial court\u2019s orders dated September 27 and October 26, 1999 permitting the court-appointed trastee to retain the same powers as contained in the August 31,1995 order. The orders of September and October 1999 state \u201c[t]he Trustee shall continue to have all of those powers enumerated in the [c]ourt\u2019s Order of August 31, 1995.\u201d Appellant points out that the majority of the powers contained in the 1995 order are moot because they have already been performed. She explains that two of the provisions, however, are in contradiction with the court\u2019s finding and are, therefore, in error. The August 31, 1995 order provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">ORDERED, that DAVID A. CARNEY, as the Trustee in the above-referenced case, is empowered with the following rights and duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">6. To disburse the funds held by Trustee for the following purposes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">e. Repayment of loans made from the Timothy E. Welsh, Retirement Account, for the expenses advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>on behalf of [appellant] and [appellee] in the planning, subdivision, and improvement of the Property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">f. Payment of monthly expenses associated with the Property, including but not limited to utilities, real property taxes, insurance premiums, lawn care, advertising, trash collection, storage, security, maintenance, and repairs....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Appellant\u2019s real concern is how the court\u2019s order of August 31, 1995, in conjunction with its subsequent findings and orders, affects expenses incurred prior to the divorce. She argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">[Appellant\u2019s] only motive in seeking to retain the power granted to the Trustee under the August 31, 1995 Order would be to have the Trustee deduct the pre-divorce expenses and development costs paid by Husband (with marital funds) from the proceeds of sale and to pay the same to him before dividing the remaining balance equally between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">She explains that, in the court\u2019s opinion issued in September 1999, it specifically found that the husband was not entitled to reimbursement for expenses before the divorce (Crawford credits).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">A review of the chronology of the court\u2019s various orders in this case is illuminative of our discussion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">1) August 31, 1995\u2014the court issues an order authorizing payments for expenses relating to the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">2) December 2, 1996\u2014the court issues an order specifically authorizing the trustee to reimburse appellee \u201cfor payment of the obligations of the parties from March 31, 1995, to August 31, 1995, in the amount of $35,859.72, which monies [appellee] advanced on behalf of the parties for those monthly expenditures involving the Property as are included in the [c]ourt\u2019s Order of August 31,1995.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">3) September 27, 1999\u2014court issues its order granting the parties an absolute divorce and specifically vacating its order of December 2, 1996.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>As we explain, <em>infra, </em>the court properly vacated its order of December 2, 1996, and the provisions contained therein are of no relevance. The order of August 31, 1995, therefore, must be read in conjunction with the order of September 27, 1999. While it is true that the court encompasses the entire August 1995 order and portions of that are no longer applicable, we do not see the authority granted the trustee as overreaching. The court specifically found that appellee paid the expenses for upkeep of Font Hill with marital funds and was, therefore, not entitled to any contribution by appellant. The powers enumerated in the order of August 31, 1995, therefore, limit what type of expenses the trustee is authorized to distribute. We do not read the orders as conflicting; rather, they supplement each other and must be read and earned out in conjunction with one another. The trustee must adhere to the findings of the court to determine what kind of expenses he is authorized to disburse to the parties or others for the post-divorce maintenance of the Font Hill property until it is sold. We do not view the court\u2019s action as an abuse of discretion, nor is it clearly erroneous. Should appellant dispute the disbursements of the trustee, she may bring that before the trial court at the proper time.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Appellee contends that the circuit court erred when it vacated its order of December 2, 1996. He explains that, due to the mandate we issued in the interlocutory appeal, the court did not have the authority to vacate that order. In <em>Welsh v. Welsh, </em>117 Md.App. 756, No. 103, September Term, 1996,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appellant complained that the court had granted appellee\u2019s motion for payment of fees associated with maintaining the Font Hill property and reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees he incurred to move the court to appoint a trustee to handle disbursements of funds in the proceedings without a hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>We vacated the court\u2019s granting of attorney\u2019s fees because the record contained no factual findings as required under the Maryland Rules and the Maryland Code allowing such fees to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Concerning appellant\u2019s request to reverse the court\u2019s ruling on the award of fees without a hearing, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">This case comes before this Court in the posture of ongoing divorce proceedings. The circuit court will ultimately hold a final hearing on the merits. Therefore, appellant will have ample opportunity in that forum to make her argument that the court erroneously approved payment in favor of [appellant]. After hearing all of the evidence, the court may, in its discretion, order a monetary award to appellee or otherwise adjust any inequities. We find, then, that the lower court has not granted summary judgement but, rather, has approved certain orders in the course of ongoing divorce proceedings. It is, therefore, premature for this Court to interfere, and we will await a final divorce judgment by the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Our mandate affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated in part and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for Carroll County. Thereafter, on remand, the trial court vacated its judgment of December 2, 1996, which had granted appellee the expenditures for maintenance to Font Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Appellee now posits that the circuit court was without authority to vacate that order. He in essence reads our mandate to affirm the portion of the order granting him fees to upkeep Font Hill and only vacating the attorney\u2019s fees, meaning the court may not disturb an order that we have affirmed. Appellee is misguided. We specifically stated that the nature of the ongoing proceedings of the divorce precluded us from deciding the matter. Our holding simply meant that the court did not err under Maryland Rule 2\u2014311 (jD(2000) for not holding a hearing on the matter because there was still a chance for appellant to be heard. Appellee, citing <em>Kline v. Kline, </em>93 Md.App. 696, 614 A.2d 984 (1992), points out that the law of the case doctrine states that an appellate rpling be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>comes the law of the case and is controlling in any further proceedings. Additionally, he reminds us that an issue raised in a previous appeal may not be raised on a subsequent appeal. We do not dispute the law of the case doctrine, but appellee has simply misinterpreted our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The issue before us on appeal in 1997 was whether the court erred by granting appellee\u2019s motion for fees without a healing. We held that it did not because a hearing could still be conducted. We further opined that, once a hearing on the merits occurred, the court would have the opportunity to review all of the evidence and make appropriate adjustments as it deemed necessaiy. Because of the ongoing nature of the case, the circuit court retained authority over the final disposition of its orders and the marital property. The issue previously before us on appeal did not decide anything related to the substance of the court\u2019s award of fees for maintenance of Font Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Our mandate clearly provided the trial court with the discretion, after a trial on the merits, to make any adjustments it deemed necessary concerning its order and we see no abuse of that discretion. The court, in balancing the equities, exercised its authority to vacate its previous order and our mandate in the previous appeal in no way limited its authority to make such a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">X</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Lastly, appellee posits that the circuit court erroneously granted appellant a divorce based on a two-year separation when it was appellee, not appellant, who provided the corroborating witness to prove the two-year separation. He argues that he should have been granted the divorce based on a two-year separation because he provided the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">The court\u2019s order granted appellant an absolute divorce on the ground of a two-year separation. F.L. \u00a7 7-108(a)(5). As observed, <em>supra, </em>the court was clear that it found that the relationship between the parties had deteriorated long before the couple\u2019s separation in April 1994. The court specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>refused to grant appellee a divorce as requested in his counterclaim on grounds of constructive desertion or abandonment. The court stated that it would \u201caccordingly grant <em>the parties </em>a divorce based upon a two-year separation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court\u2019s order, however, grants the divorce only to appellant. While we recognize that it was appellee\u2019s witness who corroborated a two-year separation, we do not find any authority that would limit the court\u2019s authority to grant only appellee the divorce. Given the deteriorated state of the parties\u2019 marriage at the time appellant moved out of the marital home, it is reasonable that the court would grant the original plaintiff in the case the divorce, because at any time prior to that, appellee could have initiated the proceedings. We liken appellee\u2019s argument to the one presented in <em>Quigley v. Quigley, </em>54 Md.App. 45, 456 A.2d 1305 (1983), wherein the appellant complained that she was not granted the divorce on the basis of adultery. We observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">She does not argue that a divorce was not legally merited, but that she was entitled to obtain it as a matter of preference. Apparently, she would have us establish a priority, or pecking order of conflicting grounds proportionate to a badder-is-better standard.... We find the reasoning absurd and based primarily upon the animosity that has festered over the years demanding now that the court point the finger of fault; more in vindictiveness than as vindication, considering that appellee never denied having initiated the dissolution and has admitted the adultery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 49, 456 A.2d 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">While appellee\u2019s contention that the court erred in granting appellant the divorce is not based on the argument that there was a more justifiable ground, we see his argument as a circular one and one based on preference, rather than substance. He cites no authority for the proposition that, because his witness presented the corroborating evidence, he alone is entitled to be granted the divorce. The one-year separation and two-year separation grounds for divorce, as codified in F.L. \u00a7 7-103(a)(3) and(5), both provide a means for the parties to obtain a divorce without regard to fault. <em>Aronson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Aronson, </em>115 Md.App. 78, 98, 691 A.2d 785, <em>cert. denied, </em>346 Md. 371, 697 A.2d 111 (1997). We do not see the court\u2019s decision to grant the divorce based on the no-fault grounds of a two-year separation to appellant as an abuse of discretion and, accordingly, the trial court\u2019s order granting appellant the divorce shall stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER FACT-FINDING CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID <em>% </em>BY APPELLEE AND <em>\\ </em>BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-11\">.

Such an extreme remedy of dismissal is not necessary in this matter; rather, we will strike the complaint from the record extract and it will not receive our consideration. <em>See Community Realty Co., Inc. v.
