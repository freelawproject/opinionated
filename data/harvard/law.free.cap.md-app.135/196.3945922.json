After the case was removed from the district court to the circuit court upon appellant\u2019s prayer for a jury trial, the trial commenced on August 19, 1999; the jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of appellee. After the lower court denied appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial or Remittitur and granted appellant\u2019s motion to amend the ad damnum clause to conform with the verdict amount, appellant noted this timely appeal, in which he raises five questions that we have rephrased and reordered for clarity as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">I.

Did the trial court commit reversible error by failing to exercise its discretion when it denied the Motion for New Trial or <em>Remittitur?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer appellant\u2019s five questions in the affirmative and reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">Appellee initially filed his claim in the District Court of Maryland for Prince George\u2019s County in the amount of $25,-000, along with his intent to introduce in the district court the writings, records, and bills of medical/health care provider, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>pursuant to Md.Code (1998 Repl.Vol.), Cts. &amp; Jud.Proe.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 10-104. Appellee gave notice of his intention to introduce medical records from Back to Health Chiropractic Centers, Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center, Christopher M. Magee, M.D., as well as medical bills from Back to Health Chiropractic Centers in the amount of $5,855, Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center in the amount of $670.98, Chesapeake Emergency Medical Associates in the amount of $145, and Schonholtz, Magee &amp; Michaels, M.D. Orthopaedics, P.A. in the amount of $870. Appellee offered an affidavit of Stephen T. Michaels, M.D., appellee\u2019s treating orthopedist, to establish the causal relationship between the motor vehicle accident and the injuries for which appellee received subsequent treatment and the necessity for that treatment as well as the fairness and reasonableness of the medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Listed in the pre-trial statement by appellee were itemized medical expenses as reflected in the medical bills submitted, as well as notification that appellee intended to establish damages for lost wages in the amount of $922.50. Appellee further indicated that he intended to introduce the medical records, pursuant to \u00a7 10-104. Appellant timely filed a prayer for jury trial and the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Counsel for appellee corresponded with appellant\u2019s counsel regarding possible stipulations concerning the admissibility of \u201cmy 10-104 statement.\u201d Appellant responded by letter dated May 18, 1999 that counsel did not want to agree to the admissibility of a \u201c10-104\u201d statement if \u201cthere is going to be live testimony.\u201d Counsel further indicated that he would agree to a stipulation, pursuant to \u00a7 10-104, only as to the records that were not the subject of live testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">A bench conference was held at trial when appellee indicated he intended to proceed pursuant to \u00a7 10-104 and the lower court ultimately ruled that, because \u00a7 10-104(f) provided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>nothing contained in this section of the code \u201cmay be construed to limit the right of a party to: (1) Request a summons to compel the attendance of a witness; or (2) Examine a witness who appears at trial,\u201d the notice given by appellee, pursuant to \u00a7 10-104, would be admitted as Exhibit No. 1 and appellee\u2019s treating chiropractor, Michael Fedorczyk, D.C., would be permitted to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Dr. Fedorczyk testified that the areas which were injured as a result of the accident might flare up if appellee was overworked, overstressed, or if the weather changes and that, as to future medical intervention, appellee would not need \u201ca lot of future treatment\u201d; the witness indicated appellee \u201cmight need treatment when these things flair [sic] up, mild treatment just to get the thing to ... calm down,\u201d adding that appellee would not need treatment for the rest of his life. The witness felt that the medical bills were fair, reasonable, and necessary, \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of chiropractic certainty.\u201d The medical bills from Prince George\u2019s Hospital Center, Chesapeake Emergency Medical Associates, and Schonholtz, Magee and Michaels, M.D. Orthopaedics, P.A., had previously been admitted into evidence based on the notice, pursuant to \u00a7 10-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Appellant elected not to call any witnesses and, at the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge instructed the jury on the issue of damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">The personal injury sustained and their [sic] extent and duration, the effect such an injury will have on the physical, mental health, and well being of the [appellant], the physical pain and mental anguish suffered in the past, medical and other expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred in the past, and a loss of earnings in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The trial judge then directed the jury to itemize its award, instructing that the jury \u201cshow the amount intended for the medical expenses incurred in the past, the loss of earnings incurred in the past, and the non-economic damages sustained in the past....\u201d In a note from the jury delivered to the trial judge, it requested instructions on the maximum and minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>amount of available damages which the jury could award. The court simply responded by sending a note that the jury \u201cmust decide the appropriate amount of damages based on the evidence you heard.\u201d Subsequently, the jury returned a verdict of $7,540.91 for medical expenses, $2,800 for loss of earnings, and $300,000 for non-economic damages. The court, upon appellee\u2019s request for leave to amend, permitted appellee to amend his <em>ad damnum </em>clause to conform to the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Appellant initially contends that \u00a7 10-104 reflects an intent to limit its applicability to cases in which the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the district court. More specifically, he asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">While the statute now applies to cases in the [cjircuit [cjourt, the conditions placed on using \u00a7 10-104 in [cjircuit [cjourt require that the litigation originate in [djistrict [cjourt, and that the \u201camount in controversy\u201d not exceed the jurisdictional limits of the [djistrict [cjourt. Accordingly, it is apparent that the Maryland General Assembly never intended this legislation to allow the introduction of medical bills and records at trial without a physician\u2019s . \u2018stimony in cases in which the amount in controversy i'.weeded the jurisdictional limits of the [djistrict [cjourt. Once the trial court allowed [appellee] to change the \u201camount in controversy\u201d from his original <em>ad damnum </em>of $25,000 to the jury verdict of 310,340.91, [sic] that is precisely what occurred in the present case. The trial court\u2019s decision to allow a Rule 2-341 amendment of his <em>ad damnum </em>under the facts of this case constitutes a failure to acknowledge and apply the clear mandate of this statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">During the colloquy between counsel and the court, the trial judge remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">Yeah. And I certainly would not make that finding. I don\u2019t believe\u2014I think the issue is I don\u2019t think it really <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>matters in my decision why you asked for a jury trial, whether it was to take advantage of the discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">That really is totally irrelevant. It\u2019s the fact that you did, and the jurisdictional consequences of doing it. That\u2019s the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Appellee responds that \u00a7 10-104 is inapplicable to the case at hand because he filed the notice of intent to introduce medical records in the district court rather than the circuit court. He argues that, by the language of section (c)(ii), the notice, pursuant to \u00a7 10-104, is required to be filed in the court in which the case will be tided.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Section \u00a7 10-104(b)(2) and (c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">(b) (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the provisions of this section apply to a proceeding in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">(i) The District Court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">(ii) A circuit court if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">1.

The case was transferred from the District Court to a circuit court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">3. The amount in controversy in the action in the circuit court does not exceed the amount specified in \u00a7 4-401 of this article for that type of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">(c) <em>In </em>general.\u2014(1) A writing or record of a health care provider described in this section is admissible under this section if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-16\">(i) The writing or record is offered in the trial of a civil action in the District Court or a circuit court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>(ii) At least 60 days, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, before the beginning of the trial, the party who intends to introduce the wilting or record files with the clerk of the court and serves on all other parties as provided under Maryland Rule 1-321:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-5\">1. Notice of the party\u2019s intent to introduce the writing or record without the support of a health care provider\u2019s testimony; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">2. A copy of the writing or record; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">(iii) The writing or record is otherwise admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">(2) A party, who receives a notice under paragraph (1) of this subsection and intends to introduce another wilting or record of a health care provider without a health care provider\u2019s testimony, shall file and serve a notice of intent and copy of the writing or record at least 30 days before the beginning of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">I, II, and III</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">We first address appellant\u2019s contention that, once appellee introduced medical records and bills at trial pursuant \u00a7 10-104, he was statutorily precluded from obtaining a judgment in excess of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 10-104 was originally enacted by the Maryland General Assembly during the 1996 Session. <em>See </em>1996 Md. Laws ch. 554. Its purpose was to allow \u201ca medical or dental writing or record to be admissible without a physician\u2019s or dentist\u2019s testimony when presented in the trial of a civil action in the [district fcjourt,\u201d when advance notice of the intent to introduce such a writing was given to the parties and the court. Bill Analysis, House Bill (H.B.) 1431, 1996 Session. The provision was amended in the 1997 Session by H.B. 423. As originally drafted, H.B. 423 would have \u201cma[de] these provisions applicable to a circuit court proceeding as well as the [district [cjourt.... \u201d Bill Analysis, H.B. 423, 1997 Session. The bill was amended before enactment, however, to apply only to a proceeding in:</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">(I) The district court; or</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>(II) A circuit court if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">1. The case was originally filed in the district court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">2. The case was transferred from the district court to a circuit court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">8. The amount in controversy in the action in the circuit court does not exceed the amount specified in \u00a7 4-401 of this article for that type of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">1997 Md. Laws ch. 443; <em>see also </em>Second Reading, H.B. 423, 1997 Session.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">Appellant contends that the language of the statute limiting its applicability to actions when the \u201camount in controversy ... does not exceed the amount specified in \u00a7 4^401 of this article for that type of action\u201d limits appellee\u2019s recovery to $25,000. Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 4-401 lists the categories of cases over which the district court has exclusive original jurisdiction. The district court has exclusive original jurisdiction over an action in tort, \u201cif the debt or damages claimed do not exceed $25,000.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Determining whether the provisions of \u00a7 10-104 serve as a limit on damages \u201cis a matter of statutory construction, the object of which is to discern and effectuate the intention of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Schuman, Kane, Felts &amp; Everngam, Chartered v. Aluisi, </em>341 Md. 115, 119, 668 A.2d 929 (1995). As the Court stated in <em>Aluisi:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">Where the ordinary and common meaning of the words used in the statute is clear and unambiguous, usually, it is unnecessary to go further. Nevertheless, \u201c(i)n the interest of completeness ... we may look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-12\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946 (1993)). The purpose of the statute may be ascertained by looking at any material \u201cthat fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal,\u201d including \u201camendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature [and] its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Both a plain reading of \u00a7 10-104(c)(2) and an examination of the history of its enactment evince an intent that medical records not be admitted under the statute unless the amount in controversy, as measured by the damages claimed, does not exceed $25,000. The most likely reason for this requirement is the policy decision that, when the defendant is exposed to damages greater than $25,000, the plaintiff should be required to authenticate the records through live testimony. The requirement would fail to serve its purpose, however, if records were introduced at trial under \u00a7 10-104 because the plaintiff plead damages of $25,000 or less, but the defendant was exposed to a potential verdict in excess of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">When a case is transferred from a district court to a circuit court, just this result is possible. Although a plaintiffs claim for damages, or <em>ad damnum, </em>has historically been a limit on the verdict, the Court of Appeals held in <em>Falcinelli v. Cardascia, </em>339 Md. 414, 663 A.2d 1256 (1995), that \u201cthe <em>ad damnum </em>does not inherently limit the power of the jury to render a verdict and does not inherently limit the power of the court to enter a judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 663 A.2d 1256. Moreover, Maryland Rule 2-341 was amended in 1998 to add a committee note reading, \u201cBy leave of court, the court may grant leave to amend the amount sought in a demand for a money judgment after a jury verdict is returned.\u201d Md. Rule 2-341(b) committee note (2000). To effectuate the legislative intent not to allow \u00a7 10-104 to be used in cases where the defendant is exposed to liability exceeding $25,000, we interpret the statute as requiring a limitation on damages. <em>Cf. </em>\u00a7 11-108 (placing a limitation on non-economic damages in personal injury actions); \u00a7 11-110 (limiting the damages for tortious injury to a pet).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Appellant also contends that appellee\u2019s mere notification of intent to introduce records under \u00a7 10-104 operated to limit damages. He argues that he made pre-trial tactical decisions in reliance on that notice and on his perception that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>liability was thereby limited to $25,000. When a party relies on notice pursuant to \u00a7 10-104, as appellant did in the case at hand, a party opponent, for the reasons we shall discuss, <em>infra, </em>may not recover damages in excess of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The trial court further erred, posits appellant, in granting appellee leave to amend his <em>ad damnum </em>clause, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-341, to conform to the verdict. As we stated above, Rule 2-341 was amended in 1998 to add a committee note reading, \u201c[b]y leave of court, the court may grant leave to amend the amount sought in a demand for a money judgment after a jury verdict is returned.\u201d Md. Rule 2-341 (b) committee note (2000). We interpret \u00a7 10-104, however, to require that, once a plaintiff has introduced medical records pursuant to the statute, recovery is limited to $25,000. To allow a post-trial amendment of the <em>ad damnum </em>clause to conform to the verdict would defeat this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">We next address the operation of \u00a7 10-104 in this case independent of the clear statutory mandate. As a threshold issue, appellee argues that \u00a7 10-104 is inapplicable to this appeal because a notice of intent was never filed in the circuit court. Appellee did file a \u00a7 10-104 notice in the district court and the notice was transferred to the circuit court as part of the record, pursuant to \u00a7 4-402(e)(2). Once in circuit court, appellee\u2019s counsel referred to \u201cthe admissibility of my \u00a7 10-104 statement\u201d in a letter to opposing counsel, the document was referred to as the \u201c10-104 statement\u201d by the court and both attorneys at trial, and appellee\u2019s counsel argued for the document\u2019s admissibility by quoting language from \u00a7 10-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 4-402(e)(2) provides that, when a party files a timely demand for a jury trial, \u201cjurisdiction is transferred forthwith and the record of the proceeding shall be transmitted to the appropriate court.\u201d Here, that court was the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, and the record, including appellee\u2019s \u00a7 10-104 notice, was so transmitted. The transfer of jurisdiction to the circuit court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>not render all proceedings below a nullity; for example, appellee was not required to file a new complaint. Appellee\u2019s notice of intent to introduce the medical records without supporting testimony was thus effective in the circuit court and \u00a7 10-104 is applicable to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Appellee also argues that he introduced the document pursuant to stipulation, rather than pursuant to \u00a7 10-104. We find no merit in this argument. To the extent that appellant stipulated to the documents\u2019 admissibility, he stipulated that they were admissible pursuant to \u00a7 10-104. At trial, appellant objected to the admission of a portion of the documents because they would be admitted during the course of live testimony, and the court, after construing \u00a7 10-104, concluded that they were admissible. Appellee further argues that the admission of the documents was \u201charmless error,\u201d because their admissibility was otherwise established through a combination of pre-trial admissions by appellee and trial testimony. Appellant does not allege, however, that the trial court erred in admitting the documents. The harmless error doctrine is therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The applicability of \u00a7 10-104 is also the subject of one of appellant\u2019s assignments of error. He contends that the trial court erred in concluding that \u00a7 10-104 was inapplicable to the case because of appellee\u2019s presentation of live testimony of a treating chiropractor at trial. The relevant portion of the court\u2019s opinion and order disposing of post-trial motions is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">[T]he [appellant\u2019s] counsel wrote on May 18,1998:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">I think the simplest thing for us to do is to agree that the 10-104 statement will come in if there is no live medical testimony. Otherwise, those portions of [the \u00a7 ] 10-104 [statement] covered by the live testimony would be submitted through the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">... The [appellee] did, in fact, call the treating chiropractor, Michael Fadorsik [sic] as a witness. His records, as well as other medical records of [appellee] were admitted into evidence, over [appellant\u2019s] objection. He objected because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the chiropractor who generated and used the records was present to testify....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">The [c]ourt finds that [appellee] disclosed at the pre[-]trial conference that he intended to call the chiropractor.... The chiropractor testified, and was cross-examined as to his own records, and the other records upon which he relied. Since there was in fact court testimony concerning the records, [\u00a7 ] 10-104 does not apply to the facts of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">Even if [\u00a7 ] 10-104 did apply[,] the [c]ourt believes that Rule 2-341, which provides for \u201cgreat liberality in the allowance of amendments,\u201d <em>Goldstein v. Peninsula Bank, </em>41 Md.App. 224[, 396 A.2d 542] (1979)[,] would permit the [c]ourt to grant the [appellee\u2019s] post[-]trial motion for amendment of the <em>ad damnum </em>clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The court then denied appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial and granted appellee\u2019s motion to amend his <em>ad damnum </em>clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">As we stated above, appellee did introduce the medical records, pursuant to \u00a7 10-104; the statute is therefore applicable to this case. The court summarily admitted the medical records as part of the \u00a7 10-104 statement; it did not mention any separate grounds for authentication or admissibility, nor was any argument heard on these matters. We think it significant that, in his correspondence of May 18, 1999, appellant\u2019s counsel, after alluding to the fact that appellee\u2019s counsel had indicated the possibility that Dr. Fedorczyk would testify, specifically said that he did not agree to the admissibility of a \u00a7 10-104 statement if there was to be live testimony. He further stated that he thought counsel was \u201centitled to one but not the other\u201d and that \u201cI think the simplest thing for us to do is to agree that the [\u00a7 ] 10-104 statement will come in if there is no live medical testimony. Otherwise, those portions of the [\u00a7 ] 10-104 covered by the live testimony would be submitted through the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Notably, the first exhibit submitted was the notice pursuant to \u00a7 10-104 offered by counsel for appellee. As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>statutorily, \u00a7 10-104 and \u00a7 4-401 can only be read as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>limitation in the circuit court to those damages which one could have recovered in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">It is clear from the record that appellant\u2019s counsel expressly advised counsel for appellee that he would agree to the admissibility of the \u00a7 10-104 statement if appellee\u2019s counsel did not offer the medical records through live testimony, but that he objected to appellant calling his expert if the medical evidence was to be admitted pursuant to \u00a7 10-104. Aside from the statutory basis, appellee was estopped from pursuing a larger damage award by deciding to proceed pursuant to \u00a7 10-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In a case in which a judgment creditor asked that a trustee be appointed to sell land formerly owned by a judgment debtor, his wife and mother-in-law as joint tenants, but which had been conveyed to a straw party, then back to the wife and mother-in-law, the judgment debtor contended that the court of equity was without power to appoint a trustee and make a sale because the earlier decree failed to define the extent and character of the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in the property and that the most the judgment creditor could obtain is recovery of the subject property to its owners of record prior to the conveyances held to be fraudulent. <em>Van Royen v. Lacey, </em>266 Md. 649, 650, 296 A.2d 426 (1972). In holding that the judgment debtors were estopped from subsequently arguing that the judgment debtor and his wife owned one-half of the property as tenants in common and that the mother-in-law held the other one-half of the property as joint tenants with the judgment debtor and his wife, the Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">Be that as it may, estoppel by admission <em>or by pleading </em>has long been recognized in this State. In ... <em>[Edes v. Garey, </em>46 Md. 24, 41 (1877),] the Court of Exchequer in <em>Cave v. Mills, </em>7 H. &amp; W. 927, was quoted as saying, \u201cA man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold, to claim at one time and deny at another.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that in this case the appellees are now <em>estopped by their own pleadings </em>from contending anything other than that the three parties owned as joint tenants, with no tenancy by the entireties involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 651-52, 296 A.2d 426 (1972) (emphasis added; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">To like effect, we said in <em>Wilson v. Stanbury, </em>118 Md.App. 209, 214-15, 702 A.2d 436 (1997), citing <em>WinMark Ltd. Partnership v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>345 Md. 614, 693 A.2d 824 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">If parties in court were permitted to assume inconsistent positions in the trial of their causes, the usefulness of courts of justice would in most cases be paralyzed; the coercive process of the law, available only between those who consented to its exercise, could be set at naught by all. But the rights of all men, honest and dishonest, are in the keeping of the courts, and consistency of proceeding is therefore required of all those who come or are brought before them. It may accordingly be laid down as a broad proposition that one who, without mistake induced by the opposite party, has taken a particular position deliberately in the course of litigation, must act consistently with it; one cannot play fast and loose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\"><em>See also Stone v. Stone, </em>230 Md. 248, 186 A.2d 590 (1962) (holding that trustee, who had admitted in certain written instruments that stock and a certain account were part of a trust, was estopped from denying that he did not have knowledge of the consequences to the trust nor of the injury to the beneficiaries if he later denied them or that he was acting in the capacity of a trustee); <em>Billman v. Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund Corp., </em>86 Md.App. 1, 20, 585 A.2d 238 (1991) (holding that, having persuaded the court not to consolidate the current case with a prior proceeding, appellants could not seek to have the subsequent proceeding dismissed by asserting that the claims could have been raised and litigated previously and therefore were barred by <em>res </em>judicata).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Although we recognize that the dispositive issue is the legislative intent as gleaned from the enactment of \u00a7 10-104 in conjunction with \u00a7 4-401, fundamental fairness requires that counsel not be permitted tactically to disarm opposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>counsel by resorting to misleading legal maneuvers, particularly when counsel has expressed his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In the course of preparation for trial, it is axiomatic that the nature and degree of preparation is dictated by what counsel perceives is at stake. One may very well be willing to stipulate to the admission of medical evidence pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 10-104 if the only exposure is to an award of $25,000. On the other hand, in a case in which one must counter the far more persuasive testimony of an expert witness, rather than a cold medical record, the level of preparation could be expected to be much greater. Indeed, the statutory scheme which does not reference any case in which the original exclusive jurisdiction is in the circuit court evinces an intent that \u00a7 10-104 be invoked only in small claims involving less serious injuries and smaller potential damage awards. We hold, therefore, that, by proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 10-104, independent of the statutory limitation which we have discussed, appellant is estopped from pursuing damages in excess of that allowed under \u00a7 4-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Finally, appellant contends that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s Motion for New Trial or <em>Remittitur </em>and that this constituted reversible error. Appellant\u2019s motion, filed August 23, 1999, focused on three main arguments for a new trial, or in the alternative, <em>remittitur. </em>First, appellant argued that the verdict should be limited to $25,000 because appellee introduced medical records and bills under \u00a7 10-104. Second, appellant argued that the verdict was so excessive as to \u201cshock the conscience.\u201d Appellant argued that various misconduct during trial justified granting a new trial, including the jury\u2019s award of more lost wages than were claimed, appellee\u2019s revelation that, contrary to his answers to interrogatories, he had been involved in other motor vehicle accidents, and appellee\u2019s testimony that appellant was insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>After a series of counter-motions and responses, and a hearing on the motions, the trial court filed an opinion and order on October 22, 1999, denying appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial or <em>remittitur </em>and granting appellee\u2019s motion to amend the <em>ad damnum </em>clause to conform to the jury verdict. The court\u2019s opinion addressed only one of appellant\u2019s contentions\u2014that appellee\u2019s use of \u00a7 10-104 limited the verdict to $25,000. '</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court\u2019s opinion and order discussed the operation of \u00a7 10-104 and Rule 2-341 in the case, but did not address the issues of the excessiveness of the jury verdict or of the alleged irregularities of the trial. Whether distracted by the novel issue presented regarding \u00a7 10-104, or convinced that the other grounds for the motion had no merit, the court failed to exercise its discretion in disposing of the motion. Because we conclude that \u00a7 10-104 operated as a limitation on appellee\u2019s recovery, the excessiveness of the jury\u2019s verdict, <em>vel non, </em>is a non-issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Although \u201c[a] decision regarding the excessiveness of a jury\u2019s award is within the discretion of the trial court, and an abuse of that discretion is reviewed by this Court under \u2018extraordinary circumstances,\u2019 \u201d <em>Owens Corning v. Bauman, </em>125 Md.App. 454, 726 A.2d 745 (1999), when the appellate court is \u201cunable to say from [the] record that the trial judge did exercise his discretion to consider the claim of excessiveness of the verdict,\u201d the case must be remanded for consideration of the motion for <em>remittitur. Taylor, </em>312 Md. 609, 624, 541 A.2d 969 (1988). Although the court\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion was an abuse of discretion, the error is of no consequence, given our decision regarding the limitation on the award recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">.
