Brown, a disbarred attorney who cross-breached his fiduciary duties to them. We must decide which one bears the risk of the losses caused by Brown\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Seaboard Surety Company, appellant and cross-appellee, is the assignee of the guardianship estate of John W. Berger (the \u201cEstate\u201d). In his capacity as guardian of the Estate, Brown made an improper loan of $60,000 in Estate funds (the \u201cLoan\u201d) to his client, Ernest D. Boney, appellee and cross-appellant. The purpose of the Berger Loan was to enable Boney to repurchase his house, which had been sold at foreclosure due to Brown\u2019s misconduct and legal malpractice. To obtain the Loan, Boney executed a promissory note and deed of trust in favor of the Estate (the \u201cNote and Deed of Trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Brown\u2019s misdeeds were discovered shortly after the Loan. A substitute guardian replaced Brown and initiated foreclosure proceedings against Boney\u2019s house. In response, Boney filed a counterclaim seeking to cancel or modify the Note and Deed of Trust on the basis of Brown\u2019s fraud and malpractice. The Estate settled its claim against the guardianship bond issued by Seaboard, and then assigned its rights against Boney and Brown to Seaboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County concluded there were grounds to cancel or modify the Note and Deed of Trust, citing Brown\u2019s fraud against Boney and Brown\u2019s capacity as guardian of the Estate at the time the Loan was made. After trial, the court entered an award of restitution in favor of Seaboard, but for an amount far less than the principal and interest due on the Note and Deed of Trust. As a result, Boney was excused from paying approximately $50,000 of the balance due under the Note, and Seaboard was left to seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>recovery of that difference from Brown, without any foreclosure rights or other security. We shall vacate the judgment, because we conclude that the risk of loss must fall on appellee Boney, as the principal of a fraudulent agent, and as the party who enabled his attorney\u2019s misconduct toward an innocent guardianship estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">This case revolves around a regrettable web of ineptitude and fraud, at the center of which sits attorney Brown. Brown had a wealthy elderly client named John W. Berger. When Berger became incompetent, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City appointed Brown guardian of Berger\u2019s Estate, in April 1994. Appellant Seaboard issued a fiduciary bond to secure Brown\u2019s faithful performance of his duties as guardian of the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">At the same time, one of Brown\u2019s clients was appellee Boney. Since 1992, Brown had been representing Boney in an effort to recover insurance proceeds alleged to be due as a result of a fire in a house that Boney owned as tenants by the entireties with his estranged wife, and in contemplated divorce proceedings. The fire insurer refused to cover the loss, alleging that Mrs. Boney had committed arson. Brown negotiated a settlement with the insurance company, which paid off the Boneys\u2019 $42,000 first mortgage. A second mortgage of approximately $11,000 remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Brown advised Boney to stop paying the second mortgage as part of a plan to eliminate Mrs. Boney\u2019s one half marital property interest in the house. By letting the second mortgage go to foreclosure, and then purchasing the house at the foreclosure sale through a straw purchaser, who then would reconvey the property to a newly formed corporation owned by Boney, Boney hoped to take the property \u201cout of consideration\u201d as marital property. Boney gave Brown $9,000 to hold toward a negotiated pay-off of the second mortgage. Boney also authorized Brown to find a lender for the additional money necessary to buy the house at foreclosure, believing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>that the loan would be in Brown\u2019s name, and that he would reimburse Brown. To implement this plan, Boney stopped making second mortgage payments, and, through Brown, formed Arrow Housing Company to receive title from the straw purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The second mortgage holders foreclosed. At the foreclosure auction held in 1995 (the \u201cFirst Foreclosure\u201d), Brown was the high bidder, for $56,000, on behalf of Boney\u2019s sister, who was acting as the straw purchaser. The source of the funds that Brown presented to make the purchase was the Berger Estate. But the check that Brown presented bounced, due to insufficient funds. Nevertheless, Brown misled Boney to believe that everything was taken care of.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The Boney house was re-advertised, and a second foreclosure sale scheduled for April 3, 1996 (the \u201cSecond Foreclosure\u201d). Brown did not tell Boney about the bounced check, re-advertisement, or second foreclosure sale. On the morning of the sale, Brown telephoned Boney, and told him to go to Annapolis to bid on his house. But by the time Boney got there, the house had been resold for $30,000 to bona fide purchasers, the Shapiros.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">By this time, Boney was aware of Brown\u2019s failures in the First Foreclosure as well as in other legal matters that Brown handled for him. Brown reassured Boney that he would buy back the house, and \u201ctake care of the damage.\u201d In an attempt to do so, Brown negotiated to purchase the house back from the Shapiros for $65,518. Boney agreed to Brown\u2019s proposal to buy out the Shapiros.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">At the June 14, 1996 settlement, Brown presented two checks totaling $60,000. Again, Brown improperly used funds from the Berger Estate as the source of those funds. This time, however, the checks did not bounce. Relying on Brown\u2019s promises to straighten everything out, and believing that Brown would reimburse him for any damages that he had caused, Boney signed the Note for $60,000 and the Deed of Trust. The Note required Boney to make 12 monthly payments of $660 (totaling $7,920) to the Estate, and to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>balance at the end of one year. But Brown led Boney to believe that he only had to make the 12 monthly payments, and that he would not be responsible for the balance. Boney believed that the total amount of his payments would be approximately the difference between the $9,000 that he had originally deposited with Brown to resolve the second mortgage and the amount necessary to buy the house back at the First Foreclosure Sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">In accordance with the plan to eliminate Mrs. Boney\u2019s marital property interest, Arrow took title to the house. The settlement proceeds were used to pay off the second mortgage; pay title, attorney, and recording fees; repay the Shapiros\u2019 deposit; and pay the Shapiros a $20,000 premium. Although it had cost far more than the face amount of his first and second mortgages, Boney had his house back, free from his ex-wife\u2019s marital claims, albeit still fire damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Brown\u2019s improper use of Estate funds to make the Loan came to light when an auditor appointed by the Baltimore City Circuit Court reported that Brown had misappropriated and misused Estate funds in various respects, including writing checks to himself; withdrawing Estate funds for personal use; making both the Loan and an unsecured $10,000 loan to an acquaintance; liquidating tax-free municipal bonds to purchase an $800,000 annuity for Berger, who was 91 at the time; and purchasing an investment condo for a price well above appraised value. The total amount of loss to the Estate exceeded $600,000.00. On September 6, 1996, the court removed Brown as Berger\u2019s guardian, for cause, and substituted Shawn R. Harby as guardian of the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Meanwhile, after making the first two monthly payments on the Note, Boney realized that Brown was not going to \u201cstraighten things out.\u201d When he stopped paying on the Note, Harby demanded payment. Boney made additional payments in February and March 1997, but none after that. Boney paid a total of approximately $8,900 on the Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In December 1996, Harby filed a claim against appellant Seaboard\u2019s guardian bond, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>City. One year after the Loan, on June 13, 1997, Harby also initiated foreclosure proceedings against the Boney house under the Deed of Trust, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The principal and interest due on the Note was $62,937.36. Boney counterclaimed, seeking to cancel or modify the Note and Deed of Trust as a result of Brown\u2019s fraud and legal malpractice. Boney also filed a third party complaint against Brown and a claim against the Client Security Trust Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Brown filed for bankruptcy protection, thereby staying Boney\u2019s civil claims against him. On August 6, 1997, Brown pled guilty to theft and fraudulent misappropriation of fiduciary funds. Brown was imprisoned and disbarred as a result of his thefts from the Estate and from others.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">On December 6, 1998, Mr. Berger died. Harby continued the Estate claims as personal representative of the Estate. The Estate\u2019s claim against Seaboard\u2019s guardian bond eventually settled for $544,995.26. This amount was equal to the Berger loss plus interest and expenses, minus net proceeds from sale of the investment condominium. As a result of the settlement, the Estate assigned to Seaboard all of its claims against Brown and Boney.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">At the bench trial on Boney\u2019s counterclaim for cancellation and modification of the Note and Deed of Trust, the parties stipulated facts and submitted other documentary evidence. The circuit court rendered its decision orally from the bench, finding that Boney</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">was the victim of fraud and legal malpractice by his attorney, Mr. Brown. He signed a note and a deed of trust for $60,000 and he did not receive $60,000. However, the second mortgage which he did owe ... was satisfied and paid off in the course of this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">The fcjourt finds that as a result of the fraud by Mr. Brown, who was at the time the substitute guardian of the property for John Berger as well as also being the attorney at law on behalf of Ernest Boney in June of 1996, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>equity requires that there be cancellation or modification of those instruments: the note and the deed of trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Seaboard\u2019s counsel objected that canceling or modifying the Note and Deed of Trust \u201cunjustly enriche[d] Mi*. Boney, given the amount of funds that were paid off on his behalf.\u201d When she requested that the court \u201cexplain [its] reasoning with regard to Mr. Brown\u2019s fraud being imputed to my client,\u201d the court replied that the fact that Brown was acting in his capacity as guardian of the Estate at the time of the Loan \u201cweighted] heavily in this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Modifying the Note, the court entered judgment on the counterclaim in favor of Seaboard for $9,589.70, which is the difference between the amount Boney owed on the second mortgage on the date of the Second Foreclosure sale ($22,-489.70), minus the amount Boney delivered to Brown to pay toward the second mortgage ($9,000), minus the amount of Boney\u2019s payments on the Note ($3,900). Both parties were dissatisfied with the amount of the judgment. When Seaboard appealed, Boney cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Au\">Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">In an action tried without a jury, we \u201cwill review the case on both the law and the evidence.\u201d Md.Rule 8-131 (c). When the issue to which appellant excepts, and on which the court ruled, is a purely legal issue, there being no dispute of fact, the appellate court\u2019s review is expansive. <em>See In re Michael G., </em>107 Md.App. 257, 265, 667 A.2d 956 (1995). \u201cThe clearly erroneous standard for appellate review ... does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based on findings of fact.\u201d <em>See Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990). In such cases, we must determine whether the trial court was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 592, 578 A.2d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Seaboard\u2019s Appeal: Who Bears The Risk Of Losses Caused By A Guardian-Attorney\u2019s Cross-Breaches Of Fiduciary Duty?</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">When asked why Seaboard, rather than Boney, should be charged with the losses caused by Brown\u2019s misconduct, the court explained that Brown\u2019s status as guardian of the Estate \u201cweighted] heavily in this decision.\u201d In its appeal, Seaboard argues that the court erred when it relieved Boney from Brown\u2019s fraud at its expense. It contends that neither the Estate nor Seaboard, as its assignee, should be held responsible for the malpractice Brown committed as Boney\u2019s attorney simply because Brown attempted to remedy that malpractice by cross-breaching his fiduciary duty to the Estate. In response, Boney contends that the trial court properly relieved Boney from the losses caused by Brown\u2019s misconduct, because those losses were covered by Seaboard under its guardianship bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The issue before us, then, is whether the circuit court erred in concluding that Boney could assert Brown\u2019s fraud and misconduct as a defense to the Note and Deed of Trust. Essentially, we must determine whether Brown\u2019s role as guardian of the Estate when he made the improper Loan and Seaboard\u2019s role as surety under the guardian bond insulated Boney from the consequences of his attorney\u2019s misconduct. We hold that the trial court erred in modifying the Note on the basis of Brown\u2019s fraud, and in treating Brown\u2019s status as guardian of the Estate or Seaboard\u2019s guardianship bond as grounds to do so. Applying established principles of agency, estoppel, guardianship, suretyship, and subrogation to the undisputed facts of this case, we conclude that, as between Seaboard and Boney, it is Boney who must bear the risk of losses caused by his attorney\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">Agency v. Guardianship</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> Brown and appellee had an attorney-client relationship. That relationship was not only a fiduciary one, it was</p>\n<p id=\"AzF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>also an agent-principal relationship. <em>See, e.g., Advance Fin. Co. v. Clients\u2019 Security Trust Fund, </em>337 Md. 195, 201, 652 A.2d 660 (1995)(\u201cagents are lawyers whose principals are clients\u201d); <em>Henley v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>305 Md. 320, 340, n. 5, 503 A.2d 1333, <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>305 Md. 320, 503 A.2d 1333 (1986) (\u201c[independent contractors generally considered to be agents include attorneys ... and other similar persons who conduct transactions for their principal\u201d). Because agents have the power to alter the legal relations of their principals, principals have the right to control their agents. <em>See Green v. H &amp; R Block, </em>355 Md. 488, 503-04, 735 A.2d 1039 (1999). A client\u2019s right to select and direct his or her attorney is a fundamental aspect of attorney-client relations. Thus, the principal-agent relationship between a client and an attorney is always a consensual one. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Agency, </em>\u00a7 1(1) cmt. b; <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 401 cmt. a (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In contrast, the relationship between Brown and the Estate was an involuntary guardianship relationship. A ward may not select, instruct, terminate, or otherwise control his guardian. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Vol., 2000 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 13 201(c) of the Estates and Trusts Article (\u201cET\u201d) (guardian substitutes its discretion and judgment for that of incompetent ward); ET \u00a7 13-221 (guardian removable only by court order). A guardian is a fiduciary who has control over the ward\u2019s property, -subject to court supervision, and is charged with preserving it \u201cfrom being squandered or improvidently used.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts, </em>\u00a7 13 cmt. a (1981). A guardian must \u201cutilize his powers ... to perform the services, exercise his discretion, and discharge his duties for the best interest of the ... disabled person or his dependents.\u201d ET \u00a7 13-206(c). Thus, the fundamental duty of a guardian of property is to preserve the property in the guardianship estate for the benefit of the ward and other persons with an interest in that property. To ensure the faithful performance of that duty, the guardian must post a judicial bond covering the value of the property in the fiduciary estate. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 10-702(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Guardians are not agents of either their wards or the bonding surety, because guardians are not subject to their control. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Agency, </em>\u00a7 14F cmt. b. Rather, the Court of Appeals has emphasized that the true guardian of every guardianship estate is the court itself, and that individuals who are appointed as guardians serve a unique role as agents of the court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">Lest sight be lost of the fact, we remind all concerned that a court of equity assumes jurisdiction in guardianship matters to protect those who, because of illness or other disability, are unable to care for themselves. In reality the court is the guardian; an individual who is given that title is merely an agent or arm of that tribunal in carrying out its sacred responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><em>Kicherer v. Kicherer, </em>285 Md. 114, 118, 400 A.2d 1097 (1979) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Equitable Estoppel By Agency</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Seaboard argues that the difference in the natures of Brown\u2019s relationships with Boney and with the Estate is outcome determinative, because Boney is legally responsible for Brown\u2019s misconduct under established principles of agency law. We agree, and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">A fundamental tenet of agency law is that a principal may be bound by even the wrongful acts of his agent. \u201cThe fact that the agent has wronged his principal through the agent\u2019s unlawful act does not provide a predicate for insulating the principal against the harm caused by the agent at the expense of the innocent third party who had no responsibility for the conduct of the agent.\u201d <em>Rothman v. Fillette, </em>503 Pa. 259, 469 A.2d 543, 546 (1983); <em>see also Coan v. Consol. Gas Elec. Light &amp; Power Co., </em>126 Md. 506, 511, 95 A. 151 (1915) (principal could not assert agent\u2019s fraud as defense to third party\u2019s claim for rescission of contract). This case falls within the parameters of the ancient maxim that \u201c \u2018when one of two innocent persons must suffer by the fraud of a third, the loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>shall fall upon him, who has enabled such third person to do the wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hall v. Hinks, </em>21 Md. 406, 418 (1864) (quoting <em>Lupin v. Marie, </em>2 Paige Rep. 169, 172, 1830 WL 2732).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">This aspect of agency is enforced through equitable estoppel, which has the effect of shifting to the principal the risk of loss arising from the agent\u2019s fraud toward an innocent third party. <em>In Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B. v. Chaires, </em>350 Md. 716, 715 A.2d 199 (1998), the Court of Appeals recently affirmed that a principal is equitably es-topped from asserting his agent\u2019s fraud as a defense against an innocent third party.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">[Ejquitable estoppel [is] \u2018the effect of the voluntary conduct of a party whereby he is absolutely precluded both at law and in equity, from asserting rights which might perhaps have otherwise existed ... as against another person, who has in good faith relied upon such conduct, and has been led thereby to change his position for the worse and who on his part requires some corresponding right....\u2019 [Pomeroy] describes the general principle underlying estoppel <em>in pais </em>as loss-shifting. Pomeroy states, \u2018When one of two innocent persons\u2014that is, persons each guiltless of an intentional, moral wrong\u2014must suffer a loss, it must be borne by that one of them who by his conduct\u2014acts or omissions\u2014has rendered the injury possible.... \u2019 \u2018[A]n estoppel may arise even where there is no intent to mislead, if the actions of one party cause a prejudicial change in the conduct of the other.\u2019 Indeed, all that is needed to create an equitable estoppel is (1) voluntary conduct or representation, (2) reliance, and (3) detriment.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">350 Md. at 737-38, 715 A.2d 199 (citations omitted). Whether the undisputed facts establish equitable estoppel is a question of law for the court. <em>See id. </em>at 744, 715 A.2d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Our review of the undisputed facts leads us to conclude that Boney cannot profit by the misconduct of his agent against the innocent guardianship Estate, who had no control over or responsibility for Brown\u2019s performance of his duties either as Boney\u2019s agent or as guardian. Boney was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>estopped from asserting Brown\u2019s fraud as a defense to the Note and Deed of Trust, because Boney enabled Brown\u2019s misconduct, even if he did not intend to do so. Among such \u201cenabling acts\u201d was Boney\u2019s decision to entrust both his money and his cause to Brown, even after Boney realized that Brown had mishandled the First Foreclosure and other legal matters that Boney entrusted to him, and even after Boney knew that Brown had compounded his incompetence and errors by covering them up. \u201c[I]f a loss occurs by which one of two innocent persons must suffer, that one should sustain the loss who has most trusted the party through whom the loss came.\u201d <em>Eversole v. Maull, </em>50 Md. 95, 106 (1878); <em>see also Thomas v. Green, </em>30 Md. 1, 7 (1869) (\u201c[f]or wherever one of two innocent persons must suffer from a false confidence or trust reposed in a third, he who has been the cause of that false confidence or trust, ought to suffer, rather than the other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Boney further enabled Brown\u2019s misconduct by failing to exercise diligence, or to take advantage of opportunities to become informed about the transactions Brown was handling for him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Principals must pay attention to what their agents are doing on their behalf, and they fail to do so at their own risk.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Boney agreed to participate in the ill-advised foreclosure scheme and accepted the Loan based solely on Brown\u2019s vague verbal assurances that he would \u201cstraighten things out\u201d and \u201ctake care of the damage.\u201d He might have avoided the Loan by making his second mortgage payments, or by declining to participate in the multi-layered foreclosure scheme, by arranging for his own loan, by firing Brown, or by declining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>sign the Note and Deed of Trust. He could have sought independent legal or financial advice at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The Loan occurred as a direct result of Brown\u2019s desperate efforts to extricate himself from the consequences of his fraud and legal malpractice toward Boney. The undisputed evidence clearly establishes that but for Brown\u2019s misconduct toward Boney in handling Boney\u2019s legal matters, Brown would not have made the Loan. But for Boney\u2019s willingness to go along with Brown\u2019s plans and to accept the Loan on the slender reed of Brown\u2019s reassurances, the Estate\u2019s funds' would not have been loaned. Thus, the misconduct that Brown committed in his capacity as Boney\u2019s agent proximately caused the Loan. As Brown\u2019s principal, Boney cannot profit by the misconduct of his agent against an innocent third party such as the Estate, who had no control over or responsibility for Brown\u2019s performance of his duties either as Boney\u2019s agent or as guardian. As between the Estate and Boney, it is Boney who is responsible for the Loan he accepted, and who is equitably estopped from challenging the Note and Deed of Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Effect Of Brown\u2019s Role As Guardian Of The Estate And Seaboard\u2019s Role As Surety Of The Guardianship Bond</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Boney argues that the circuit court properly considered Brown\u2019s role as guardian of the Estate as grounds for shifting the losses caused by Brown to Seaboard. He argues that Seaboard should bear the loss because Brown breached his fiduciary duty to the Estate when he made the Loan, and because Seaboard bonded Brown\u2019s faithful performance of his duties as guardian. He complains that \u201cjustice to Boney would be sacrificed because of the mere technicality that Brown is deemed an \u2018agent\u2019 for Boney, and a \u2018trustee\u2019 for Berger.\u201d We disagree. As discussed below, neither Brown\u2019s role as guardian of the Estate nor Seaboard\u2019s role as surety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>on the guardianship bond relieves Boney from the principles of agency and estoppel that govern this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">First, we do not agree with Boney\u2019s contention that Brown\u2019s status as a guardian was a \u201cmere technicality\u201d or a \u201csuperceding\u201d reason to shift the risk of loss to Seaboard. To the contrary, it actually provides more reason that the risk should remain on Boney. The duty of the courts to protect beneficiaries of a guardianship includes a duty to protect against the harmful consequences of fraud. In <em>Green v. Lombard, </em>28 Md.App. 1, 343 A.2d 905 (1975), this Court considered a guardian\u2019s fraudulent use of estate funds to make improper loans. We emphasized that the rule that fraud \u201ctaints and vitiates all that it touches .... is especially true when the victim occupies a position of confidence and trust with the perpetrator of the fraud and is either an aged [or] infirm person----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12, 343 A.2d 905. We think this rule and its underlying concerns for the welfare of the ward are even stronger when, as in this case, the fraud is committed by an attorney acting in dual roles as both guardian of the estate from which an improper loan is made, and as attorney for the client who receives the improper loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">This result is consistent with Maryland law governing persons dealing with guardians. A borrower with actual knowledge or reasonable cause to inquire whether the guardian is acting improperly in making a loan from estate funds bears the risk that the loan is improper.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ET \u00a7 13-219. In this case, Boney, as borrower, properly bears that risk, because when he signed the Note and Deed of Trust, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>had reason to inquire whether the Loan was proper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is undisputed that, before he agreed to accept the Loan, Boney knew that Brown had mishandled the First Foreclosure and other legal matters. Thus, he had reason to know that the Loan would personally benefit Brown by \u201cstraightening out\u201d the problems and losses that Brown had caused him. In these circumstances, Boney fairly may be held responsible for his decision to accept the Loan and to execute the Note and Deed of Trust \u201cwith no questions asked\u201d about its propriety. <em>See, e.g., Trenton Trust Co. v. Western Surety Co., </em>599 S.W.2d 481, 493-94 (Mo.1980) (when party to a transaction has reason to suspect that guardian has misappropriated estate assets for guardian\u2019s own benefit, party has reason to know that transaction was in breach of guardian\u2019s fiduciary duty, and acts in bad faith).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Furthermore, we are not persuaded that Seaboard must bear Boney\u2019s risk of loss merely because it bonded Brown as guardian of the Estate. First, we do not think that <em>National Surety Co. v. State to the use of Morgan, </em>152 Md. 71, 136 A. 274 (1927), stands for the proposition advanced by Boney: that Seaboard\u2019s bond was intended to cover losses to third parties harmed by the wrongful actions of the guardian in the course of their dealings with him. Instead, that case addressed whether the assignee of a mortgagee could make a claim against a bond securing the faithful execution of a trustee\u2019s duty under a mortgage. The Court of Appeals held that under a mortgage trustee\u2019s bond, the surety had a duty to the mortgagee and its assignee, because \u201cthe principal purpose of such a bond, and indeed the only reason for it, is to protect those who may be interested in the trust fund from just such acts [of misappropriation].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, 136 A. 274. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>That holding simply recognizes that mortgagees are \u201cpersons interested in such mortgaged property or the proceeds thereof.\u201d <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp. v. State, </em>163 Md. 119, 133, 161 A. 249 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Thus, <em>Morgan </em>merely affirmed that a mortgagee is an intended beneficiary of a mortgage bond. It did not extend the protections of all bonds to persons who have no claim to or interest in the property that the bonded fiduciary is charged with protecting. In <em>State to use of Murray v. Bishop, </em>24 Md. 310, 320 (1866), the Court of Appeals recognized that \u201c[t]he object of the guardian\u2019s bond is to secure the ward against illegal disposition of his property by the guardian, or its maladministration.... \u201d Third parties who may have been harmed by the guardian\u2019s wrongful actions \u201cmight be entitled to their action against [the guardian], to recover [damages resulting from his misconduct], but they have no right of action on the guardian\u2019s bond.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322. Thus, we reject Boney\u2019s contention that the protections of a guardian bond extend to members of the public who deal with the guardian, but who otherwise have no cognizable rights in or claim to the guardianship property.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">A guardian\u2019s bond is a court fiduciary bond that is legally mandated as an important means of protecting guardianship property. <em>See Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty, </em>\u00a7 71 cmt. d (1996). Its purpose is not to provide security for otherwise disinterested third parties who deal with the guardian. This limitation on the purpose and beneficiaries of a guardian bond is reflected in the language required under Maryland rules, and used in Seaboard\u2019s bond. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 10-702(e)., The bond states that both Brown \u201cas Principal\u201d and Seaboard as \u201cSurety,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">are held and firmly bound unto the State of Maryland, in the full and just sum of ... $1,250,000.00, to be paid to the State of Maryland aforesaid; to which payment, well and truly made and done, [they] bind [them]selves____Now the Condition of the above Obligation is such, that if ... Brown as Guardian ... shall faithfully account with the Orphans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Court of Baltimore City, as directed by law for the management of the property and Estate of the Incompetent under care, and shall also deliver up the said property; agreeably to the order of said Court, or the directions of law, and shall, in all respects, perform the duty of Guardian to the said Incompetent according to law, then the above obligation shall cease; it shall otherwise remain in full force and virtue in law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">This limitation on the scope of a guardian bond promotes the purpose of guardianship proceedings, not only by protecting guardianship property, but also by promoting the guardian\u2019s faithful performance of fiduciary duties. Under established principles governing fiduciary relations, the risk of financial losses caused by a fiduciary\u2019s misconduct remains on the fiduciary as an incentive for the fiduciary to faithfully perform. It has long been held that the fiduciary estate itself is not liable for its fiduciary\u2019s misconduct toward others.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">\u2018It seems to have been thought, that if [fiduciaries] are guilty of a breach of [fiduciary duty], the persons damnified thereby have a right to be indemnified out of the [fiduciary] funds. That is contrary to all reason and justice and common sense. Such a perversion of the intention of the [person creating the fiduciary estate] would lead to the most inconvenient consequences. The [fiduciaries] would, in that case, be indemnified against the consequences of their own misconduct, and the real object of the [fiduciary estate] would be defeated. * * * Damages are to be paid from the pocket of the wrong-doer, not from the [fiduciary] fund.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1q\"><em>Perry v. House of Refuge, </em>63 Md. 20, 27 (1885) (quoting Lord Campbell regarding charitable trusts). Thus, third parties seeking redress for a guardian\u2019s wrongful acts must look directly to the guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">We do not think that the addition of a guardian bond shifts the risk of loss away from the guardian. Once a surety makes the guardianship estate whole in accordance with the terms of a guardian bond, the surety is subrogated to the rights of the guardianship estate, and may recover from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the guardian any amounts paid to the estate under the bond. In addition, the surety may assert any claims that the guardianship estate may have had against collateral and any defenses that the estate may have had against third parties who dealt with the guardian. <em>See generally Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty, </em>\u00a7 28 (rights obtained through subrogation).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">We are not persuaded that the rule should be different in cases involving an attorney-guardian. Expanding a surety\u2019s liability under a guardian bond to cover losses caused by an attorney-guardian\u2019s misconduct to third parties effectively would convert the guardian bond into legal malpractice insurance, and may impose undue burdens on the guardianship estate. We find merit in Seaboard\u2019s contention that if fiduciary bonds are construed to cover the consequences of an attorney-fiduciary\u2019s wrongful use of his fiduciary position to \u201ccover up\u201d unrelated malpractice, sureties would be less likely to issue fiduciary bonds for attorneys at the same rate or frequency as for fiduciaries who are not attorneys. Fiduciary bond premiums are significantly less expensive than legal malpractice insurance. Sureties understandably would raise fiduciary bond premiums if the selection of an attorney as the fiduciary would increase the liability risk. Courts would be more reluctant to appoint attorneys if doing so imposes an additional expense on the estate, and more reluctant to excuse bonds for attorney-fiduciaries if doing so exposes the estate to third party damages. Thus, courts and fiduciary beneficiaries would be either discouraged from or financially penalized by selecting an attorney as fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The anomalous result would be fewer attorneys serving as guardians, trustees, personal representatives, or other fiduciaries, even though sureties traditionally have preferred attorneys as fiduciaries because their fiduciary experience generally decreases the risk of misconduct. Moreover, as officers of the appointing court, attorneys must adhere to established rules of professional conduct, including specific rules governing handling of third party money. They have fiduciary duties to all clients, in addition to their fiduciary duties to the estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Attorneys also have a unique motivation to avoid breaching their fiduciary duties, because doing so may result in disbarment or other disciplinary measures, and may damage their reputation and livelihood. Indeed, we recognize that in estates with no fiduciary bond, the nature of the attorney-fiduciary\u2019s relationship with the court can serve as an important protection for the fiduciary estate and its beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">We hold that the trial court erred in modifying the Note and Deed of Trust on the basis of Brown\u2019s status as guardian or Seaboard\u2019s guardianship bond. Our decision- in Seaboard\u2019s appeal moots Boney\u2019s cross-appeal and Seaboard\u2019s alternative contentions regarding the amount of the restitutionary judgment. We shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court, and remand with instructions to enter judgment denying Boney\u2019s counterclaim for rescission, cancellation, or modification of the Note and Deed of Trust. As the subrogee and assignee of the Estate, Seaboard is entitled to pursue payment and foreclosure rights under the Note and Deed of Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
