Appellant presents the following question for review, which we have re-phrased and consolidated for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">Did the trial court err in granting appellee\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment regarding appellant\u2019s petition of appeal of MDE\u2019s administrative decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to this question and explain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Appellant owned and operated gas stations in Maryland, and was cited by appellee for oil contamination at two of its gas stations\u2014one in Upper Marlboro and one in Hyattsville. Appellant was ordered to remedy these environmental concerns and implemented plans to do so. After successfully cleaning up the sites, appellant received notices of compliance from MDE for both sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">In 1995, appellant applied to appellee for reimbursement of costs associated with the removal and off-site treatment of contaminated soil at these sites, pursuant to the Maryland Oil Contaminated Site Environmental Cleanup Fund (\u201cFund\u201d) of Title 4, subtitle 7 of the Environment Article. The Fund was created by the General Assembly in 1993 and amended in 1996. The parties agree that the 1996 amendment does not directly affect this case, as this action is based on events occurring prior to 1996. Following is a reproduction of the relevant portions of Title 4, subtitle 7 of the Environment Article, as it read prior to the 1996 amendment:</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00a7 4-701 provides relevant definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014In this subtitle the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">(b) Cleanup.\u2014\u201cCleanup\u201d means abatement, containment, removal, and disposal of oil and the restoration of the environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">(c) Fund.\u2014\u201cFund\u201d means the Oil Contaminated Site Environmental Cleanup Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>(d) Oil.\u2014\u201cOil\u201d has the meaning provided in \u00a7 4-401(g) of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">(e) <em>Site </em>rehabilitation.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">(1) \u201cSite rehabilitation\u201d means cleanup actions taken in response to a release from an underground oil storage tank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">(2) \u201cSite rehabilitation\u201d includes investigation, evaluation, planning, design, engineering, construction, or other services undertaken and expenses incurred to investigate or clean up affected soils, groundwater, or surface water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">(f) <em>Third party </em>claim.\u2014\u201cThird party claim\u201d means any civil action brought or asserted by any person against any owner or operator of any underground oil storage tank for damages to person or property which damages are the direct result of oil released from tanks covered under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">(g) <em>Underground oil storage </em>tank.\u2014\u201cUnderground oil storage tank\u201d has the meaning provided in \u00a7 4-401 (k) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">\u00a7 4-702 provides legislative findings and intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">(a) Findings.\u2014The General Assembly finds and declares that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">(1) The storage of oil in underground oil storage tanks is a major cause of groundwater contamination in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">(2) Groundwater resources are vital to the population and economy of this State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">(3) The preservation of the State\u2019s groundwater resources is in the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">(b) <em>Additional </em>Findings.\u2014The General Assembly further finds that where contamination of groundwater has occurred due to leaking underground oil storage tanks, remedial measures have often been delayed for long periods due to high costs of such remedial measures.

The Department may approve other site rehabilitation costs for reimbursement if it determines the costs are for effective and necessary site rehabilitation activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">COMAR, Title 26, Subtitle 10, Chapter 14</p>\n<p id=\"AZc\">Appellant claims that it \u201cexcavated and treated 2,131 tons of contaminated soil from the Upper Marlboro site ... at a cost of over $105,000\u201d and that it \u201cexcavated and treated 3,517 tons of contaminated soil from the Hyattsville site ... at a cost of over $175,000.\u201d Interpreting its own regulations, MDE determined that the costs in question were for \u201csoil handling\u201d and \u201csoil treatment,\u201d and reimbursed appellant $32,263.08 for the Upper Marlboro site and $36,410.01 for the Hyattsville site. These amounts were established primarily as a result of the maximum allowable reimbursement limits for \u201csoil handling\u201d and \u201csoil treatment\u201d under \u00a7 .05A of COMAR 26.10.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Appellant, dissatisfied with the amount of the reimbursement provided by appellee, requested that MDE reconsider its determination and provide it with additional reimbursement under \u00a7 .05B of COMAR 26.10.14 for \u201cother site rehabilitation costs for reimbursement\u201d that appellant claimed were \u201cfor effective and necessary site rehabilitation activities.\u201d MDE rejected appellant\u2019s request, stating in a letter to appellant that it believed \u201cthat additional reimbursement would be beyond the cost allowed in the current regulations\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Department has reimbursed you under COMAR 26.10.14.05A(1) and A(2) for soil removal and treatment. CO-MAR 26.10.14B applies to rehabilitation costs not listed under Regulation .05A....\u201d Appellant subsequently filed a notice of appeal with MDE. In response, MDE stated that \u201cit would be inappropriate to allocate additional funds. Under COMAR 26.10.14.04D, this decision is final regarding reimbursement matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Appellant then filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County requesting judicial review of MDE\u2019s reimbursement decision pursuant to applicable provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), or, in the alternative, a writ of mandamus ordering MDE to pay additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>reimbursements. Ultimately, the circuit court did not rule on the motion regarding the mandamus petition but remanded the case to MDE for the issuance of a written decision outlining MDE\u2019s specific findings of facts and conclusions of law upon which it had based its denial of additional reimbursements. MDE then appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision to remand the case. In an unreported opinion, Judge Rosalyn B. Bell wrote for this Court, holding that appellant did not have the right to judicial review under the APA, and that its petition for mandamus failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Regarding the right to judicial review under the APA, we stated that \u201cwe hold that \u00a7 4\u2014412(b) grants APA judicial review only for MDE decisions issued pursuant to Subtitle Four, Title Four of the Environment Article.\u201d Pertaining to appellant\u2019s petition for mandamus, we allowed for the filing of an amended petition for mandamus, as we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">[Appellant\u2019s] allegations are much too sparse and conclusory to support a claim that MDE officials acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Thus, Homes cannot be allowed to proceed on that pleading; if it wants review of MDE\u2019s reimbursement decision, it will have to re-file a pleading which contains more specific allegations entitling it to relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><em>Maryland Department of the Environment v. Homes Oil Company, Inc., </em>No. 541, September Term, 1997, 122 Md.App. 789 (filed July 24, 1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Appellant subsequently filed an amended complaint in mandamus. MDE responded by filing a motion for summary judgment on the ground that its reimbursement decisions were consistent with the reasonable interpretation of its own regulations. MDE\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted by the circuit court. Appellant then moved to alter or amend the judgment; appellant\u2019s motion was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment when material facts were in dispute. Pursuant to Md. Rule 2-501 (e), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u201c[t]he court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md.Rule 2-501(e). <em>See, e.g., Murphy v. Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. 525, 531, 697 A.2d 861 (1997); <em>Bowen v. Smith, </em>342 Md. 449, 454, 677 A.2d 81 (1996); <em>Rosenblatt v.

Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 244, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992). This Court has held that \u201c[cjonclusory denials or bald allegations will not defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Barber v. Eastern Karting Co., </em>108 Md.App. 659, 672, 673 A.2d 744, <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 334, 681 A.2d 69 (1996); <em>see Seaboard Sur. Co., </em>91 Md.App. at 243, 603 A.2d 1357. Moreover, \u201ca mere scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party\u2019s claim is insufficient to avoid the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Barber, </em>108 Md.App. at 672, 673 A.2d 744 (citing <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 738, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Appellant contends that an actual controversy does exist on two issues: 1) whether MDE\u2019s handling of appellant\u2019s reimbursement applications to the Fund was arbitrary and capricious, because MDE limited reimbursement to the amounts specified in Section A of COMAR 26.10.14.05, and refused to reimburse appellant under Section B of that statute for other remediation costs;, and 2) whether COMAR 26.10.14.05 is invalid because it provides incentive for applicants to delay clean-up of oil contaminated sites, contrary to the legislative intent. By contrast, MDE asserts that the motion for summary judgment was properly granted because there was no dispute as to any facts, as its reimbursement decisions were consistent with the reasonable interpretation of its own regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>lations. We agree with MDE, and find no merit in appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\n<em>Writ of Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The method of review in this case is by means of a writ of mandamus. Therefore, we shall first address the threshold question of whether this Court has the authority to issue the extraordinary writ of mandamus under the circumstances of this case. \u201cThe common law writ of mandamus is an original action and not an appeal.\u201d <em>Philip Morris Inc., et al. v. The Honorable Edward J. Angeletti, </em>358 Md. 689, 707, 752 A.2d 200 (2000). <em>See Board of License Commissioners for Anne Arundel County v. Corridor Wine, Inc., t/a Corridor Wine &amp; Spirits, et al., </em>361 Md. 403, 411, 761 A.2d 916 (2000), slip opinion at 8. A writ of mandamus \u201cis a summary remedy, for the want of a specific one, where there would otherwise be a failure of justice. It is based upon reasons of justice and public policy, to preserve peace, order and good government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708, 752 A.2d 200 (citations omitted). \u201c[T]he authority to issue mandamus rests within the sound discretion of the court, but that discretion must \u2018be exercised under the rules long recognized and established at common law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cWe have acknowledged that the power to issue an extraordinary writ of mandamus is one which ought to be exercised with great caution.\u201d <em>Doering v. Fader, </em>316 Md. 351, 361, 558 A.2d 733 (1989). Although the Maryland Constitution only provides circuit courts with statutory authority to grant mandamus, the Court of Appeals has stated that \u201cwe have jurisdiction to issue to an inferior court peremptory writs in aid of our appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Philip Morris, </em>358 Md. at 710-11, 752 A.2d 200. In support of this conclusion, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">Whether we have, as the highest court of this State, an inherent superintending or supervisory power over the courts below us in the judicial hierarchy, and whether any such power is implicit in Article IV, \u00a7 18 of the Maryland Constitution, are questions we reserve for another day. We need not and do not address them today because we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that under the circumstances of this case we have the power to issue a writ of mandamus or a writ of prohibition in aid of our appellate jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 710, 752 A.2d 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The <em>Philip Moms </em>Court explained that mandamus is in aid to appellate jurisdiction when the use of it is necessary to enable the Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 711, 752 A.2d 200. The Court explained that mandamus aided the appellate process \u201cby making possible the review of a potentially unreviewable question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For similar reasons, it is within the purview of this Court to issue writs of mandamus. <em>See Bozeman v. Disability Review Bd. of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Pension Plan, </em>126 Md.App. 1, 727 A.2d 384 (1999).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">In Maryland common law mandamus has been described as a prerogative writ grantable where the public justice of the State is concerned. It is a writ to prevent disorder, from a failure of justice, where the law has established no specific remedy, and where in justice and good government there' ought to be one....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\"><em>In re Writ of Prohibition, </em>312 Md. 280, 307, 539 A.2d 664 (1988) (citation omitted) (inner quotation marks omitted). A writ of mandamus will only be issued in <em>extraordinary cases </em>where that \u201caction is necessary to protect its jurisdiction or accomplish substantial justice.\u201d <em>Philip Morris, </em>358 Md. at 718, 752 A.2d 200. The Court ultimately granted mandamus in <em>Philip Morris, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">We simply hold that, given the irreparable harm that might otherwise be suffered by the legal system and by Petitioners, we may issue a writ of mandamus in aid of our appellate jurisdiction in the present matter. It is appropriately within this Court\u2019s prerogative to review the order of the Circuit Court granting class certification in this case so extraordinary because of the immense amount of time and expense that both the parties and the judicial system of this State will incur should the litigation proceed as a class action, as well as the astronomical number of persons in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Maryland whose lives will be affected by our decision either way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 722, 752 A.2d 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In <em>Goodwich, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that \u201cjudicial review is properly sought through a writ of mandamus \u2018where there [is] no statutory provision for hearing or review and where public officials [are] alleged to have abused the discretionary powers reposed in them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 680 A.2d 1040 (quoting <em>State Department of Health v. Walker, </em>238 Md. 512, 522-23, 209 A.2d 555 (1965)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThus, prior to granting a writ of mandamus to review discretionary acts, there must be both a lack of an available procedure for obtaining review and an allegation that the action complained of is illegal, arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Goodwich, </em>343 Md. at 146, 680 A.2d 1040. In <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Carusillo, </em>52 Md.App. 44, 50, 447 A.2d 90 (1982), we stated, \u201cthe writ will lie if no statutory provision for a hearing or review exists <em>and </em>public officials are alleged to have abused their discretion.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Regarding the first point of this two-step analysis, the Court of Appeals has stated that \u201c[i]t is well settled in this State that a writ of mandamus will not be granted where the petitioner has a specific and adequate legal remedy to meet the justice of the particular case and where the law affords [another] adequate remedy.\u201d <em>Brack v. Wells, </em>184 Md. 86, 90-91, 40 A.2d 319 (1944); see also <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Elections Board, </em>345 Md. 477, 497, 693 A.2d 757 (1997). Our earlier unreported opinion in this case stated that there was no method of review available to appellant other than mandamus. We will not now disturb that determination. Therefore, appellant has met the first criteria, but, in order for mandamus to be appropriate under the facts of this case, appellant must also demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>that the second criteria has been met, namely, that MDE acted arbitrarily or capriciously.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">We find that MDE did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in making its determination, and, therefore, we decline to grant mandamus. Subsequently, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of MDE.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In <em>Goodwich, </em>our Court of Appeals opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEh\">Our mandamus jurisprudence is illustrated both by those cases in which we have granted the writ, as well as those in which we have refused to issue it. For example, in <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Rosenberg, </em>269 Md. 520, 307 A.2d 704 (1973), we held that mandamus relief was appropriate because there was no statutory provision for judicial review and because the Planning Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to approve a plan for the subdivision of a piece of property. <em>Id. </em>at 529-31, 307 A.2d at 708-10. In <em>[State Dept. of Health v.] Walker, supra, </em>[238 Md. 512, 209 A.2d 555 (1965)] mandamus was granted in the absence of provision for hearing or review and where the issuance of sewage disposal permits was arbitrarily denied. 238 Md. at 522-23, 209 A.2d at 561. In <em>Heaps [v. Cobb], supra, </em>[185 Md. 372, 45 A.2d 73 (1945)] again we found mandamus relief warranted in the absence of provision for judicial review and where the Board of Trustees of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System arbitrarily denied a pension claim by a member\u2019s widow. 185 Md. at 379-86, 45 A.2d at 76-79.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">In <em>Bovey [v.

We denied relief on the basis that the Director was free to exercise discretion in assuring the impartiality of panelists; therefore, mandamus would not lie to compel him to follow a specific procedure. 292 Md. at 649, 441 A.2d at 338. We also stated that judicial review existed to correct any such errors on the Director\u2019s part. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Stark v.

Appellant cites <em>White v. North, </em>121 Md.App. 196, 219, 708 A.2d 1093 (1998). That case was <em>reversed and remanded </em>by the Court of Appeals in <em>White v.

That case, which did not involve a writ of mandamus, is inapposite to the instant case, as the Court of Appeals discussed only judicial review of <em>zoning </em>matters and applied a \u201cfairly debatable\u201d test. Moreover, appellant apparently loses sight of the fact that mandamus can be granted only if MDE acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or contrary to law. Any error short of this standard does not call for the granting of appellant\u2019s mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Having articulated the appropriate rule of law, we proceed to the substance of appellant\u2019s claims. We observe that, where the classification of appellant\u2019s costs was completely within MDE\u2019s discretion, we should not substitute our expertise for that of an agency interpreting its own regulations. \u201cUpon appellate review, courts bestow special favor on an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation.\u201d <em>Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Reeders Memorial Home, </em>86 Md.App. 447, 453, 586 A.2d 1295 (1991). Recognizing an agency\u2019s superior ability to understand its own rules and regulations, a \u201ccourt should not substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apartments, </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Appellant contends that the manner in which MDE applied its regulations was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law. In order to disturb MDE\u2019s decision, we would have to find this contention to be true. In <em>Hurl v. Board of Education, </em>107 Md.App. 286, 305, 667 A.2d 970 (1995), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>In order to determine whether the appellant sufficiently alleged facts of \u201carbitrariness and capriciousness,\u201d we first must define what is meant by those terms. \u201cDecisions contrary to law or unsupported by substantial evidence are not within the exercise of sound administrative discretion, but are arbitrary and illegal acts.\u201d <em>Department of Health v. Walker, </em>238 Md. 512, 523, 209 A.2d 555 (1965). See also <em>Hackley v. City of Baltimore, </em>70 Md.App. 111, 116, 519 A.2d 1354 (1987). BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY (6th ed.1990) (citations omitted) defines the term \u201carbitrary\u201d as including something done \u201cwithout adequate determining principle,\u201d \u201cnonrational,\u201d and \u201cwillful and unreasoning action, without consideration and regard for facts and circumstances presented\u201d; and the term \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d as \u201cwillful and unreasonable action without consideration or in disregard of facts or law or without determining principle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aeg\"><em>Hurl, </em>107 Md.App. at 306, 667 A.2d 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">In <em>Hurl, </em>we were addressing whether the Board of Education\u2019s actions had been arbitrary and capricious. We stated that \u201cthe State Board regulations define decisions of a county board as being \u2018arbitrary\u2019 where \u2018contrary to sound educational policy\u2019 and/or where a \u2018reasoning mind could not have reasonably reached the conclusion the county board reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In that case, we were unable to find any evidence that the Superintendent acted arbitrarily or capriciously in any way in transferring appellant, a veteran teacher. We stated, \u201cFirst, appellant has not shown, nor have we found, anything to indicate that a superintendent is forbidden from making a transfer decision based on his subjective professional judgment. Second, even if his or her subjective rationale is without merit, that does not mean the decision is arbitrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 667 A.2d 970. We also stated that appellant \u201chad been given reasons for her transfer. Although the reasons were not to her liking, this does not make the decision itself arbitrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, 667 A.2d 970.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Similarly, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find no implication that the agency (in this case MDE) acted arbitrarily, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>capriciously, or illegally. Our review indicates that MDE acted reasonably within its administrative discretion. From the record before us, we find no reason to believe that MDE acted unreasonably or without consideration and regard for the facts and circumstances presented in this case. In our prior unreported opinion in this case, we stated that appellant\u2019s pleading was \u201cmuch too general to support a mandamus claim.\u201d We recognized appellant\u2019s allegations that MDE\u2019s refusal to grant all of the requested reimbursement was \u201cunsupported by competent, material and substantial evidence ... is in direct conflict with the clearly expressed intent of the legislature ... exceeds the authority granted by the Statute ... is unreasonable in light of all of the facts and circumstances .... \u201d Nonetheless, we found that appellant\u2019s \u201callegations are much too sparse and conclusory to support a claim that MDE officials acted arbitrarily and capriciously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We reach the same conclusion today. MDE reviewed appellant\u2019s reimbursement request. It decided to reimburse appellant an amount that it found to be correct and appropriate according to the relevant statute and the regulations it had adopted in furtherance of that statute. It responded to appellant\u2019s letters, and at all times provided appellant with a consistent explanation as to how the reimbursement amounts were determined in this case. MDE\u2019s findings and interpretations in this case appear sensible, logical and wholly based on the applicable rules and regulations. Nowhere do we find any reason to believe that MDE acted arbitrarily or capriciously. MDE\u2019s decision was ultimately decided based on its discretion whether to include appellant\u2019s costs under \u00a7 .05B, and we will not disturb that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Appellant\u2019s applications to the Fund for the two subject sites were approved in 1994 and 1995, thus subjecting this situation to the applicable statute as it was written prior to the 1996 amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The maximum reimbursement amount for any site was, and is, $125,000. Appellant owned and operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>more than thirty underground storage tanks within Maryland; therefore, pursuant to the statute, the applicable deductible for each site was $40,000. As a result, the maximum reimbursable amount for each site was $85,000. This amount was then subject to the application of the category limits as detailed in \u00a7 .05A. According to \u00a7 .05A, a maximum of $2,000 for soil handling and a maximum of $30,000 for soil treatment could be awarded to appellant at each site.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">MDE\u2019s determination of what type of costs appellant had incurred was dispositive as to how much reimbursement appellant would be entitled. Appellant contends that it should be reimbursed additional expenses under \u00a7 .05B because its costs represented \u201cother site rehabilitation costs,\u201d and thus should not have been subjected to the limitations imposed by \u00a7 .05A. Appellant correctly states that, had MDE not classified appellant\u2019s expenses under \u00a7 .05A, appellant\u2019s expenses may have been covered instead by \u00a7 .05B, which provides for much more liberal reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Section .05B provided that \u201cthe Department <em>may </em>assess other site rehabilitation costs for reimbursement <em>if it determines </em>the costs are for effective and necessary treatment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) MDE contends that, \u201ceven assuming that [appellant\u2019s] costs qualified for consideration under [\u00a7 .05B], the relief [appellant] seeks is simply beyond the reach of mandamus, because it would require the court to substitute its discretion for that of [MDE].\u201d MDE argues that \u201cthe permissive language of [\u00a7 .05B] conveys broad discretion to [MDE] in determining whether and, if so, how much reimbursement to award an applicant for qualifying costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">On the other hand, Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">Section .05B may reasonably be read as a \u201csavings clause\u201d that not only applies to activities not listed in \u00a7 .05A, but also supplements \u201cother costs\u201d incurred in connection with the listed activities. So read, the regulations would provide reasonable reimbursement where site conditions demand or permit unusual or innovative treatment methods, even if they also involve activities listed in \u00a7 .05A.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Appellant attempts to convince us that its actio ties \u201clisted in \u00a7 .05A\u201d should nonetheless be interpreted to qualify for reimbursement under \u00a7 .05B because they involve \u201cunusual or innovative methods.\u201d Applying this argument, appellant contends that its off-site bioremediation should not be classified as \u201csoil treatment\u201d under the statute, and thus should be considered under \u00a7 .05B.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">MDE addresses this contention in its brief, replying that \u00a7 .05A(1) \u201cdeals expressly with excavation, transportation, and proper disposal ... [t]hese activities by their very nature encompass the removal of soil from the site ... \u00a7 .05A(2) is entirely neutral as to the location at which soil treatment takes place ... [finally, the term \u2018on-site\u2019 appears nowhere in either provision.\u201d MDE further explains that appellant\u2019s treatment of the soil was not distinct from the soil treatment described in \u00a7 .05A. MDE asserts that its interpretation of the term \u201csoil treatment\u201d does <em>not </em>exclude the bioremediation method used by appellant, that the soil was treated at a facility licensed by MDE, and that bioremediation is one of several methods used by the licensed facilities to treat oil contaminated soil. Consequently, MDE contends that there is no merit to appellant\u2019s argument that its soil treatment was not performed pursuant to \u00a7 .05A, nor that it used \u201cunusual or innovative treatment methods.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Appellant asserts that MDE\u2019s interpretation of the statute is illogical and \u201cunfathomable,\u201d and takes particular exception to \u00a7 .05A(1), which limits reimbursement for soil handling activities to \u201cup to $20 per ton up to 100 tons per site,\u201d or $2,000. Appellant argues that \u201c[a] rationale for the $2,000 limit does not appear on the face of the regulation\u201d and that \u201c[t]here has been <em>no </em>finding by the Agency that $20 per ton is the usual, customary, or reasonable cost for soil handling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Appellant\u2019s contentions are simply not persuasive. This Court is not the proper forum for appellant\u2019s disagreement with the rationale and purpose of specific provisions of the applicable regulation. Such concerns are not for the courts to address. Instead, appellant may wish to direct its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>dissatisfaction with the practical consequences of this statute to the legislature, thereby possibly working toward less costly clean-up efforts in the future. COMAR 26.10.14.05 was a regulation established by MDE for purposes of implementing the legislative intent of the Fund that was set forth by the General Assembly in Title 4, subtitle 7 of the Environment Article. Appellant\u2019s contention that MDE\u2019s regulations are not effective at encouraging expeditious cleanups is beyond the proper scope of our review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsJ\">This power of review, whether authorized by statute or assumed inherently, cannot be a substitution of the court\u2019s judgment for that of the agency. In those instances where an administrative agency is acting in a manner which may be considered legislative in nature (quasi-legislative), the judiciary\u2019s scope of review of that particular action is limited to assessing whether the agency was acting within its legal boundaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><em>Fogle v. H &amp; G Restaurant, </em>337 Md. 441, 454, 654 A.2d 449 (1995).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">State agencies often perform functions that are legislative in nature. Promulgation of new regulations by agencies is one of these so-called quasi-legislative activities. The regulation at issue in the instant case was adopted by way of the rule-making process. Agency regulations must be consistent with the letter and the spirit of the law under which the agency acts. Furthermore, while it is well-settled that there must be sufficient guidance given when legislative authority is delegated to agencies, we have held that \u201cthe modern tendency of the courts is toward greater liberality in permitting grants of discretion to administrative officials in order to facilitate the administration of laws as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>complexity of governmental and economic conditions increase.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 453, 654 A.2d 449 (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of judicial review, as set forth in \u00a7 215(c)(2), namely, whether a reasoning mind could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached, is inapplicable as our prior cases indicate where the agency is acting in a quasi-legislative mode in considering and adopting regulations within the boundaries of its rule-making authority. See also <em>Montgomery County v. Woodward &amp; Lothrop, Inc., </em>280 Md. 686, 711, 376 A.2d 483 (1977). It is thus \u201cnot the function of the courts to pass upon the wisdom of the regulation, or to approve or disapprove it, if it does not exceed constitutional limits.\u201d <em>Givner v. Commissioner of Health, </em>207 Md. 184, 192, 113 A.2d 899 (1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 456, 654 A.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In any event, our reading of the relevant legislation indicates that the legislature did not intend to provide contaminators with <em>full </em>reimbursement in their clean-up efforts. It appears that the Fund is a means of subsidizing a portion of the clean-up costs associated with underground storage tanks; nowhere is it stated or implied that this Fund should provide contaminators with <em>full </em>reimbursement for their clean-up efforts. The Fund was established to provide assistance and <em>adequate </em>financial resources for these clean-up efforts. We are somewhat troubled by appellant\u2019s assertions, as appellant too readily finds that it is <em>entitled </em>to reimbursement for merely <em>obeying the law. </em>We note that there exist a multitude of laws within our society that require citizens and corporations to spend large amounts of money in order to comply with numerous social policies, without any provisions for any type of government reimbursement. Aside from reimbursement for clean-up costs, the contaminator\u2019s desire to be environmentally responsible, to abide by the laws of the State, and to increase the marketability of its property seem to be strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>encouragement for companies in this predicament to \u201cclean up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Appellant points out that the 100-ton limit imposed by this legislation pertaining to soil handling activities was eliminated in the 1996 amendment to this statute. This amendment was established to be effective prospectively, for applications filed after July 1, 1996, and therefore does not affect the case <em>sub judice. </em>Appellant argues, however, that the amendment itself indicates MDE\u2019s acknowledgment that the 100-ton limit was inappropriate. We do not assess whether this contention is true and find it to be irrelevant. The limit was in effect during the critical time pertaining to the facts of this case. MDE had undoubtedly imposed this limit, as well as the other limits within this legislation, in order to be certain that enough money would be available to assist a larger number of applicants. Therefore, the limit was directly related to the intent, and we do not concern ourselves with the fact that MDE saw it necessary at a later time to eliminate this limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Appellant contends that \u201cthe regulation can be harmonized with the statute by reading \u00a7 .05B to include <em>costs </em>not covered by \u00a7 .05A which are for effective and necessary activities, regardless of whether the particular <em>activities </em>are also listed in \u00a7 .05A.\u201d Appellant argues that, \u201c[b]y giving \u00a7 .05A preclusive effect, the Agency effectively renders \u00a7 .05B a nullity, since \u00a7 .05A covers just about every activity involved in site rehabilitation.\u201d Appellant states that \u201c[tjhere is hardly any activity left that can possibly qualify for \u00a7 .05B, if B only applies to other \u2018activities.\u2019 \u201d It asserts that MDE should have looked outside of \u00a7 .05A because its rehabilitation system was innovative and not contemplated by the regulations. It also posits that \u00a7 .05B is a savings clause and should have been applied in this case, and that MDE\u2019s refusal to do so was \u201can abuse of discretion based on its illegal interpretation of the regulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Appellant further asserts that MDE\u2019s interpretation of the regulation is inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s stated intent, and that the regulation, as interpreted by MDE, disadvan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>tages an applicant, who, like appellant, rehabilitates its site expeditiously, because the benefits under the statute are reduced when an applicant rehabilitates its site within one year. It avers that this is the case because, if an applicant completes the clean-up within one year, the applicant would not be eligible for the full statutory benefit of $125,000. We find this argument without merit. Appellant completely and erroneously rules out the possibility that an applicant would receive reimbursement under \u00a7 .05B for additional activities not listed in \u00a7 .05A, therefore providing the applicant with a means of receiving additional reimbursement above and beyond what is allowable within \u00a7 ,05A. Thus, an applicant could indeed be reimbursed up to the limit of $125,000 per occurrence, provided the appropriate deductible is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">MDE\u2019s response to these contentions is that \u00a7 .05B provides reimbursement only for site rehabilitation activities not identified in \u00a7 .05A. As we have stated, the language in \u00a7 .05B, as it was written prior to the 1996 amendment, provided: \u201cThe Department may approve other site rehabilitation costs for reimbursement if it determines the costs are for effective and necessary site rehabilitation activities.\u201d We find that MDE\u2019s interpretation of the statute appears to be in line with the legislative intent. As the Court of Appeals recently stated in <em>Sacchet v. Blan, </em>\u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the true legislative intent that lies behind the statutory enactment itself.\u201d 353 Md. 87, 92, 724 A.2d 667 (1999); <em>see also Catonsville Nursing v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 570, 709 A.2d 749 (1998); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471 (1988). To determine the legislative intent, we primarily look to \u201cthe plain language of the statute, with the words given their ordinary and natural meanings.\u201d <em>Sacchet, </em>353 Md. at 92, 724 A.2d 667; <em>see also Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">When the words in a statute could be given more than one meaning, \u201cthe court may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning, rather than another, and adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the construction that promotes the most reasonable result in light of the objectives and purpose of the enactment.\u201d <em>Fox v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>126 Md.App. 279, 285, 728 A.2d 776, <em>cert. denied, </em>355 Md. 612, 735 A.2d 1106 (1999) (citing <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986)). \u201c[A]ll sections ... must be read together, in conjunction with one another, to discern the true intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Philip Electronics North America, et al. v. Wright, </em>348 Md. 209, 216, 703 A.2d 150 (1997); see <em>also Vest v. Giant Food Stores, Inc., </em>329 Md. 461, 466-67, 620 A.2d 340 (1993); <em>Ryder Truck Lines v. Kennedy, </em>296 Md. 528, 537, 463 A.2d 850 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">As MDE explains in its brief, it \u201cinterpreted this language to allow, but not require, it to award site rehabilitation costs for remedial activities not falling within the remedial categories listed in section .05A.\u201d It further asserts that if \u00a7 .05B \u201cwere used to pay site rehabilitation costs in amounts exceeding the limits imposed by section .05A, it would render section .05A a nullity.\u201d We agree, and find this reasoning not only very persuasive, but succinctly on point and dispositive in this case. <em>See Wright, </em>348 Md. at 216, 703 A.2d 150 (\u201cOf course, we seek to avoid an interpretation which would lead to an untenable or illogical outcome.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">We find that the court properly granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
