Appellant Linda McCoy, individually and as personal representative of the estate of William McCoy, filed a complaint on January 10, 1999, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against two Baltimore City employees, paramedic Billie R. Hatmaker and police officer Brian Schwaab; the Baltimore City Police Department;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Hatmaker and Officer Schwaab filed separate motions for summary judgment, and the. court heard these motions and McCoy\u2019s opposition to them on January 14, 2000. The City filed a line adopting Hatmaker\u2019s pleadings on the same day, although its separate summary judgment motion was not before the court at that time. The court granted Hatmaker\u2019s and Schwaab\u2019s motions at the hearing, and it later granted Baltimore City\u2019s motion for summary judgment on February 10, 2000. This appeal followed, and McCoy now asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>1. Did the court below err in considering and granting appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the basis that appellant failed to make a prima facie showing of gross negligence on the part of appellees Hatmaker and Schwaab, even assuming the truth of all allegations against them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">2. Did the court below abuse its discretion by striking an affidavit of appellant\u2019s expert witness contradicting that witness\u2019s deposition testimony, because it included testimony that amounted to a legal conclusion and because appellant submitted it beyond the discovery deadline?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">3. Did the court below abuse its discretion when it quashed the subpoena for the deposition of a supervising Lieutenant who investigated the incident and entered a protective order barring, as privileged, discovery of his report?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">To these questions, we answer \u201cno\u201d and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">On the evening of January 24, 1996, William McCoy, age 62, was driving himself and a co-worker, Bernard Lowe, to their place of employment. McCoy typically picked up Lowe at about 10:00 p.m. so that the two would arrive in time for their 11:00 p.m. shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">McCoy, heading north on Hanover Street in Baltimore City, stopped for a red light. As the two men conversed, Lowe recalls, the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-11\">I said something to Bill, and Bill never answered me. I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t see that Bill?\u201d I turned around and looked, and I thought Bill dropped his cigarette between his legs because his head was down and his hand was in his lap, and I thought he dropped his cigarette. I\u2019m like, \u201cHey Bill,\u201d and there was no response, no nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-12\">The next I know we\u2019re going off into the parked cars. I reached over and grabbed the steering wheel. I\u2019m still yelling at him and I grabbed the steering wheel and got it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>straight back out on the street to keep us from hitting the parked cars. That\u2019s how it happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Lowe then engaged the emergency brake. When the car had come to a stop, Lowe explains, McCoy was still in the driver\u2019s seat, non-responsive to Lowe\u2019s efforts to rouse him and making what Lowe described as gargling noises. Lowe left the car and flagged down a passing police car, driven by Officer Irvin Bradley.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">He asked me what was going on. I told him something is wrong with my buddy. I said, \u201cAll he\u2019s doing is gargling. I thought he dropped his cigarette.\u201d He heard me yelling, \u201cBill, Bill,\u201d and he walked over, put his hand in the throat area by his ear and stuff I guess to check for a pulse, and he \u2022 said something.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Officer Bradley told Lowe that McCoy had a \u201csmall pulse,\u201d then called for assistance on his shoulder radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">After Officer Bradley called for assistance, Officer Brian Schwaab arrived at the scene. Officer Schwaab is a trained emergency medical services provider who is qualified both as a first responder and an emergency medical technician (\u201cEMT\u201d). At the time, he had been about eight blocks away, patrolling the lower area of the southern district. Responding to Officer Bradley\u2019s call for assistance, he estimated that he arrived at the scene within \u201ca minute\u201d of hearing the call. He brought with him a personal resuscitation mask.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Officer Schwaab immediately asked Officer Bradley what had occurred. He also went over to McCoy, ensured that his airway was open, and checked for a pulse. He did not feel one. Before he could start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (\u201cCPR\u201d), however, Officer Schwaab noticed an ambulance, Medic 5, rounding the corner to turn southbound on Hanover Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Although appellant now seeks to infer otherwise, the undisputed evidence, including City records and staff testimony, shows that Medic 5 reached the scene only on its second attempt. Medic 5 was initially dispatched at 10:21 p.m. Because of confusion relating to the exact location of McCoy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>vehicle, the ambulance initially went to the wrong address. The same rig was then dispatched a second time-in fact, Paramedic Hatmaker, who was with the ambulance, even recorded a new call on the run sheet\u2014at 10:25 p.m., and it reached the scene at about 10:30 p.m. Officer Schwaab greeted the ambulance crew with the news that McCoy was in full cardiac arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Paramedic Hatmaker ran to McCoy\u2019s car and assessed his condition. He noted that McCoy, who was slumped over the steering wheel, showed no visible signs of life. He felt no pulse in McCoy\u2019s carotid artery. Placing his stethoscope under McCoy\u2019s sweatshirt, Hatmaker listened for a heartbeat and heard none.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Heart sounds, in fact, were entirely absent. Hatmaker next examined McCoy\u2019s eyes by opening his eyelids and examining his pupils with a penlight. He observed McCoy\u2019s pupils to be fixed and dilated and his sclera dry. He then checked McCoy\u2019s body for signs of trauma, including blood, and found none. Finally, Hatmaker observed that McCoy had already released body fluids and his body temperature had already dropped markedly. He thus concluded that McCoy was dead and was not a viable candidate for resuscitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Because he considered his job there over, Hatmaker proceeded to complete a Maryland Ambulance Information Sheet regarding the call, then conferred with police, who would summon the Medical Examiner to remove McCoy\u2019s body from the car and transport it to the morgue.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">In her complaint, appellant alleged that Hatmaker breached his duty of care to McCoy by \u201cfailing to render appropriate resuscitation and emergency medical treatment\u201d and \u201cviolating the Maryland State Protocols for Cardiac Rescue Techni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>cian and Emergency Medical Technician/Paramedic Guidelines for deceased cases\u201d (hereinafter the \u201cMaryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems protocols\u201d or the \u201cMIEMSS protocols\u201d). Appellant asserted that, by committing such a breach, Hatmaker was grossly negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">All of appellant\u2019s experts- were deposed during discovery, including her emergency medical services expert Gerald M. Dworkin, who testified at a deposition on October 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Additionally, on October 15, 1999, appellant noted the deposition of Lieutenant William J. Shelley of the Baltimore City Fire Department. Lt. Shelley had investigated the incident on behalf of the Fire Department\u2019s Medical Bureau and had concluded, in his report to the Fire Department chain of command, that Hatmaker had violated some MIEMSS protocols when he treated McCoy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The report was placed in Hatmaker\u2019s personnel file. On November 9, the Baltimore City Police Department moved to quash appellant\u2019s subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>and prevent discovery of the report, on grounds that such information was confidential and thus not subject to discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Appellant opposed appellees\u2019 motion. On December 15, the court granted that motion, quashed the subpoena for Lt. Shelley\u2019s deposition, and entered an order precluding formal discovery of any findings or records of the Fire Department\u2019s review of Hatmaker\u2019s performance in the McCoy incident. For reasons that are not clear, we note that appellant already possessed a copy of the report in question. The court\u2019s order, however, effectively precluded her from using the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">On December 2, Hatmaker and Officer Schwaab moved for summary judgment, and the City adopted Hatmaker\u2019s pleading by line. Appellees argued that, because neither had committed any willful act nor any grossly negligent act or omission under the standard set forth in <em>Tatum v. Gigliotti, </em>80 Md.App. 559, 565 A.2d 354 (1989), <em>aff'd, </em>321 Md. 623, 583 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>1062 (1991), they were immune from suit under both the Good Samaritan Act, Md.Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-603 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the Fire and Rescue Company Act, Md.Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-604 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Appellant opposed the motion, submitting with her opposition an affidavit from Dworkin, in which he opined,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>to a reasonable degree of certainty in the field of emergency medical services, the acts and/or omissions of Defendant Hatmaker and Defendant Schwaab constituted not only a breach in the standard of care by falling well below the recognized standards, but that these acts and/or omissions also constituted a reckless disregard for the life of William McCoy and resulted in his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment after a hearing on January 14, 2000. At that hearing, Hat-maker moved to strike Dworkin\u2019s affidavit on grounds that i) the affidavit could not act to defeat summary judgment under <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>127 Md.App. 255, 732 A.2d 912 (1999), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>359 Md. 513, 754 A.2d 1030 (2000), and ii) Dworkin\u2019s affidavit was inadmissible because it stated a conclusion of law. The Court granted this oral motion and also granted Hatmaker\u2019s and Officer Schwaab\u2019s summary judgment motions at the hearing. On February 10, the court additionally granted Baltimore City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">We review grants of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>under a simple standard: whether the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions were correct. <em>See Matthews v. Howell, </em>359 Md. 152, 161-62, 753 A.2d 69 (2000); <em>Green v. H. &amp; R. Block, Inc., </em>355 Md. 488, 502, 735 A.2d 1039 (1999); <em>Calomiris v. Woods, </em>353 Md. 425, 434, 727 A.2d 358 (1999); <em>Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp. of Baltimore, Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 204, 680 A.2d 1067 (1996). Here, the grant of summary judgment rests in part on the court\u2019s exclusion of expert witness Dworkin\u2019s eleventh-hour affidavit, which concludes that appellees had been grossly negligent. Without that affidavit, appellant cannot aver any genuine issue of material fact\u2014any factual controversy that would somehow affect the outcome of this case, <em>see Goodwich, </em>343 Md. at 206, 680 A.2d 1067 (citing <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985))\u2014that shows Hatmaker and Officer Schwaab committed any willful or grossly negligent act. Appellant otherwise concedes that the immunity provisions of sections 5-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>603 and -604 apply. Although the Court of Appeals, when it reversed <em>Pittman, </em>dealt a blow to the trial court\u2019s reasoning relying on that case, we hold that the* blow was not fatal, for the court\u2019s secondary justification gave it sufficient rationale for striking the affidavit. Likewise, we hold that the trial court committed no abuse of discretion when it quashed appellant\u2019s subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>for the deposition testimony of Lt. Shelley and the report he prepared. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees because Maryland law affords them immunity from civil damages in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Finding that appellant presented no evidence of such abuses, the trial court properly ended this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Under Maryland law, two separate statutes immunize fire, rescue, and law enforcement personnel from civil damages for errors and omissions made while acting in the scope of their duties. The Good Samaritan Act grants a broad class of rescuers, which would include both Hatmaker and Schwaab (because he is a trained EMT), and medical providers civil immunity \u201cfor any act or omission in giving any assistance or medical care,\u201d in the absence of gross negligence, where they provide care without fee or compensation i) at the scene of an emergency, ii) during transit to a medical facility, or iii) through communication with personnel providing such assistance. \u00a7 5-603. The Fire and Rescue Company Act further ensures that members of fire and rescue companies, like Hatmaker, \u201care immune from civil liability for any act or omission in the course of performing their duties,\u201d except for those acts that are willful or grossly negligent. \u00a7 5-604(a). Appellant concedes, in fact, that the proper standard for determining appellees\u2019 liability is one of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\"><em>Tatum v. Gigliotti </em>fleshes out Maryland\u2019s gross negligence standard in the context of services provided by emer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>gency medical technicians such as Hatmaker operating within their assigned duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">\u201cGross negligence has been equated with \u2018wilful and wanton misconduct,\u2019 a \u2018wanton or reckless disregard for human life or for the rights of others.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-8\"><em>Tatum, </em>80 Md.App. at 568, 565 A.2d 354 (quoting <em>Foor v. Juvenile Serv., </em>78 Md.App. 151, 170, 552 A.2d 947 (1989)). One is grossly negligent or acts wantonly and willfully \u201c \u2018only when he inflicts injury intentionally or is so utterly indifferent to the rights of others that he acts as if such rights did not exist.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tatum, </em>80 Md.App. at 568, 565 A.2d 354 (quoting <em>Romanesk v. Rose, </em>248 Md. 420, 423, 237 A.2d 12 (1968)). Stated differently, only extraordinary or outrageous conduct can be termed gross negligence-mere \u201creckless[ness] is not enough; there must be reckless disregard for human life.\u201d <em>Khawaja v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>89 Md.App. 314, 319, 598 A.2d 489 (1991) (citing <em>Nast v. Lockett, </em>312 Md. 343, 352, 539 A.2d 1113 (1988)), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>326 Md. 501, 606 A.2d 224 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">In <em>Tatum, </em>an asthma sufferer in the midst of a severe attack called the Prince George\u2019s County Fire Department and requested emergency aid. Paramedics, including defendant Gigliotti, arrived and sought to have plaintiffs decedent employ an emergency treatment commonly used for hyperventilation (but not for asthma). When he resisted this effort, they administered oxygen and then escorted him to the ambulance, requiring him to walk. En route to the hospital, plaintiffs decedent further resisted the paramedics\u2019 efforts to administer oxygen and refused to lie on the stretcher. When the ambulance rounded a sharp turn at the entrance of the hospital, the decedent fell to its floor. At the emergency room door, paramedics placed the decedent on a gurney and turned him over to hospital personnel. <em>Tatum, </em>80 Md.App. at 562-63, 565 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">In the ambulance report, paramedics stated that the decedent \u201cwas conscious, stable, pupils normal, and pupils were equal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, emergency room personnel testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>the decedent was \u201cin complete respiratory and cardiac arrest\u201d when admitted. <em>Id. </em>A physician performing the post-mortem examination testified that plaintiffs decedent died from cerebral edema, secondary to anoxia from status asthmaticus with respiratory arrest. <em>Id. </em>When asked whether the administration of oxygen in the ambulance would have saved decedent\u2019s life, the physician testified in the affirmative. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Despite such highly egregious facts showing misdiagnosis of the patient, treatment bordering upon cruelty, and falsification of official records, we nevertheless upheld the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Gigliotti:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">Even though the lower court, in ruling on the question of sufficiency of the evidence, is required to take the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we hold that the trial judge acted properly in granting the appellee\u2019s motion for judgment. The evidence in this case indicated that although the actions of Gigliotti may have amounted to negligence, they do not satisfy the threshold of gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 569, 565 A.2d 354. We went on to explain how the plaintiffs own expert, although he initially condemned the actions of the paramedics as \u201creckless,\u201d backed away from this description during cross-examination, stating, \u201cI believe it is an improper action that could have aggravated the condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After being instructed by the court on the correct standard for gross negligence, the expert refused to testify that Gigliotti\u2019s actions constituted reckless disregard for the decedent\u2019s life. <em>Id. </em>We thus held that, as a matter of law, Gigliotti was insulated from liability by the Good Samaritan Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Here, appellant asserts that Hatmaker \u201cbreached [his duty] of care by [failing] to render appropriate resuscitation and emergency medical treatment; by [abandoning] treatment of Mr. McCoy without the direction of a medical doctor; and by [failing] to appropriately examine [sic ] the plaintiff to determine his status and survivability prior to abandoning his efforts.\u201d She then posits that each of these alleged breaches constitutes gross negligence and argues that, in concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>otherwise, the court below engaged in improper fact-finding. <em>See, e.g., DiGrazia v. County Executive, </em>288 Md. 437, 445, 418 A.2d 1191 (1980) (purpose of summary judgment is not to settle factual disputes but rather to determine existence of a genuine issue of material fact that would provide the basis for trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">From our perspective, however, the court below did nothing more than apply the legal standard in <em>Tatum </em>to the undisputed facts and, even resolving all inferences in appellant\u2019s favor, found that her insubstantial allegations failed to withstand the most basic level of scrutiny provided by the summary procedure. No party disputes that when Hatmaker arrived on the scene he ran from the ambulance to McCoy\u2019s vehicle and began to assess his condition with the intention of saving his life. Using his stethoscope on McCoy\u2019s chest, he tried to establish a heartbeat. He likewise checked McCoy\u2019s carotid artery for a pulse. He assessed McCoy\u2019s eyes and found his pupils to be fixed and dilated and the schlera dry. He examined McCoy\u2019s body for signs of bleeding or other trauma and found none. He noted that McCoy had released his bowels and bladder. All of the above are, we note, medical signs that death has occurred, and only after noting all of such symptoms did Hatmaker conclude that McCoy was beyond resuscitation and treat the patient like a corpse. Far from exhibiting deliberate indifference to McCoy\u2019s welfare, the undisputed facts show that Hatmaker demonstrated genuine concern and urgency that was appropriate to the situation, and, at worst, he made an error in medical judgment. If the facts in <em>Tatum </em>supported a finding that careless, inconsiderate and deceitful ambulance crewmen were not grossly negligent, the court could not have reasonably found that the undisputed facts <em>sub judice, </em>as averred by the parties, would support an inference that Hatmaker had responded to McCoy\u2019s illness with grossly deficient care.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Just as appellant failed to present facts from which the court could infer that Hatmaker sought to injure McCoy or acted with willful indifference to his well-being, she cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>point to facts in the record that show the court engaged in improper fact-finding. Indeed, we find it clear that all the court did was to apply the <em>Tatum </em>standard to the facts <em>sub judice. </em>In doing so, it weighed appellant\u2019s preferred inference and concluded that inference was untenable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: [L]et me first address Defendant Hatmaker and we agree that the standard is gross negligence. In the standard of gross negligence as cited in Tattum <em>[sic </em>] and I believe, Your Honor, that I do sight [sic] cases other than Tattum [sic] throughout my brief, but you can be the judge of that, pun intended\u2014but in Tattum [sic] it says the standard of gross negligence is a reckless disregard for human life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">THE COURT: A wanton or reck\u2014okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right. And willful or wanton reckless disregard for [human] life and wanton, I believe, Your Honor, means that you demonstrate a deliberate indifference or act as if this person does not have the right to live, his rights or her rights do not exist. Your Honor, this case is so much more egregious than Tattum [sic ] that I will do as they did and go briefly through Tattum [sic ]. In Tattum [sic], the paramedic arrives, attempts to do something, here paramedic Hatmaker did nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">THE COURT: Well, no that\u2019s not\u2014that\u2019s\u2014no he didn\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t think you can say that. You can say that he didn\u2019t do what your expert says he should have done but he did do something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I will go beyond that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">THE COURT: Well, show me where it says he did nothing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asb\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Sure. He didn\u2019t do just what my expert says, he didn\u2019t do anything that the [MIEMSS] standard set forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">THE COURT: Okay. He didn\u2019t do those things. When you say he did nothing, that means he didn\u2019t go to the patient, he didn\u2019t, I mean there are things that he did. You say that they\u2019re not sufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">THE COURT: But, you can\u2019t say that he didn\u2019t do nothing <em>[sic </em>].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I take that back then, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-9\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Appellant countered and still contends that Hatmaker\u2019s failure to observe the MIEMSS and other treatment protocols equaled no action at all and gross negligence on its face. The MIEMSS protocols state that \u201c[t]he goal of pre-hospital emergency medical services is to deliver a viable patient to appropriate definitive care as soon as possible.\u201d Appellant points out that the protocols set forth several criteria for emergency personnel to use in determining whether resuscitation is appropriate, including asking other persons at the scene about the patient\u2019s symptoms and condition; determining by use of a monitoring device that heart rhythms are incompatible with life; checking for the absence of electrical pulse activity; and, in the absence of obvious signs of death,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> beginning basic and advanced life support procedures, including CPR, to continue until the patient reaches a hospital or a physician directs termination of treatment. Instead, after fully examining McCoy, Hatmaker pronounced him dead and proceeded to document the case as though the patient were dead-on-arrival. Deposition testimony shows that Hatmaker believed he had authority to do just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The court below found that, by <em>Tatum\u2019s </em>standard, it could not construe Hatmaker\u2019s failure to follow MIEMSS protocols as reckless disregard for McCoy\u2019s life. Instead, the court characterized his actions as a well-intended but wrong judgment call.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: In my\u2014in my brief, I said he did something. He ran to the person and all he did was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>a visual assessment of Mr. McCoy. That visual assessment isn\u2019t enough as set forth in their own protocol, in the [MIEMSS] protocols that he acknowledges. These protocols require certain steps that he has to do. Nowhere in these protocols does it say, Your Honor, that you can show up, look at someone, pronounce them dead, and call the medical examiner. The protocols set forth what he has to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">THE COURT: Well, don\u2019t you think in Tattum <em>[sic </em>] the protocols set forth that you don\u2019t put somebody on a gurney in the back of the ambulance and don\u2019t strap them down when you get ready to drive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t know, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">THE COURT: Well, I can tell you what, I bet dollars to donuts they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">THE COURT: Are you saying there is ever a chance where he doesn\u2019t apply the standards? In other words, all the time failure to follow the standards is gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, no, not at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">THE COURT: When is it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Not at all. If he\u2014let\u2019s say for example that Hatmaker would have\u2014he never even took him out of the car\u2014let\u2019s say he gets there, does the examination, gets the medical consult immediately. Doctor, we\u2019ve got somebody coming in. On the way there to the hospital with the medical consult trying to save the man\u2019s life. He doesn\u2019t intubate, he doesn\u2019t hook up a defibrillator, he doesn\u2019t bag the patient. Gets to the hospital, hands it off to the doctor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">THE COURT: What\u2019s different about that then <em>[sic </em>] what happened here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Because here he didn\u2019t do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>THE COURT: Well, you keep saying that he didn\u2019t do anything. He didn\u2019t do what you thought, but he did something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: He did a quick visual assessment and called the medical examiner. The standards don\u2019t allow for him ever to do that unless he\u2019s obviously dead.... Because not following the standards is gross negligence....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">THE COURT [Reading from <em>Tatum]: </em>\u201cGross negligence has been equated with willful and wanton misconduct. A wanton and reckless disregard for human life or for the lives of other [sic ]. Those aren\u2019t to say that a wrong doer is guilty of gross negligence or acts wantonly and willfully, only when he inflicts injury intentionally or is so utterly indifferent to the rights of others that he acts as if such rights did not exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">And frankly, I can not see any set of circumstances under which a fact finder could find in this case that the two Defendants meet, met that standard. The Plaintiffs, Plaintiff I should say, has stated several times that the Defendant Hatmaker did nothing. Perhaps I don\u2019t know, if that were true that might be gross negligence. Perhaps had he arrived on the scene and been told and instead of running to the car said, do you have a cigarette to someone and lit a cigarette and began to smoke a cigarette. I think under those circumstances that would well be something that would show utterly [sic ] indifference to the rights of others, just total indiff\u00e9rence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">But, here the evidence it [sic] to the contrary. All the evidence is that he ran to the car and that was something. The evidence is also that he took a stethoscope and tried to see if he heard a heartbeat, that is something. That he tried to get a pulse, that is something. That he looked to see if his eyes were dilated, that was something and that he saw that he expelled, his bowels on himself, that was something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">The Plaintiffs position is that is [sic ] was not enough and for purposes of this emotion [sic ] I will assume that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>not enough, but it was something and it did not amount to utter indifference to the rights of others. It did not\u2014what it was, was a judgment by Defendant Hatmaker that this man was dead. <em>It was a judgment that was wrong but, it was a judgment that was made. It was not an action based on utter indifference and just simply saying\u2014not saying but behaving in such a way is indifference as to whether or not Mr. McCoy lived or </em>died....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">If this is gross negligence then there\u2019s never a time when a medic and a police officer who doesn\u2019t fail to do everything they are suppose [sic ] to do and someone\u2014death results or it\u2019s not gross negligence. I mean there were judgments being made. The judgments may have been wrong, but they were not indifference <em>[sic </em>] judgments they were actual judgments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We agree with the court\u2019s reasoning and believe it to be consistent with the standard we expressed in <em>Tatum. </em>Were we Baltimore City officials responsible for Hatmaker\u2019s job performance, we might recommend retraining in the protocols of emergency care, or even disciplinary action. As judges, however, we cannot equate a well\u2014intended error in medical judgment\u2014even if it costs the patient\u2019s life\u2014with wanton and reckless disregard for the life of that patient. Medical protocols seek to establish best practices for successfully treating certain conditions. Failure to follow such protocols might sometimes be deliberate, but more often than not, we believe, such failure to heed them during an emergency would be purely accidental and, therefore, at most simple negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even resolving all inferences in appellant\u2019s favor, the undisputed facts here simply do not show that Hatmaker\u2019s failure falls into the former category. Appellant cannot point to <em>any </em>facts that show he made a <em>deliberate </em>choice not to give McCoy a chance to survive, and, at the end of the day, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>deliberateness that lies at the core of the <em>Tatum </em>standard of willfulness and wantonness.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">We note, furthermore, that neither of appellant\u2019s experts would testify at deposition that Hatmaker\u2019s conduct was grossly negligent. Dr. John J. Shane, appellant\u2019s medical expert, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">Q: There is no evidence, as I understand, from the materials that you have reviewed or from your testimony so far that Mr. Hatmaker knew Mr. McCoy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">Q: There is no indication, is there, that Mr. Hatmaker arrived at the scene and decided that he was willfully going to harm this gentleman, was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-9\">Q: There is no indication in the record &amp;r in any material you have reviewed or from any testimony you have reviewed that there was any grossly willful and wanton disregard for the person we know as Mr. McCoy as an individual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-10\">A: No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-11\">Q: <em>Where in your report do you use the term grossly negligent or gross negligence ?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-12\">A: <em>I do not use it in the report. </em>I think in my report, we went through it in detail, I think what I say is careless, callous and inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-13\">Q: Well, when was the first time you heard the term grossly negligent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-14\">A: Today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-15\">Q: In this deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-16\">A: , Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-17\">Q: So prior to Mr. Winkelman putting that question to you in this deposition, you had never heard that term used before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-18\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Q: What do you understand as to the meaning of that term under Maryland law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion. You can answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">A: I am not a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">Q: Does that mean you have no understanding of what it means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">A: I have no understanding. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Even Dworkin, appellant\u2019s emergency services expert, whose affidavit affirmed gross negligence, testified that Hat-maker had simply erred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-11\">Q: Is it your opinion in this case that Paramedic Hatmaker simply <em>made an error or a mistake </em>in failing to initiate lifesaving measures in\u2014in pronouncing Mr. McCoy dead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">A: <em>That\u2019s my opinion, yes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-13\">Such equivocal testimony draws the case <em>sub judiee </em>even more tightly into the realm of <em>Tatum. See Tatum, </em>80 Md.App. at 568-69, 565 A.2d 354 (upholding dismissal of claims against county under Good Samaritan Act because plaintiffs own expert failed to testify that any of EMTs actions constituted reckless disregard for human life).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">Finally, appellant implies that discrepancies regarding the timing of Hatmaker\u2019s arrival on the scene create a triable issue of fact. Seeking to shorten the time between McCoy\u2019s cardiac arrest and Hatmaker\u2019s arrival, she crafts her rendition of the facts to omit any mention of the original ambulance call, during which Medic 5 went to the wrong location. Both Officer Schwaab and Hatmaker testified at deposition that the ambulance had been misdirected, and we thus find appellant\u2019s representation of the timing of events to be disingenuous at best. When all the facts are presented, appellant can do nothing more than baldly allege that Hatmaker acted with reckless and wanton disregard for McCoy\u2019s life. Such allegations would not defeat appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, for neither bald assertions nor the existence of some alleged factual dispute will defeat a properly supported motion like the one <em>siob judiee. See Barber v. Eastern Karting Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>108 Md.App. 659, 672, 673 A.2d 744 (1996); <em>Seaboard Sur. Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 243, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Appellant also asserts that the trial court erred in granting Officer Schwaab\u2019s motion for summary judgment. As a member of the Baltimore City Police Department, Officer Schwaab has been trained as a first responder, subject to first responder protocols set forth in J. David Bergeron &amp; Gloria Bizjak, <em>Brady First Responder </em>(5th ed.). According to <em>Brady, </em>first responders who are on duty must assist any patients they find according to their departments\u2019 standard operating procedures. In Baltimore, police officers who arrive on the scene of a distressed patient before more specialized medical personnel arrive must start CPR. Officer Schwaab is also certified as an EMT and subject, like Hatmaker, to MIEMSS protocols.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">In his deposition testimony, Officer Schwaab acknowledged his duty to begin CPR when he reached the scene, and indeed he brought with him a personal resuscitation mask for that purpose. Yet, as he explained, the arrival of Fire Department personnel coincided with his own arrival and he left the job for others to do:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">Q: I believe you said once you got there it was almost immediate that you saw the Fire Department and the paramedics?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">Q: If they hadn\u2019t been there immediately and Mr. McCoy presented the way you said,<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> what would you have done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You can answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">A: I would have asked Officer Bradley to help me. I would have got him out of the car and used my mask, and we would have did CPR on him until the fire department arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">Q: Why would you have done that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">A: Well because that\u2019s the kind of person I am and them not being on the scene yet, not knowing where they were coming from, I would have initiated CPR until they got there like I\u2019ve done in the past.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">From this colloquy, appellant flatly concludes that Officer Schwaab\u2019s failure to begin CPR posthaste constituted reckless disregard for life and thus gross negligence. His negligent act, she argues, overcomes any immunity Officer Schwaab might have. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">As a trained EMT, Officer Schwaab enjoys the immunity provisions of the Good Samaritan Act and the analysis for Hatmaker <em>supra </em>applies here as well. To be sure, under the standard for simple negligence, appellant might have reasonably second-guessed Officer Schwaab\u2019s medical judgment. Under simple negligence, she might have created an issue of material fact as to Officer Schwaab\u2019s failure immediately to pull McCoy from the automobile and begin CPR at the instant of diagnosis, rather than allow Medic 5\u2014which was already in sight\u2014to reach the scene, so that more experienced rescue personnel could take over. The court properly refused, however, to raise any questions about Officer Schwaab\u2019s judgment under the tougher standard of wanton and reckless disregard for life. If anything, one might infer from Officer Schwaab\u2019s actions an intention to procure the best medical help available at the time. Appellant thus failed to identify a genuine issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>of material fact that would have precluded summary judgment on the grounds of immunity under the Good Samaritan Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Even if appellant could have proven gross negligence, Officer Schwaab, as a law enforcement official, also qualifies for public official immunity under the rule of <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 48-49, 729 A.2d 354 (1999). Such immunity is hard to defeat. Under the rule of <em>DiPino, </em>the court must find that two factors exist simultaneously before it can relieve a governmental official of liability for his negligent acts. First, the actor whose conduct is at issue must be a public official rather than a mere government employee or agent. Second, the tortious conduct must have occurred while he was performing discretionary rather than ministerial acts in furtherance of his official duties. If the official can establish these two factors, he receives qualified immunity, that is, immunity in the absence of malice. <em>DiPino, </em>354 Md. at 48-49, 729 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\"> Under <em>DiPino, </em>Officer Schwaab qualifies for immunity in the absence of malice. Police officers are public officials who, when carrying out their official duties, receive immunity in the absence of actual malice. <em>See Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>128 Md.App. 1, 15, 736 A.2d 1084 (1999) (\u201cThe Maryland case law establishes unequivocally that police officers in the course of their public duties are public officials within the contemplation of the qualified immunity law.\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>359 Md. 101, 753 A.2d 41 (2000). Even accepting appellant\u2019s factual scenario, Officer Schwaab was clearly engaged in discretionary public duties when, acting on a radio call for assistance, he raced to the site of the medical emergency, attended briefly to McCoy, then turned the case over to more qualified personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Because he meets the first two elements of the <em>DiPino </em>test, we need only examine his actions for malice. <em>Id. </em>at 19, 729 A.2d 354 (\u201cWhen the affirmative conditions for qualified immunity are satisfied, the only qualifier limiting such immunity is the presence of malice on the part of the officer.\u201d). We have defined actual malice necessary to defeat public official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>immunity as \u201c \u2018an act without legal justification or excuse, but with an evil or rancorous motive influenced by hate, the purpose being to deliberately and willfully injure the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Leese v. Baltimore County, </em>64 Md.App. 442, 480, 497 A.2d 159 (1985) (quoting <em>Arrington v. Moore, </em>31 Md.App. 448, 464, 358 A.2d 909 (1976)); <em>see also Thacker v. Hyattsville, </em>135 Md.App. 268, 300, 762 A.2d 172, 2000 Md.App. Lexis 149, at *39-*40 (2000); <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, </em>353 Md. 143, 164, 725 A.2d 549 (1999); <em>Williams, </em>128 Md.App. at 19, 736 A.2d 1084; <em>Thomas v. City of Annapolis, </em>113 Md.App. 440, 455, 688 A.2d 448 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The facts, viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, cannot be construed to show such evil or rancorous motives. Officer Schwaab did not ignore or refuse to treat McCoy. He did not act with intent to make McCoy more ill than he already was or to cause his death. Instead, Officer Schwaab assessed McCoy\u2019s physical condition with the intent of starting resuscitation, and before he could even begin lifesaving measures, the ambulance arrived. Seeking immediate help from more experienced medical personnel, Officer Schwaab ran to the ambulance and told the crew of McCoy\u2019s condition. There is <em>no </em>evidence that Officer Schwaab acted with evil or rancorous motive influenced by hate for the purpose of deliberately and willfully injuring McCoy. We thus affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Officer Schwaab\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Appellant also questions the court\u2019s exercise of discretion when it excluded Dworkin\u2019s affidavit and relied alone upon his expert testimony as to the standard of care for ' EMTs. The affidavit said what Dworkin had been unwilling to say in deposition, namely, that \u201cthe acts and/or omissions of Defendant Hatmaker and Defendant Schwaab constituted not only a breach in the standard of care by falling well below the recognized standards but that these acts and/or omissions constituted a reckless disregard for the life of William McCoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>and resulted in his death.\u201d Appellant avers that she presented Dworkin\u2019s affidavit as \u201cthe direct result of this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Tatum v. Gigliotti\u201d </em>in which this Court held that plaintiffs expert on the standard of care had failed to testify that any of the paramedics\u2019 actions showed a reckless disregard for human life. <em>See Tatum, </em>80 Md.App. at 569, 565 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Hatmaker moved to strike this affidavit on the basis of the sham affidavit rule articulated by this Court in <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co. See Pittman, </em>127 Md.App. at 255, 732 A.2d 912 (excluding an affidavit that contradicted deposition testimony when it was submitted after the close of discovery). The court granted Hatmaker\u2019s motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">So, I am going to grant the motion to strike for two reasons. I\u2019m going to grant one because I believe it contradicts under Pittman. I\u2019m going to grant for the second reason because I am not convinced that this expert in remedy <em>[sic </em>] in that part of the opinion....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">In essence, I mean this is the appropriate question to the asking witness, was there a breach in the standard of care, not what is their opinion? <em>[Tatum] </em>doesn\u2019t say well this amounts to legal negligence, that\u2019s for the jury to decide and here the witness is going not just that it amounts to legal gross negligence and there\u2019s nothing to indicate that this witness has the knowledge, skill, experience, training or education to make that legal conclusion. For ihose, so for those reasons I\u2019m going to grant the motion to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">Now, I\u2019ll emphasize it\u2019s not just because of the close of discovery, but it\u2019s the second that questioning the competency of the witness to testify as to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Since the motions hearing took place, however, the Court of Appeals reversed our holding in <em>Pittman </em>regarding the sham affidavit rule. <em>See Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>359 Md. 513, 536-39, 754 A.2d 1030 (2000). Citing that Court\u2019s new ruling, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s judgment here cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>By focusing exclusively on <em>Pittman, </em>however, appellant ignores the lower court\u2019s secondary reason for striking the affidavit, that Dworkin was not qualified to testify to a legal conclusion of negligence, rather than individual elements of the same, <em>i.e., </em>standard of care, breach of duty, and causation of damages. To allow Dworkin to testify that Hatmaker had acted with reckless disregard for McCoy\u2019s welfare, the court reasoned, would have permitted testimony in the form of a legal opinion and usurped the role of the jury. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Maryland Rule 5-702 gives the trial court discretion in determining whether expert testimony may be admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Such discretion is quite broad, <em>see Bentley v. Carroll, </em>355 Md. 312, 339, 734 A.2d 697 (1999) (trial court is afforded wide latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony), and applies to summary judgment proceedings as well as at trial. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs., </em>109 Md.App. 217, 286, 674 A.2d 106 (1996) (citing <em>Helinski v. Rosenberg, </em>90 Md.App. 158, 166, 600 A.2d 882, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>328 Md. 664, 616 A.2d 866 (1992)), <em>aff'd, </em>346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997). \u201cReckless disregard\u201d is a legal standard. As the trial court correctly observed, Dworkin was not an expert in the law, but instead, was hired by appellant to present testimony regarding the standard of care for EMTs. The trial court thus did not abuse its discretion when it found that Dworkin lacked the knowledge, skill, experience, and training to testify as to conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The court below also pointed out that to allow Dworkin to label Hatmaker\u2019s actions as reckless disregard would usurp the role of the jury, in contravention of recent opinions of this Court. <em>See, e.g., Burdette v. Rockville Crane Rental, Inc., </em>180 Md.App. 193, 745 A.2d 457 (2000). We agree. In <em>Burdette, </em>also a wrongful death and survival action, we upheld the trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling to strike testimony of plaintiffs accident reconstruction witnesses as to the cause of a traffic accident. Although we recognized the discretionary nature of such rulings, we pointed out that plaintiffs had in fact asked their experts to make a legal conclusion and not a factual one. \u201c[T]he jury,\u201d we wrote, \u201cwas well-equipped to assess the facts and assign legal responsibility. The trial court did not abuse its discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 745 A.2d 457; <em>see also Franceschina v. Hope, </em>267 Md. 632, 642-44, 298 A.2d 400 (1973) (on questions of law, judge must instruct jury and jury must draw conclusion; legal conclusion or legal standard is not proper subject of expert testimony). Here, the holding of <em>Burdette </em>surely applies. Were the trial court to have allowed Dworkin\u2019s conclusory affidavit, it would have abandoned its duty as expert in the law and taken from any potential jury\u2014had one been empaneled\u2014the role of sifting through the facts of Hatmaker\u2019s actions in this case and applying the law to those facts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We thus uphold the ruling of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Finally, we hold that the motion to quash and protective order were properly granted. The Fire Department\u2019s review of the actions of an EMT, and any records, statements, or files obtained or generated in connection with .the same, are not subject to discovery. The Department undertakes such reviews to ensure that its EMTs give the best care possible to persons requiring emergency assistance. In this way, the Department\u2019s internal review of Hatmaker\u2019s actions is part of its quality assurance process and is, therefore, protected from disclosure in litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Section 14-501 of the Health Occupations Article provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe proceedings, records and files of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>medical review committee are not discoverable and are not admissible in any civil action arising out of matters that are being reviewed and evaluated by the medical review committee.\u201d Md.Code (1981, 2000 RepL.Vol.), \u00a7 14-501(d)(l) of the Health Occupations Article. The statute defines a medical review committee by listing the categories of committees that generate protected records, including \u201ccommittee[s] appointed by or established in the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems.\u201d \u00a7 14-501(b)(4). The statute further defines the term \u201cmedical review committee\u201d by articulating the functions that a covered committee would perform. A medical review committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">(1) Evaluates and seeks to improve the quality of health care provided by providers of health care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">(2) Evaluates the need for and the level of performance of health care provided by providers of health care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">(3) Evaluates the qualifications, competence, and performance of providers of health care; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">(4) Evaluates and acts on matters that relate to the discipline of any provider of health care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">[\u00b6] \u00a7 14-501(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">Here, for the purpose of its efforts to control the quality of EMT activities, the Fire Department falls within the statutory definition of a \u201cmedical review committee.\u201d Although no evidence shows that Lt. Shelley took action at the behest of MIEMSS\u2014indeed, as appellant notes, the investigation came forth from concerns voiced by McCoy\u2019s son\u2014that agency coordinates <em>all </em>public emergency medical services in this State. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1978, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 13-503 &amp; -504 of the Education Article. The governing body of MIEMSS, the State Emergency Medical Services Board, ED \u00a7 13-503(c), oversees the licensing of EMTs and continuing quality control in the profession. <em>See, e.g., </em>ED \u00a7\u00a7 13-509, -515, -516.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">It would thus seem that any <em>ad hoc </em>quality control study or investigation performed by a public provider of emergency medical services like the Baltimore City Fire Department would fall under the aegis of MIEMSS and within the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>section 14\u2014501(b)(4). Certainly, Lt. Shelley and the Fire Department sought to \u201c[e]valuate[ ] the ... level of performance of health care provided by providers of health care,\u201d ED \u00a7 14\u2014501(c)(2); \u201c[e]valuate[ ] the ... competence ... and performance of providers of health care,\u201d \u00a7 14-501(c)(3); and \u201c[e]valuate[ ] and act[ ] on matters that relate to the discipline of any provider of health care.\u201d \u00a7 14\u2014501(c)(4). Moreover, although medical review committees are most often associated with hospitals or other traditional health care facilities, a review by the Fire Department would constitute a protected action when, as here, the fundamental <em>purpose </em>of the review was the improvement of health care services provided by Fire Department paramedics. <em>See Brem v. DeCarlo, Lyon, Hearn &amp; Pazourek, </em>162 F.R.D. 94 (D.Md.1995). The <em>origin </em>of the complaint that led to the review-\u2014with the McCoy family\u2014 does not change its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Given its purpose and sponsorship, the confidentiality provision of section 14-501 applies in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The provision \u201cwas intended to provide \u2018broad statutory protection\u2019 and is based on \u2018legislative appreciation that a high level of confidentiality is necessary for effective medical peer review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98 (citing <em>Baltimore Sun Co. v. University of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., </em>321 Md. 659, 668, 584 A.2d 683 (1991)). With few exceptions enumerated in the statute, materials protected by section 14-501 are confidential and not discoverable, and, even when they end up in the hands of the other party to litigation, as they did here, they are inadmissible in court. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting an appropriate order, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Neither expert, we also note, was willing to aver that had Hatmaker followed recommended protocols McCoy would have survived. Dworkin, in fact, hedged when asked about the amount of time that would have elapsed between cardiac arrest and the point at which McCoy could no longer be a viable patient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">Q: Do you have an opinion that you hold to a reasonable degree of pre-hospital emergency medical services certainty as to at what period of elapsed time Mr. McCoy would no longer have been a viable patient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">[APPELLANT'S COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">A: I can\u2019t answer that.

Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-19\">Q: Now, you said there are hundreds of such patients. My question is how do you know there are hundreds of such patients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-20\">A: Because I know that is our global experience, and I know that is the global experience regionally and nationally; but, again, I don\u2019t think there is a statistical network to access.

Cases from other states are also instructive. See especially <em>Norris v. Zambito, </em>135 N.C.App. 288, 520 S.E.2d 113 (1999), which holds that the trial court properly struck expert opinion that police officers had been \"grossly negligent'' and shown \u201creckless disregard\" for the safety of others in pursuing high speed chase. <em>Norris </em>rejects the argument that N.C. Rule 5--704, which is identical to Md. Rule 5-704 (\"testimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable merely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact\"), allows such testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">As a general rule, an expert may not testify as to whether a certain legal standard has been met....

(citation omitted) It is for the court to explain to the jury the given legal standard or conclusion at issue and how it should be determined. To permit the expert to make that determination usurps the function of the judge. The second reason is that an expert is in no better position to conclude whether a legal standard has been satisfied or a legal conclusion should be drawn than is a jury which has been properly instructed on the standard or conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>HAJMM Co. v. House of Raeford Farms, Inc., </em>328 N.C. 578, 587, 403 S.E.2d 483 (1991)). A Michigan case, <em>Koenig v.

In this case, a government employee claimed immunity from tort liability under a statute with a gross negligence standard much like the Good Samaritan Act. The statute defined gross negligence as conduct \"so reckless as to demonstrate a substantial lack of concern for whether an injury results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515. Plaintiff's expert opined that the defendant has acted \"so recklessly as to demonstrate a substantial lack of concern for whether an injury resulted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516. The trial court struck that testimony, noting that to allow it \"could have unduly invaded the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515.
