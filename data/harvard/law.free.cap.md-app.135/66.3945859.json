BISHOP, Judge, Retired, specially assigned.</author>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">Appellant Jay Timothy Lurz was convicted by a Baltimore County jury of first degree assault, first degree burglary, stalking, and resisting arrest. He presents five questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-15\">1. Was the Appellant improperly charged by criminal information in the circuit court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-16\">2. Did the trial judge err in determining that the Appellant had waived his right to be represented by counsel under Rule 4-215(e)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-17\">3. Did the trial judge make a proper determination of the Appellant\u2019s competency to be tried or to waive represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tation by counsel, after being informed by the prosecutor of the Appellant\u2019s mental health history?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">4. Did the trial judge err in denying the motion to suppress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">5. Did the trial judge improperly deny Appellant\u2019s challenge for cause during jury selection?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We shall recount only those facts necessary to resolve the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Appellant contends that he was improperly charged by a criminal information in the circuit court because the charging document was not filed in accordance with the requirements of Rule 4\u2014201(c)(2) and, therefore, that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Article 27, \u00a7 592 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">\u00a7 592. Charge by criminal information; right to preliminary hearing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-12\">(a) <em>Charge by criminal </em>information.\u2014In all cases involving a felony, other than a felony within the jurisdiction of the District Court, in which the accused has not requested a preliminary hearing within ten days after being informed by the court or court commissioner of the availability of such a hearing, or in all cases in which a preliminary hearing has been held and probable cause to hold the accused has been found, the State\u2019s Attorney may charge by information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-13\">(b) <em>Right to preliminary </em>hearing.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-14\">(1) In any case where the defendant has been charged with a felony, other than a felony within the jurisdiction of the District Court, the defendant shall be advised by the court or court commissioner, at the time of the initial appearance required by Maryland Rule 4-213 of his right to request a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>hearing. The defendant may make that request at the time of the initial appearance or at any time within ten days thereafter. If the defendant fails to request a preliminary hearing within the ten-day period, it is waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The Court of Appeals has implemented the statute by adopting Md. Rules 4-201 and 4-221, which provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Rule 4-201. Charging document\u2014Use.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">(a) Requirement.\u2014An offense shall be tried only on a charging document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">(c) <em>In the circuit </em>court.\u2014In the circuit court, an offense may be tried</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">(2) on an information if the offense is ...

Preliminary hearing in District Court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">(a) <em>Request and </em>waiver.\u2014A defendant charged with a felony that is not within the jurisdiction of the District Court may request a preliminary hearing at or within ten days after an initial appearance pursuant to Rule 4-213(a). The preliminary hearing shall be held in the District Court. Failure to make a timely request is a waiver of a preliminary hearing, unless the court orders otherwise. Within three days after a defendant waives a preliminary hearing expressly or by not making a timely request, the clerk shall forward to the State\u2019s Attorney a written notice of the waiver or a copy of the docket entries showing the waiver. Within ten days after a defendant waives a prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>nary hearing, the State may request a preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">(f) <em>Action required by State\u2019s </em>Attorney.\u2014Within 30 days after a finding by the court of probable cause or within 30 days after the defendant waives a preliminary hearing, the State\u2019s Attorney shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">(1) File a charging document in circuit court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">(2) Amend the pending charging document or file a new charging document charging the defendant with an offense within the jurisdiction of the District Court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">(3) Enter a nolle prosequi or have the charge marked stet on the docket as provided in Rules 4-247 and 4-248.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">After hearing on the record in the presence of the defendant and for good cause shown, the court may extend the time within which the State\u2019s Attorney shall take such action.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">(g) <em>Dismissal for lack of </em>prosecution.-\u2014If the State\u2019s Attorney fails to comply with section (f) of this Rule, the court shall enter an order of dismissal for lack of prosecution. A dismissal pursuant to this section is without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">\n<em>Chronology</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">The following is a chronology of the pertinent events:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">9-14-98 = Appellant appeared before a District Court Commissioner pursuant to Md. Rule 4-213 and was advised</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-14\">\u201cthat he has a right to have a preliminary hearing by request made now or within ten days; that failure to make a timely request will result in waiver of such hearing.

(R. 4-9)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-19\">On March 8,1999, the circuit court conducted a suppression hearing at which Appellant moved to dismiss the charges on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>the ground that the criminal information was not filed within the time permitted by Md. Rule 4-221 (f)(1). That motion was ultimately decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">THE COURT: ... He was given his right to a preliminary hearing. He had ten days to file a request for one. He didn\u2019t file it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The State then filed a request for one,' which wasn\u2019t held, according to Mr. Lurz\u2019s statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">THE COURT: Then it was continued and then a criminal information occurred. I don\u2019t see\u2014your arguiw at is convoluted and perhaps I don\u2019t understand it but it is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Appellant appeared for trial on June 2, 1999, and he renewed his motion to dismiss: ;\u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, we had a motions hearing, I believe it was on March eighth. At that time I made a Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that the charges in this case were not properly filed. That was based on Mr. Lurz\u2019s denial of a preliminary hearing or at least a denial of his rights to have the procedure followed regarding a preliminary hearing. I would advise the Court something of which [the hearing judge] was not aware. Mr. Lurz indicates he did in fact demand a preliminary hearing, but for some reason due to some clerical error, that never made it to the file. Unfortunately, I am probably stuck with the clerical error. But for the record Mr. Lurz indicates he did in a timely fashion demand a preliminary hearing. He indicates he did that not initially, when he appeared in front of the District Court Commissioner, but about 24 hours later, when he appeared in front of a District Court Judge for a bail review, it was then that he indicates he did demand a preliminary hearing. That somehow didn\u2019t make it to the file and that wish of his was never carried out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">THE COURT: Do you have any verification of that fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">MR. LURZ: Excuse me, could I speak?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>MR. LURZ: Okay, what happened was, I told him I wasn\u2019t actually sure if I had filed(sic) through at the, what was it, bail review when I was informed about it, but while I was in the Baltimore County jail, I had sent, I had asked the Police Department, who I spoke to, to file for the preliminary hearing. And on, what was it, it was on September 28rd, I have the letter, it says a review preliminary hearing will be held, which was within the ten day period of when I requested it. So at that time I thought my request had been put in, because I had received a letter within ten days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">THE COURT: Well, do you have a letter or any other document indicating that you requested a preliminary hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I think what he\u2019s indicating is that my office wrote to him indicating there would be a preliminary hearing. I am understanding him to say that he doesn\u2019t have any documentation from the court itself, is that correct, Mr. Lurz?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes. Right here on September 23rd, and I was locked up on September 14th. This was nine days and I received this letter from the Public Defender\u2019s Office stating I was going to have a preliminary hearing. So, my understanding was that my request had been filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would hand up to the Court a copy of the letter that he has, or the letter he has handed to me. It\u2019s a letter signed by Ms. Chappell of our office. I believe it simply indicates the charging procedure, just informing him that we are going to be representing him, this is a felony case, and the usual procedures will be followed and one of those things that\u2019s mentioned is a preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">A lengthy colloquy ensued, involving the court, both counsel, and Appellant, during which Appellant quoted.sections (g) and (f) of Rule 4-221. He argued that the State\u2019s failure to file a criminal 'information within the time permitted by Rule 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>221(f) precluded his being charged in the circuit court on a charging document other than an indictment. The court denied the renewed motion, commenting, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cI am satisfied that the State requested a preliminary hearing within the ten day period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">On appeal, Appellant asserts that the \u201cnew evidence\u201d (his assertion that he requested a preliminary hearing and the letter from the Public Defender\u2019s Office) introduced during the renewal of his motion to dismiss required the court to make a finding of fact. He notes that the trial judge was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d in finding that the State made a timely request for a preliminary hearing in the District Court. He makes much ado about whether the State\u2019s request was timely, whether a preliminary healing was held at all, and whether the criminal information was filed within the time permitted by Rule 4-221(f). We think it is much ado about nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">As Judge Moylan noted in <em>Tyler v. State, </em>105 Md.App. 495, 514, 660 A.2d 986 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d </em>342 Md. 766, 679 A.2d 1127 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">If the ruling was correct for the reasons advanced by the trial judge, it will be affirmed. If it turns out to have been correct for any other reason, it will also be affirmed. We are not scrutinizing the trial court\u2019s reasoning in arriving at his decision. We are scrutinizing the naked decision itself. <em>State v. Breeden, </em>333 Md. 212, 227 n. 5, 634 A.2d 464 (1993); <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 502, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979); <em>Aubinoe v. Lewis, </em>250 Md. 645, 649, 244 A.2d 879 (1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The question before us is whether the circuit court was correct in denying the motion to dismiss. From our review of the record, we are satisfied that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">1. The appellant did not request a preliminary hearing in the District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">2. The State did not make a timely request for a preliminary hearing in the District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">3. No preliminary hearing was held in the District Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>4. The criminal information filed in the circuit court was not filed within the time permitted by Rule 4\u2014221(f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Of the four matters listed, only the first is material to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The case of <em>State v. Graziano, </em>71 Md.App. 652, 527 A.2d 52, <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 324, 534 A.2d 991 (1987), also involved criminal informations filed beyond the time permitted by Rule 4\u2014221(f). Relying on Rule 4-221 (g), the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County dismissed several criminal informations. This Court reversed. Judge Wilner explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">The Circuit Court construed section (g) as applying to the late-filed criminal information, which, in each case, is what it dismissed. The State argues that section (g) has no application in the Circuit Court or to the subsequently filed criminal information or indictment. It reads the Rule, correctly we think, as simply directing the District Court to dismiss a stale charge pending in that court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">Rule 4-221 was derived from former Md. District Rule 727; indeed, sections (e), (f), and (g) are taken nearly verbatim from sections h., i., and j. of M.D.R. 727. Notwithstanding the unfortunate and possibly confusing use of the word \u201ccourt\u201d rather than \u201cDistrict Court\u201d in section (g) of the current version of the Rule, it was, and is, a rule that applies to proceedings in the District Court and has nothing to do with the validity of an indictment or information subsequently filed in the Circuit Court. The obvious and necessary purpose of section (g) is to clear the District Court docket of a case over which that court has no further authority to act and, at the same time, to release the defendant from the charge and from any harmful consequences of it. That limited function is clear not only from the general language and context of the Rule but also from the fact that the dismissal is \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d It would be anomalous\u2014indeed absurd\u2014for the Rule to require the Circuit Court to dismiss an information or indictment because it was not filed within 30 days after the preliminary hearing but then to permit the State, five minutes after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>order of dismissal, to file a new, identical indictment or information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">71 Md.App. at 655-56, 527 A.2d 52. The same reasoning is equally applicable here. The circuit court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Appellant contends that the trial judge erred in determining that he had waived his right to be represented by counsel under Rule 4-215(e), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Rule 4-215. Waiver of counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">\u2756 * <em>Ht</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">(e) <em>Discharge of </em>counsel\u2014Waiver.\u2014If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or file does not reflect prior compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">On the first day of trial, Appellant wanted to discharge the attorney assigned to his case by the Public Defender\u2019s Office, Edward Barry. Appellant acknowledged, upon questioning by Mr. Barry, his assigned counsel, that a postponement on that basis had already been denied and that Appellant would be required to proceed without an attorney unless Mr. Barry represented him. Upon questioning by the court, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Appellant equivocated, indicating that he wanted substitute counsel and that he would like Mr. Barry to remain \u201cas an advisor.\u201d The court then proceeded to question Appellant, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">THE COURT: You understand by discharging Mr. Barry and waiving your right to counsel would require you to represent yourself at trial; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">THE COURT: Do you understand that your decision to waive counsel and represent yourself may hurt you at trial, since you do not have the special training of a lawyer? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">THE COURT: Do you understand that if you decide to represent yourself, you will be expected to comply with all relevant rules for the trial of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">THE COURT: And you will be held to the same standards and rules of procedure as if you were an attorney. Do you understand all that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-12\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">THE COURT: Do you understand that you will not be able to complain if you are convicted of any of these charges, that you made a mistake in representing yourself? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-15\">THE COURT: Do you still wish to waive or give up your right to have counsel represent you on these charges?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-16\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-17\">THE COURT: And are you making that decision knowingly, voluntarily, of your own free will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-18\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-19\">THE COURT: Is anyone forcing you into making that decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-20\">THE WITNESS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>THE COURT: All right, the Court finds that the Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. The Court will accept the Defendant\u2019s express waiver and insure that the file or docket adequately reflects this Court\u2019s action in compliance with Rule 4\u2014215(a)(1)\u2014(4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">Now, do you wish Mr. Barry to remain as what is referred to as stand-by counsel, that is, you may confer with him or receive advice from him if you have a question during the course of this trial, but he may not ask any questions and he may not participate in the trial of the case? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">THE COURT: Do you wish Mr. Barry to remain as standby counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">MR. BARRY: May I be heard on that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">THE COURT: Just a moment. All right. The Court finds that there is meritorious reason for the Defendant to discharge his counsel and the Court has informed the Defendant that this trial will proceed as scheduled with the Defendant unrepresented by counsel. And the Court has, as previously stated, informed the Defendant of his rights under Rule 4\u2014215(a) (1)\u2014(4). And the Court specifically finds that Defendant has made his waiver knowingly, voluntarily, of his own free will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">All right, Mr. Barry, I\u2019ll hear from you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">MR. BARRY: Thank you, Your Honor. Two things. One, based on the Court\u2019s comments just now, the Court indicated that there was, I don\u2019t remember the exact words, but a basis for his request. That causes me some concern. Is the Court saying that I have done something where I have been less than adequate or is the Court simply stating that Mr. Lurz has the right and elected that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">THE COURT: If I found there was no meritorious reason for the Defendant\u2019s request. Then under Rule 4-215(e), I could not permit Mr. Lurz to discharge you. I have to find, as I understand it, that there was a meritorious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>reason for the Defendant\u2019s request and permit him to discharge you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">MR. LURZ: Okay. Thank you. Your Honor, the reason\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">THE COURT: So, I am finding that in Mr. Lurz\u2019s eyes, there\u2019s meritorious reason for his request. I am not passing on the reasons he\u2019s stated that there was evidence of dishonesty of your part. I find that there is no evidence that\u2019s been presented to me to support that allegation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">He claims that you have not requested that the transcript of the motions hearing be transcribed. That has been discussed and apparently no request has been made, but, you have copies of the police reports and you have notes of what the police officer\u2019s testified to at the motions hearing. So I find that Mr. Lurz has not. been prejudiced by the failure to have the transcript itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">Mr. Lurz has complained that you have failed to subpoena certain witnesses. I would assume that in your judgment, you decided not to subpoena certain witnesses because you didn\u2019t believe it would be favorable to Mr. Lurz, is that accurate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">MR. LURZ: Yes, sir, it would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">THE COURT: And Mr. Lurz also complained that you did not obtain the 911 tapes, whereas you did obtain the 911 tapes and Mr. Lurz admits that he listened to them in the lock up this afternoon. So, although I don\u2019t find that there are meritorious reasons, Mr. Lurz believes that there are meritorious reasons and has made that request. Because of that, I will permit him to discharge you as his attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">In his brief, appellant argues that the court\u2019s belief that it had to find \u201cthat there was a meritorious reason for the Defendant\u2019s request and then permit him to discharge [counsel]\u201d shows that the court had a \u201cmisunderstanding of the procedures that the court must follow in finding a waiver of counsel.\u201d Appellant believes the court\u2019s initial misunderstanding entitles him to a new trial. We are satisfied that the court\u2019s ultimate finding that <em>\u201cI </em>don\u2019t find that there- were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>meritorious reasons,\u201d coupled with the extensive questioning we have recounted, was sufficient to show compliance with Rule 4-215(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for discharge of counsel the defendant is entitled to a postponement. If the court finds that there is no meritorious reason, the court may permit the discharge of counsel and, after advising defendant of the possible consequences, require defendant to proceed without counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Appellant contends that the court failed to make a proper determination of his competency in accordance with \u00a7 12-103(a) of the Health General Article of the Maryland Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00a7 12-103. Court determination of competency.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">(a) Hearing.\u2014If, before or during a trial, the defendant in a criminal case appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial, the court shall determine, on evidence presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">During the court\u2019s questioning regarding Appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel, he told the court that he had not been under the care of a psychiatrist or a patient in a mental institution. Prior to jury selection, the prosecutor informed the court that she possessed information indicating that the appellant had been a patient at Sheppard Pratt \u201cas recently as last summer\u201d and that he was in a facility called Gundry Glass and \u201cat some point was under medication.\u201d She wanted the court \u201cto be sure you satisfy yourself that he understands what is going on in light of that.\u201d The court then questioned Appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">THE COURT: Mr. Lurz, when I questioned you earlier, I asked you whether or not you had ever been treated for mental disease or examined or evaluated by a psychiatrist. You told me that you had not. I am now informed by [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>prosecutor] that you were in Sheppard Pratt Hospital at one time, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">THE WITNESS: No, sir. It was a drug program I was attending, out patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">THE COURT: You were in some other facility called Glass?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Gundry Glass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">THE COURT: Gundry Glass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">THE WITNESS: Not to my\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">THE COURT: Are you taking any medications at the present time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">THE WITNESS: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">THE COURT: The fact that you were in Sheppard Pratt for some drug program and perhaps had been in Gundry Glass for some type of problem, would that in any way prevent you from knowing what is going on here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">THE WITNESS: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">THE COURT: Do you fully understand the questions I previously asked you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-15\">THE COURT: And you are not taking any medications so that there\u2019s no medication or mental disease or mental problem that is affecting your ability to understand what is going on here, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-16\">THE WITNESS: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-17\">THE COURT: Once again, you want to proceed with this trial representing yourself, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-18\">THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-19\">THE COURT: You are making that decision of your own free will, voluntarily and knowingly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-20\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-21\">THE COURT: All right. You can return to your seat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-22\">Appellant contends that \u201c[t]he information provided by the prosecutor raised a genuine question as to Appellant\u2019s competence, not only his competence to waive his right to counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>but his competency to stand trial at all,\u201d thus triggering the requirement in \u00a7 12-103(a) that the court \u201cdetermine, on evidence presented on the record, whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Appellant correctly notes that the issue of incompetency may be raised by the prosecutor or by the court <em>sua sponte. Langworthy v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 116, 126, 416 A.2d 1287, <em>cert. denied, </em>288 Md. 738 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 960, 101 S.Ct. 1419, 67 L.Ed.2d 384 (1981). There was no request that Appellant\u2019s competency be determined in accordance with \u00a7 12-103. The prosecutor requested that the court consider the information she provided in order to be sure that Appellant understood \u201cwhat is going on in light of\u2019 that information. The court was not requested to make a competency determination and there was nothing in Appellant\u2019s responses to the court\u2019s questions or the information provided by the prosecutor that provided any basis for the court, <em>sue sponte, </em>to order one.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Appellant next contends that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress a shotgun seized in the course of a warrantless search of his automobile. He does not dispute the existence of probable cause, but argues that there was no exigency justifying the failure to obtain a warrant. He relies in part on <em>Dyson v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 413, 426-28, 712 A.2d 573, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 287, 718 A.2d 235 (1998), as authority for the proposition that exigency must be shown to justify a warrantless search of an automobile. That reliance, alas, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In <em>Maryland v. Dyson, </em>527 U.S. 465, 119 S.Ct. 2013, 144 L.Ed.2d 442 (1999), the United States Supreme Court, in a three-page per curiam opinion, summarily reversed our decision as a \u201cdemonstrably erroneous application of federal law.\u201d The Court reiterated that \u201cthe \u2018automobile exception\u2019 has no separate exigency requirement.\u201d The Court noted that our holding that the automobile exception to the warrant require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ment requires a separate finding of exigency in addition to a finding of probable cause \u201cis squarely contrary to\u201d the Court\u2019s prior holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The court refused Appellant\u2019s request to strike juror number 339. Appellant then used a peremptory strike to remove the juror. Appellant contends the court committed an error entitling him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">A criminal defendant is entitled to a trial by an impartial jury, but a claim that the jury was not impartial must focus on the jurors who actually served. <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 216, 670 A.2d 398 (1995). Appellant used one of his peremptory challenges to remove the juror at issue, but he makes no claim that any juror who actually served was in any way incompetent. <em>Id. </em>See also <em>Ross v. Oklahoma, </em>487 U.S. 81, 87, 108 S.Ct. 2273, 101 L.Ed.2d 80 (1988). Appellant is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
