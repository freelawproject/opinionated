Judge Beeks granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, vacating and enjoining enforcement of the challenged compensation award, upon the ground that Bradley\u2019s injury was not within the coverage of the Federal Act, but was compensable, if at all, under the provisions of the Washington State Compensation Act. [See Puget Sound Bridge &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. O\u2019Leary, 224 F.Supp. 557 (W.D.Wash.1963).] This appeal is from that summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-17\">The controlling facts, as found by the Deputy Commissioner, are not in controversy and are summarized in the District Court\u2019s opinion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-18\">\u201cBradley, a machinist employee of plaintiff, was severely injured while installing a rudder post bearing on the stern of the USNS \u2018COCH-RANE\u2019, which was lying on plaintiff\u2019s building way, Plant No. 1, Seattle, Washington, when he was struck by a piece of timber and knocked from the scaffolding on which he was working to the building way below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cThe building way on which the accident occurred is a permanent shipyard structure located entirely on land which was designed and is used exclusively for new ship construction. To facilitate the launching of completed vessels, the outermost or seaward end of the building way extends into the water on an incline. The tide ebbs and flows around this outermost portion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">\u201cAt the time of the claimant\u2019s accident, the \u2018COCHRANE\u2019 was un-launched. Indeed, it did not become waterborne nor had it undergone \u2018baptismal rites\u2019 until some two months following the accident.\u201d [224 F.Supp. at 558.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Section 3(a) of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Act provides coverage under the Federal statute \u201conly if the disability * * * results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the United States (including any dry dock) * * [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903 (a).]</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">The parties agree that the case at bar presents a single question: whether Bradley\u2019s injury is within the coverage of the Act. Also agreed is that the answer to this question turns upon whether the injury occurred upon \u201cany dry dock\u201d within \u00a7 3(a) of the Federal statute. [See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903 (a).]</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">In the record before us there appears a publication of the Department of the Navy, Bureau of Yards and Docks, which classifies and defines dry docks as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">\u201c1A-.03 Terms and Definitions. The terms applying to all of the major types of docking facilities are defined in the following paragraphs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">\u201c1. DRYDOCKING FACILITIES. Dry docking facilities are structures that permit the underwater portion of ships or other floating crafts to be exposed for work thereon. The three principal types of drydocking facilities are floating drydocks, graving drydocks, and marine railways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-13\">\u201c2. FLOATING DRYDOCKS. A floating drydock is a floating structure that can be partially submerged to a predetermined depth by flooding the ballast tanks. After the ship to be docked has been floated into position in the dock, the dock and ship are raised by pumping the water out of the ballast tanks until the pontoon deck is clear of water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-15\">\u201c3. GRAVING DOCKS. A graving drydock is a permanently fixed basin with entrance closures constructed at or near the water\u2019s edge into which a ship can be floated and which can be pumped dry of water, thereby exposing the underwater portion of the ship\u2019s hull.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-16\">\u201c4. MARINE RAILWAYS. A marine railway is a permanently fixed track system extending from a point on shore well above the waterline to a point offshore well below the waterline; it is equipped with a cradle capable of moving along the track by means of rollers or wheels, and a cable or chain and hauling mechanism for hauling the cradle carrying the docked ship into or out of the water. A vertical lift is a variation of a marine railway that is used for small craft; it consists of a cradle and lifting device for raising the craft vertically out of the water.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">The problem is not, however, purely one of definition. It was, for instance, conceded at the bar upon oral argument that, during the more than thirty years since the phrase \u201c(and including any dry dock)\u201d was adopted as part of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act [see \u00a7\u00a7 2(4), 3(a), 44 Stat. 1424 (1927), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 902(4), 903(a)], the Government has never before urged that \u201cany dry dock\u201d includes a building way provided and being used exclusively for new-ship construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">Without reviewing maritime history, we may safely assume that building ways, upon which to construct ships and from which to launch them, necessarily antedated any form of dry dock in or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>upon which to repair the ships once constructed. There is nothing in the legislative history of this Act to indicate that the Congress intended to include a building way on which a new ship was under construction within the meaning of the phrase \u201cany dry dock\u201d. [See: Calbeck v. The Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., 370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962); Avondale Marine Ways, Inc. v. Henderson, 346 U.S. 366, 74 S.Ct. 100, 98 L.Ed. 77 (1953); North Pacific S. S. Co. v. Hall Bros., etc., Co., 249 U.S. 119, 39 S.Ct. 221, 63 L.Ed. 510 (1919).]</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Indeed, since new-ship building has always been considered a non-maritime activity [The Winnebago, 205 U.S. 354, 363, 27 S.Ct. 509, 51 L.Ed. 836 (1907); Edwards v. Elliott, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 532, 22 L.Ed. 487 (1874); People\u2019s Ferry Co. v. Beers, 61 U.S. (20 How.) 393, 401-402, 15 L.Ed. 961 (1857)], considerations of reason and policy would seem to point to the opposite conclusion respecting the intent of the Congress. As the Court observed in Thames Towboat Co. v. The \u201cFrancis McDonald\u201d, 254 U.S. 242, 41 S.Ct. 65, 65 L.Ed. 245 (1920):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">* * the doctrine is now firmly established that contracts to construct entirely new ships are non-maritime * * * in no proper sense can they be regarded as directly and immediately connected with navigation or commerce by water.\u201d [254 U.S. at 244, 41 S.Ct. at 66.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The reason for the exclusion of new-ship construction from the category of maritime activities is well explained in Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U.S. 424, 22 S.Ct. 195, 201, 46 L.Ed. 264 (1902):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201cPrior to her launching she is a mere congeries of wood and iron\u2014 an ordinary piece of personal property \u2014 as distinctly a land structure as a house * * *. In the baptism of launching she receives her name, and from the moment her keel touches the water she is transformed, and becomes a subject of admiralty jurisdiction.\u201d [183 U.S. at 438, 22 S.Ct. 195.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">On the other hand, ship repair has long been considered a maritime activity. [North Pacific S. S. Co. v. Hall Bros., etc., Co., supra, 249 U.S. 119, 39 S.Ct. 221, 63 L.Ed. 510; The Robert W. Parsons, 191 U.S. 17, 33-34, 24 S.Ct. 8, 48 L.Ed. 73 (1903); The Planter, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 324, 340, 8 L.Ed. 700 (1833).] As explained in North Pacific S. S. Co. v. Hall Bros., etc., Co., supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-11\">\u201c * * * there is no difference in character as to repairs made upon the hull of a vessel dependent upon whether they are made while she is afloat, while in dry dock, or while hauled up by ways upon land. The nature of the service is identical in the several cases, and the admiralty jurisdiction extends to all.\u201d [249 U.S. at 128, 39 S.Ct. at 224.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Traditionally, the character of a tort as being nonmaritime or maritime, and therefore giving rise to recovery under the Act, has always depended upon either the place of injury [Atlantic Transport Co. of W. Va. v. Imbrovek, 234 U.S. 52, 34 S.Ct. 733, 58 L.Ed. 1208 (1914); The Plymouth, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 20, 18 L.Ed. 125 (1865); see: Calbeck v. The Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., supra, 370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368; Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, Inc., 314 U.S. 244, 62 S.Ct. 221, 86 L.Ed. 184 (1941)], or the nature of the work being performed [Robins Dry Dock Co. v. Dahl, 266 U.S. 449, 45 S.Ct. 157, 69 L.Ed. 372 (1925); North Pacific S. S. Co. v. Hall Bros., etc., Co., supra, 249 U.S. 119, 39 S.Ct. 221, 63 L.Ed. 510; Waring v. Clarke, 46 U.S. (5 How.) 441, 457-463 (1847); see Avondale Marine Ways, Inc. v. Henderson, supra, 346 U.S. 366, 74 S.Ct. 100, 98 L.Ed. 77]. So an injury sustained in the performance of a non-maritime contract upon navigable \u2022 waters is covered by the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act [Calbeck v. The Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., supra, 370 U.S. 114, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368] while an injury sustained in the performance of a maritime contract upon dry land is also covered by the Act [Avondale Marine Ways, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>v. Henderson, supra, 346 U.S. 366, 74 S.Ct. 100, 98 L.Ed. 77]. In the case last cited, a so-called \u201cMarine railway\u201d on dry land was held to be a \u201cdry dock\u201d within the coverage of the Act, at least while being used in the performance of maritime work \u2014 ship repair. [See Avondale Marine Ways, Inc. v. Henderson, 201 F.2d 437, 438 (5th Cir. 1953).]</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We are of the opinion, therefore, that not alone the nature and location of the facility, but also the nature and location of the work being done, are to be considered in determining whether a given injury occurred on \u201cany dry dock\u201d within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">It would follow then, by parity of reasoning with the Avondale case, that the building way involved at bar would be a \u201cdry dock\u201d while used, as conceivably it might be, for old-ship repair instead of new-ship construction, although one may suppose that such use would <em>ex necessitate </em>require conversion of the building way into what would amount to a \u201cmarine railway\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The short answer to the \u201ccould-be-used\u201d and the \u201cmight-have-been-used\u201d arguments is that such is simply not the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">. This case involves an injury sustained upon dry land, while employed in the performance of a non-maritime contract, upon a ship-building way being used for new-ship construction. [Cf. Port Houston Iron Works v. Calbeck, 227 F.Supp. 966 (S.D.Tex.1964).] To construe a building way, so located and so used, to be a \u201cdry dock\u201d would, we think, as applied to the case at bar, confront constitutional questions involving the breadth and scope of \u201cadmiralty and maritime jurisdiction\u201d [U.S.Const. Art. III, \u00a7 2, Cl. 1]; questions to be avoided when they need not be reached [O\u2019Donnell v. Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Co., 318 U.S. 36, 41, 63 S.Ct. 488, 87 L.Ed. 596 (1943); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22, 52 S.Ct. 285, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932)].</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The statutory presumption of \u00a7 20 [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a)] cannot, as appellant urges, bring an injury within the coverage of the Act under the admitted facts involved here [cf.: O\u2019Keeffe v. Smith, etc., 380 U.S. 359, 85 S.Ct. 1012, 13 L.Ed.2d 895 (1965); Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 330 U.S. 469, 67 S.Ct. 801, 91 L.Ed. 1028 (1947); Davis v. Dept. of Labor, 317 U.S. 249, 63 S.Ct. 225, 87 L.Ed. 246 (1942) ]; for as the Court has often observed, when the finding of the Deputy Commissioner is erroneous as a matter of law, it must be set aside [see Norton v. Warner Co., 321 U.S. 565, 64 S.Ct. 747, 88 L.Ed. 430 (1944) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Finally, appellant contends that we should construe the Act to be an exercise of the complementary powers of the Congress under both the \u201cCommerce Clause\u201d [U.S.Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8] and the \u201cAdmiralty Clause\u201d [id., Art. III, \u00a7 2]. It is true, of course, as pointed out in appellant\u2019s scholarly brief, that: \u201cThe two powers are entirely distinct, either or both may be invoked, and neither limits the other.\u201d [See: The Lottawanna, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 558, 577, 22 L.Ed. 654 (1874); The Genesee Chief, 53 U.S. (12 How.) 443, 452, 13 L.Ed. 1058 (1851); United States v. Coombs, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 72, 76-79, 9 L.Ed. 1004 (1838); Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 189-192, 6 L.Ed.2d 23 (1824).] But we share the view of Judge Beeks that, if the Commerce Clause is to be invoked to extend the coverage of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the Congress and not the courts should so decide. [See Berryhill v. Pacific Far East Line, 238 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1956).]</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
