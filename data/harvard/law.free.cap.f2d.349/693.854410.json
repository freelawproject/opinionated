State of Maryland, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 259, 322 F.2d 1009, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 954, 84 S.Ct. 445, 11 L.Ed.2d 314 (1963), we affirmed a judgment of the District Court in favor of appellees under the Federal Tort Claims Act, Ch. 753, 60 Stat. 842 (1946) (codified in various sections of 28 U. S.C.). A copy of the pertinent parts of the judgment is set forth in the Appendix to this opinion, from which it will be seen that it contains several individual money awards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Appellees moved in the District Court to require the United States to pay interest on the judgment. The court granted the motion, ordering,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">\u201cthe motion to require defendant to pay interest on judgments, in accordance with the provisions of Title 28, Section 2411(b), United States Code Annotated be and is hereby granted, and the defendant, the United States of America, be and is hereby directed to pay the judgments entered in these two cases, together with interest, which shall be computed at the rate of 4% per annum from the date of the judgments up to, but not exceeding, thirty days after the date of approval of any appropriation act providing for the payment of the judgments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">We think this order must be reversed except as to interest on the award of $175,000 to Vance Lewman Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Each appellee other than Vance Lew-man Brady recovered a sum of less than $100,000; and each failed to take the steps necessary in that situation to obtain prompt payment. Each is accordingly precluded from recovering interest, which is not recoverable against the United States except as authorized by statute or contract. United States v. Goltra, 312 U.S. 203, 207, 61 S.Ct. 487, 85 L.Ed. 776 (1941). It is provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b) (1958) that except as otherwise provided in subsection (a), which calls for interest in certain instances at the rate of six per cent per annum, interest on final judgments against the United States entered under the Federal Tort Claims Act shall be computed at the rate of four per cent per annum from the date of judgment up to but not exceeding thirty days after the date of approval of any appropriation act providing for payment of the judgment; but 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 724a (Supp. V, 1959-63)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> partially overrides these provisions. It appropriates sums for the payment, not otherwise provided, of final judgments of a district court against the United States, \u201cnot in excess of $100,000 * * * in any one case,\u201d provided that as to a judgment to which Section 2411(b) applies, and which is payable from this appropriation, interest shall be paid \u201conly from the date of the filing of the transcript thereof in the General Accounting Office to the date of the mandate of affirmance * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">The transcript of the judgment in this case was not filed in the General Accounting Office, so that, except as to Vance Lewman Brady, the award of interest was erroneous unless the judgment ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>dered is to be considered a judgment in excess of $100,000 \u201cin any one case.\u201d Appellees contend that there is only one case for each of the deaths which occurred, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>with a separate judgment for each group of survivors in excess of $100,000. They point to the Wrongful Death Act of Maryland <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which requires that the \u201caction shall be brought by and in the name of the State of Maryland for the use of the person or persons entitled to damages,\u201d the amount recovered to be divided among the parties entitled to damages, and not more than \u201cone action shall lie for and in respect of the same subject matter of complaint.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The Federal interest statute, however, is to be construed and applied according to its own purposes and meaning. The judgment is not necessarily to be construed as \u201cin any one case\u201d because only one action for each death was filed according to Maryland law. This requirement of Maryland has no purpose related to the liability of the United States for interest. Its purpose is related to the convenience of litigation in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Judgment \u201cin any one case\u201d does not necessarily mean in one law suit without regard to the character of the judgment as it bears on the problem of interest. We should give the language a meaning, if the words will bear it, which carries out the purposes of the statute, even though this is not the literal meaning of the words when considered in isolation. United States v. Shirey, 359 U.S. 255, 260-261, 79 S.Ct. 746, 3 L.Ed.2d 789 (1959); United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns., 310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1941). The obvious purposes of the Federal statute are (1) to enable one who has a judgment not in excess of $100,000, obtained under the Tort Claims Act, to receive prompt payment without awaiting a special appropriation, and (2) to relieve the United States of the obligation of paying interest, or of a bad conscience as it were for not doing so, while the principal remains unpaid. As to the purposes as they appear from legislative history see H.R.Rep.No.2638, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 72 (1957); and see Harue Hay-ashi, 40 Comp.Gen. 307 (1960) ; Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pac. R. R. v. United States, 206 F.Supp. 795 (S.D.Ia.1962). These purposes are served by permitting each individual who recovers a severable and distinct amount not in excess of $100,000 to be paid under Section 724a. Each such claimant has a severable and specific award in the final judgment. Each award may therefore be considered a judgment \u201cin any one case\u201d as that expression is used in the statute. Each individual thus awarded no more than $100,000 could have complied with the statute by filing a transcript of the judgment; each would then have been entitled to receive payment with the interest authorized by Section 724a; and each indeed would have been paid. See Harue Hayashi, <em>supra </em>at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The position of appellees is not devoid of support; for the result of our construction is that an individual who recovers $175,000 must await a special appropriation, during which period interest accumulates, while the several individuals in the same over-all case whose aggregate recoveries exceed $100,000 are paid without the further attention of Congress. Frankly, we do not have a problem with a perfectly clear solution. The solution we reach, however, better carries out the Congressional plan, and the language used lends itself well enough to that end. Moreover, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>appear to be no policy considerations which outweigh those which operate in favor of the view we take.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">When the District Court ordered that \u201cMary Jane Meyer recover of the defendant United States the sum of $85,000.00\u201d, for example, there arose a separable and final judgment under Section 724a, payable to her upon affirmance, notwithstanding-that in the same document entitled \u201cJudgment\u201d awards were made in an aggregate amount exceeding $100,-000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">The United States urges that as to all, including Vance Lewman Brady, interest could not be recovered in any event because neither the judgment of the District Court nor our judgment of affirmance provided for interest. We disagree with this contention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b) explicitly provides for interest on such final judgments as are here involved if in excess of $100,000.00. The award to Vance Lewman Brady was in excess of $100,000, so Section 724a does not remove her case from the coverage of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b). Where an Act of Congress speaks so clearly the absence of a provision for interest in the judgment itself, or in the mandate of affirmance, does not render the statute ineffective. We emphasize that we are concerned with interest after judgment, not, as in Briggs v. Pennsylvania R. R., 334 U.S. 304, 68 S.Ct. 1039, 92 L.Ed. 1403 (1948), with the allowance of interest prior to judgment. Nor is In re Washington &amp; Georgetown R. R., 140 U.S. 91, 11 S.Ct. 673, 35 L.Ed. 339 (1891), controlling, since it involved no explicit statutory provision for interest after judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Reversed as to Mary Jane Meyer, Paul Jeffrey Meyer, Susan Lynn Meyer, Pamela Ann Meyer, Austin F.

The ease itself grew out of an airplane collision over Maryland resulting in the death of the pilot and co-pilot.

After this court had affirmed, the District Court entered its further order of April 20, 1964 awarding interest at the rate of 4 per cent from the date of the original judgment \u201cup to, but not exceeding, thirty days after the date of approval of any appropriation act providing for the payment of the judgments.\u201d The total of the awards in the Meyer case was $171,000, allocated among the several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>beneficiaries in the original Meyer judgment, with no one award as great as $100,000. The awards in the Brady case aggregated $249,000 with a single award to Vance Lewman Brady of $175,000 and with lesser amounts payable to other survivors. My colleagues treat the amounts of the individual awards to the respective survivors as though each was the result of a separate \u201ccase.\u201d Thus they reverse the District Court\u2019s 1964 order except insofar as they recognize the award to Vance Lewman Brady to be valid since it was in excess of $100,000. I find myself unable to concur in a reversal, our difference having arisen with respect to the construction of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 724a (1965), 70 Stat. 694 (1956), as amended, 75 Stat. 416 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In that legislation and as here pertinent, Congress appropriated \u201csuch sums as may hereafter be necessary\u201d for payment of certain final judgments, as certified by the Comptroller General; it was simply a fiscal \u201chousekeeping\u201d statute, clearly intended to apply only to judgments of less than $100,000. Through such mechanism, Congress sought to provide a procedure whereby some 98 per cent of final judgments rendered against the Government might be satisfied through action by the Comptroller General, with interest thereon to run only from the date of the filing of the transcript of a final judgment in the General Accounting Office to the date of the mandate of affirmance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Congress reserved to itself final consideration with respect to the 2 per cent of \u201cfinal judgments (not in excess of $100,000 * * * in any one case)\u201d which by virtue of the legislation were beyond the power of the Comptroller General to satisfy. Our problem derives from the fact that in No. 18676 the State of Maryland was plaintiff in \u201cone case\u201d for the use of the Meyer claimants. The judgment there amounted to $171,000 broken down into individual awards to separate claimants. In the other case, No. 18677, the State of Maryland was plaintiff for the use of members of the Brady family, with individual awards which total $249,000. There was only one judgment, that of December 6, 1961, with the separate respective apportion-ments to the individual Brady and Meyer claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">When the suit for the use of Meyer like that for the Brady survivors was commenced pursuant to Article 67, section 4 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1957), actions for wrongful death were required to be brought only in the name of the State of Maryland in behalf of various named beneficiaries of the decedent. Even under Maryland\u2019s 1962 amendment of section 4 (Ann.Code of Md., Art. 67, \u00a7 4 (Supp.1964)), only one such action will lie. Those who may have a right to become parties but refuse to do so are excluded from bringing a subsequent action on their own account. State of Maryland to Use of Bashe, 72 Md. 140, 19 A. 366, 7 L.R.A. 272 (1890).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">Our own Wrongful Death statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that \u201c[e]very such action shall be brought by and in the name of the personal representative * * * \u201d of the decedent. This court has expressly held that the \u201crequirement of the statute is in plain and unambiguous language.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">It is fundamental that an action for wrongful death does not lie unless a statute so provides. Since the \u201cuse\u201d plaintiffs are mandatory parties, if they are to sue at all,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> they are bound by the judgment when entered. Conversely the bringing of a single action redounds to the advantage of the alleged tort feasor who thus will be spared the necessity of defending multiple suits. Nothing in Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(a) is to the contrary in respect of the result necessary here; indeed whatever effect may be accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>to the Rule in situations where a jurisdictional problem arises, we have expressly held that substantively, the Rule does not modify or repeal the \u201cspecification in our statute <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the party authorized to bring an action for wrongful death.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Footnote added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) (1965) provides that subject to the provisions of ch. 171 which prescribes tort claims procedure, the District Courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States for death caused by the negligence of the Government \u201cunder circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674 provides that the United States shall be liable in tort claims \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The Maryland statute, Article 67, section 4, as amended, <em>supra, </em>is explicit: only \u201cone action shall lie for and in respect of the same subject matter * * * <em>\u201d </em><footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">Thus, if there were no living members of the use class as named in the Maryland statute, no claim for wrongful death could be made. Obviously, under the federal statutes, <em>supra, </em>no liability would devolve upon the Government.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Conversely, living members of the classes in whose behalf the action might be maintained are mandatory plaintiffs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-18\">Thus the Meyer action, like the Brady suit, could have been brought only as it was brought \u2014 in accordance with the law of Maryland. It was \u201cone case.\u201d The final judgment exceeded $100,000.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore the order of the District Court correctly provided for interest to \u201cbe computed at the rate of 4 per centum per annum from [December 6, 1961] up to, but not exceeding, thirty days after the date of approval of any appropriation Act providing for payment of the judgment.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-19\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">.
