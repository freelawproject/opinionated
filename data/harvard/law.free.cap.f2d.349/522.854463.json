Trial of the issue of damages was before the Court below, sitting without a jury. Compensation in the amount of $21,246.00, plus interest from the date of taking, was allowed for a perpetual easement over a part of \u201cMorris Island\u201d lying in the Arkansas River, within the city limits of Fort Smith, Arkansas. The opinion of the District Court so adjudicating is reported at 230 F.Supp. 973.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">\u201cMorris Island\u201d is approximately one and one-half miles long. Prior to the date of \u201ctaking\u201d, it contained about 160 acres of land. It lies adjacent to the right, or east, bank of the Arkansas River, at a point where the river runs north and south through Fort Smith, Arkansas. The easement condemned included all the area of \u201cMorris Island\u201d riverward, from a line running the entire length thereof. The taking was approximately 97 acres, leaving a remainder of approximately 63 acres. On the land side of \u201cMorris Island\u201d there was a slough or shallow waterway which enters the river near the south end thereof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Access to \u201cMorris Island\u201d is over a public road which crosses the slough on a causeway or low water bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The Court below found the partial taking of land here to be related to \u201cgeneral work of bank stabilization, channel rectification, control of floods, and the improvement of navigation on the Arkansas River.\u201d As a part of such project, it found a trench 8,400 feet long was cut through \u201cMorris Island\u201d of such depth and width as to enable the construction of a rock revetment, which was done \u201cin an effort to stabilize the right or east bank of the river * * *.\u201d As a consequence, 36.86 acres of the easement area, riverward, was left to the ravages of the river current. After the casting thereof into the river, there were approximately 60.49 acres of the easement area remaining, which, of course, included the area upon which the revetment was built. The remaining land in the easement was variously stated to be 250 to 300 feet wide, which lies adjacent to the remainder containing approximately 62.36 acres. The taking was \u201csubject * * * to existing easements for public roads and highways, public utilities, railroads and pipelines; reserving to the landowners, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, the right to use the surface of (the easement) land as access to their adjoining land.\u201d (Par. added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">At the trial of this case, the Government took the position that this \u201criver stabilization\u201d work conferred a \u201cspecial and direct\u201d benefit upon the land remaining in \u201cMorris Island\u201d; thus making it more adaptable for industrial use by reason of the \u201cproject\u201d; which, it asserted, increased the value of the remainder so that it was worth more after the taking than the value of the whole of \u201cMorris Island\u201d before that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">Only one expert witness testified for each of the parties as to land values in this case. The Government\u2019s expert witness testified that prior to the taking here the highest and best use of all the land in \u201cMorris Island\u201d was for \u201cagriculture\u201d, with a market value of $12,000.00, which was $500.00 less than appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>had paid therefor at the time of purchase in 1957.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of the project here considered, it was that witness\u2019s opinion that the highest and best use of the remainder was \u201cindustrial\u201d. On the other hand, appellees\u2019 evidence of highest and best use before and after the taking \u201cwas for agricultural purposes and the gain it had already sustained by it lying within its proximity to the manufacturing district of Fort Smith, as well as it being zoned 1-3 Industrial Zone.\u201d Hence, ap-pellees\u2019 expert witness as to value excluded the \u201cproject\u201d of \u201cbank stabilization, channel rectification, control of floods and navigation on the Arkansas River\u201d entirely from his estimate of before and after values.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">From the opinion of the District Court, it is apparent that it considered \u201cthe general work of bank stabilization, channel rectification, control of floods and for improvement of navigation of the Arkansas River * * * \u201d to be the cause and purpose for the taking here, but when it came to consider the question of general or special benefits to the remainder it limited its consideration thereof, singularly, to \u201cnavigation on the Arkansas River,\u201d and from that vista ruled that such was the sole objective of the project and cause for the \u201cpartial condemnation\u201d of \u201cMorris Island.\u201d From that limited view of the proof adduced, it found \u201cthe benefit, if any, to the remaining land\u201d to be \u201ca general benefit\u201d arising \u201cfrom the fulfillment of (a) public project,\u201d which was general to all riparian land on the Arkansas River, particularly in and near Fort Smith, Arkansas. As a consequence, it concluded that \u201cno special or direct benefit arose from the relation of the land in question to (this) public improvement,\u201d and such appears to be the singular premise for allowance of damages as it did in this partial condemnation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Generally stated, it is the Government\u2019s contention that \u201cthe district court, in ascertaining compensation\u201d as it did in this \u201cpartial taking case, erred in rejecting enhancement to the remainder due to the project.\u201d Its argument before us is premised thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">\u201cIn the instant case, even though the owners would have received no award according to the testimony of the Government\u2019s expert witness, they are now in a better position financially than they would have been had there been no project. To pay them the value of the land taken, plus so-called severance damages calculated on an artificial basis, in addition to the benefits they have received, is far more than just compensation, unfair to the public and, hence, to be avoided.\u201d (Applnt\u2019s br., pp. 10-11.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">It is clear from the opinion of the District Court, ante, that it only considered the testimony of the witnesses for both parties from the vista that they were in agreement \u201cthat the highest and best use for the land at the time of taking was for agricultural purposes.\u201d (1. c. 984 of 230 F.Supp. ante.) The only inference to be made from the record is that it declared as a matter of law from that premise that \u201cno special or direct benefit arose from the relation of the land in question to the public improvement\u201d as made in the \u201cDeclaration of Taking\u201d and \u201csince the remainder of the land (did) not receive any special * * * benefits\u201d it determined \u201cthe amount of compensation to be awarded to the landowner\u201d as it did. In so doing, we believe that Court inadvertently misconceived the issues as raised and joined in this partial condemnation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">From the facts appearing in the record, doubt cannot exist as to the <em>causa causans </em>for the commencement of this partial condemnation proceeding. As the District Court specifically found, the purpose thereof was \u201cgeneral work of bank stabilization, channel rectification, control of floods, and for the improvement of navigation on the Arkansas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>River.\u201d (ante, 1. c. 975, of 230 F.Supp.) As a consequence, we think the mandate of \u00a7 595, of Title 33, U.S.C.A., is and was at the time of the taking here considered, particularly applicable to the facts established by all the proof adduced in the case at bar. (cf.) United States v. Mills, (8 Cir. 1956) 237 F.2d 401, and authorities there cited. In proceedings to condemn riparian land under the River and Harbor Improvements Act, and the Flood Control Act, supra, Congress has specifically declared that the trier of the facts, in \u201cawarding the just compensation or assessing the damages to the owner\u201d for property taken thereunder, \u201cshall take into consideration by way of reducing the amount of compensation or damages any special and direct benefits to the remainder arising from the improvement.\u201d Such statute, of course, does not affect the Fifth Amendment constitutional norms considered in relation to the issue of a \u201ctaking\u201d, nor assessment of severance damages in partial condemnation proceedings as defined in United States v. Miller, 317 U.S. 369, 63 S.Ct. 276, 87 L.Ed. 336 (1943); Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246, 54 S.Ct. 704, 78 L. Ed. 1236 (1934); and United States v. River Rouge Co., 269 U.S. 411, 46 S.Ct. 144, 70 L.Ed. 339; or Bauman v. Ross, 167 U.S. 548, 17 S.Ct. 966, 42 L.Ed, 270 (1897). But it does constitute a mandate by the Congress that in each such case the Court in which any such condemnation proceeding is pending shall specifically consider the issue of \u201cspecial and direct benefits to the remainder arising from the improvement, and shall render (its) award or verdict accordingly.\u201d (Par. added.) Hence, in a partial condemnation proceeding, the trial court should have made specific findings of fact in respect to severance damage considered in the light of the object for the taking. Here, the District Court only considered the issue of severance damage from the general vista of \u201cnavigation on the Arkansas River.\u201d It made no findings of fact as to \u201cspecial benefits,\u201d if any, arising from a consideration of \u201cbank stabilization, channel rectification, control of floods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">It was the Government\u2019s contention in this case that the project of construction of a \u201crevetment on (the) land\u201d in question \u201cwhich prevents the river from washing it away * * * has converted\u201d the remainder \u201csuitable for a more valuable use, i. e. industrial\u201d than it had before, and that failure of the District Court to consider the taking from that aspect has caused the issue of damages to be wrongfully decided. In opposition thereto, appellees contended that there is nothing anywhere in the record of this case tending to show any special benefits accruing to the land remaining; that all which does appear is \u201cgeneral benefits that * * * might accrue to property of (the) nature\u201d of Morris Island, because of general improvement of the Arkansas River. This, we think, completely overlooks all the issues present in the case, as well as the testimony in the record to the effect that before the taking, Morris Island was subject to reliction or erosion, and because thereof a part of it had washed away by reason of \u201ccurrent\u201d reaction of the Arkansas River since appellees purchased the same to the date of this taking. The only inference to be made from the record is that the \u201crevetment work\u201d performed by the Government has manifestly, within the ambit of the Government\u2019s cause for a partial taking thereof, closed Morris Island, \u201criverward\u201d, from further reliction or erosion. That fact alone apparently places the easement, as well as the remainder of Morris Island, in a \u201cbetter position\u201d because of the taking here, than it was before, located and joined as the remainder is, within the industrial zone area of Forth Smith, Arkansas. Hence, it is apparent there was a factual issue in this case as to \u201chighest and best\u201d use by reason of this \u201cproject\u201d, which the Court below apparently did not consider and adjudicate from all the evidence adduced before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In this case, the testimony of the Government\u2019s witness was to the effect that by reason of the \u201cproject\u201d the highest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>and best use of \u201cMorris Island\u201d was changed from \u201cagricultural\u201d to an \u201cindustrial\u201d use. The testimony of appel-lees\u2019 own witness was to the effect: \u201cI consider the highest and best use of this property at the date of taking to be for agricultural purposes <em>and for urban growth </em>as the need for this acreage could be placed in the hands of investors, such as the present owners, <em>for the expansion and growth of industry </em>zone in which the property is located.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-4\">\u201cQ. Is the property adaptable for industrial use ? A. Yes, it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In the light of the foregoing, we do not consider the finding of fact as made by the Court below, that \u201cboth witnesses agree that the highest and best use for the land at the time of taking was for agricultural purposes\u201d <em>only, </em>can be sustained, nor as being factually decisive of the issue of damages here. Such finding does not reflect the whole content of all the testimony adduced as to \u201chighest and best use\u201d as established in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">It was from a limited consideration of the facts existing at the date of taking, that the Court below estimated damages in the case at bar. That the owner of property condemned for public use is to be put in as good position pecuniarily as he would have occupied if his property had not been taken, is axiomatic in the law of condemnation. As said in United States v. Miller, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">\u201cSince the owner is to receive no more than indemnity for his loss, his award cannot be enhanced by any gain to the taker. Thus although the market value of the property is to be fixed with due consideration of all its available uses, its special value to the condemnor as distinguished from others who may or may not possess the power to condemn, must be excluded as an element of market value.\u2019\u2019 (317 U.S., 1. c. 375, 63 S.Ct. 1. c. 280.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">In the case at bar the Court below limited its consideration of the issue of \u201cspecial benefit\u201d as a \u201cproject to improve navigation on the Arkansas River,\u201d and disregarded any \u201cspecial benefits\u201d to the land here considered arising from \u201cbank stabilization, channel rectification * * * and control of floods.\u201d It is apparent that those three factors were vital matter at issue in this case. The taking * * * presupposed a <em>stable </em>bank for Morris Island; that the channel of the river would be controlled by such project; and that the revetment work would so control the \u201cchannel\u201d of the Arkansas River that \u201cMorris Island\u201d would be protected from the ravages thereof. Such was the theory of the Government\u2019s proof as to specific benefits made in the case at bar, but not considered by the Court below in arriving at the quantum of damages as it did. That such matters present mixed questions of fact and law is clear. The commitment of the project, of course, was also to \u201cnavigation\u201d, but not singularly so. The taking of riparian rights to property, which only has the aspects of \u201cbank stabilization, channel rectification and control of floods,\u201d reserving to the owner of the remainder \u201caccess\u201d over the easement taken to his former riparian interest, can only be considered as being \u201cdirect\u201d, i. e. special to the riparian interest before and after the taking, (cf.) United States v. River Rouge Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">The Declaration of Taking in this case was for \u201cpublic use\u201d of land \u201cnecessary for use in connection with bank stabilization, channel rectification, control of floods, and navigation on the Arkansas River in Sebastian County, Arkansas.\u201d All four of such factors were the purpose of construction of the revetment work on the island for which the \u201ceasement\u201d was sought. Clearly, the District Court erred in confining its consideration of benefits as it did, solely to one factor, namely, \u201cnavigation\u201d. To the extent that the \u201ceasement\u201d rights protect the remainder of \u201cMorris Island\u201d and the latter is \u201cfast land,\u201d evidence of \u201cindustrial use\u201d value at time of taking is not unreasonable. (cf.) Olson v. United States, supra. As recently said by this Court: \u201cIt is settled that special benefits do not become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>general merely because other lands in the area (of the taking) are similarly benefited.\u201d United States v. Crance, et al., 8 Cir., 341 F.2d 161, 1. c. 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The judgment appealed from is reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\">. Quotations in this opinion not otherwise identified are to be found in the opinion of the District Court, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b569-11\">. From the record before us, doubt exists as to whether \u201cMorris Island\u201d is and was in fact an island at the time of taking, (cf.) Crow v. Johnston, 209 Ark. 1053, 194 197; Jones v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. (Mo.App.) 100 S.W.2d 617, and cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-6\">. The lesser value was arrived at \u201cbecause from investigation\u201d the Government\u2019s appraiser was of the opinion \u201cMorris Island <em>* * </em>* had more land at the time of purchase than it contained at the time of taking.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
