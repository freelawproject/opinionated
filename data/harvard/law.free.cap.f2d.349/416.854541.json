The Government insists that the sale was barred from capital gain treatment because the property was \u201cheld by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of [its] trade or business.\u201d Int. Rev.Code \u00a7 1221(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">We affirm the judgment of the Tax Court, at the same time resisting the entreaties of the Taxpayer to thereby voice our approval of any broad standards perhaps suggested in the Tax Court\u2019s opinion, so that they would become additional factors having, or thought to have, or hoped to have, some unique significance in this field which already suffers from a proliferation of tests. Thompson v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 122, 127. Because on this record it is clear that by the time of the sale, the Taxpayer\u2019s purposes with regard to this property had been so altered that the character of this part of the larger tract could no longer be considered as within \u00a7 1221(1), the Tax Court\u2019s ultimate fact finding must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
