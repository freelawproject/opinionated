Patent Office, with whom Mr. Clarence W. Moore, Sol., U. S.

The use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>such pressures during mixing allegedly results in uniform and controlled cell size and eliminates fissures in the end product. Appellants then sued the Commissioner of Patents in the District Court under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 for a declaration that they are entitled to the patent. The District Court entered judgment for the defendant and dismissed the complaint, and the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Both the Patent Office and the District Court held the process unpatentable because the prior art made it obvious to a person with ordinary skill in the art, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103, relying on the Hoppe <em>et al. </em>patent No. 2,764,565, the application for which was filed two months after appellants\u2019 application. Hoppe\u2019s application was a continuation in part of an abandoned application filed two and a half years before appellants\u2019 application, and the parties agreed in the trial court that the continuation-in-part application is available as a reference to the extent its disclosures are also contained in the abandoned application. Though appellants now contest this, we have already held that, \u201c[a]s to all subject matter carried over into the continuing application from the parent application, the former is entitled to the filing date of the latter.\u201d Asseff v. Marzall, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 358, 359, 189 F.2d 660, 661, cert. denied, 342 U.S. 828, 72 S.Ct. 51, 96 L.Ed. 626 (1951). The Hoppe <em>et al. </em>abandoned application discloses an apparatus for the production of polyurethane plastics, including foamed products. Under one modification of the apparatus the ingredients are conveyed simultaneously through a common mixing nozzle and injected under pressure \u201cup to 1000 atmospheres\u201d into a mixing chamber.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This modification was carried forward into the continuation-in-part application. See Hoppe <em>et al. </em>patent No. 2,764,565 (Sept. 25, 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The Patent Office held that this disclosure would suggest the process of mixing the ingredients under pressure to one with ordinary skill in the art. Although some evidence at trial conflicted with this holding, the District Court agreed with the Patent Office, relying on its expertness and stating that obviousness was indicated by the facts that another inventor had discovered the process at about the same time as appellants did and that the problem was not of long standing in the art.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\"> The Patent Office\u2019s expertness in determining technical questions such as obviousness requires affirmance of its judgments unless they have no rational basis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since the Patent Office\u2019s finding of obviousness is supported by the record, the District Court\u2019s judgment is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-10\">. \u201cIn this modification the two components of the reaction mixture, namely at least one di-isocyanate and at least one hy-droxyl-group-containing polyester, are conveyed separately to a mixing chamber into which they are <em>injected under pressure through </em>separate nozzles or <em>a common miming nozzle, </em>and the activator is either conveyed separately to the mixing chamber and <em>injected into it under pressure through </em>a separate nozzle or <em>the common miming nozzle </em>or is conveyed to the mixing chamber in admixture with one of the said components.\u201d Hoppe abandoned application, serial No. 327,522. \u201cThe reaction components and activator are preferably injected into the mixing \u25a0chamber at a pressure up to 1000 atmospheres, the homogeneity and strength of the end product of porous or homogeneous structure being thus improved.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-18\">.
