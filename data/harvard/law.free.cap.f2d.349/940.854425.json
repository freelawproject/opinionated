Thomason has also moved in this court for appointment of counsel to represent him on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-24\">In his district court application Thom-ason urged three grounds for relief, namely: (1) the corpus delecti was not established by evidence upon which the information is based; (2) the evidence purporting to establish the crime is hearsay and therefore inadmissible; and (3) the state court erroneously denied his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty after he discovered a witness who v/ould establish Thomason\u2019s innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-25\">None of these grounds are renewed in support of Thomason\u2019s appeal. None of the grounds for reversal which he now urges, were presented in his application for a writ of habeas corpus. Except where necessary to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice, no such showing being made here, an appellant may not urge, as a ground for reversal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>a theory which he did not present in the trial court. See Daugharty v. Gladden, 9 Cir., 257 F.2d 750, 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The motion for appointment of counsel is denied. The order under review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
