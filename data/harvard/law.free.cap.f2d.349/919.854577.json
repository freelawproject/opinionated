BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">This appeal challenges a declaratory judgment rendered on the Insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, F.R.Civ.P. 56, declaring that the Insurer is not obligated to defend a damage suit or pay any judgment rendered therein. Although the specific issue presented is the construction and application of policy terms, our disposition is affected by principles which bear on granting declaratory relief. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2201.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-19\">The Insurer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued to the Assured<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a standard Texas Comprehensive General Liability (CGL) policy. Consistent with its name, its coverage for personal injuries and death under Part I was virtually unlimited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Limited only with \u201crespect to such insurance as is afforded by this policy,\u201d the obligation to defend under Part II was likewise broad.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But structured as one now comes to expect, cf. Ocean Acc. &amp; Guar. Corp. v. Aconomy Erectors, Inc., 7 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 242, 247, what was given in Parts I and II, notes 3 and 4, supra, shrunk considerably as tabular spaces on attached schedules were filled in or left blank. As a consequence, the Insurer asserts, the coverage was limited to \u201c(a) Premises \u2014 Operations\u201d; \u201c(c) Independent Contractors\u201d; and contractual liability under \u201c(e) Contracts as Defined in Condition 3(a).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And it contends that coverage for \u201cProducts (Including Completed Operations)\u201d was expressly negatived both by the tabular language <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and by formal endorsement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>which excluded liability for \u201cProducts Hazards.\u201d <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">This coverage and duty-to-defend controversy arises out of a damage suit filed December 7, 1961, by Billy Lee Schafer in the State Court; Schafer, an employee of Luke Grace Drilling Company, claimed to have been seriously injured January 22, 1961, on a drilling rig located in Hansford County, Texas, when a drill collar, which had previously been taken to the machine shop of the Assured Rotary Tool &amp; Joint Company in Perry-ton, Texas, for reworking and return, broke.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the State Court suit charged that the Assured Rotary Tool &amp; Joint Company had delivered the drill collars back to the premises of the Drilling Company, its customer, the Insurer urged that this claim was not within the policy coverage since the occurrence was within \u201cProducts Hazards\u201d as defined in the policy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which had been expressly excluded, notes 7 and 6, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">The problem of policy coverage was early recognized and raised. After obtaining a reservation agreement<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Insurer employed an Amarillo firm to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>\u25a0defend the suit. This firm filed an answer on behalf of the Assured and undertook (and apparently still continues in) the defense of this case. The case was twice set for trial and during this time all depositions of several persons were taken in connection with the investigation of the facts in preparation for trial \u25a0of the State Court suit. Just shortly before the second setting of the damage suit for trial during the month of October, the Insurer filed this declaratory judgment action in the Federal Court. The complaint precisely asserted nonlia-bility, noncoverage on the ground that the State Court suit charged a claim of a kind within the \u201cProducts Hazard\u201d definition which risks had been purposefully excluded. It sought a declaration that the Insurer had no duty to defend or pay any judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Federal District Court held with the Insurer and \u25a0made the declaration precisely as sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">We are, of course, Erie-Texas bound both as to the substantive construction of the policy contract and as to the substantive nature of the test to determine whether the damage claim comes within the coverage thus construed. Unlike some where the lights are dim, United Services Life Ins. Co. v. Delaney, 5 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 483, or where the wick sputters from doubtful fuel, Kay v. Home Indem. Co., 5 Cir., 1964, 337 F.2d 898, 900, the lights here are bright, clear, and contemporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">As to coverage, we think the Supreme Court of Texas by its decision in Pan American Ins. Co. v. Cooper Butane Co., 1957, 157 Tex. 102, 300 S.W.2d 651, makes several things quite clear. First, the liability at issue is a matter of contract upon which contract principles apply. Second, policy provisions excluding liability for damages occurring after an assured\u2019s activity has ceased are perfectly valid. And third, the plain meaning of language comparable to that of \u201c(2) Operations\u201d, note 9, supra, excludes occurrences taking place after operations have been completed. Although some distinctions exist between the Coop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>er policy and the one involved here,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we think that for our Erie purposes, the path to follow is plainly marked. And in any event other Texas writing Courts who also mark our way, Ford Motor Co. v. Mathis, 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 267, 269, give Cooper a broad reading to deny coverage under \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d for damages growing out of failures occurring away from premises owned, rented, or controlled by the assured and happening after operations had been completed since such liabilities are covered expressly under \u201cProducts \u2014 Completed Operations\u201d. Maryland Casualty Co. v. Knorpp, Tex.Civ.App., writ refused n. r. e., 1963, 370 S.W.2d 898; Pan American Ins. Co. v. White, Tex.Civ.App., no writ history, 1959, 321 S.W.2d 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">This means that as to coverage under \u201c(2) Operations\u201d we reject, as did the trial Court, the cases from other jurisdictions which in effect tie the \u201c(2) Operations\u201d coverage into some kind or character of a product which is manufactured, sold, handled or distributed as dealt with in \u201c(1) Goods or Products\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the policy definition (see note 9, supra). These cases adopt the theory that \u201c(2) Operations\u201d relates only to persons who are engaged in the business of selling, manufacturing, etc. some product. In other words (2) is not independent of (1). In view of this we find it unnecessary to pass on the Assured\u2019s argument labored so mightily that to \u201cwork on\u201d goods such as the drill collar here does not amount to goods \u201chandled\u201d within the phrase \u201c(1) Goods or Products Manufactured, Sold, <em>Handled, </em>or Distributed by the Named Insured -x- -x * <em>\u00bb </em>jn thg Products Hazards definition, note 9, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Accepting this Texas construction as we must, the question then arises whether the damage claim asserted is within the coverage \u2014 perhaps more accurately, whether the claim is excluded from coverage. The big question has always been whether duty to defend is to be determined by what the damage claimant formally alleges or what the true facts are. On this, Texas has even more recently, but no less plainly, established the nature of the test to be applied. On January 27,1965, in Heyden Newport Chemical Corp. v. Southern General Ins. Co., 1965, Tex., 387 S.W.2d 22, the Supreme Court of Texas gave its answer. Through Justice Hamilton it declared, \u201cWe think that in determining the duty of a liability insurance company to defend a lawsuit, the allegations of the complainant should be considered in the light of the policy provisions without reference to the truth or falsity of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>allegations and without reference to what the parties know or believe the true facts to be, or without reference to a legal determination thereof.\u201d 387 S.W.2d at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Since initial duty to defend depends on the damage claim alleged, the Court recognizes that a problem is inescapably presented concerning the standard to be applied to the pleadings in the damage suit when matching it against the coverage prescribed in the policy. The Court answers that one plainly too. \u201cWhile we have said above that the court is limited to a consideration of the allegations and the insurance policy in determining an insurer\u2019s duty to defend, we wish to point out that in considering such allegations a liberal interpretation of their meaning should be indulged.\u201d 387 S.W.2d at 26. The Court went on to cite with approval 50 A.L.R.2d 458, at 504, that \u201c * * * in case of doubt as to whether or not the allegations of a complaint against the insured state a cause of action within the coverage of a liability policy * * * such doubt will be resolved in insured\u2019s favor.\u201d 387 S.W. 2d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">If the matter stopped there, our task would be an easy one of determining whether even under these loose, liberal standards<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> any theory is set forth which does not essentially charge that the Assured took the drill collar from the rig, took it to its shop where it was supposed to, but did not, work on it and thereafter returned it to the drilling rig where it broke because of defective servicing by the Assured. More than that, we could hold that the trial Judge was correct in concluding that such allegations affirma-lively revealed a temporary custody of the drill collar by the Assured and a surrender of that custody back to the Drilling Company after the repair work had been, or was thought to have been, performed by the Assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">But the Supreme Court of Texas did not stop there. In articulating this standard for determining the duty to defend, Justice Hamilton distinguishes the liabilities under Part I Coverage and Part II Defense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With respect to payment of the claim, Part I Coverage A (see note 3, supra), the Court pointed out the \u201cinsurer does not pay because [the assured] is <em>alleged </em>to be legally responsible but because [the assured] has been <em>adjudicated </em>to be legally responsible.\u201d 387 S.W.2d at 25. (Emphasis supplied). The Court highlights the contrast when it goes on to state: \u201cThe coverage in Paragraph II is entirely different from the coverage in Paragraph I. No legal determination of ultimate liability is required before the insurer becomes obligated to defend the suit. That paragraph has reference to a suit seeking to recover damages that are covered in Paragraph I. * * * The coverage in Paragraph II does not depend on what the facts are or what might finally be determined to be the facts. It depends only on what the facts are alleged to be. To put it simply, Paragraph I protects all [assureds] from payment of damages they may be found legally obligated to pay under Paragraph I. Paragraph II protects the same parties against the expense of any suit seeking damages under Paragraph I.\u201d 387 S.W.2d at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Although the parties seem not to have sensed its importance in the post argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>ment materials including information on the Heyden opinion, we regard this distinction of vital importance in assaying the correctness of the declaratory judgment entered by the Federal District Judge. For here the Insurer sought and the Court entered a declaration holding that it had no obligation to defend or to pay any judgment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">As the Supreme Court of Texas so plainly points out, there may be an obligation to defend where finally it turns out on the merits there is no obligation to pay because the facts turn out to be something other than alleged.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The contrary is just as apt to happen. The trial of a case may establish a legal liability which is clearly within the coverage of the policy and as to which the insurer has assumed a broad undertaking comparable to that in Part I here (see note 3, supra). The obligation to pay such claim would, of course, depend on whether other provisions of the policy, such as notice of suit, cooperation, and the like had been complied with. And it is also quite possible- \u2014 -especially in a case in which a declaration is sought and obtained that there is no duty to defend because of the peculiar allegations of the damage complaint \u2014 that in the damage suit there would have to be a clear fact finding by the trier of the fact, Judge<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or jury<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> showing precisely an adjudication of facts bringing the claim within the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">If this is an anomaly, it is hardly one of which the insurer can complain. After all it is the insurer\u2019s policy drafted wholly by it and intended to furnish broad and needed coverage to businessmen. And perhaps more important\u2014 certainly in the context of this case \u2014 it is this Insurer\u2019s choice to defend, as it did for awhile, or to stand aloof as it is now doing while it seeks an adjudication of its duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">Obviously there are some risks in either course. If, for example, this Insurer stands on its reservation agreement (note 10, supra), it can continue the defense. Subject to the restraints of honorable dealing, impeccable fairness to its own Assured (the nominal defendant) and the avoidance of self-serving actions which conflict with the interests of its Assured,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> it may carry on a vigorous defense of its Assured to establish the true facts, hoping that the chips will fall to exonerate the Assured and hence the Insurer, and if not, then to exonerate the Insurer through the nature of the liability precisely adjudged against the Assured. On the other hand, the Insurer might do as it is now doing \u2014 stand aloof with or without a declaration of no duty to defend \u2014 and await the outcome of the damage suit hoping naturally that private counsel retained by the Assured will win outright or if not, the unsuccessful defense will delineate facts keeping the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>judgment from being within the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">But if these risks exist, they are agaiq the creature of the one who prescribed the contract and then sold its benefits to one in apparent need.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Occasionally, of course, declaratory judgment in the State or Federal Court may solve the riddle. But wonderful as is that device, there are limitations on its use by Federal Courts lest we engage in interesting, but academic, declarations about things that may never be. Byers v. Byers, 5 Cir., 1958, 254 F.2d 205, 209; American Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. v. Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 453, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">That is certainly the case here. Technically, of course, w\u00e9 might hold that the trial Court\u2019s declaration of non-liability for any judgment to be entered was tied into the case as framed by the present State Court petition to which the Federal Court could alone look in determining duty to defend. But there are too many variables to allow the Federal Court to adjudge ultimate liabilities on that basis. Not the least of these is the necessity of the Federal Court assuming that under the present petition and State Court procedure, <em>no </em>state of facts could be proved which would (a) impose liability on the Assured and (b) simultaneously come within Part I Coverage A.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But we have enough difficulty divining just what limitation is now afforded by pleadings in Federal Trial Courts<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> without speculating on State practice. More than that, there is always the possibility of the damage suit plaintiff filing amended pleadings,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the only intrinsic restriction being the problem of relation back to avoid the statute of limitations <footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and giving such notice to the insurer as required by the policy in the light of a refusal to defend.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">Putting the question of State Court pleadings to one side, the record certainly did not permit a determination as a matter of law that under no possible state of facts could a claim within Part I Coverage A be made out. As to this, the essential ingredient of summary judgment \u2014 no genuine issue as to a material fact \u2014 was lacking. F.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">Nor, on remand, do we think it appropriate for the Federal Court to hear this part of the claim in advance of the State Court trial. Of course, many cases can be supposed where disposing of duty to defend permits like determination of judgment liability.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> But here it is quite possible that the Assured may be held liable. Whether insurance is available depends on the nature of any such imposed liability. To determine that, means a full trial of the damage claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">A moment\u2019s reflection will demonstrate that the trial of the merits of the underlying damage claim should be held in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>State Court, not in the Federal Court as a prelude to negative potential liability. There is, first, the need for husbanding precious judicial time \u2014 a factor having a strong hold on the Federal Judge in exercising the inherent discretion in granting declaratory relief. Two trials are not needed where one would do. More important, Part I obligation to pay the judgment depends on liability being imposed by law. If the Federal Court were to conduct what amounts to a full dress trial<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> on the liability phases of the damage claim, it might, or might be required to, conclude that no claim within the coverage was made out, and on that enter a declaration of (a) no duty to defend and (b) no obligation to pay.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> And yet, in a subsequent trial of the damage suit in the State Court, a jury right find precise facts, the legal effect of which would be to (a) cast the Assured for liability and (b) bring the occurrence within Part I coverage. But at that stage, of course, with the earlier Federal Court declaration the Assured would be without insurance and res judicata would cut off forever the opportunity to demand compliance by the Insurer of its policy promise to \u201cpay * * * all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay\u201d (note 3, supra).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">And, finally, in the light of this particular record, we think that while it was permissible to make the declaration of no duty to defend the suit as disclosed by the original damage petition, no purpose is served by the Federal Court attempting to declare whether there is a Part II duty to defend as successive amended petitions are filed. There is, for example, a strong suggestion in this record that the drill collar was never picked up by the Assured at all. If that is judicially determined, it might mean no liability by the Assured whatsoever. On the other hand, with concepts broadening as they are in Texas,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> we cannot rule out the possibility of a judgment being rendered on a theory akin to products liability for failure to pick up and repair after a promise to do so under circumstances which would lead the Drilling Contractor\u2019s employees to assume that the service work had been done by the Assured. On that state of legal-fact, the question would then arise whether that would be a \u201ccompleted operation\u201d as defined in \u201cProducts Hazard\u201d (note 9, supra). Without deciding that, or even intimating what we might hold, some comments are appropriate. Viewed as a physical fact, operations never commenced at all could hardly be \u201ccompleted.\u201d Nor could they be regarded as \u201cimproperly or defectively performed\u201d if never performed at all. Similarly, it is odd to describe this as operations which \u201chave been * * * abandoned.\u201d On the other hand, a strong argument could be made that in the light of the entire policy and the exclusionary definitions such asserted liability arises subsequent to the time activities either were, or should have been, carried on and consequently are hot within the coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>Whether answering that question would be difficult or not, it is an answer that ought not to be made with the imprimatur of law until such time as it is reasonably certain that the precise issue is presented. Obviously, we ought not to express opinions which may turn out to be academic only relating to situations that never will be. American Fid. &amp; Cas. Co. v. Pennsylvania Threshermen &amp; Farmers\u2019 Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1960, 280 F.2d 453; Corsican Prods. v.

It provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">\u201cThat the Company, or any of its representatives or attorneys may proceed to investigate the cause or circumstances under which an accident is alleged to have occurred at or near Per-ryton in the State of Texas on or about the 22nd day of January, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">\u201cThat the Company, its representatives or attorneys aforesaid may investigate any and all things affecting their rights, directly or indirectly, present or remote, in connection with their Policy No. CGL 095743 issued to G &amp; G Machine Works, et al of Borger, Texas, effective from the 3rd day of March, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">\u201cThat in consideration of the trouble and expense in so doing, the Company, its representatives, agents, adjusters or attorneys may investigate, prepare for defense or actually defend me or us, without prejudice to the Company under the above policy, and still reserving unto the said Company all its rights and defenses under said policy of insurance as fully and completely as if the said Company had refused to take any steps whatever in the investigation and/or defense as above set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">\u201cAll of the acts of all parties with respect to the matter herein referred to shall be deemed to be voluntary and to be done pursuant to the agreement herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">\u201cThe intent and purpose of this agreement is to permit an impartial and full investigation and/or defense of all matters relating to said accident and the liability, if any, of the said Aetna Insurance Company, without incurring any admission of liability, and to preserve without estoppel, waiver, or forfeiture of any of the rights to any of the parties hereto. It is expressly understood, however, that I or we do not waive or release any rights that I or we might have under the said policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b968-14\">. The prayer sought a \u201cdeclaratory judgment declaring the rights, liability and status of the parties hereto, and declaring that [the Insurer] has no obligation to defend [the Assured] in said Cause No. 11205 * * *; and, further, that [Insurer] has no obligation to pay or discharge any judgments or any portion thereof which may be rendered in favor of said Bill Lee Schafer in the above described and numbered cause.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b969-6\">. The Cooper case involved a Manufacturer\u2019s and Contractor\u2019s Scheduled Liability Policy. Hazards which could be insured were (1) Premises \u2014 Operations, (2) Elevators, (3) Independent Contractors, (4) Products, and (5) Contractual. Coverage A, however, was restricted to injuries or death \u201ccaused by accident and arising out of the \u2018hazards\u2019 defined\u201d in contrast to unrestricted coverage here. See note 3, supra. The hazard \u201cPremises \u2014Operations\u201d was defined as \u201cThe ownership, maintenance or use of the premises, and all operations which are necessary or incidental thereto,\u201d whereas \u201cPremises \u2014 Operations\u201d as such is nowhere defined in the instant policy. In Cooper coverage for accidents occurring after operations had \u201cbeen completed or abandoned at the place of occurrence thereof and away from the premises owned, rented, or controlled by the Insured\u201d was defined under \u201cProducts\u201d liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Without intimating that the instant policy is no broader, we have pointed out earlier, see notes 5, 6 and 7 and accompanying text, supra, that the instant policy is structured to insure hazards specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b969-11\">.

It is not as bad as some make out.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">\u201cEasy living, easy virtue, and easy pleading all have the nervous energy of youth, live in the moment, are streamlined for speed, give little thought to where they are going, do not worry about balancing the budget, are intolerant of restrictions, and hope for a Santa Clause to help them out of trouble while they are pursuing the rainbow. Instead of putting poor pleaders on relief, and bringing the pleading task to their level, it is suggested we give more attention to the character building qualities of work and discipline.\u201d McCaskill, Easy Pleading, 35 Ill.L.Rev. 28, 40 (1940), in Hill, The Erie Doctrine and the Constitution, 55 N.W.L.Rev. 427, 577, n. 275.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b970-12\">.

Absent consent of all parties, jury submission in Texas must be by special issues only. As a result of literally thousands of appellate decisions on this fruitful subject matter, a highly refined, complex, and some think unrealistic, system exists requiring submission of minute separate, independent fact or legal-fact questions to the jury. See, e. g., Tex.R. Civ.P. 277, 279; Hodges, Special Issue Submission in Texas (1958). Some who have worked under both systems consider F.R.Civ.P. 49(a) which blends a general charge with special interrogatories an improvement. See Tugwell v. A. F. Klaveness &amp; Co., 5 Cir., 1963, 320 F.2d 866, 868 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b971-16\">.

Although it might first appear that refusal to defend would make further notice superfluous and therefore not required, cf. United Services Auto Ass\u2019n v. Russom, 5 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 296, 301; National Surety Corp. v. Wells, 5 Cir., 1961, 287 F.2d 102, a Court might well hold that successive notice was required. The assured, as well as - the insurer, must take cognizance of distinct Part I and II liabilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b972-18\">. E.g., scope of employment of an alleged corporate servant, permission to use the vehicle, nonpayment of premium, cancellation of policy, breach of policy requirement of notice of occurrence, claim, suit, cooperation, status of claimant or vacarious assured under employee or cross employee exclusion, and the like.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b973-6\">. The Assured sought, but the Federal Court denied, a motion for production of the investigative file in the hands of trial counsel appointed by the Insurer and ostensibly defending the Assured under reservation of rights in the State Court. As this has no significance in our disposition, we make no holding on the point. If Part I liability is inquired into, obviously the Assured is entitled to this information. See Steel Erection Co. v. Travelers Indem. Co., Tex.Civ.App., 1965, 392 S.W.2d 713. Cf. Chitty v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., E.D.S.C., 1964, 36 F.R.D. 37, 40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b973-8\">. Although the State Court plaintiff is now an intervenor in the Federal Court declaratory suit, it is not likely that the Federal trial Judge, exercising the discretion inherent in declaratory relief, would deprive the damage plaintiff of his choice of the State Forum for the trial of his case vis-a-vis the Assured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b973-11\">. In Burton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 317, 325, we required affirmative declaratory relief to avoid whipsawing the assured between Federal Court declarations of nonliability which were res judicata and outstanding State Court judgments imposing liability for a claim within the policy coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b973-12\">.
