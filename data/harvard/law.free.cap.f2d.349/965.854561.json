That opinion assumed, without deciding, that appellant\u2019s statement to the police after arrest was inadmissible in the Government\u2019s case in chief. But we held that statement admissible on Government rebuttal to impeach appellant\u2019s self-defense claim for the reasons that (1) appellant \u201cmade the first reference to his statement\u201d in his testimony, and (2) \u201cdefense counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s subsequent use of that statement * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-26\">Appellant now asserts, and we agree, that these reasons do not survive a closer reading of the record. The statement was first mentioned in the presence of the jury during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>examination of appellant, in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-5\">Q. I asked you, Mr. Defendant, that as soon as you had settled down enough after this excitement of the police officers coming in with their drawn guns that you could think, you told the police then all about this, that you told us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-6\">A. I didn\u2019t tell the police anything right then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">Q. I didn\u2019t say right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-8\">I said you told this to the police, didn\u2019t you, about his coming at you with his hand in his pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-9\">A. I don\u2019t know whether I told the police that or what I told the police at the time. I made a statement at headquarters, if that is what you mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-10\">Q. Fine. I am glad you mentioned that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">The prosecutor then asked, \u201cIn that statement to the police at headquarters, which you have just mentioned, did you tell them about this man advancing on you with his hand in his pocket?\u201d Appellant answered that he did not remember. At the prosecutor\u2019s request, the court instructed appellant to read the statement to himself to refresh his memory. The question was then repeated, and appellant answered, \u201cI don\u2019t see it in the statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">Our previous opinion found that appellant\u2019s testimony, \u201cI made a statement at headquarters, if that is what you mean\u201d justified the prosecutor\u2019s introduction of the statement to counter the \u201clikely inference \u2014 an erroneous one\u2014 * * * [that the statement] did contain a complete account of his version of the shooting.\u201d But it is evident from the record that the prosecutor purposely elicited from appellant this reference to his statement, since the trial court had earlier ruled, over defense counsel\u2019s objections, that the statement could be used for impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\"> Another incident in appellant\u2019s testimony is now urged by our dissenting brother as grounds for affirmance. Appellant testified on direct examination that, at his arrest, \u201cI asked the officer could I explain to them what happened. They made me sit down in the chair and told me not to say anything.\u201d The dissent construes this testimony as an attempt by appellant \u201cto leave with the jury the inference that he would have given the police a contemporaneous version of what had happened if they had let him do so\u201d and the further inference that such statement would have supported his self-defense claim. In some circumstances, otherwise inadmissible evidence may be used to contradict a defendant\u2019s \u201caffirmative resort to perjurious testimony.\u201d Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 65, 74 S.Ct. 354, 356, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954). But <em>Walder </em>does not authorize the use of inadmissible evidence to contradict such remote inferences as our dissenting brother finds here. Moreover, the Government did impeach this inference through the testimony of two arresting officers that appellant had spoken freely when arrested and had made no claim of self defense. Thus, unlike <em>Walder, </em>the inadmissibility of appellant\u2019s statement did not \u2018\u2018provide him [self] with a shield against contradiction of his untruths\u201d and he could not rely \u201con the Government\u2019s disability to challenge his credibility\u201d on this point. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">The fact that appellant\u2019s statement might impeach his defense more effectively than the police testimony is no justification for admitting it. A defendant \u201cmust be free to deny all the elements of the ease against him without thereby giving leave to the Government to introduce by way of rebuttal evidence illegally secured by it, and therefore not available for its case in chief.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Inadmissible \u201cevidence is not rendered admissible merely because the defendant testifies in his own behalf.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>\u201c \u2018sweeping claims\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> going far beyond the crime charged\u201d nor was the impeaching use of the statement restricted \u201cto \u2018lawful proper acts\u2019 which are purely \u2018collateral matters\u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the issues at bar.\u201d Rather, the use of the statement here \u201cbore on the central issue\u201d of the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant admitted the shooting, but claimed he acted in self-defense. The Government used appellant\u2019s statement directly to contradict his only defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cTo permit the Government to introduce illegally obtained statements which bear directly on a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence in the name of \u2018impeachment\u2019 would seriously jeopardize the important substantive policies and functions underlying the established exclusionary rules.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We vacate our previous affirmance and remand the record for determination of the circumstances in which appellant\u2019s statement was obtained by the police. If that determination reveals that the statement was inadmissible for the Government\u2019s case in chief, the conviction is reversed for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">.

Johnson &amp; Stewart v. United States <em>supra </em>note 2, 344 F.2d at p. 166.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1014-5\">McGOWAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A7Q\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The petition for rehearing pending complains primarily of our reliance upon Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P., in our earlier disposition of this appeal. It is urged that appellant\u2019s counsel, at the time appellant\u2019s statement to the police was used to refresh his recollection, was not required to articulate a fresh objection but was, rather, entitled to rely upon an earlier indication of a purpose to object, made in a bench colloquy when appellant first took the stand. Although the transcript continues to show this purpose as having been, to say the least, equivocally pursued, I would not be disposed, in view of the seriousness of the crime charged and the sentence imposed, to reject appellant\u2019s reading of the record. Accordingly, I think it would be appropriate to amend our opinion in the following respects for the purpose of making clear that an affirmance of this conviction need not rest upon an assumed absence of objection at the trial to the use of the statement now urged as error on appeal;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-14\">1. In the last paragraph of Part I, two sentences (\u201cApart from considerations stemming from Mallory, augmented by <em>Walder, </em>we would have no difficulty in finding the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination proper. There was no objection based on these considerations,3 and since the defendant made the first reference to his statement, we cannot say that this cross-examination was plain error under Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P., if it was error at all.\u201d) are deleted; and there is substituted therefor \u2014 \u201cWhat we hold is that, on the facts of this record, the court did not allow cross-examination to exceed proper limits.3 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-15\">2. The following paragraph is added , to Footnote 3:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-16\">There was, however, a colloquy at the bench at the time appellant took the stand and before he told his story. At that time defense counsel indicated a purpose to object to any subsequent use of the statement. This colloquy terminated somewhat inconclusively for the reason that the prosecutor, under the urging of the court, said that he did not intend to use the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>unless he felt compelled to do so by the nature of appellant\u2019s testimony. Because, however, defense counsel may have thought that his earlier expressions in the bench conference served as continuing objections, we are prepared to assume that the matter was adequately called to the court\u2019s attention within the meaning of Rule 52 (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">It is also urged in the petition for rehearing that our holding was erroneous because it referred to the circumstance that the first reference to the existence of the written statement came from appellant himself, and the appellant was thereby taken to have opened up the subject for impeachment purposes. There is not, as there could not be, any claim that the jury did not first hear of the statement from the lips of appellant, but it is said that we should not have taken this to be an opening up inasmuch as appellant was craftily maneuvered by the prosecutor into making this first reference. The short answer to all this is that affirmance does not turn upon the fact that it was the appellant who initially spoke of the statement. A close look at the unfolding of the record in this case will show what I mean in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Reference has already been made to the bench colloquy when appellant first took the stand, which ended with an expression of willingness by the prosecutor to defer to the court\u2019s wishes and not to use the statement at all unless compelled to by something in the forthcoming testimony. Appellant then gave his version of the shooting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He then told how the policemen who arrived at the scene would not let him tell what had just happened.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The moment direct examination was finished, the prosecutor asked to approach the bench, and there said as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-10\">(At The Bench:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApMk\">Me. Titus : Your Honor, does the Court have the statement? Your Honor, may I refer the Court respectfully to page 2, the first paragraph on page 2 of this statement? The paragraph that I am referring to, Your Honor, which I will not say because the jury may hear it, as Your Honor can see, is directly and totally contradictory to the testimony that he has just given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-12\">I submit, Your Honor, that this has nothing to do with the elements of the offense. It has to do with the defense that he has asserted in this case, not the elements of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-13\">The first two sentences of that paragraph, Your Honor, are most directly contradictory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">The court said it would think about the matter during the noon hour. After the noon recess, the judge addressed himself to the prosecutor\u2019s request to use the statement in cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-15\">Now, as to the two sentences, Mr. Titus, I assume that you have indicated you are going to stop at the word laughed. I kicked the door open and he \u2014 Kelly Miller Griffin\u2014 was standing there. I raised the gun and I fired. He stood there and looked at me and laughed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-16\">Me. Titus : That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1015-17\">TheCoubt: One of the difficulties is that the two sentences are sort of taken out of context, out of the whole statement and this is what bothers me about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>I think I should not permit you to ask about those two sentences, but I would think it would be proper in this connection, as long as you made this proffer, <em>in view of the defendant\u2019s testimony on his theory of self-defense, </em>to ask the defendant whether he made any statement about threats or having his hands in his pockets, approaching that closet door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-4\">I would confine it to that one question if you wish to ask it, and permit that to be asked. In the event that he admits that he didn\u2019t say anything about that in the conversation with the police, that would end it, of course. In the event that he denies it, then I think this statement could be shown to him, not for him to read aloud, but to read to himself those portions to see if it would refresh his memory \u2014 read the whole statement, rather, to see if it would refresh his memory. Rather, in case he said he did make a statement, that is what I am trying to say\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-5\">Mr. Titus: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-6\">The Court: About it in his conversation, then I would permit him to read to himself the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1016-7\">Mr. Titus : Very well, Your Hon- or. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">Throughout all this defense counsel was silent, and remained so even as the court made its ruling. Thus, as the cross-examination began, the prosecutor and defense counsel knew that the court had specified exactly what use could be made of the statement. That ruling did not depend upon appellant\u2019s being the first to refer to the statement. It was conditioned, rather, only upon the character of appellant\u2019s response to a question to be asked as to whether appellant had ever made a statement to the police about the threatening move towards him by the dec\u00e9dent. A question of this nature by the prosecutor on cross-exami\u00f1ation was clearly proper. When appellant indicated that he had made a statement to the police, he was asked if it made reference to these circumstances. When he said he did not remember, he was handed the statement solely to refresh his recollection. This was all squarely within the scope of the court\u2019s earlier ruling as to what it would permit. And I do not think that that ruling was a reversibly arbitrary enlargement of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">When the court made its ruling, this was the situation: Appellant had testified to the effect that the decedent was physically threatening him when the fatal shot was fired; and that he had tried to tell his story to the police who came to the scene, who refused to hear it. The officers in question testified to quite a different version of this confrontation, and one which was wholly inconsistent with any refusal by them to permit appellant to tell them what had happened. It is naive to think that the point of appellant\u2019s testimony was not to leave with the jury the inference that he would have given the police a contemporaneous version of what had happened if they had let him do so. The fact was that such a version had been given to the police in writing at the station shortly thereafter. It made no reference to the threats. The prosecutor in effect sought leave to cast doubt upon the credibility of appellant's testimony that he had been denied an opportunity to speak, and thereby to combat the inference which appellant had affirmatively imported into the case by testimony in conflict with that of the police. That leave was granted by the court under carefully limited conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">A defendant is, of course, free to deny all the elements of the crime charged without being contradicted by statements illegally obtained from him, but, as <em>Waider </em>contemplates, this freedom does not extend to taking a misleading advantage of the prosecution\u2019s normal inability to make any use of such statements, at least in respect of matters bearing upon the credibility of testimony other than a direct denial of guilt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>the whole record before us, I do not believe that the highly restricted use of appellant\u2019s statement permitted by the trial court was an abuse of his discretion in the conduct of the trial resulting in such unfairness to appellant as to require any affirmative response to the petition for rehearing other than that contemplated hereinabove.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">. A I had just got to the door, just about to the frame. He was approaching his door. And I told him to stop and he wouldn\u2019t stop, he kept coming. That\u2019s when I brought the gun up and shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">Q And will you describe him as he was approaching, what he was doing, if anything?</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">A Well he had his hands in his pocket as if he had something in it. I didn\u2019t know what he had. I wasn\u2019t going to ask him if he was going to hurt me. I know he had carried a knife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-19\">. A They asked me where was the shooting. I told them it was upstairs. So they ' got me in-between them and carried me upstairs. I asked the officer could I explain to them what happened. They made me sit down in the chair and told me not to say anything.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">. Appellant\u2019s testimony might well have led the jury to conclude, erroneously, that his statement to the police actually corroborated the account he had just given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>in open court. The prosecutor\u2019s limited use of that statement was intended to do no more than correct that impression. In effect, it merely deprived appellant of a piece of evidence whose contents had been misrepresented to the jury, and thereby, of course, weakened the credibility of his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-17\">The test under Walder is not whether the Government\u2019s use of the illegally obtained evidence makes it more difficult for the defendant to convince the jury of his defense. Presumably it would not be used if it were not calculated to have just that effect, and to this extent its use may impair the defendant\u2019s ability successfully to deny all the elements of the charge against him. Walder was a prosecution for four illicit transactions in narcotics. After the defendant had testified that he had never sold, possessed, received or transferred narcotics in his life, the prosecutor was permitted to ask the defendant if narcotics had not been illegally seized from his home prior to an earlier prosecution, and, when the defendant denied that they had, to introduce independent evidence of that fact. It would not seem an unreasonable speculation to suppose that this disclosure somewhat undermined the credibility of the defendant\u2019s claim that he had not possessed or sold narcotics on the occasions in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
