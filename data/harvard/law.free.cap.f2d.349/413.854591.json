He sought a writ of error comm <em>nobis </em>in the state courts and, after exhausting his remedies there, petitioned for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York where Judge Cannella denied his petition without a hearing, but granted a certificate of probable cause (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253) and assigned counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">White\u2019s sole contention, advanced in conclusory terms, is that the count to which he pleaded guilty, being then represented by counsel, and two other related counts were not found by the Grand Jury but were typed on the indictment by some member of the District Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">The record is barren of any suggestion of a factual basis for White\u2019s claim. Consequently the district court properly denied the petition without holding a hearing. United States ex rel. Marinaccio v. Fay, 336 F.2d 272 (2 Cir.1964); United States ex rel. Homchak v. People, 323 F.2d 449 (2 Cir.1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 919, 84 S.Ct. 677, 11 L.Ed.2d 615 (1964); United States ex rel. Vaughn v. LaVallee, 318 F.2d 499 (2 Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
