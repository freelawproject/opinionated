The consequence is that there are a number of factual situations in the Norfolk school case which are very hazy to us and, in light of our very recent further enunciation of those principles which seem to us controlling, the answer here is uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">The appropriate course seems to be a remand of the case to the District Court for its further consideration in light of the more recent decisions in this and other courts. In that connection, if the issue is presented after further definition of the factual situation, the Court is directed to consider the appropriateness and the legal propriety of a mixture of freedom of choice in certain zones where the plaintiffs claim the population is residentially mixed as to races and the denial of that same freedom of choice in other zones which the plaintiffs allege contain racially homogeneous populations. The Court should also consider the propriety of superimposing the \u201cat large\u201d characteristics of the Booker T. Washington enrollment over the entire system while the other high schools serve separate geographical zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-10\">.
