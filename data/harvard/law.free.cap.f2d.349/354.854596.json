Thomas told Sanchez that he wanted to purchase some cocaine, to which Sanchez replied that he did not have any at that time but that he could probably get some at a later date. However, when Sanchez made an estimate of what the price would be, Thomas asked if he could buy some marijuana. After some dickering over the price, the appellant agreed to sell Thomas a pound of marijuana for $140. The same parties met later that night at the corner of 140th Street and Broadway, and Thomas paid the agreed sum to Sanchez and the appellant delivered the pound of marijuana to the agent, Thomas.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">The indictment in the instant case was returned on February 17, 1964. On February 26, Agent Thomas saw Sanchez uptown, and asked if appellant could get him any more \u201cpot.\u201d Sanchez replied that he could not be of any help, as he had lost his connection. He was then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">Shortly thereafter, appellant was brought to the United States Courthouse at Foley Square where he was questioned by an Assistant United States Attorney. Thomas served as interpreter for Sanchez, who does not speak or understand English and who was not represented by counsel at this interrogation where he made several damaging admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">The prosecution\u2019s case at the trial was based on the testimony of the two agents. Sanchez testified in his own behalf and denied participating in the acts to which the agents had testified. He claimed that he had never seen Thomas before the night of the arrest and denied ever having participated in any narcotics transaction. On direct examination he testified in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">\u201cQ. Now, I want you in your own words to tell me, if you ever saw Agent Thomas on or about October 31, 1963? A. I never saw him before. I only saw him when he caught me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-19\">Q. And when did he arrest you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-20\">A. February 25th. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>On cross-examination by Assistant U. S. Attorney Samuels, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">\u201cQ. Did you ever see Agent Thomas [in the Chesterfield Bar] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">A. I never saw Agent Thomas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">Q. Do you recall being asked certain questions and giving certain answers to me when you were brought over here after you were arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">A. Yes I answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">Q. Do you recall this question and this answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">Mr. Krieger: If your Honor please, with respect to the question and answer I will insist upon a voir dire as to the facts and circumstances surrounding that particular incident of law enforcement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">Mr. Samuels: Your Honor, I think that the government is not offering it in evidence. I am just asking whether he recalls a question and whether he recalls an answer. Now, I think that he can answer yes or no, either he recalls it or he doesn\u2019t recall it, and I don\u2019t think for this purpose that a voir dire is necessary. I don\u2019t think there is any case that so holds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">The Court: I will take it just the same. I will permit it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">Q. Do you recall being asked certain questions and this answer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-13\">\u2018Q. W aere did you see Agent Thomas before ? A. I saw him at 136th, 137th and Broadway.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">A. No, sir, I didn\u2019t say that. I told you I never saw him before and if I saw him I don\u2019t know, because I never spoke to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-15\">Q. And do you recall after \u2014 well do you recall this question:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-16\">\u2018Quando\u2019 [sic] \u2014 that is the question it was asked in Spanish, when \u2014 \u2018Quando\u2019 [sic] and your answer \u2018Two months ago\u2019 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-17\">A. I say when they caught me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-18\">Appellant seeks to set aside his conviction on the ground that he was prejudiced by the reading into the record of the inculpatory statements made by him while he was without the benefit of the guiding hand of counsel after he had been indicted and arrested. Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964); Fahy v. State of Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963). For purposes of this appeal, the Government concedes that the interrogation at which the statements were obtained was in derogation of appellant\u2019s right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-19\">In United States v. Guerra, 334 F.2d 138, 145 (2d Cir.), cert. denied 379 U.S. 936, 85 S.Ct. 337, 13 L.Ed.2d 346 (1964), this court construed Massiah to hold that the reversal is required under these circumstances only where the illegally obtained statements have been put to an \u201cincriminating use\u201d against the defendant. There can be no doubt that an admission by Sanchez that he had seen Thomas prior to the arrest in the vicinity where the crime was alleged to have taken place would be highly incriminating. It would flatly contradict the key prop to appellant\u2019s defense of mistaken identity, namely his testimonial assertion that he had never seen the agent, to whom he stood accused of selling marijuana, prior to the night of the arrest. The question presented, therefore, is whether the statements were \u201cused\u201d against Sanchez so as to require reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-20\">As Sanchez had testified on direct examination that he never saw Thomas before the night of the arrest, the Government attempted to attack his credibility by showing that on a prior occasion he had made statements inconsistent with that testimony. The Supreme Court has stated that there must be limits on the use of unconstitutionally obtained evidence for purposes of impeachment. Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954); and see Tate v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 283 F.2d 377, 382 (1960) (Con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>currenee). We need not, however, decide whether those limits have been reached in this case, for we feel that no eviden-tiary use was made of the illegally obtained admission. Cf. Johnson v. United States, 344 F.2d 163 (D.C.Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Over objection, the trial court permitted the prosecution to inquire whether Sanchez recalled being asked certain questions and giving certain answers when he was interrogated at the Courthouse following his arrest. Those questions and answers were read into the record. Sanchez flatly denied making any such statements and asserted he had then said exactly the same thing he testified to on direct examination. The prosecution thereupon dropped the matter and made no effort to prove the making of the alleged statement. Consequently the record contained no evidence which contradicted Sanchez\u2019s statement on direct examination. The attempted impeachment was thus abortive. See McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 37 at 68 (1954). In the face of Sanchez\u2019s denial, it cannot be presumed that the able trial judge treated the prosecution\u2019s foundation question as proof of the matter contained therein. We are confident of the ability of a trial judge to distinguish questions from evidence and, absent a contrary indication from the record, we are satisfied that the incident in no way contributed to the judgment of conviction. See United States v. Reeves, 348 F.2d 469 (2d Cir. June 28, 1965); In re Bonanno, 344 F.2d 830 (2d Cir. April 30, 1965); United States v. Cimino, 321 F.2d 509, 511-512 (2d Cir. 1963), cert. denied, D\u2019Ercole v. United States, 375 U.S. 967, 974, 84 S. Ct. 486, 11 L.Ed.2d 416 (1964); Teate v. United States, 297 F.2d 120, 121-122 (5th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">It is most unlikely, however, that we would take the same position if this case were tried before a jury or if we believed the attempt at impeachment was purposefully truncated, solely devised as a means of having the purported admissions, imbedded in the loaded questions, reach the trier-of-fact. Cf. United States v. Robbins, 340 F.2d 684, 689 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"Afm\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
