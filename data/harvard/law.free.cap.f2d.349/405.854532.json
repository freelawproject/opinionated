After having served such sentence and when he was not in custody thereunder, but was in fact in custody in the Kansas State Penitentiary, he filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate such two-year Federal sentence. From an order denying the motion, he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-27\">A motion to vacate a sentence under \u00a7 2255, supra, will not lie unless the movant is in custody under such sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-28\"> In a proper case, the court to which the motion is addressed may regard it as a petition for a writ in the nature of coram nobis. United States v. Capsopa, 2 Cir., 260 F.2d 566; Lopez v. United States, 9 Cir., 217 F.2d 526. See also: Williams v. United States, 10 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>267 F.2d 559, 560, c.d. 361 U.S. 867, 80 S.Ct. 128, 4 L.Ed.2d 106; United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248. Here, however, on the record before us, it is clear that the attack on the validity of the sentence was groundless and the court did not err in failing to treat the motion as a petition for a writ in the nature of coram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Accordingly, the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
