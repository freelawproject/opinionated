(\u201cEmployer\u201d) for a declaration of its rights under the collective bargaining agreement between them and to compel arbitration. Jurisdiction is founded upon Section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-20\">The facts are not in dispute. Union was, at the times relevant here, an industrial labor organization duly designated as the collective bargaining agent of certain employees of Employer. Union and Employer entered into a collective bargaining agreement as of January 6, 1961, effective until January 5, 1964. On January 10, 1962, Employer filled a vacant position (plant maintenance hand) by promoting one Finch. Union claimed that one Cobb was entitled to the position because his qualifications were substantially equal to those of Finch, and he had greater seniority. The controversy not being otherwise resolved, Union demanded arbitration and set forth the matter in dispute with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>spect to which it sought arbitration as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">\u201cThe Union charges that the Company failed to fulfill its commitment contained in Article 14, Section 14.02 in failing to promote employee Cobb to the position of plant maintenance hand, where Cobb and employee Finch had substantially equal qualifications, but Cobb had greater seniority. The Union demands that Cobb be promoted to the job of plant maintenance hand and be awarded back pay retroactive to January 10, 1962, the date when the promotion was effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Employer would not proceed to arbitration on the issue thus stated; hence, this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In the court below, Union asserted that it had stated an issue which on its face was subject to be arbitrated under Section 14.02 of Article 14 and Article 17 of the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Employer contended that Union failed to specify the contract commitment in Section 14.02 which could be deemed unfulfilled under the factual allegations presented and that the subject matter of the demand was outside the scope of the \u201cuniquely restricted\u201d arbitration provisions of Article 17. It further offered to prove the meaning of the agreement if the district court believed the contract was ambiguous, by adducing evidence of the negotiations respecting arbitrability of promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The district court concluded that the issue presented by Union sufficiently informed Employer of the subject matter sought to be arbitrated and that on its face the claim to arbitration was within the arbitration provisions of the agreement. It rejected the offer of proof of Employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">We agree with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">In substance, Employer asserts that no \u201ccommitment\u201d under Section 14.02 is involved because that Section recites that seniority shall be determinative \u201cwhen two or more employees have in the opinion of Laboratories [Employer] substantially equal qualifications for the job to be filled.\u201d Accordingly, it says, unfettered discretion to determine whether qualifications are \u201csubstantially equal\u201d is reserved to management. It concludes that the substance of the dispute is promotion, and therefore the grievance should be classified either as involving unfair treatment of, or discrimination against, an employee (Section 16.01(3)), or as involving conditions of employment (Section 16.01(2)), neither of which is a subject of required arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Notwithstanding the assertion of Employer that the arbitration clause of the agreement is \u201cuniquely restricted\u201d, it does provide for the arbitration of \u201cdifferences arising with respect to the <em>interpretation </em>of this Agreement <em>or </em>regarding a charge that a <em>commitment </em>herein contained has not been fulfilled\u201d (emphasis supplied). Article 17, Section 17.01, Appendix, infra. While Employer professes that Union points to no unfulfilled \u201ccommitment\u201d under Section 14.02, it relies upon its contention that in the context of the factual situation the agreement gave to management unfettered authority to decide what were \u201csubstantially equal qualifications.\u201d Whether this is so involves, in our opinion, as in the district court\u2019s opinion, an issue of interpretation of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">We adhere to our decisions in Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 3 Cir., 283 F.2d 93 (1960) and General Warehousemen and Employees Union No. 636 v. American Hardware Supply Co., 3 Cir., 329 F.2d 789 (1964), cert. den. 379 U.S. 829, 85 S.Ct. 57, 13 L.Ed.2d 37. They bespeak our view of the law settled in United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1363, 4 L.Ed.2d 1432 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>(1960); United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960); and United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593 (1960). They are consistent with John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 84 S.Ct. 909, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964). These cases stand for the proposition that when the issue presented is, on its face, within the contractual agreement to arbitrate, the court shall not interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Employer relies upon Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co. v. Communications Workers of America, 310 F.2d 244 (9 Cir. 1962), in support of its offer of proof. We need not decide whether the theory of that case is supportable, for it is distinguishable: there, the court was faced with what it considered an omission of expression in the contract. Here, the contract to arbitrate specifically includes differences with respect to interpretation of the agreement as well as violations of contractual commitments.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">There is one final matter for our attention. Employer complains of the form of the Judgment of the district court. The Judgment in essence declared that an arbitrational issue was presented which should be referred to an arbitrator for disposition in accordance with the agreement between the parties and the opinion of the court. Employer expresses the concern that the arbitrator\u2019s authority may be infringed by the Judgment. It fears that because evidence as to the meaning of the contract was rejected in this proceeding it may be precluded from adducing such evidence before the arbitrator.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It says that this does not involve the threshold question of whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction \u201cin the broad sense.\u201d We believe such fears are groundless, for we only decide here that the issue presented by Union is one for arbitration. We do not decide how the contract should be interpreted or what evidence is or is not admissible to determine how it shall be interpreted or to determine whether a commitment was unfulfilled. See Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., supra. As the district court noted, after the court has determined that an ar-bitrable issue exists, the rest remains for the arbitrator. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">For the reasons stated, the Judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Excerpts from Collective Bargaining Agreement Dated January 6, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Article 14</p>\n<p id=\"AIJ4\">Job Vacancies and Promotions</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">Section 14.02 \u2014 Filling of Job Vacancies</p>\n<p id=\"Aqb_\">The factors to be taken into consideration in the filling of a job vacancy with an employee from a lower-rated classification shall be seniority and necessary qualifications for the job to be filled.
