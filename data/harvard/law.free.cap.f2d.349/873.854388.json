BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b920-26\">Directly involved is the question whether the District Court was correct in denying a permanent injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>against the Florida Public Utility Commission in the enforcement of Florida Motor Truck laws. But wrapped up in the question are a number of competing factors. One, of course, is the strong comity policy, legislatively reflected in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283 of avoiding Federal Court interference in state judicial proceedings and especially criminal prosecutions. But pulling in the other direction is the fact that the Florida criminal law at stake inescapably has as its core a Federal standard. And that Federal standard calls for interpretation and application of two distinct legislative structures, one the Transportation Act, the other the Agricultural Marketing Act. And pleading always for recognition is the strong policy to facilitate, not thwart, free movement in interstate commerce. Complicating all of it further is the problem of the extent to which the trial Court ought in the past, or should in the future, defer action pending decision of all or a part of the underlying controversy by the Interstate Commerce Commission. In effect, we do not disapprove of the denial of the injunction. But we do vacate the order so that if further relief is sought after the remand, the District Court will refer it initially to the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-14\">Suit for injunction was filed by ATA <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against FPUC<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking an order prohibiting the arrest of its driver employees in the operation of trucks on Florida highways in interstate commerce. After a full hearing, the trial Court denied a permanent injunction. It is clear from the record that none of the arrests was for alleged violation of Florida highway safety regulations as to physical operations, speed, weight, or load. On the contrary, the arrests were made because, in the judgment of FPUC the interstate transportation was being effected by owner-drivers and not ATA. Since owner-drivers concededly did not have a Florida certificate, such operation is in violation of \u00a7 323.02 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u00a7 323.35 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Florida statutes, F.S.A., since it is likewise conceded that such owner-drivers did not have requisite authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission to bring themselves within the exemption of \u00a7 323.28 (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">But this is the beginning, not the end, of the problem, for ATA, frankly recognizing this, asserts two things. First, ATA is a Texas nonprofit cooperative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>association<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> operating as a \u201ccooperative association\u201d under the Agricultural Marketing Act. As such it is authorized to engage in transportation services for nonmembers provided such \u201cservices with or for nonmembers\u201d is not \u201cin an amount greater in value than the total amount of such business transacted by it with or for members.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Second, this brings into play \u00a7 203(b) (5) of the Interstate Commerce Act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which exempts from regulation (other than safety) \u201cmotor vehicles controlled and operated by\u201d an approved agricultural Co-op.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">For the purpose of this case, it was, and is, assumed by all hands that ATA qualified as an authorized co-op under \u00a7 203(b) (5).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The controversy raged, therefore, around the question whether owner-driver trucks meet the exemption standard of \u201cmotor vehicles controlled and operated by\u201d ATA.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">This sets the stage. This reveals that while the immediate problem is compliance with Florida laws, what Florida laws demand presents a Federal question \u2014 clearly one proper for a Federal Court \u2014 in the application and interpretation of one, and perhaps two, Federal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-17\">At the time of the trial, ATA conducted all of its transportation services through the use of leased rolling stock. Each lease is for a term of one year with a 30-day written cancellation clause. The equipment must, of course, meet ATA\u2019s specifications as to size, type, weight, insulation, type of refrigerating equipment. And it must be and remain in operating condition which means that the owner-lessor bears the expense of replacement of tires and other accessory equipment, general repairs to the equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>ment, depreciation and consequences of ordinary wear and tear. In addition the owner-lessor must provide Texas registration, collision and upset insurance on equipment and the first $500 deductible on cargo insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">Lease rentals for the tractors and the refrigerated semi-trailers are computed separately for each completed trip. Under the lease ATA, the lessee, pays the owner-lessor a sum equal to 100% of the gross freight revenue received by ATA for the shipments based on the freight revenues received <em>less </em>two deductions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The first deduction is a constant of 18% of the gross revenue. This is retained by ATA as compensation for administrative overhead and related services, and constitutes the sole source for its profits. The second group covers all operating expenses incurred by ATA (not including overhead covered by the 18%) for the operation of the equipment on the trip involved including, any deadhead on the outward or homeward legs. These operating expenses include all fuel, oil, registration fees, state licenses, road and fuel taxes, fuel bonds, permits, loading and unloading expense, cost of emergency road service or substitute equipment, all signs and identifying material placed on the leased equipment, cargo insurance (above the $500 deductible), public liability insurance, wages, social security, withholding taxes and workmen\u2019s compensation insurance on all drivers, the compensation being fixed on a mileage basis without regard to profits of the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">It is without any contradiction that all cargo is booked solely by ATA. It alone makes the quotation of rates and terms. It issues all bills of lading, shipping contracts, or documents and invoices and collects all freight charges. The equipment and the drivers are under the positive control of the central dispatch office at Fort Worth. It alone advises drivers where and when to pick up loads, where to deliver them, what routing to use, and what special handling, such as temperature for cargo spaces, specified time of delivery, and the like is required. None of the equipment or the drivers is ever trip-leased to anyone else or used by anyone else but ATA during the time the equipment remains under the lease to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">Analyzing this briefly summarized arrangement in the light of United States v. Drum, 1962, 368 U.S. 370, 82 S.Ct. 408, 7 L.Ed.2d 360, the trial Judge concluded that the owner-driver-lessors were in effect paying 18% to ATA for cargo solicitation and related services and that ATA\u2019s contention of complete control and operation of these trucks through the payment of wages and on the road expenses * * * is a subterfuge * * <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although there was evidence concerning some highly artificial rearrangments of the legal title to some of this leased equipment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we do not understand the Judge to have arrived at the conclusion of a \u201csubterfuge\u201d on the basis of facts showing that the operation was something other than that described in the lease. Rather, he concluded that the terms of the lease if faithfully carried out had this economic impact in fact. This results from the nature of the lease-formula by which nominally ATA pays the operating expenses but which are in fact borne directly by the owner-driver since these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>are deducted from the 82% of gross revenues before any balance is available to remit to the owner-driver. In this sense, even direct mileage wages paid to the owner-driver are borne by him.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Although ATA specifically challenges this as an erroneous fact finding, we certainly accept the Judge\u2019s conclusion on the economic impact. The opprobrium \u201csubterfuge\u201d probably adds little either to help or hinder solution. And in our consideration, we approach it as did the District Court. The record is clear that the arrests were made solely because the trucks were leased from owner-drivers under this particular type of lease agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The question was whether ATA could legally do this. And the trial Judge faced directly up to the issue in stating, the \u201csole and limited issue before this Court is the determination of the legal effect of the factual arrangement between the co-operative and its lessors of rolling stock in the operation and control of the transportation furnished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Although strong arguments can be marshalled raising much doubt that Drum is as dispositive of this case as the District Judge thought, little is to be gained by that pursuit. While we make no holding as to the applicability of Drum, we think analysis of the decision in the light of other cases and the statute demonstrates even more graphically that the basic question ought first to be resolved by the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\"> In the first place, Drum deals with the highly specialized problem of so-called private carriage and the great abuses which led Congress by successive amendments to bolster the ICC\u2019s administrative weapons against it. This struggle is traced both in Drum and more recently in Red Ball Motor Freight, Inc. v. Shannon, 1964, 377 U.S. 311, 84 S.Ct. 1260, 12 L.Ed.2d 341. As those cases and that history reflect, at no time was it intended that a \u201cprivate carrier\u201d should ever be permitted to engage in transportation as such. What, and all, a \u201cprivate carrier\u201d could do was to carry its own goods.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Congress, at the persistent behest of the ICC, made this doubly clear in the 1958 amendments. Even one who is \u201cthe owner, lessee, or bailee\u201d of property which is being carried \u201cfor the purpose of sale, lease, rent, or bailment\u201d if \u201cengaged in any other business\u201d may not \u201ctransport property by motor vehicle in interstate * * * commerce for business purposes <em>unless </em>such transportation is within the scope, and in furtherance, of a primary business enterprise <em>(other than transportation) </em>of such person.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied) Within the highly complex, intensely regulated, structure of common-contract-motor carrier transportation, the aim of Congress was to assure a healthy regulated monopoly of for-hire carriage while preserving the right of one to transport his own private property by his own transportation facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">But the congressional treatment of approved agricultural co-ops is quite dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>ferent. As to co-ops, just as to other accorded statutory exemptions, the Transportation Act recognizes that such persons are entitled to, and in fact do engage in, transportation as carriers for-hire. Thus, as the most prominent and frequent source of litigation, is the subsection (6) exemption of \u201cmotor vehicles used in carrying property consisting of ordinary livestock, fish * * * or agricultural * * * commodities * * *.\u201d \u00a7 203(b) (6), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(b) (6).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Others are the three-bulk-cargo and Iiquid-bulk-cargos-in-tank-vessels exemptions under the parallel provisions of Part III for water carriers.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">And the same consequence is evident under \u00a7 203(b) (5) for qualified agricultural co-ops when that section is read together with the Agricultural Marketing Act (note 7, supra). By the terms of the Act, it is certain that Congress recognized that such co-ops would be engaging in for-hire transportation. See ICC v. Jamestown Farmers Union Federated Co-operative Transportation Assn., D.Minn., 1944, 57 F.Supp. 749, 751. Such co-ops were not to be confined to the transportation of commodities belonging to, or to be delivered to, its own members. The only limitation for transportation services, as all other activities, was that such \u201cbusiness services with or for nonmembers\u201d should not be \u201cin an amount greater in value\u201d than that transacted by it for its members. Indeed, unlike \u00a7 203(b) (6) (see note 17, supra), which ties the exemption to vehicles and particular agricultural, etc. commodities, the only limitation under the Marketing Act is on the comparative dollar revenue of member and non-member business. The legislative history also demonstrates that Congress was aware that cooperative associations were then engaging in for-hire transportation activities, and some appropriate recognition had to be taken when the Motor Carrier Act was enacted in 1935.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Since it is plain that agricultural co-ops are entitled to engage in transporation for-hire for members of the public so long as the 49% plus ceiling is maintained on non-member business, the modifying terms in \u00a7 203(b) (5) \u201ccontrolled and operated by\u201d ought to be looked at in the light of a recognized for-hire common (or contract) motor carrier. In dealing with the prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>lem whether it is essential that the carrier own outright equipment required for the performance of the transportation, it is significant that the Transportation Act treats \u201cservice\u201d and \u201ctransportation\u201d in broad terms to \u201cinclude all vehicles operated by, for, or in the interest of any motor carrier irrespective of ownership or of contract, express or implied.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that the definition of \u201ccommon carrier by motor vehicle,\u201d as amended in 1940 and now appears as \u00a7 203(a) (14), 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 303(a) (14), has the same meaning as the original 1935 section to include any person \u201cwho * * * undertakes, \u2018whether directly or by a lease or any other arrangement,\u2019 to transport * * Thomson v. United States, 1944, 321 U.S. 19, 23, 64 S.Ct. 392, 394, 88 L.Ed. 513.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">And the Supreme Court has twice specifically recognized that in determining the question of <em>who </em>is the carrier, i. e., the person engaging in the <em>transportation, </em>the solution does not depend on the status of the ownership of the equipment being employed or, for that matter, the physical control over the operation thereof. Thus, in United States v. Rosenblum Truck Lines, 1941, 315 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">50, 62 S.Ct. 445, 86 L.Ed. 671, grandfather rights under \u00a7 209(a), 49 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 309(a), were accorded the railroad rather than the owner and operator of the motor trucks carrying cargo for the railroad under contract. The grandfather clause, like \u00a7 203(b) (5) \u201ccontrolled and <em>operated </em>by\u201d, speaks in terms of one who \u201cwas in bona fide <em>operation\u201d </em>as a common or contract carrier.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The motor truck owners, much as the owner-lessor-drivers here, had to bear the cost of fire, theft and collision insurance, paid operating and maintenance costs, assumed some cargo damage claims and hired and paid the drivers as their employees. And in Thomson v. United States, 1944, 321 U.S. 19, 64 S.Ct. 392, 395, 88 L.Ed. 513 (see note 21, supra), the Court reversing the ICC, declared that the railroad carrier, not the motor vehicle actual operator, was entitled to the grandfather rights. This was so even though the contracts between railroad and truck owners described the operators as \u201cindependent contractors\u201d and the facts showed actual, complete independent physical control. Thus drivers were employees of the truck owner who paid all operating expenses including indemnification of the railroad against loss or damage claims, costs of insurance, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>the like. The Court held this was transportation by the railroad, not the contractor. The Court\u2019s language bears a strong parallel to that here.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In doing so the Court, just as it did by ignoring it as insignificant in Drum, here rejected the ICC\u2019s application of the common law control test to phyical operations of the vehicles. Of it they said, \u201cThis so-called \u2018control and reponsibility\u2019 test, however, is applicable in this case only insofar as it aids in determining the person offering and engaging in the single coordinated rail-motor freight service. To the extent that it leads to a result different from that reached by the application of the statutory provisions and the Congressional intent which we have indicated, it must be disapproved.\u201d 321 U.S. at 26, 64 S.Ct. at 395, 88 L.Ed. at 518.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">And probably of the greatest significance is the fact that the ICC, the body charged with responsibility for developing and maintaining a strong national transport system with the full legislative blessing of Congress, recognizes in a formal and vital way that carriers (common or contract) are entitled to obtain needed equipment and augment fleets to care for increases in traffic <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> by means of leases. The trail followed, long and tortuous, is well described in Christian v. United States, D.Md., (3 Judge), 1957, 152 F.Supp. 561. It begins in 1947-48 with Ex Parte No. MC-43, Lease and Interchange of Vehicles By Motor Carriers. There are four published official ICC reports comprising over 206 printed pages which reflect the painstaking care with which the ICC sought the views and obtained evidence as to all phases of motor transportation including state regulatory agencies.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> En route, the Commission\u2019s power to promulgate these regulations was upheld by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> And Congress twice took notice of this comprehensive project by legislation which both affirmed the existence of power to regulate the leasing of vehicles to carriers and prohibited restrictions as to trip leasing of agricultural commodity exempt vehicles.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>With interim regulations and exemptions adopted from time to time, the end was reached in 1956 with the promulgation of the regulations in final form, 68 MCC 553, which now appear as 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.1-6.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">As the reports (note 26, supra) reflect, in this rule-making process the ICC considered and analyzed the contentions and objections of every phase of the business. Of particular importance to our case was the Commission\u2019s preoccupation with two things when the vehicle was owner-operated: (1) the duration of the lease, and (2) compensating the lessor by a percentage of the freight revenues received by the carrier-lessee. As to the first, trip leasing, thought to be provocative of many of the abuses, was prohibited and a minimum 30-day lease period was fixed.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> All of ATA\u2019s leases satisfy this. As to the second, this really demonstrates that law making when done through rule-making is the product of experience born often of experimentation. For in the initial decision, Division 5, despite the urgings of its Bureau of Motor Carriers, and others, to prohibit compensation of owner-driver lessors by a percentage of freight revenues, concluded that it should not \u201cspecify any basis for the compensation for the use of the leased equipment.\u201d 51 MCC 461, 528. When reviewed by the full Commission, the ICC flatly held \u201cthat compensation for the rental of equipment based upon a percentage of the revenue earned with the equipment should be prohibited.\u201d 52 MCC 675, 726. In the 1955 review the ICC adhered to this prohibition except as to a few exemptions. 64 MCC 361, 384-5.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> But eight years after the refusal of Division 5 to prohibit percentage compensation, the full Commission completed the round trip by holding that \u201c * * * the previously issued regulations are being modified by the cancellation of those provisions governing the basis of compensation * * 68 MCC 553, 556.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Far from indicating an arbitrary indecisiveness, the ICC recognized that they had reached the point where the proposed \u201crules must be put in force * \" * or put away\u201d with the likelihood \u201cthat the entire subject may * * * require consideration at some future date * * * \u201d and with a realization that as \u201cwe close the books <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>on the past record * * it is \u201cfrom this point forward\u201d that \u201cwe start with a clean slate upon which to record the results of the regulations being put into effect.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Of course, in ATA\u2019s leases the 82% appears to be merely a variation of this permissible method.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">It concludes the analysis to emphasize that Drum is of perhaps limited application since, as the Court points out, the three-Judge District Court has held that the shipper had control over the operation of the trucks. This ruling was not challenged on the appeal. \u201cBut,\u201d the Court declared, \u201ca finding of shipper control does not require a resolution of the ultimate issue in the shipper\u2019s favor.\u201d 368 U.S. at 382, 82 S.Ct. at 414. Rather, the Court approved the more recent substantive test of the Commission which requires that for it to be authorized private carriage when performed by equipment not operated by the shipper\u2019s direct employees, such shipper must have significantly shouldered the burdens of transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">With this background, it becomes evident that Drum was dealing with quite a different situation. Who is a private carrier, when does transportation effected by a shipper for movement of a shipper\u2019s own goods cease to be private carriage and become unauthorized transportation, does not turn on control.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">And yet the test of \u00a7 203(b) (5) is whether the motor vehicle is \u201ccontrolled\u201d and operated by the co-op. As in the grandfather cases, the law recognizes that one having the status and statutory responsibility of a carrier (common or contract) may both \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201coperate\u201d vehicles under lease or contract to it. Regulation comes from regulating the carrier, not the vehiclefurnisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Moreover, Drum makes two further things clear. The first is that the test fashioned continuously by the authoritative policy making agency, the ICC, is an evolving one. Efforts to analogize to the handy, but frequently artificial common law test of \u201ccontrol\u201d are giving way more and more to the composite one of substance. Second, as the newer approach takes over and reliance can come less and less from \u201cindicia\u201d which \u201care the instruments of decision, not touchstones,\u201d the ICC, and the Courts, must deal with these situations \u201cas an integral and unique problem in judgment, rather than simply as an exercise in counting common-places.\u201d 368 U.S. at 384, 82 S.Ct. at 415. That task of judgment becomes likewise more and more delicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\"> This brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of Federal transportation policy demonstrates that the important question is <em>who, </em>within Federal machinery in the first instance, should make these delicate judgments. This is not to suggest an intrusion by the Federal Government into the State domain, because the relevant Florida motor truck statutes (see notes 3 and 5, supra) are cast in terms which recognize the right to engage in any interstate motor truck transportation which is authorized by Federal law. The Florida test becomes the Federal test. Nor is it a suggestion that when cases, criminal or civil, under these statutes are properly before the Florida State Courts, they are any less competent in the resolution of this built-in Federal question. Rather, our problem is one of Federal judicial administration precipitated by reason of the filing of a case within the jurisdiction of the District Court and which it had to entertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">On this score, we think the case as it now comes to us calls for the exercise of primary jurisdiction by the ICC as a condition precedent to any future relief. That this leaves to the ICC initial responsibility for making fact findings and perhaps the even more decisive task of fashioning a policy which it articulates in terms of a legal standard, is no longer an argument against the power to invoke <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>decision by the administrative agency. Southwestern Sugar and Molasses Co. v. River Terminals Corp., 1959, 360 U.S. 411, 79 S.Ct. 1210, 3 L.Ed.2d 1334, 1959 AMC 1631; Far Eastern Conference v. United States, 1952, 342 U.S. 570, 72 S.Ct. 492, 96 L.Ed. 576; United States v. Western Pacific R., 1956, 352 U.S. 59, 77 S.Ct. 161, 1 L.Ed.2d 126; United States v. Chesapeake and Ohio Ry., 1956, 352 U.S. 77, 77 S.Ct. 172, 1 L.Ed.2d 140. And see our recent decision, Louisville &amp; Nashville R. v. Knox Homes Corp., 5 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 887, which points out that in several of these cases the reference to the ICC was of a question of transportation law, not just the interpretation of obscure tariffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">This will \u2014 or at least tends to \u2014 balance many of these delicate factors. First, it serves to ascertain the controlling standard in the context of an adequate record developing fully a factual basis for policy determination. Just what is the Federal legal standard of vehicles \u201ccontrolled and operated by\u201d a co-op? Is it the common law control test? The private carrier substantial test ? Are co-ops, as exempt carriers, entitled to use the same sort of lease arrangements as would a certificated common (or contract) carrier? Do the ICC regulations for common (or contract) carriers on leases extend to exempt for-hire carriers? If so, does this arrangement suffice? In the final analysis the ICC must someday decide this question. For while it is a legal question on which Courts will ultimately rule, Drum and Shannon illustrate the practical decisiveness of administratively wrought legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Second, this serves the strong policy of our working Federalism to minimize unseeming conflict between the Federal and Florida State Courts especially in the area of criminal law enforcement and the strong appeal of comity epitomized by Douglass v. City of Jeannette, 1943, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324; 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283; cf. Dilworth v. Riner, 5 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 226. Florida properly intends to enforce its laws. But Florida law fully and expressly respects the Federal right. A genuine doubt exists as to whether this arrangement satisfies Federal law. If it does, this record makes it certain that Florida would not arrest either drivers or owners or ATA for acting under it. ,The important thing is'to obtain, if possible, an authoritative ruling which in a practical sense would be binding on all \u2014 ATA, owner-drivers and Florida. Arrests and trials of owners-drivers no matter how adequate for the arrested driver-defendant, will hardly suffice for ATA whose like operations cease with the campaign of arrests. In view of the heavy burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt, acquittals or reversals of convictions will mean little to ATA either as res judicata, collateral estoppel or as establishing a legal principle. Cf. United States v. Burch, 5 Cir., 1961, 294 F.2d 1. A full dress review of the underlying issue by the Supreme Court of Florida in an appeal from a conviction would be quite another thing. But there is no way of predicting whether or when that might occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Third, this simultaneously serves the Federal policy of the flow of interstate commerce unobstructed by even State laws or practices. Congress has granted this right to co-ops. Florida does not desire- \u2014 and it could not if it did \u2014 to lessen or thwart any practice by ATA or owner-drivers which the Federal law permits. Indeed, it disclaims any such purpose.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Of course it is important that within the sphere of its powers, Florida be allowed to enforce its laws and prosecute those accused of their violation. But it is equally important that commerce between the states enjoy that free, uninterrupted flow as validly prescribed by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Fourth, it serves to keep Florida in the case and the ease in Florida. Florida has a strong interest at stake. But this being ultimately a Federal question, there is a risk that either by Court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>ICC decision, the issue will be resolved in a case in which Florida, not a party, is not heard. On a reference to the ICC from the Court below, Florida may participate fully in the administrative proceedings and the statutory three-Judge Court review since that now comes back to the Court initiating the reference.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Having reached the conclusion that this case calls initially for the expertise of the ICC, it would be manifestly improper for us to undertake the task of determining whether the District Judge was right or wrong on the underlying question. We do not hold that he erred nor do we hold that he was correct. There is, of course, the element \u2014 indeed important, sometimes decisive \u2014 of discretion in granting or denying injunctive relief. In some situations it would be enough merely to say that \u201cno abuse\u201d of the Judge\u2019s discretion has been shown and affirm. But that leaves the parties and, for that matter, the flow of commerce frustrated. More than that, af-firmance carries with it overtones of res judicata, or collateral estoppel, at least as between ATA and Florida. If the matter is first to be referred to the ICC, that agency ought to be able to probe the problem and arrive at a conclusion unfettered by a prior adjudication perhaps equivocal in nature as being primarily on the intrinsic merits of the legality of the arrangement, but partly on equitable discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">To avoid this we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further consistent proceedings. If either of the parties thereafter seek relief, the District Court shall direct the parties to refer the matter by appropriate proceedings to the ICC. Pending such reference, the trial Court will be completely free under usual equitable principles to determine whether to grant or deny interim relief. Nothing said or unsaid is to be understood as an expression of any view thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Judgment vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-5\">.
