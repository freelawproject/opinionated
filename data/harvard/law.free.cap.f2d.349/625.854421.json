The deed had inadvertently failed to include certain real property located in Tarrant County, Texas. A correcting deed was executed and recorded after the tax lien was filed. The question is whether the federal tax lien attaches to the property erroneously omitted from the original deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-18\">On January 21, 1959, Creamer Industries, Inc., the ultimate purchaser, and Maxwell Steel Company, Inc., the taxpayer, entered into a contract whereby all of Maxwell\u2019s assets were to be transferred and conveyed to Creamer. The consideration paid by Creamer was $183,000 and the assumption of some of Maxwell\u2019s indebtedness, amounting in total to more than $1,100,000. By inadvertence the contract failed to list or describe in any way the six lots of land, five of which are the subject of this lawsuit. The deeds executed on the same day likewise omitted these six lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-19\">On March 24, 1959, the United States made a jeopardy assessment against Maxwell for $430,523.09, which included past due income taxes and excise taxes. Notice of the tax lien which arose by virtue of the assessment was filed on March 26, 1959, two days after the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-20\">Thereafter, on or about April 1, 1959, Maxwell executed and delivered a correcting deed, conveying these lots to Creamer. The deed was back-dated to January 21, 1959, but was recorded on April 28, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-21\">Before discussing and deciding the merits, we must dispose of a question of jurisdiction. While Professor Moore questions with deference whether such an inflexible rule is needed or sound,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the present rule is that a fundamental question must be raised sua sponte by a federal appellate court first as to its own jurisdiction and then as to the jurisdiction of the court from which the appeal comes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jurisdiction of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>appeal from a final decision of the district court is conferred on this Court by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. While the action in the district court sought an injunction, we think that the district judge did not err in treating it as a suit to quiet title to real property clouded by a federal tax lien. The complaint alleged that the proceeding is brought under 28 U. S. Code \u00a7 2410. The district court stated: \u201cSo far as Section 2410 is a point, I do not see any attending lack of jurisdiction in this suit. United States v. Morrison [5 Cir.] 247 F.2d 285.\u201d The Ninth Circuit disagrees with our decision in United States v. Morrison, supra, relied on by the district court, but bases jurisdiction of a suit to quiet title to land attacking the validity or priority of a federal tax lien upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1340.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Government has now abandoned its attack upon the jurisdiction of the district court. Upon one basis or another, we are satisfied that there was no lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The district court based its ruling with the plaintiff Creamer upon two conclusions of law, expressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\u201c1. It is manifest as a matter of law that the buyer corporation had become \u2018purchaser,\u2019 in the most literal sense of Section 6323(a), as to the great mass of property and assets constituting the subject matter of the contract between the two corporations, and stood in that position thereunto at the time the tax lien was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">\u201c2. The two corporations had a single contract of sale and, although the subject matter included a multiplicity of items, there was simply a common and blanket consideration for the whole property, and consequently it would be too rigid in the light of the \u2018realities\u2019 referred to in the Regulation to split the concept of \u2018purchaser\u2019 and say that the buyer corporation, at the time the tax lien was filed, had become a \u2018purchaser\u2019 in very large part, but had not become a \u2018purchaser\u2019 as to the very minor part ' of the subject matter in the contract of sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323(a) referred to by the district court reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-14\">\u201c\u00a7 6323. <em>Validity against mortgagees, pledgees, purchasers, and judgment creditors</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-15\">\u201c(a) <em>Invalidity of lien without notice. </em>\u2014 * * * the lien imposed by section 6321 shall not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, purchaser, or judgment creditor until notice thereof has been filed by the Secretary or his delegate \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">That statute was recently considered by this Court in Fore v. United States, 5 Cir. 1964, 339 F.2d 70. As implicit in that decision, and as held in one of the cases there cited,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the purpose of the statute was \u201cto protect mortgagees, purchasers and judgment creditors against a secret lien for assessed taxes and to postpone the effectiveness of the tax lien as against these interests until the tax lien was filed.\u201d In the present case, as has been seen, the United States made the jeopardy assessment on March 24, and notice of the tax lien was filed on March 26. During the two intervening days there was no happening or occurrence which could change Creamer\u2019s rights in the slightest. The rights of the parties were the same at the time the lien arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>and at the time when notice was filed. In our opinion, therefore, section 6323(a) has no application to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The sections providing for the creation of the lien are quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The question to be decided is whether at the time of the assessment on March 24, 1959, the taxpayer, Maxwell, owned any property or rights to property in the six lots upon which the tax lien could fasten. The nature and extent of Maxwell\u2019s interest in the lots on that date must be determined by state law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">As between Maxwell, the seller, and Creamer, the purchaser, Maxwell\u2019s interest may differ from its interest with respect to a creditor without notice, such as the United States. Most pertinent is the Texas recording statute, 19 Vernon\u2019s Ann.Tex.Civ.St., art. 6627:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cAll bargains, sales and other conveyances whatever, of any land, tenements and hereditaments, whether they may be made for passing any estate of freehold of inheritance or for a term of years; and deeds of . settlement upon marriage, whether land, money or other personal thing; and all deeds of trust and mortgages shall be void as to all creditors and subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration without notice, unless they shall be acknowledged or proved and filed with the clerk, to be recorded as required by law; but the same as between the parties and their heirs, and as to all subsequent purchasers, with notice thereof or without valuable consideration, shall be valid and binding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-14\"> As to the taxes owed to it, the United States was a \u201ccreditor\u201d within the Texas recording statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A creditor who has obtained a lien by operation of law is protected by the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In Henderson v. Odessa Bldg. &amp; Finance Co., just cited (n. 9), a judgment creditor asserted its lien against lot 3 which the debtor had intended to convey prior to the levy, but his deed had mistakenly described lot 5 instead of lot 3. It was held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-15\">\u201cThe failure to convey the lot levied upon by plaintiffs in error through mutual mistake of the parties gave defendant in error an equitable right to have the deed reformed by correction deed or a decree in equity, but, as plaintiffs in error had no knowledge of such equity at the time their levy was made, the lien thereby fixed was superior to defendant in error\u2019s right to such reformation.\u201d 24 S.W.2d at 394.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>That decision seems almost \u201con all fours\u201d with the present case. It follows that the judgment should have gone for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The judgment of the district court is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-15\">. 1 Moore, Federal Practice 1f 0.60 [4], p. 610.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-22\">.

BROWN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"am5-dedup-0\">dissenting :</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">This is a startling result. Laws of Texas which are designed to protect innocent persons dealing in faith on the revelations of title records are twisted to permit the great national sovereign to take property from one who is the acknowledged owner of it to apply on the tax debts of another the former owner who \u2014 as the trial Court found and this Court does not dispute \u2014 has transferred <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the property. I do not believe that Congress ever intended any such result. I do not think that a Court should lend its hand to anything so demeaning to a sovereign.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">The Federal Statute creates a lien only \u201cupon all property and rights to property * * * belonging to such person [taxpayer].\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Unless there is property belonging to the taxpayer, the Government\u2019s lien is nonexistent. The Texas Statute<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which protects business creditors and those parting with consideration on the faith of apparent record title speaks in terms of the persons against whom the conveyance is not good, such has bona fide purchaser, judgment creditors, etc. Unlike this, the Federal Statute speaks in terms of the origin of the lien. The tax lien arises, the tax lien comes into being, only as to property or rights to property belonging to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">Clearly this property did not belong to Taxpayer. It had no right to such property. True, under Texas law a judgment creditor had a superior claim against the purchaser whose deed was imperfect for late recordation. But the one thing clear is that Taxpayer here had <em>no </em>right in or to the property.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Not a single Texas case could possibly be dredged up which in even the most remote way would suggest the faintest hope that Maxwell, the vendor-taxpayer, had any rights, legal or equitable, against anyone \u2014 Creamer, the public, or the Publican to get the property back or assert any interest in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">And yet it is this \u2014 ownership by the taxpayer \u2014 which gives rise to the lien for the National Government. Congress has not said that this Nation has a tax lien against any and all property once owned by a delinquent taxpayer to the same extent as some innocent purchaser or judgment creditor might have under local recordation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">Once Congress so declares, Courts must enforce it. But the morality of the Government\u2019s taking property which the Court\u2019s opinion reflects was sold to, paid for by, and in equitable conscience and law belonged to a stranger, is so disturb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>ing to me that before the heavy hand of the tax gatherer falls, it is for Congress to speak clearly to declare that this is the conscience of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b675-15\">. See, e.g., \u201cThe deed had <em>inadvertently </em>failed to include certain real property * * <em>*. </em>The question is whether the federal tax lien attaches to the property <em>erroneously </em>omitted from the * * * deed. * * * By <em>inadvertence </em>the contract failed to list or describe * * * the six lots of land * * (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b675-19\">. I am at a loss to understand why there is any question about jurisdiction. United States v. Morrison, 5 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 285.
