Westa, Denver, Colo., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b981-8\">Before BARNES, Circuit Judge, ORR, Senior Circuit Judge, and MATHES, Senior District Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b981-9\">MATHES, Senior District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">This action was originally commenced in the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, by appellant and eight other former fellow employees of appellee. Each sued for damages for alleged defamation contained in letters of discharge sent them by appellee as their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">The action was removed to the District Court upon the petition of appellee asserting diversity of citizenship. [28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332, 1441.] The parties then stipulated that all nine plaintiffs might try their respective causes of action separately; and the attorneys for plaintiffs thereafter elected to try appellant\u2019s cause of action first. The jury found against him, and this appeal is from the judgment entered upon that adverse verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Inasmuch as the letter of discharge, dated June 20,1957, contains not only the defamatory matter complained of, but also the grounds asserted by appellee for appellant\u2019s discharge, it is set forth in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-13\">\u201cDear Mr. Peterson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-14\">\u201cThis is to notify you that effective June 8, 1957, your services with the Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company have been permanently terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-16\">\u201cThe reasons for termination of your services are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-17\">\u201cOn June 8, 1957, evidence was reviewed with you which indicated that you failed to turn over to the company certain monies which you removed from the upper housings of certain pay station telephones. After review of this evidence you were given an opportunity to make any statement that you desired with respect to your position on the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-18\">\u201cI have carefully reviewed all the evidence together with all statements which you made in your own behalf. I find that you knew that monies removed from the upper housings of pay station telephones were to be turned over to the company; that you failed to turn over to the company certain monies which you removed from the upper housings of certain pay station telephones and that you offered no satisfactory explanation concerning the disposition of these monies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-20\">\u201cUnder the provisions of the Company\u2019s Fidelity Bond covering the Company\u2019s employees, the circumstances outlined above render it necessary that you be removed from coverage under the bond. The Company, of course, has no alternative but to report the matter to the Bonding Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-21\">It is conceded that this letter, the contents of which the District Judge ruled were \u201clibelous per se\u201d, was published by appellee in Phoenix, Arizona, at least to the stenographer who typed it and to the clerk who filed appellee\u2019s office copy of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-22\">It is our duty of course to accept as true all evidence tending to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict. [Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); Mickelson v. United States, 346 F.2d 952 (9th Cir. 1965).] The evidence is uncontradicted that it had not been the practice of appellee to send a letter of discharge upon terminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>ing an employee, but here the Arizona Director of the Communications Workers of America, appellant\u2019s union, requested that all charges in connection with anticipated discharges for cause against appellant and the eight others be made in writing. It is undisputed also that the union was acting throughout as appellant\u2019s agent, and that even the decision to sue appellee was made by the District Director of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">The evidence shows that appellant received the letter of discharge by registered mail on or about June 23, 1957, and that this action was filed five days thereafter, on June 28, 1957. The evidence further shows that, with appellant\u2019s consent, news of the letter of discharge and of the ensuing suit for damages received wide publicity in a Phoenix newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">In defense of the action, appellee pleaded by way of confession and avoidance that the letter of discharge was qualifiedly privileged because of the employer-employee relationship, and was written without malice. Appellee also pleaded the affirmative defense of truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Before proceeding to consider appellant\u2019s specifications of error, it is well to recall that in this action, where Federal jurisdiction rests entirely upon diversity of citizenship, the District Court was called upon to apply the substantive law of Arizona. As the Court has said, \u201cin all cases where a federal court is exercising jurisdiction solely because of the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the outcome of the litigation in the federal court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State court.\u201d [Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 1470, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945); see: Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co. of America, 350 U.S. 198, 76 S.Ct 273, 100 L.Ed. 199 (1956).]</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\"> For grounds of appeal, appellant specifies certain alleged errors in the charge to the jury, to each of which appellant made timely objection as required by Rule 51 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. He first asserts that the instructions given \u201cerroneously assumed that because the publication was quali-fiedly privileged, the burden was upon appellant to prove both malice and untruthfulness\u201d. As to this, the District Court instructed the jury, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkI\">\u201cHas plaintiff proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the libel contained in said letter of discharge was false? If you find that plaintiff has failed to carry that burden, then your deliberations would end and you would return a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">The law of Arizona as to burden of proof is \u201csubstantive\u201d in character and, as such, governed the trial in the District Court. [See: Dick v. New York Life Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 437, 446, 79 S.Ct. 921, 3 L.Ed.2d 935 (1959); Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 116-119, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943); Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, 308 U.S. 208, 212, 60 S.Ct. 201, 84 L.Ed. 196 (1939); cf. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra, 326 U.S. at 108, 65 S.Ct. 1464.] And it appears to be settled Arizona law \u201c that where, as here, defamatory matter is shown to be qualifiedly privileged, the burden of proving both falsity and malice rests upon the plaintiff. [See: Phoenix Newspapers, Inc. v. Choisser, 82 Ariz. 271, 312 P.2d 150 (1957); Broking v. Phoenix Newspapers, Inc., 76 Ariz. 334, 264 P.2d 413, 39 A.L.R.2d 1382 (1953).]</p>\n<p id=\"A7N\">The rule has been stated clearly and unequivocally by the Supreme Court of Arizona that \u201cwhere an occasion for a privileged communication is shown, such publication should be deemed in the exercise of such privilege. The burden then shifts to the plaintiff to prove the falsity of such publication and that the defendant was actuated in publishing the same by malice in fact.\u201d [Phoenix Newspapers, Inc. v. Choisser, supra, 82 Ariz. at 277, 312 P.2d at 154.]</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Appellant next contends that the instructions given \u201con the issue of malice were improper in that they restricted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>question of malice to ill-will or evil in-. tent.\u201d The term \u201cmalice\u201d, appellant insists, \u201calso includes publications made negligently or with a gross disregard for the rights of others\u201d. The jury were instructed: \u201cSimply stated, a publication is malicious when it is inspired by ill-will or evil intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">When appellant made timely objection to omission of the possible elements of gross negligence and recklessness, the learned trial judge explained his purpose as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-6\">\u201c * * * [I] might say for the record here that I don\u2019t feel that there is any evidence in this case of gross negligence or reckless disregard that is sufficient to submit to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">The record discloses beyond question that appellant tried his case and submitted it to the jury on the theory that, because of his union activities the year before in an \u201cimportant strike\u201d against appellee, and because of appellant\u2019s \u201cmilitant leadership\u201d as president of the Phoenix local of the union and as chairman of the local strike committee, ap-pellee set out to \u201cframe\u201d him, with the result that appellant was falsely accused of failure \u201cto turn over to the company certain monies * * * removed from * * * certain pay telephones\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">According to appellant\u2019s theory of his case, therefore, ill will and evil intent were necessarily the operative ingredients of any malice on the part of appellee. To have included any concept of negligence, however gross, or of reckless disregard of appellant\u2019s rights, however wanton, could only have served to becloud the issue as to the existence of malice; for appellant\u2019s case, as presented and argued to the jury, simply left no room for any suggestion that the libelous statements in the June 20th letter were the product of anything less than knowing and purposeful personal spite and ill will toward appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\"> It is not the role of the Court\u2019s charge to confuse the jury with abstract propositions of law. Instructions to the jury should always be adjusted to opposing contentions as to the facts shown by the evidence in the case. [Martin v. Globe Indemnity Company, 345 F.2d 1, 3 (5th Cir. 1965); see Indianapolis etc. R. R. Co. v. Horst, 93 U.S. (3 Otto.) 291, 295, 23 L.Ed. 898 (1876).] Indeed, we have held that it is error to instruct the jury on an issue not properly a part of the case. [Brown v. Chapman, 304 F.2d 149 (9th Cir. 1962).]</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">Accordingly, we hold that the definition of malice, as given to the jury following the evidence and the argument in the case at bar, was sufficiently comprehensive, and that omission of the possible elements of gross negligence and recklessness did not affect any \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of appellant within the meaning of Rule 61 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the last paragraph of the June 20th letter is \u201cthe most damning part of the libel\u201d. This paragraph states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-15\">\u201cUnder the provisions of the Company\u2019s Fidelity Bond governing the Company\u2019s employees, the circumstances outlined above render it necessary that you be removed from coverage under the bond. The Company, of course, has no alternative but to report this matter to the bonding company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">Appellant urges that, in view of these statements about the fidelity bond, the jury were erroneously instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-17\">\u201c[I]f you find that plaintiff has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he properly accounted for pay station monies which he took from the pay stations on the occasions mentioned, your verdict must be in favor of the defendant even though you might find that the letter of discharge was not exactly correct in every detail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-18\">The District Court\u2019s view was that the gist or \u201csting\u201d of the defamatory letter was the accusation that appellant failed to account for certain \u201cmonies which he took from the pay stations\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Appellant\u2019s contention, as put in his opening brief, is that the last paragraph of the letter contains \u201ca charge that he is not bondable, to wit, that he is dishonest, that he has committed a \u2018fraudulent or dishonest act\u2019 as the language of the bond provides.\u201d To state the argument is to answer it; for the \u201csting\u201d of the entire letter unmistakably is that appellant is dishonest and unworthy of trust as to money, and the entire letter was submitted to the jury upon that view of it. Moreover, appellant\u2019s argument on this point must rest not only upon the statements in the letter, but also upon \u201cthe language of the bond\u201d; and the record is searched in vain for any indication that any person to whom the letter in question was published ever saw \u201cthe language of the bond\u201d. Appellant\u2019s final contention must therefore fall, if for no other reason than because it is grounded upon facts extrinsic to the libelous publication, namely, \u201cthe language of the bond\u201d. [See: Ilitzky v. Goodman, 57 Ariz. 216, 112 P.2d 860 (1941); Henn, \u201cLibel-by-Extrinsic-Fact\u201d, 47 Cornell L.Q. 14 (1961).]</p>\n<p id=\"b984-3\">There is no merit then to be found in appellant\u2019s appeal. Under full and fair and, when taken as a whole, eminently correct instructions, the jury considered appellant\u2019s claim and, obviously disbelieving him, returned a verdict against him. For the reasons already stated, the judgment entered on that verdict must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">But there is much to be said for another ground advanced for affirmance: appellee\u2019s contention that the defamatory letter was absolutely privileged because appellant consented to the publication. The uncontradicted evidence in the record before us is that union officials, who were admittedly appellant\u2019s agents with unquestioned authority, consented to\u2014 indeed invited and sought \u2014 the libelous publication. An interesting surrounding circumstance is the speed with which the preparation of the complaint and the filing of this action followed the mailing of the letter to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">That publications made with the consent of the person defamed are absolutely privileged appears to be well settled. [See: Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 583 (1938); Harper and James, Torts, \u00a7 5.17, n. 1 at 105 (1956); Prosser, Torts, \u00a7 95 (2nd ed. 1955); 33 Am.Jur. Libel and Slander, \u00a7 93, n. 1-2 at 105 (1941); 53 C.J.S. Libel and Slander \u00a7 80, n. 7 at 129 (1948).] Although there appears to be no Arizona decision or legislative enactment on this point, the Supreme Court of Arizona has stated on more than one occasion that \u201cwhen not bound by previous decision or legislative enactment\u201d the State courts \u201cwould follow the Restatement of Law\u201d. [Waddell v. White, 56 Ariz. 525, 527, 109 P.2d 843, 844 (1941); accord, Small v. Ellis, 90 Ariz. 194, 198-199, 367 P.2d 234, 236 (1961).]</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">We may assume, then, that if the defamatory letter were in fact consented to by appellant or his authorized agent, the publication was absolutely privileged. However, since it does not appear that the defense of absolute privilege was presented to the District Court, we do not decide here whether it would rule this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
