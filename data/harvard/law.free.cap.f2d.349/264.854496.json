The sole corporate defendant, Pride Wholesale Meat &amp; Poultry Corp., appeals from the conviction entered against it on the conspiracy count, the only offense with which it was charged, after a six-week jury trial in the Southern District of New York.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-19\">The conspiracy count charged that all seven defendants agreed, knowingly and fraudulently, to transfer property and monies of Murray Packing Co., Inc. (\u201cMurray\u201d), valued at appoximately $1,-300,000, in contemplation of a bankruptcy proceeding involving Murray, or with intent to defeat the bankruptcy laws. The indictment\u2019s seven substantive counts charged that, from March 20,1961, to March 29, 1961, Pagano, with the other five individual defendants acting as principals and aiders and abettors, fraudulently transferred $747,000 from Murray to his own account. We conclude that the evidence was more than sufficient to enable a reasonable jury to find the appellants guilty as charged and that no prejudicial errors were committed in the admission of evidence or in the court\u2019s charge. We therefore affirm all .convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-20\">Stripped to essentials, the conspiracy was initiated when Pagano took over control of Murray, then owned and managed by Newman and the Weinberg defendants, at a time when the meat pack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>ing company was in dire financial straits. Shortly thereafter and through Pagano\u2019s efforts, defendant Castellana and his company, Pride, began to buy meat in huge quantities from Murray, often paying less than the billed price and on many occasions less than the cost of the goods to Murray. Similar cut-price purchases were made by G. S. Food Dealer, a company formed by defendant Scian-dra -to assist in bankrupting Murray. Corresponding with these increased sales, Pagano, Newman, and the Wein-bergs escalated their purchases of meat provisions, assuring Murray\u2019s suppliers that payment would be forthcoming. These assurances were intended to lull the creditors into a sense of security during a period when Pagano was (within the space of less than ten days) withdrawing some $747,000 in cash from Murray\u2019s bank accounts. Moreover, the funds were siphoned from the accounts via Pride\u2019s reduced payments on Murray\u2019s bills. These payments more than coincidentally coincided with Pagano\u2019s withdrawals. With Murray\u2019s assets thus depleted, the company passed into insolvency and ultimately bankruptcy, but not before the defendants, after tentatively offering the suppliers a settlement of forty cents on the dollar, fraudulently transferred an additional $112,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">We reject, at the outset, defendants\u2019 challenges to the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s proof. It is well-established that once the trier of fact has returned a guilty verdict, the evidence must be viewed \u201cmost favorably to [the Government], which includes <em>* * * </em>the indulgence in all permissible inferences in its favor.\u201d United States v. Marchisio, 344 F.2d 653, 662 (2 Cir. April 9, 1965). Applying this standard to this case, we cannot avoid the conclusion that reasonable jurors could have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that each of the individual defendants was guilty of \u201cknowingly and fraudulently\u201d transferring or concealing Murray\u2019s property \u201cin contemplation of a bankruptcy proceeding * * * or with intent to defeat the bankruptcy law.\u201d We believe that for us to test the evidence by any other standard would be an invasion of the jury\u2019s function to choose between competing inferences of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">The following narrative summary of the more than 3,000 pages of testimony in this factually complicated case will serve to reveal the essential details of the scheme and participation of each appellant. Murray, with headquarters in the Bronx, New York, was incorporated in December 1959, with David Newman as president and Stanley Weinberg as secretary-treasurer; the two, together with Stanley\u2019s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Weinberg, and Newman\u2019s wife comprised the Board of Directors. Stanley was office manager of the new wholesale venture, in charge of bookkeeping, payments and deposits; Newman supervised poultry purchases and sales; and Joseph directed the veal, lamb and beef departments. By late 1960, within less than a year of its organization, Murray was experiencing serious financial difficulties, having lost much money and being in need of new markets and capital to improve its profit margin. In fact, the company\u2019s bank refused to make any loans because the weak capital base of $125,000 supporting annual sales of approximately $3 million overextended Murray\u2019s financial structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">At this time, Joseph Pagano \u2014 who until then played a minor role as salesman for Mercury Hotel &amp; Restaurant Supply Corp., a small company owned by Murray and specializing in supplying meat and provisions to nightclubs and camps\u2014 moved to the center of the stage. Through his efforts, and despite Murray\u2019s undercapitalized corporate being, the company obtained, on December 2, 1960, an $8,500 loan from Jo-Ran Trading Corp., of which defendant Peter Castellana was president and joint-owner. The interest rate was set at the extraordinarily high rate of <em>1% </em>per week, with the principal to be repaid in three months. Pagano and Stanley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Weinberg co-signed the interest payment checks on behalf of Murray as well as the check covering the principal, which was paid on March 24, 1961, three weeks tardy. The overdue payment came at a time when, according to the Government\u2019s proof, Pagano had already withdrawn $185,000 from Murray\u2019s bank accounts, thus contributing to the company\u2019s impending insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Pagano\u2019s signature on the various checks is explained by an even more significant series of events in late 1960 and early 1961 which terminated in Pagano achieving the dominant position in the Murray operation. While working as a Mercury salesman, Pagano approached Newman and the Weinbergs, proposing that he acquire an interest in Murray in return for a comparatively nominal investment and assurances that he would substantially increase the company\u2019s sales and profits by obtaining new customer accounts. For $35,000, he purchased a one-third stock interest in Murray, replaced Newman as corporate president, and was authorized to sign all Murray checks. These arrangements, formally approved at a joint directors\u2019 and stockholders\u2019 meeting on January 31, 1961, were supplemented by intra-corpo-rate accord which gave Pagano a signatory right on all Murray checks and \u201csole management and control\u201d of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Simultaneously, and due to Pagano\u2019s connections, a series of meetings was held between Pagano, Newman, the Weinbergs and Castellana in which the latter agreed that Pride Wholesale Meat &amp; Poultry Corp., which operated a chain of wholesale and retail stores in the New York metropolitan area, would substantially step up its meat and poultry purchases from Murray, which for the month of November 1960 had approximated only $1,000. During these discussions the parties informally agreed that Murray, thereafter would bill Pride at only one-half cent per pound over Murray's own cost. Pursuant to these arrangements, dealings between the two companies rose rapidly to a point where, in March 1961, Murray was selling Pride about $922,000 out of approximately $1,437,000 in total monthly sales and this resulted in almost 80% of Pride\u2019s total purchases in that month \u2014 $922,000 out of $1,161,000 \u2014 being made from Murray.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, the relationship between the two companies became so interdependent that in the same month of March one financier, terming it \u201cdangerous,\u201d refused to factor Murray\u2019s accounts receivable in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">As Murray-Pride business dealings assumed this symbiotic character, Castel-lana began to take sizable, frequent price reductions when he paid Murray\u2019s bills. Thus, the prosecution\u2019s detailed, methodical proof showed that of the 315 Murray-Pride transactions in March 1961, 114 represented instances where Castellana paid a total of $78,000 less than the billed price; in at least 54 instances the Government was able to show that Pride\u2019s payments did not even equal Murray\u2019s cost of goods sold.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Newman and the Weinbergs belatedly claimed that this price-cutting was unau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>thorized, Stanley Weinberg \u2014 after learning that the reductions were permissible if \"okayed\u201d by Pagano \u2014 issued credit memoranda authorizing Pride to pay less than the price on Murray\u2019s invoices. Stanley further admitted in certain pretrial statements that he knew at the time \u201cit [did] not make sense to sell * * * at this price\u201d and that \u201cno company\u201d could continue in business if it took such losses. On his part, Joseph Weinberg could recall no basis for the reductions and no effort to seek a corresponding reduction from his processor-suppliers. On the other hand, Castellana \u2014 the only defendant to testify at the trial \u2014 painstakingly sought to justify each particular price reduction by pointing to such considerations as defective condition or late shipment. This testimony was counterbalanced, however, by Castel-lana\u2019s admission that he made no notes concerning the reasons for the reductions at the time they were taken; and in the bankruptcy hearings approximately three years previously he was unable to give any reasons for the price reductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Before turning to the critical March 1961 withdrawals by Pagano, one additional phase of the Government\u2019s proof, which introduces defendant Gondolfo Sciandra to the saga, requires synopsis. On March 10, 1961, Sciandra, who had been working for a retail meat market owned by Castellana, his relative by marriage, organized a meat supply business known as G. S. Food Dealer (\u201cG. &amp; S.\u201d). Operating from one of Castel-lana\u2019s warehouses, occupied rent-free, Sciandra bought exclusively from Murray. During the brief three-week period of his ownership, G. &amp; S. purchased from Murray approximately $240,000 in meats and provisions, giving rise to an unpaid debt that reached $176,353.83. Prior statements by Sciandra indicated that he traded mainly through Pagano, with whom he admittedly did not discuss credit terms. Instead, Sciandra \u201ctold him that I had some good accounts and that as soon as I would get paid for the merchandise I would in turn send him a check for the amount of money I owe him,\u201d although he did not \u201cknow what the accounts were exactly.\u201d Moreover, as in the case of Murray-Pride transactions, there were instances where Sciandra paid Murray less than the billed price or even less than Murray\u2019s own wholesale cost. And, even though they were aware of G. &amp; S.\u2019s mounting liability to Murray, Newman and Joseph Weinberg continued to accept Sciandra\u2019s orders and Stanley Weinberg did not call a halt to credit extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Murray\u2019s mounting sales to Pride and G. &amp; S. meant, of course, that there was a corresponding pyramiding in wholesale purchases by the company, which more than quintupled from $233,000 in November 1960 to approximately $1,229,000 for the first three weeks of March 1961. During January and February Murray paid for these purchases promptly within the usual seven-day credit period characteristic of the quick-turnover meat business, but this pattern changed significantly in early March when the size and number of the meat and poultry orders rose rapidly and payments were delayed. When combined with Murray\u2019s rapidly burgeoning sales, this failure to use the proceeds from Pride and G. &amp; S. to pay supplier-creditors produced a larger-than-usual .bank balance, which Pagano proceeded to raid as the culmination of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The record reveals, in great detail, how during the critical period from March 20 to March 29, 1961, Pride poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Murray\u2019s bank accounts, in cut-price payment of outstanding bills, while <em>pari passu </em>Pagano withdrew $747,000 as the deposits were being made. The money-drawing operation began on the morning of March 20 when Pagano and Stanley Weinberg went to Murray\u2019s bank \u2014 the Royal State, located in the East Bronx, to cash a check for $50,000 payable to Pagano\u2019s order, drawn by a Murray clerk at Stanley\u2019s direction, and signed for Murray by both Pagano and Stanley. At the bank\u2019s branch office, Stanley told an officer that the withdrawal was \u201cneed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ed to pay- some trade bills\u201d and the check was cashed. Later the same afternoon, an additional $50,000 was withdrawn from the Murray account at the Royal State Bank under similar circumstances. But, when Pagano and Stanley sought to withdraw still another $50,000 on Tuesday, March 21, they were refused by a bank officer who advised them that the Royal Bank would not continue paying out large sums of cash against uncollected funds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Undaunted by the Royal Bank\u2019s prudence, Pagano opened another account for Murray at the Commercial Bank of North America, located on Fifth Avenue in midtown Manhattan. Pride already maintained an account with the Commercial Bank and it was either Castel-lana or Sciandra who telephoned the Bank, on behalf of Pride, recommending acceptance of the new Murray account. Later that day, Wednesday, March 22, Sciandra \u2014 a frequent depositor of Pride checks \u2014 introduced Pagano to the Bank\u2019s officers, telling them that the Murray account was being opened to facilitate cashing checks drawn against Pride de-in the same Bank. Within the space of one week, Pagano withdrew $645,000 from the Murray account in the Commercial Bank by cashing checks which, like those brought to the Royal Bank, were payable to him and signed by Stanley and himself. During this period Sciandra regularly delivered Pride checks drawn to Murray\u2019s account to the Bank, where he joined Pagano in watching a bank officer make out Murray deposit slips and then stood by as Pagano withdrew roughly comparable sums from the Murray account, thus completing the circle around which the money flowed. When a bank officer sought some explanation for Pagano\u2019s large withdrawals, Sciandra disingenuously replied that it was the \u201cheight of the [Easter] season and large purchases have to be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The most significant evidence introduced by the Government on this phase of the case established that the Pride checks deposited to Murray\u2019s account in the Commercial Bank during this ten-day period were almost equal in daily and total amounts to Pagano\u2019s withdrawals. Thus, the record discloses the following</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">Castellana-Pride Cash withdrawals deposits to from Date Murray\u2019s accounts Murray\u2019s accounts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avk-dedup-0\">March 20..., $ 93,156.46 $100,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ-\">March 21____ ....... 75,000.00 (attempted $ 50,000.00)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS8\">March 22____ ....... 40,000.00 35,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aiv-dedup-0\">March 23..., ....... 50,000.00 50,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac6\">March 24____ ....... 125,000.00 127,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aeq-dedup-0\">March 27.... ....... 241,930.95 250,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO5W\">March 28____ ....... 90,000.00 125,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">March 29..., ....... 35,000.00 60,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9c\">Totals____ ....... $750,087.41 $747,000.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">These transactions transposed Pride\u2019s debt to Murray of $441,000 as of March 20 into a credit balance of approximately $78,000 by March 29,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> despite additional purchases during the ten-day period by Castellana\u2019s company. Three noteworthy factors rounded out the Government\u2019s proof concerning this brief but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>important time span: (1) A Pride accountant testified that the checks drawn to Murray\u2019s account were unusual for the company in that they were often for amounts exceeding $25,000, frequently were in round figures, and many times were certified, permitting immediate withdrawal. (2) At the same time, Stanley Weinberg furnished Pagano with several checks of differing amounts on particular days so that he might withdraw whatever sum happened to be in the Commercial Bank account at the time Sciandra delivered the Pride checks. (3) Finally, about one-fifth or $150,-000 of the Pride deposits derived from a short-term loan which Castellana negotiated with a factor who, in early 1960, had a lending arrangement with Murray, but with whom Castellana himself had never dealt before and with whom he never did business again. Pride received the- money (two-thirds in certified checks) on March 27, 1961, deposited it promptly in Murray\u2019s account at the Commercial Bank, and repaid the factor by April 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">While Pagano was thus siphoning off the proceeds of Murray\u2019s sharply increased sales to Pride, Newman and the Weinbergs continued to step up purchases from their suppliers, all the time freely but falsely assuring them of payment in due course. Indeed, the appellants concede that Newman and Joseph Weinberg cajoled some suppliers to ship more goods when they were aware that Pagano\u2019s withdrawals were fast putting Murray in a precarious financial condition. For example, when the poultry suppliers who dealt with Newman came to see him about unpaid bills, he uniformly assuaged their fears with assurances that there was \u201cnothing to worry about.\" Instead of mentioning Pagano\u2019s withdrawals or the depleted capital situation of the company, he sought to explain away the delayed payments by referring to a comparatively inconsequential $30,-' 000 error in Murray\u2019s Royal State Bank account. There was also evidence, in the form of bank records and testimony by Murray\u2019s supplier-creditors, to establish that Newman and the Weinbergs gave false excuses that checks were already in the mail, that Stanley permitted checks amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars and payable to suppliers to accumulate unsigned on his desk, and that stop orders totaling more than $75,-000 were issued by the corporation\u2019s secretary-treasurer on many of the checks actually sent out during March. The situation was further aggravated when, at Pagano\u2019s request, Stanley issued credit memoranda to Castellana even though he knew that Pagano was personally drawing off the company\u2019s liquid assets. By the end of the fatal month of March 1961 Murray\u2019s suppliers, having been thoroughly deceived by the Weinbergs and Newman, were drained of approximately $1,300,000. This sum represented outstanding bills that would never be paid because Pagano had virtually emptied the meat packing company\u2019s bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Not until after Pagano\u2019s final withdrawal of $60,000 on March 29 did the conspiracy enter its penultimate phase when Joseph Weinberg consulted a lawyer-friend, Abe Platt, seeking a remedy for the financial debacle caused by the rapid-fire withdrawals. Platt testified that he attended meetings with Newman, the Weinbergs, Pagano and Castellana at a Manhattan restaurant at which they discussed the possibility of initiating settlement- negotiations with the defrauded creditors. They decided to retain a bankruptcy lawyer, Harris Levin, who proceeded to work out a tentative settlement arrangement with the suppliers whereby Murray would pay 40% of its total indebtedness and post $100,-000 as a good faith down payment. Between April 3, when the plan was approved, and April 5, $100,000 was brought to Platt\u2019s office by a friend of Pagano, one Dominick Cirillo, and deposited in a special account in a downtown Manhattan commercial bank under Levin\u2019s name. Three days later, however, at another restaurant meeting, Platt was advised that Murray could not go forward with the proposed settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>because the final total indebtedness of $1,300,000 exceeded the anticipated liabilities by $200,000. Then, with Levin\u2019s authorization, Platt joined Cirillo and Sciandra when they withdrew the $100,-000 from the special account at the bank, the latter two dividing the money and leaving the bank separately; the sum was, of course, never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">After it was clear that the settlement talks had failed, Murray\u2019s creditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy on April 11, 1961. But this did not mean a cessation of the defendants\u2019 fraudulent activities, for Pagano and Stanley Weinberg deposited $12,000 \u2014 the substantial portion of the bare remains withdrawn six days earlier from Murray\u2019s account at the Royal State Bank (admittedly to escape attachment) \u2014 in a special escrow account to be managed by Platt in his name. Thereafter, the Weinbergs directed Platt to issue checks from the special account; $6,000 was given to Pa-gano, allegedly to pay the expenses of a fund-raising trip he made, with the Weinbergs, Cirillo and Platt, to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Palm Springs. Platt testified, however, that in so far as he knew no efforts were made to raise funds, but instead the money was spent largely on golf courses, gambling, self-indulgence and entertainment. And, notwithstanding the filing of the bankruptcy petition, Stanley Weinberg and Pagano opened another bank account for Murray in a Mount Vernon, New York, bank, using Platt\u2019s address without his authorization. Ostensibly, the purpose of the account was to receive Murray collections. With full knowledge of what had transpired in late March, Stanley permitted Pagano to be made sole signatory of this new account.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Murray was adjudged a bankrupt on May 11, 1961, owing a total of approximately $1,300,000 to some 85 creditors. The corporation's assets totaled $1,060,-442.15, of which $745,000 were promissory notes from Pagano, $268,692.15 were accounts receivable, and the remainder of its assets totaled less than $50,000. The eight-count indictment was returned in May 1963. By then, most of the principals had been examined in proceedings before a Referee in Bankruptcy and Murray\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy had brought a civil action against the individual defendants and others alleging a conspiracy to defraud Murray and its creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Admissibility of Prior Sworn Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The trial court, exhibiting meticulous care, permitted the introduction of admissions previously made by the individual defendants (except Pagano) in the civil case depositions and Section 21, sub. a bankruptcy examinations, carefully and repeatedly admonishing the jurors, except for one trivial exception, that the statements were to be weighed as evidence only as against the particular declarant. We see no basis for finding, as the defendants contend, that these statements were improperly received as admissions, or that they were privileged, or that there was a harmful spill-over effect against the co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Significantly, the admissions were not received until the Government produced independent proof of the existence of the conspiracy and also introduced independent extrinsic evidence regarding the subject matter of the defendants\u2019 pre-trial statements. Both before and after each statement was admitted and in his charge prior to submission of the case to the jurors, the trial judge scrupulously pointed out that the out-of-court statements \u2014 although given under oath with opportunity for cross-examination by each of the appellants \u2014 could be considered only against the particular defendant who made the admission. There was, in other words, strict adherence to the rule laid down in United States v. Bufalino, 285 F.2d 408 (2 Cir. 1960), that proof in a mass conspiracy trial must be individualized and compartmentalized, defendant by defendant and count by count. See also United States v. Dardi, 330 F.2d 316 (2 Cir.), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>denied, 379 U.S. 845, 85 S.Ct. 50, 13 L.Ed.2d 50 (1964); United States v. Agueci, 310 F.2d 817, 99 A.L.R.2d 478 (2 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 959, 83 S.Ct. 1013, 10 L.Ed.2d 11 (1963); United States v. Stromberg, 268 F.2d 256 (2 Cir.), cert. denied 361 U.S. 863, 80 S.Ct. 119, 4 L.Ed.2d 102 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">A. Although citing no explicit statutory or case authority to support their position, Joseph Weinberg and David Newman advance the technical claim that their admissions were privileged under Section 7, sub. a(10) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 25 sub. a(10), which provides that \u201cno testimony given by [the bankrupt] shall be offered in evidence against him in any criminal proceeding, except such testimony as may be given by him in the hearing upon objections to his discharge.\u201d We believe, however, that a reasonable construction of the statutory scheme does not permit either Newman or Joseph Weinberg to utilize this limitation because neither was \u201cthe bankrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We learn from the leading treatise-writer that before 1938 there was a split of authority as to whether the officer of a bankrupt corporation was permitted to invoke the protection of Section 7. 1 Collier, Bankruptcy 1020 n. 27 (14th ed. 1962). This Court, for example, in Kaplan v. United States, 7 F.2d 594 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 269 U.S. 582, 46 S. Ct. 107, 70 L.Ed. 423 (1925), ruled that the controlling figures in a bankrupt corporation and their co-conspirators did not come under the umbrella of the privilege. But, in 1938 Congress added Section 7, sub. b to the Act, providing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">Where the bankrupt is a corporation, its officers, the members of its board of directors or trustees or of other similar controlling bodies, its stockholders or members, or such of them as may be designated by the court, shall perform the duties imposed upon the bankrupt by this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">This statutory change, we are told, \u201capparently resolved the uncertainty, making it clear that the privilege does apply to [an officer of a bankrupt], <em>at least when the court designates him to perform the duties of the </em>bankrupt.\u201d 1 Collier, Bankruptcy 1020 (14th ed. 1962) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">As we read the cases, a meaningful distinction, rooted in the statutory language, should be drawn between the corporate officer who testifies voluntarily, and thus cannot claim the privilege, and the one who, having been <em>directed </em>to appear by the bankruptcy court, has thereby been \u201cdesignated by the court [to] perform the duties imposed upon the bankrupt by this title.\u201d Thus, in United States v. Weissman, 219 F.2d 837 (2 Cir. 1955), we held that the Section 7 privilege could be invoked by the sole owner of a number of corporations who was the \u201conly person financially interested in any of them,\u201d with \u201cabsolute control of their conduct,\u201d even where \u201che was neither an officer, a director, nor indeed even a shareholder of record in any of them.\u201d Judge Learned Hand, writing for the Court, distinguished the earlier decision in In re Bush Terminal Co., 102 F.2d 471 (2 Cir., 1939), holding that a former stockholder director of the debtor, who had never been an officer and who gave up his directorship and shareholdings more than three years before a reorganization petition was filed, could not lawfully be examined under Section 7. Judge Hand noted that Bush Terminal did not concern anyone who had been \u201cdesignated by the court\u201d to perform the bankrupt\u2019s duties. In contrast he observed that Weissman was <em>directed </em>by a Referee to sign the bankrupt\u2019s schedules in bankruptcy and therefore came under the protection of Section 7, sub. b as one of the \u201cstockholders or members\u201d who was \u201cdesignated by the court\u201d to \u201cperform the duties imposed upon the bankrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">Under the circumstances of this case, however, it is clear that Newman and Joseph Weinberg were not performing the bankrupt\u2019s statutorily-imposed duties when they were examined. It was not their \u201cduty\u201d to testify in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>these proceedings, nor were they designated or directed to perform any of the bankrupt\u2019s other duties. In any event, the privilege against self-incrimination was available to them and could have been invoked during their testimony in the 21(a) examinations, Arndstein v. McCarthy, 254 U.S. 71, 41 S.Ct. 26, 65 L.Ed. 138 (1920), if they determined to do so, thus adequately protecting their rights. A broader interpretation of the Section 7 immunity under these circumstances would encourage falsification for exculpatory purposes with all advantages to those engaged in defrauding creditors and with every disadvantage to the latter group. Cf. United States v. Epstein, D.C., 152 F.Supp. 583, 586-588 &amp; 587 n. 12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is interesting furthermore that Section 7, sub. b, in merely stating who may be designated to perform the duties imposed upon a corporate bankrupt, makes no explicit reference to extension of the Section 7, sub. a(10) privilege. Thus, we believe that Section 7, sub. b cannot be read in a vacuum and must be considered in the light of Section 7, sub. a as conferring immunity only if the director or shareholder is specifically designated to perform the bankrupt\u2019s duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"> Turning to the use of Stanley Weinberg\u2019s prior admissions, we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that by filing the required bankruptcy schedules as Murray\u2019s secretary-treasurer, he came within the statutory definition of \u201cthe bankrupt\u201d and thus was entitled to invoke the Section 7 privilege. Nevertheless, there was no occasion to resort to that privilege because no part of Stanley\u2019s 21(a) examination was introduced and the section does not apply to the deposition testimony, given in separate related civil litigation and read into the record. We see no reason to broaden the privilege so that it encompasses private civil case discovery examinations. The purpose of the privilege \u2014 assuring complete disclosure in those proceedings where the Government and the public have a vital interest \u25a0 \u2014 is adequately served if Section 7, sub. a (10) is limited, as construed above, to officers or others designated to perform the bankrupt\u2019s statutorily-delineated duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">B. Nor is there any basis to the claim that, notwithstanding the trial judge\u2019s repeated cautionary instructions, the admissions had a prejudicial spillover effect on the defendants other than the declarant. On the record before us, where more protection was afforded the defendants than in Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957), the holding there is clearly dispositive of this issue. In Delli Paoli the appellant contended that reversible error was committed in receiving a co-defendant\u2019s confession without deleting references implicating himself and other confederates. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, noting that the trial court clearly stated\u2014 indeed, emphatically warned \u2014 that the confession was to be considered only in determining the guilt of the confessor and not that of the other defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The rationale is applicable with greater force to the case before us for \u201c[ujnless we proceed on the basis that the jury will follow the court\u2019s instructions where those instructions are clear and the circumstances are such that the jury can reasonably be expected to follow them, the jury system makes little sense.\u201d 352 U.S. at 242, 77 S.Ct. at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We have already indicated that the foregoing principle is more readily applicable to this case. Here, the Government did not introduce any prior admissions as devastatingly incriminating as the signed confession of Delli Paoli\u2019s confederate. Eather the statements disavowed any intentional wrongdoing and were introduced simply to show an awareness of what was transpiring which, when conjoined with the declar-ants\u2019 actual conduct, supported the findings of guilty knowledge. And, several additional factors persuasively indicate that there was no prejudicial spill-over effect: (1) Each defendant played a separately defined role in the conspiracy and the individual interest of each was constantly emphasized by the court. (2) The prior statements were received only after the trial court determined that <em>other </em>independent evidence as to the same subject matter was already in the record; illustrations are the testimony of bank officers concerning the March withdrawals, as well as the actual withdrawal checks and bookkeeping figures showing the extraordinary escalation of purchases and sales rising to the apex in mid-March. (3) Finally, the record nowhere indicates that the jury misunderstood or was in any way confused by the limiting instructions. Indeed, it is interesting to note that the jurors, during their deliberations, never asked to see the transcripts of the 21(a) examinations or the depositions, but instead first called for those exhibits that might be exculpatory and then for the highly incriminating stop-payment orders issued by Stanley Weinberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">In sum, having balanced the probative value of the pre-trial admissions, in a case where circumstantial evidence of knowledge and intent was substantial and critical, against the possible prejudicial effect on the co-defendants, we are persuaded that the trial court wisely exercised its broad discretion in ruling in favor of admissibility with prudent limiting instructions that adequately protected the rights of all parties. Model Code of Evidence rule 303 (1942). As in Delli Paoli, supra, the instructions were sufficiently clear and it was reasonably possible for the jury to follow them. No reversible error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">C. The single exception to the trial court\u2019s firm policy of admitting the prior statements only as against the declarant forms the basis of Castellana\u2019s complaint that error was committed in permitting introduction of a statement by Stanley Weinberg, made during his civil case deposition testimony, to the effect that Castellana was present at one of the April restaurant meetings at which settlement was discussed. At the trial, Castellana denied attending any such meetings. The prosecution, in rebuttal, then offered Stanley\u2019s prior sworn statement in which he said that he recalled attending a restaurant meeting with Castellana, who was present because \u201cwe had developed a very friendly relationship toward the end of the business situation * * * and I knew he was very interested in what was happening to us.\u201d In this particular instance \u2014 and only this instance \u2014 the testimony was received against Stanley and Castellana as well. We find that, in light of all the circumstances present in this case, this minor incident in connection with an isolated situation did not rise to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Initially, it is questionable whether any error was committed for we have held that a statement \u2014 made during and in furtherance of a continuing conspiracy \u2014 falls within the long-recognized co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule, even in the absence of a conspiracy count and when offered as proof on a substantive count. United States v. Marchisio, 344 F.2d 653 (2 Cir. April 9, 1965). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>And Judge Clark remarked in United States v. Switzer, 252 F.2d 139, 142-143 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 357 U.S. 922, 78 S.Ct. 1363, 2 L.Ed.2d 1366 (1958), it is reasonable to assume, in connection with schemes to transfer assets to defeat the bankruptcy laws and defraud creditors, that post-transfer concealment is an integral part of the original unlawful agreement. Furthermore, the traditional objections to hearsay evidence are particularly inappropriate in this situation because the reliability of the deposition testimony was assured, insofar as possible, by the fact that it was under oath, transcribed and later signed, cf. United States v. DeSisto, 329 F.2d 929 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 979, 84 S.Ct. 1885, 12 L.Ed.2d 747 (1964), and Castellana had an opportunity to cross-examine Stanley at the time the deposition was taken. We are loath to reduce the corpus of hearsay rules to a strait-jacketing, hypertechnical body of semantical slogans to be mechanically invoked regardless of the reliability of the proffered evidence. Instead, \u201cwe should indeed welcome,\u201d as Judge Learned Hand once wrote, \u201cany efforts that help disentagle us from the archaisms that still impede our pursuit of truth.\u201d United States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., 241 F.2d 925, 934 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 984, 77 S.Ct. 1282, 1 L.Ed.2d 1143 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">But, our decision does not rest on this ground for we are convinced that any error which might have been committed was, on the record before us, harmless. Given the overwhelming evidence of Castellana\u2019s guilt, we are convinced that the jury\u2019s guilty verdict was not \u201csubstantially swayed by the error,\u201d Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 765, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), or that there is even \u201ca reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d Fahy v. State of Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 230, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">In United States v. Guerra, 334 F.2d 138 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 936, 85 S.Ct. 337, 13 L.Ed.2d 346 (1964), we found that no prejudice could possibly have resulted from the admission of defendant Rivera\u2019s post-indictment statements made in the absence of counsel under circumstances that required exclusion by virtue of Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964). The error charged there was but a fly-speck on one page of a 900-page trial record; here the purported error can fairly be described as only a \u201cneedle in the haystack\u201d of a transcript that runs to more than 3,000 pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Indeed, when Stanley\u2019s statement was admitted to rebut Castellana\u2019s self-serving denials, the record already included testimony from Platt that Castellana had attended several early April settlement discussions with Pagano, Newman, and the Weinbergs, at a midtown Manhattan restaurant. Moreover, the insignificant item introduced from Stanley\u2019s deposition had minimal rebuttal effect because he did not say who else attended the meeting, but instead explained Castel-lana\u2019s presence in his favor, stating that he was invited because of his friendly interest in Murray\u2019s travails. In fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the trial judge in summarizing the evidence in his charge noted that Stanley did not state that Platt was present at the particular meeting to which the rebuttal testimony referred. Most important of all, the Government\u2019s case against Castellana was firmly established by highly probative, cumulative testimony, quite apart from the inconsequential question whether or not he attended a restaurant meeting with Stanley Weinberg in April 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">To paraphrase what we said in United States v. Guerra, supra, reversal of Castellana\u2019s conviction by mechanical or <em>per se </em>invocation of the much-maligned hearsay rule, see generally McCormick, Evidence, ch. 25 (1954), would transform a meaningful expression of concern that jurors be confronted with reliable evidence into a meaningless mechanism for the obstruction of justice. The harmless error principle, as embodied in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 and Fed.R. Crim.P. 52(a), prevents such results by assuring that courts of review do not \u201ctower above the trials of criminal cases as impregnable citadels of technicality.\u201d Kavanagh, \u201cImprovement of Administration of Criminal Justice by Exercise of Judicial Power,\u201d 11 A.B.A.J. 217, 222 (1925). In applying the rule to this case, we simply follow the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaK\">to substitute judgment for automatic application of rules; to preserve review as a check upon arbitrary action and essential unfairness in trials, but at the same time to make the process perform that function without giving men fairly convicted the multiplicity of loopholes which any highly rigid and minutely detailed scheme of errors, especially in relation to procedure, will engender and reflect in a printed record. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. at 760, 66 S.Ct. at 1245.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Additional Questions</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The appellants\u2019 remaining contentions deserve only summary treatment. Evidence of the April 1961 activities was properly admitted because the transactions and occurrences \u2014 the settlement conferences and the disappearance of an additional $112,000\u2014 were in furtherance of the conspiracy to defraud Murray\u2019s creditors by fraudulently transferring the company\u2019s assets. Once this was established, Platt\u2019s testimony concerning the post-withdrawal activities did not invade the attorney-client privilege, as Newman and the Weinbergs contend, because the communications were made while perpetrating a fraud. 8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2298 (McNaughton Rev. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Furthermore, our examination of the court\u2019s charge reveals no merit to Castellana\u2019s contention that the jury was not properly instructed on the need to prove that each of the individual defendants knowingly and fraudulently caused the transfers of Murray funds to Pagano. The jurors were correctly advised that the Government was required to establish knowledge on the part of each defendant of the objectives of the conspiracy \u2014 to defeat the bankruptcy law or to defraud Murray\u2019s creditors. Similarly, the theory that Pagano acted alone in fraudulently transferring Murray\u2019s assets was brought home to the jurors by the constantly reiterated admonitions that the evidence against each defendant should be considered independently and separately. The Court also restated the respective contentions that Castellana, Newman and the Weinbergs had nothing to do with the payments to Pagano and did not aid him in withdrawing the money from Murray\u2019s accounts at the Royal and Commercial Banks between March 20 and March 29, 1961. Indeed, the trial judge spelled out the Newman-Weinberg defense that they could do nothing to stop Pagano\u2019s withdrawals and that his control of the company handcuffed them, despite their efforts to induce him to return what he had taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Nor was there error in the court\u2019s charge that the jury might find the defendants guilty of the substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>counts if they were members of the conspiracy at the time of the withdrawals and the withdrawals were in furtherance of the conspiracy. Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 643-648, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946); Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 618, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919 (1949). Finally, failure to note any objection precludes assigning as error the claim here that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that a co-conspirator\u2019s acts and declarations, made in furtherance of the conspiracy, may ser\u201de as evidence against his co-defendants only with respect to the conspiracy count. In any event, we recently held, in United States v. Accardi, 342 F.2d 697, 700 (2 Cir. 1965), that such statements may properly be considered against a co-defendant <em>on the substantive counts </em>once the jury finds, by independent proof, that a conspiracy existed in which the defendant was a member and that his statements were made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In reviewing a similarly complex multi-defendant conspiracy case we commented that \u201c[i]n a trial of this dimension, each juror is faced with a difficult task in compartmentalizing the evidence with regard to each particular defendant and keeping clearly in mind the full circumstances of each transaction.\u201d United States v. Agueci, 310 F.2d 817, 829, 99 A.L.R.2d 478 (2 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 959, 83 S.Ct. 1013, 10 L.Ed.2d 11 (1963). Here, as there, the trial judge \u201cpatiently and capably\u201d discharged the \u201cburden of impressing upon the jury the need for judging each defendant separately\u201d so that \u201cjustice [might] be meted out to the individual rather than to the group.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Appellants\u2019 other allegations have been considered and rejected, and are too insubstantial to warrant discussion. The judgments of conviction as to all of the defendants are hereby affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-12\">. The sentences were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">Castellana \u2014 5 years on each count, to run concurrently; $10,000 fine on conspiracy count; $5,000 fine on each substantive count; defendant to stand committed until total fine is paid or he is otherwise discharged by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">Newman \u2014 15 months on each count, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">Joseph Weinberg \u2014 1 year on each count, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-21\">Stanley Weinberg \u2014 1 year on each count, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-22\">Gondolfo Sciandra \u2014 18 months on each count, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-23\">Pagano \u2014 5 years on each count, to run concurrently; $10,000 fine on conspiracy count; $5,000 fine on each substantive count; defendant to stand committed until total fine is paid or he is otherwise discharged by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-24\">Pride Wholesale Meat &amp; Poultry Corp. \u2014$10,000 fine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">. The Government\u2019s proof established that Pride\u2019s March purchases from Murray almost doubled those for February. The jury could reasonably reject Castellana\u2019s claim that this increase was traceable to the Easter-Passover season, for it was shown that during the same seasons in 1960 and 1962 Pride\u2019s purchases actually declined when compared with the preceding months. Moreover, in November 1960 Murray sold to Pride only about $1,000 of its approximate $258,000 total sales and for December 1960 sales to Pride amounted to about $139,000 of a gross volume of about $340,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-10\">. In January 1961 there were, according to the Government\u2019s proof, 128 transactions between Murray and Pride, with Castel-lana taking 92 price reductions totaling about $5,000. More significantly, the pattern of reductions increased markedly during the period from March 20 to March 29, 1961, when Pagano was withdrawing large sums from Murray\u2019s bank accounts. The weekly figures were as follows: March 3 \u2014 5 reductions out of 54 transactions; March 10 \u2014 45 out of 125; March 17 \u2014 29 out of 58; March 24 \u2014 35 out of 49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\">. The Royal Bank made one minor exception to this declared policy, cashing on March 24 a relatively small Murray check for $2,000 drawn to Pagano\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b316-11\">. At the close of the month, the Pride-Murray account substantially balanced due to continued transactions between the two corporations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b320-5\">. The Epstein case involved a conviction for using the mails to send false and fraudulent financial statements to persons from or through whom the defendant wished to secure credit, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. In post-trial motions the defendant, citing Section 7, sub. a(10), contended that error was committed in admitting portions of the testimony he gave before a Referee in Bankruptcy at special Section 21(a) meetings held after creditors filed an involuntary petition in bankruptcy. The court, citing McCarthy v. Arndstein, supra, rejected this argument, noting that since there was no duty to testify in the 21(a) examination, even though Epstein was directed to appear by the bankruptcy court, the testimony was not privileged. \u201c[A]ny testimony of the bankrupt given at an examination under * * * Section [7 of the Bankruptcy Act, which details the duties of the bankrupt], being compulsory, may be privileged,\u201d the court wrote, \u201c [bJut testimony under \u00a7 21 is given by the bankrupt as it would be by any other witness in a proceeding in which it is not made his duty to testify, and, therefore, it is not privileged.\u201d 152 F.Supp. at 587-588. See also In Matter of Mutual Security Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, Inc., 214 F.Supp. 877 (D.Md.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b322-5\">. Our dissenting brother votes to reverse Castellana\u2019s conviction because we \u201chave no way of knowing * * * what weight the jury may have given to this evidence.\" But if this lack of absolute certainty requires reversal of every conviction, no matter how <em>de minimis </em>the error may have been, we would be required to reverse most criminal convictions. Such a rule would repeal <em>sub silentio </em>the harmless error doctrine, as embodied in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111 and Fed Jt.Crim.P. 52(a).
