Seven years later, Kenney\u2019s two children, sued in admiralty for the wrongful death of their father. They rely on Article 2315 of the Louisiana Civil Code creating an action for wrongful death. Unfortunately for the children, Article 2315 limits the right of action to one year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The libellants contend that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>the maritime doctrine of laches their delay in suing is excusable. They say that they were minors at the time of their father\u2019s death, and that their mother, their natural tutrix, was advised by friends and relatives that she had to wait seven years before the death of her husband could be legally established. The question this case presents is whether in an admiralty proceeding the maritime doctrine of excusable laches can keep alive a state-created right of action for wrongful death that, according to state law, has expired. The district court dismissed the action on the libellee\u2019s motion for a summary judgment. Because of the \u201cstrange principle\u201d that applicability of federal maritime law to a maritime tort on a state\u2019s navigable waters depends on whether the injury was fatal or non-fatal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we are compelled to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">A. Disposing of certain preliminary matters, we note, first, that in general maritime law, historically, a seaman\u2019s right to sue for personal injuries sustained as a result of a maritime accident died with the seaman. A similar archaic rule existed in the common law and was not changed in England until the passage of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, the Fatal Accidents Act of 1846. Every state now has a wrongful death statute, but Congress has given only partial relief to a seaman\u2019s surviving dependents by adopting two limited wrongful death statutes. These are the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, giving a seaman or his personal representative the right to sue his employer, and the Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C. 761 et seq., creating a cause of action for any wrongful death \u201coccurring on the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore of any State\u201d. Neither statute is applicable to the facts of this case. The only basis for an action for the wrongful death of a seaman on territorial waters within a state (other than an action against an employer) is a state\u2019s wrongful death statute. The Harrisburg, 1886, 119 U.S. 199, 7 S.Ct. 140, 30 L.Ed. 358; Butler v. Boston <em>&amp; </em>Savannah S.S. Co., 1889, 130 U.S. 527, 555, 9 S.Ct. 612, 32 L.Ed. 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">B. If the plaintiffs may resort to the maritime doctrine of excusable laches, the court below should not have decided the issue on summary judgment. Larios v. Victory Carriers, Inc., 2 Cir. 1963, 316 F.2d 63. Compare McDaniel v. Gulf &amp; South American Steamship Co., 5 Cir. 1955, 228 F.2d 189, with Morales v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 5 Cir. 1953, 208 F.2d 218. The issue of laches depends on the facts and is addressed to the discretion of the trial , court. Czaplicki v. S.S.

It is clear that in an admiralty case the Court is not bound by Erie and Klaxon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 1953, 346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143; Levinson v. Deupree, 1953, 345 U.S. 648, 73 S.Ct. 914; 97 L.Ed. 1319. In Levinson v. Deupree, involving a state-created cause of action, the Court observed that \u201cErie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 [58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188], is irrelevant; [in such cases] The court in this case was not, \u2018in effect, only another court of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>State\u2019.\u201d In Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, a diversity suit, the Court declined to apply Erie to a federally-created cause of action (a maritime tort); the Court held that a state rule of contributory negligence was inapplicable to a suit by a carpenter for an injury sustained aboard a ship in navigable waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The contention that a seaman\u2019s dependents may resort to the doctrine of excusable laches to avoid limitations in a state wrongful death act has led a shadowy existence in dicta ever since The Harrisburg. In The Harrisburg the Supreme Court applied the state statute of limitations but reserved the laches question, intimating that in a proper ease the doctrine might apply: \u201cNo question arises in this case as to the power of a court of admiralty to allow an equitable excuse for delay in suing, because no excuse of any kind has been shown.\u201d 119 U.S. at 214, 7 S.Ct. at 147. In Mejia v. United States, 5 Cir. 1946, 152 F.2d 686, cert. den\u2019d 382 U.S. 862, this Court applied the Louisiana one year limitation period in a case based on the Louisiana action for wrongful death. Judge Borah, speaking for the Court, emphasized the peremptive aspect of Article 2315 but noted, \u201cNo equitable reason is set forth in appellants\u2019 motion to amend sufficient to justify the delay in the filing of the libel\u201d. 152 F.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">The question The Harrisburg left open could be said to have been decided by implication in Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 1921, 257 U.S. 233, 42 S.Ct. 89, 66 L.Ed. 210.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the facts in Garcia, the dependents of a stevedore killed on board a vessel had a strong case for application of the doctrine of excusable laches: the California statute of limitations had run while the administrator of Garcia\u2019s estate had pursued a state compensation remedy later annulled on the authority of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 1917, 244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086. The Court held that expiration of the statutory period extinguished the right of action: \u201cTime has been made of the essence of the right, and the right is lost if time is disregarded. * * * The limitations of the remedy are, therefore, to be treated as limitations of the right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-18\">The language in the Garcia opinion and the rationale underlying it support the basic principle, spelled out in The Tungus, that when a state\u2019s wrongful death act is relied on in admiralty, all of the pertinent substantive law of the state rides with the libel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In The Tungus v. Skovgaard, 1959, 358 U.S. 588, 79 S.Ct. 503, 3 L.Ed.2d 524, a maintenance foreman for a stevedoring company, while on board of the Tungus, slipped, fell, and breathed his last in a tank of hot coconut oil. A majority of the Court held that the New Jersey statute creating a right of action where death is caused \u201cby a wrongful act, neglect or default\u201d encompasses an action for death caused by unseaworthiness. Mr. Justice Stewart, for the Court, rejected the \u201cbroad argument\u201d that the Court \u201cdisregard completely the conditions which the State has put upon the right it created\u201d. After quoting from The Harrisburg, the Court said: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-19\">\u201cThe decisions of this Court long ago established that when admiralty adopts a State\u2019s right of action for wrongful death, it must enforce the right as an integrated whole, with whatever conditions and limitations the creating State has attached. * * * The legislative history of the Death on the High Seas Act discloses a clear congressional purpose to leave \u2018unimpaired the rights under State statutes as to deaths on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>waters within the territorial jurisdiction of the States.\u2019 S.Rep.No. 215, 66th Cong., 1st Sess. 3; H.R. Rep.No.674, 66th Cong., 2d Sess. 3. The record of the debate in the House of Representatives preceding passage of the bill reflects deep concern that the power of the States to create actions for wrongful death in no way be affected by enactment of the federal law. 59 Cong.Rec. 4482-4486.\u201d The Tungus v. Skovgaard358 U.S. 588, 593, 79 S.Ct. 503, 506.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The rational basis for The Tungus, The Harrisburg, and this case is a conflict of laws approach. The court of the forum enforcing a right created under the laws of another jurisdiction must give effect to the right as it is defined in that other jurisdiction. As in conflict's generally, however, there are exceptions. Thus, a state\u2019s substantive law will not be enforced if it detracts from a right created by federal maritime law. Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., 1942, 317 U.S. 239, 63 S.Ct. 246, 87 L.Ed. 239. And purely procedural provisions may be overlooked. Levinson v. Deupree, 345 U.S. 648, 73 S.Ct. 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Levinson v. Deupree, 345 U.S. 648, 73 S.Ct. 914, underscores the Supreme Court\u2019s conflicts approach to the problem. In that case the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate brought a wrongful death action in the district court under a Kentucky statute, which had a one year limitation period. The administrator, by mistake, had been appointed to act in the wrong county. After a year had passed, he corrected the defect and moved to amend his pleadings accordingly. The district court held that the amendment was barred by the state statute of limitations, because a Kentucky court would not have permitted the amendment of the pleadings to relate back to the time of the original filing of the suit. The court of appeals reversed ; the Supreme Court affirmed. After pointing out that Erie was irrelevant, Justice Frankfurter, for the court, held that the district court should have enforced the state wrongful death statute as any court enforces a cause of action created under the statute of a <em>foreign </em>nation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-7\">\u201cThe District Court adopted and enforced the <em>obligatio </em>created by the State of Kentucky not because it sits in Kentucky and responds to the desirability of uniformity in the administration of justice within that State. In the absence of congressional action, the court adopted and enforced the <em>obligatio </em>created by Kentucky <em>as it would one originating in any foreign jurisdiction. </em>[Citing cases * * *] And it was bound to enforce it as it found it, but not bound beyond that to strive for uniformity of results in procedural niceties with the courts of the jurisdiction which originated the ob-ligatio. Even in diversity cases, when \u2018a right is enforceable in a federal as well as in a State court,\u2019 and the federal court sits as \u2018another court of the State,\u2019 we have recognized that \u2018the forms and mode of enforcing the right may at times, naturally enough, vary because the two judicial systems are not identic.\u2019 Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, supra, 326 U.S. at page 108, [65 S.Ct. 1464, at page 1469, 89 L.Ed. 2079], Whether, if this were a diversity case, we would consider that we are here dealing with \u2018forms and modes\u2019 or with matters more seriously affecting the enforcement of the right, it is clear that we are not dealing with an integral part of the right created by Kentucky.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 345 U.S. at 651-52, 73 S.Ct. at 916.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">In Bournias v. Atlantic Maritime Co., 2 Cir. 1955, 220 F.2d 152, Justice, then Judge, Harlan pointed out that Levinson v. Deupree established \u201cthe ground rules which govern a federal admiralty court in enforcing an <em>obligatio </em>created by Panamanian law.\u201d 220 F.2d 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">There is a persuasive analogy between the role of a federal court applying a state wrongful death statute and the role of a federal court applying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>wrongful death statute of a foreign state or nation. A court enforcing an obligation created by a foreign state is bound to enforce the obligation as it finds it, but is not \u201cbound by the dubious and perhaps conflicting intimations on <em>ele-gantia juris </em>to be found in local decisions\u201d and is not \u201cimprisoned by procedural niceties relating to amendment of pleadings\u201d. Levinson v. Deupree, 345 U.S. at 651, 73 S.Ct. at 916. Under usually accepted choice of laws'rules, procedural matters are governed by federal procedural law. If Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia is considered as- having established an outcome-determinative test in federal maritime suits under state wrongful death statutes, in effect, that case was overruled by Levinson v. Deu-pree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the other hand, substantive matters which are integral parts of the state-created right, such as the standard of care, must be governed by state law. As the Supreme Court explained in Hess, \u201c[Levinson v. Deupree] means that in an action for wrongful death in state territorial waters the conduct said to give rise to liability is to be measured not under admiralty\u2019s standards of duty, but under the substantive standards of the state law.\u201d Hess v. U. S. A., 1960, 361 U.S. 314, 80 S.Ct. 341, 4 L.Ed.2d 305, 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Levinson v. Deupree emphasizes the continuing importance of the familiar (if unclear and sometimes specious) distinction between procedure and substance. The crucial point here is whether the time limit imposed by Article 2315 of Louisiana Civil Code is a matter of substance or a matter of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Louisiana courts, and courts generally, distinguish between a period of limitation that is prescriptive and therefore procedural and one that is per-emptive, a condition of the right, and therefore substantive.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the court of the forum, the federal court determines when the statutory limitation bars the right and not merely the remedy, but it is guided in this determination by the attributes the state attaches to the limitation. See Restatement, Second, Conflict of Laws, Tentative Draft No. 9, \u00a7 605, Comment C.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">In Kozan v. Comstock, 5 Cir. 1959, 270 F.2d 839, 841, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-12\">\u201cArticle 13 of the Louisiana Code of Practice provides: \u2018The forms, the effects, and the prescription of actions, are governed by the law of the place where they are brought * * \u2019 This article expresses the general rule, supported by ample Louisiana authority, that prescription is procedural and the law of the forum governs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-13\">The principle that the prescriptive law of the forum governs is not without exceptions. If a foreign statute of limitations not only bars the remedy but extinguishes the substantive right as well, then the forum will apply the limitation period of the foreign jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">For example, in Page v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc., 5 Cir. 1958, 259 F.2d 420, 422, we held that the one year prescriptive period provided in Article 3536 of the Civil Code is a procedural restraint barring the remedy but not extinguishing the right. And in the recent case of Fidelity &amp; Casualty Company of New York v. C/B Mr. Kim, 5 Cir. 1965, 345 F.2d 45, the question was \u201cwhether a compensation insurer, as a Louisiana statutory subrogee, seeking reimburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>ment from a vessel and its owner as tortious third parties may maintain a libel filed after the expiration of the state prescriptive period in which suit could be filed by the injured employee\u201d. Judge Brown, for the Court, held that \u201cthe forum here is the Federal District Court in which the equitable doctrine of laches, not prescription, is controlling as to a maritime claim\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">On the other hand, as Judge Borah wrote in Mejia, the \u201cone-year limit of Article 2315 is not in the nature of a [statute of] limitation but is a peremption,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and, unless the right created by the Article is exercised within the one year period, it ceases to exist and is completely lost\u201d. 152 F.2d at 688. Thus, Article 2315 establishes an absolute peremption, not prescription, of the cause of action for one year; the period cannot be interrupted or continued beyond its term of one year. To the extent therefore that the libellants have a state-created right to recover under Article 2315 of the Louisiana Civil Code, that right ceased to exist when they failed to comply with the codal requirement of filing suit within one year from the date of their father\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In an analogous situation the Ninth Circuit has held that a ca\u00fcse of action for wrongful death occurring within California\u2019s territorial waters was subject to the California one-year limitation on an action for wrongful death and not the two-year limitation set forth in the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 745, Allen v. United States, 9 Cir. 1964, 338 F.2d 160. The Court reached this result, enforcing \u201cthe right as an integrated whole with whatever conditions and limitations the creating state has attached\u201d (The Tungus), even though the action was brought against the United States under the Public Vessels Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 781-790, incorporating the limitations of the Suits in Admiralty Act for certain purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">The principles we have discussed are consistent with generally accepted principles of conflict of laws. The Harrisburg holding that the statute of limitations of the forum does not apply to foreign wrongful death actions, because the foreign limitation period is an integral part of the foreign cause of action, formed one of the bases of the traditional choice of law rule in wrongful death cases. See Restatement, First, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 605;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Restatement, Second, Tentative Draft No. 9, \u00a7 391,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 397,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 605.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Tungus holding that state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>law governs the standard of care in negligence or unseaworthiness or both is the usual choice of law rule. Restatement, First, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 379, 380; Restatement, Second, \u00a7 379(a), Comment e, \u00a7 380. The standard of care itself is substantive, though some aspects of its application may be procedural and governed by the law of the forum. Restatement, First, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 595, Comment b; cf. Restatement, Second, \u00a7\u00a7 380, 598. The Levinson v. Deupree holding that whether an amendment to pleadings will have retroactive effect is a question of procedure to be determined by federal admiralty rules is the usual choice of law rule that matters concerning amendment of pleadings are procedural. Restatement, First, Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 592 and Comment a; Restatement, Second, \u00a7 592 and Comment a.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Long before the American Law Institute began to wrestle with protean Conflicts, Holmes and others had begun to attack the position that statutes of limitations are necessarily procedural. The defendant, Justice Holmes has pointed out, \u201cis entitled to the benefit of whatever conditions and limitations the foreign law creates. * * * [I]n cases where it has been possible to escape [characterization of prescription as procedural] by a reasonable distinction courts have been willing to treat limitations of time as standing like other limitations, and cutting down the defendant\u2019s liability whenever he is sued.\u201d Davis v. Mills, 1904, 194 U.S. 451, 24 S.Ct. 692, 48 L.Ed. 1067. Statutes of limitations and laches are the legal effects of conduct outside the courtroom. The state that creates the cause of action has an obvious interest in determining how long it can be enforced, but the forum has relatively little to set against the interest of the foreign state. There is something to be said for applying the prescriptive period of the forum if it is shorter than the foreign period: the courts of the forum should not be forced to decide stale claims merely because the foreign state has a longer period of limitation. But the forum has no particular interest in applying a <em>longer </em>period of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">In applying conflicts rules, courts reserve the right to refuse to enforce a foreign law if it is contrary to a strong public policy of the forum. But there is no strong policy of the forum requiring application of the doctrine of excusable laches to state wrongful death actions. For example, admiralty courts enforce strictly the limitations periods in the Jones Act and in the Death on the High Seas Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And in applying the doctrine of laches, federal courts are usually guided by the period of the analogous state statute of limitations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> After the statutory period has run, the libellant has the burden of proving that the delay has not prejudiced the respondent and that there is a good excuse to justify invocation of the doctrine. Vega v. The Malula, 5 Cir. 1961, 291 F.2d 415; McMahon v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., 5 Cir. 1962, 297 F.2d 268; Morales v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 5 Cir. 1953, 208 F.2d 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>We come at last to an end foretold many years ago by The Harrisburg. The doctrine of excusable laches is deeply engrained in the maritime law \u2014 here it could have been asserted, if the seaman had lost a limb instead of his life \u25a0 \u2014 but this doctrine must yield to the power of a state to set a time limit on a right of action the state creates. This limitation, as Louisiana courts construe it, is an integral part of the right of action for wrongful death Louisiana created by Article 2315 of the Civil Code. In a proceeding in the federal courts to enforce this state-created right, federal courts, on accepted principles of conflicts of laws, respect the time limitation as a substantive condition incident to the right, not a procedural nicety relating to the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Having reached a result we regard as compelled by <em>The Harrisburg, Garcia, The Tungus, Mejia, </em>and other decisions, and having rationalized our holding as any appellate court must, we feel that it is not inappropriate to make a few comments prompted by the topsy-turvy result we reach in this case. As Justice Brennan has pointed out, it <em>is </em>a \u201cstrange principle\u201d that requires a court to apply one law to a maritime tort when the injury is fatal and another law when the injury is not fatal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This vagary in the law seems especially indefensible in placing a shipowner in a better position when he is responsible for a seaman\u2019s death than when he is responsible for a seaman\u2019s injury short of death. Here the seaman\u2019s dependents were deprived of the benefits of the maritime doctrine of excusable laches. But, in the present state of the law, it is only by the grace of Louisiana that Kenney\u2019s dependents would have any right to bring an action for wrongful death for a maritime tort occurring on navigable waters within Louisiana or within one marine league of its borders. In other cases we have held that the Florida death statute does not allow recovery for death caused by unseaworthiness (Graham v. A. Lusi, Ltd., 5 Cir. (Florida) 1953, 206 F.2d 223) and that there is no recovery if the seaman is contributorily negligent (Byrd v. Napoleon Ave. Ferry Co., E.D.La. 1954, 125 F.Supp. 573, aff\u2019d 227 F.2d 958, cert. den\u2019d, 351 U.S. 925, 76 S.Ct. 783, 100 L.Ed. 1455). The Supreme Court holds that the Jones Act, providing a right of action for the death of a seaman caused by negligence, precludes recovery for unseaworthiness under a state wrongful death statute. Gillespie v. United States Steel Corporation, 1965, 379 U.S. 148, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">Legislative solution of the problem in the form of a comprehensive federal statute tied in with the Jones Act and the Death on High Seas Act would, of course, be the best solution. We suggest, however, with the utmost deference, that the dissenting justices in The Tungus and in Gillespie v. United States Steel Corporation may have pointed the way to an acceptable judicial solution. The difference between laches and the Louisiana time limit set in Article 2315 and the difference between the three year limitation in the Jones Act and the one year limitation in the Louisiana Civil Code are not necessarily part of a price that must be paid for the federal system. The duty breached seems to us to be grounded in federal maritime law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We submit, without elaborating the point, that the broad constitutional grant of jurisdiction to federal courts in \u201ccases of Admiralty and Maritime Jurisdiction\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> empowers federal courts to fashion a federal law of the sea permitting recovery for wrongful death on any navigable waters. The national interest in an effective merchant marine, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>growing importance of inland water transportation, and the increasing commercial activities on territorial waters, call for reconsideration of a federal court\u2019s powers in admiralty in wrongful death cases and the propriety of a uniform federal remedy for wrongful death occurring on a state\u2019s maritime waters. The State of Louisiana unquestionably has a legitimate interest in its citizens and in what happens to its citizens on the Mississippi River as it flows past New Orleans to the Gulf. But there is no improper federal intrusion in state affairs, if a federal remedy affords additional benefits to the dependents of a Louisiana seaman killed as a result of a maritime tort or breach of a maritime duty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-15\">.

The almost invariable prerequisite is that the liability sought to be enforced must have been created by statute. Once this requirement has been met, the usual test is whether, in the opinion of the forum, the limitation provision was directed to the right \u2018so spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>cifically as to warrant saying that it qualified the right\u2019 (Davis v. Mills, 194 U.S. 451, 454, 24 S.Ct. 692, 48 L.Ed. 1067 (1904). Other tests have at times been employed, as whether the statute of limitations has attributes in the state of its enactment which the forum would characterize as substantive, as that the defense need not be pleaded or that the obligation cannot be revived after the statutory period has elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The most common illustration of a situation where a statute of limitations will usually be held to bar the right is when a statute creates but a single right of action and also contains a provision limiting the time in which actions under the statute may be brought.
