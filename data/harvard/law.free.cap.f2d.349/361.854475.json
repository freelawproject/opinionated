C., for a determination of his mental capacity to stand trial. The motion was granted and a sixty-day study made. The hospital authorities reported that Issacs was competent to stand trial. Thereafter he entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment, the maximum sentence authorized by the statute. One week later the defendant applied to the court for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty and to enter one of not guilty. This is an appeal from the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-21\">Rule 32(d) of Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a judgment of conviction may be set aside and the defendant permitted to withdraw his guilty plea \u201cto correct manifest injustice.\u201d The only suggestion made by the defendant here is that he pleaded guilty in the expectation that he would be returned to the Saint Elizabeth Hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>for psychiatric treatment and not sent to the Lewisburg Penitentiary, where he is presently confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The District Court\u2019s denial of Isaacs\u2019 motion was proper, as no \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d was shown. The place of imprisonment is determined not by the court, but by the Attorney General of the United States, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4082 (1950), and if the defendant is in need of mental treatment the Attorney General is authorized to provide such treatment, either at Lewisburg, or elsewhere. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4005 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The plea having been understandingly made, it must stand since no valid reason for setting it aside has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The order of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
