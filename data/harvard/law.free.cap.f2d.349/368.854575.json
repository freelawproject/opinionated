plaintiffs were seriously injured in the course of their employment between 1947 and 1952 and were officially accorded \u201csuper-seniority\u201d status; following expiration of the 1955 labor contract in December, 1958, a new collective bargaining agreement provided that preferential seniority would be granted only to employees having more than a 17 percent disability and, as a consequence, the plaintiffs, who had less than a 17 percent disability, were not eligible for super-seniority status; that the earlier-enjoyed \u201csuper seniority\u201d of the plaintiffs was a \u201cvested right\u201d and \u201cstatus\u201d which <em>\u201cdoes not involve </em>\u2018the meaning and application of any of the provisions\u2019 of the [collective bargaining] agreement * * [which] could not be divested by any arbitrary, capricious, and/or malicious acts of the defendants herein acting in concert, conspiracy and collusion to defraud the plaintiffs and others similarly situated of their vested rights in contravention of law and public policy.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">The record discloses that the collective bargaining agreement in effect<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> when the instant action was instituted on January 2, 1964, also provided that super-seniority status was accorded only to employees who had more than a 17 percent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">It is the plaintiffs\u2019 contention here that their super-seniority rights \u201care based not upon the collective bargaining agreements but upon the original contract of hire\u201d; they \u201cdid not have the spark of their creation in the collective bargaining agreements themselves * * * therefore, these rights survive and are not nullified when the agreements, nor portions of them are terminated\u201d; and, Union \u201cbreached a duty of fair representation as to the plaintiffs\u201d when it and Budd conspired \u201cto collusively deny the plaintiffs * * * of their super-seniority status\u201d in new collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">In reply, Union contends that Section 301(a) accords jurisdiction to the federal courts over actions for breach of a labor contract and the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to allege such a breach; further, plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cclaim is not based upon a <em>violation </em>of a contract between an employer and labor organization\u201d but \u201csolely upon the adverse effect upon plaintiffs of the <em>negotiation </em>of such an agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">Union\u2019s contention is well-taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">The distilled essence of the plaintiffs\u2019 position is that they can enforce, under Section 301(a), their \u201ccontract of hire\u201d super-seniority rights, accorded under Budd\u2019s pre-labor contract policy, even though subsequently negotiated collective bargaining agreements bargained away such rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-18\">The plaintiffs seem to be oblivious of the fact that Section 301(a) <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> only cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ates federal jurisdiction, in the absence of diversity of citizenship, with respect to \u201c[s]mis <em>for violation of contracts </em>between an employer and a labor organization * * * or between any such labor organizations.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Here the plaintiffs do not seek redress for violation <em>of </em>a collective bargaining agreement; what they seek is redress for an alleged violation <em>by </em>a labor contract of rights which they assert were independently, and pre-agreement, vested in them by their \u201ccontract of hire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">We are of the opinion that Section 301(a) did not confer jurisdiction upon the District Court to entertain this action and that it should have dismissed it for that reason. As we earlier stated, it is conceded that diversity jurisdiction does not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The cases relied on by the plaintiffs to sustain their claim to Section 301(a) jurisdiction are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">In Humphrey v. Moore, 375 U.S. 335, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964) the suit was based on an alleged breach of the seniority provisions <em>of </em>a collective bargaining agreement. It was there charged that the employer and the union had acted in a manner contrary to the explicit provisions of the labor agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">In Smith v. Evening News Association, 371 U.S. 195, 83 S.Ct. 267, 9 L.Ed. 2d 246 (1962) it was also charged that the union and the employer had violated rights of employees \u201carising <em>from </em>a collective bargaining contract.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Humphrey and Smith hold only that Section 301(a) creates jurisdiction in the District Court to entertain suits \u201cto vindicate individual employee rights <em>arising from a collective bargaining contract </em>* * * \u201d 371 U.S. 200, 83 S.Ct. 270 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">In the instant case there is no complaint or contention that Budd and Union violated a provision of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">For the reasons stated the Judgment of the District Court dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 action will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-27\">. 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 185(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\">.
