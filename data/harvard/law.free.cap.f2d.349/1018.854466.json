In this appeal, he is seeking reversal of the denial by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, James T. Foley, J., without evidentiary hearing, of his application for a writ of habeas corpus. Appellant claims that his plea of guilty was unconstitutionally coerced by the existence of a confession that had been wrung from him involuntarily. Judge Foley denied appellant\u2019s application on the ground that appellant had failed to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-17\">A voluntary guilty plea entered on advice of counsel is a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects in any prior stage of the proceedings against him. United States ex rel. Swanson v. Reincke, 344 F.2d 260 (2d Cir. 1965); United States ex rel. Boucher v. Reincke, 341 F.2d 977 (2d Cir. 1965). Any language to the contrary in United States ex rel. Vaughn v. LaVal-lee, 318 F.2d 499 (2d Cir. 1963) is herewith disavowed. In this posture, it is unnecessary to decide whether the District Court erred in concluding that appellant failed to exhaust his state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-18\">Petitioner\u2019s motions are denied. The respondent\u2019s cross-motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-19\">HAYS, Circuit Judge, dissents and votes to grant the petitioner\u2019s motions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
