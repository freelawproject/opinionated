Without discussing the various opinions rendered by the different courts, we say they all seem to arrive at the same conclusion in the end. In the light of all the authorities we have examined'upon this question we do not believe that this municipal corporation can grant a monopoly to one individual by contract or otherwise, to enter upon the private premises of the inhabitants of the city, and at their expense collect and remove substances not in themselves nuisances.

Samuels, </em>Corporation Counsel, City of Fort Worth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AR4\">The title of the ordinance is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-6\">\"An ordinance providing for the protection of the health of the inhabitants, the destruction and prevention of nuisances, the cleansing of premises, removal of night-soil and other garbage, and the licensing-of persons to remove night-soil and other garbage, fixing penalties for violation of same, and providing for the repeal of Ordinance <em>25, </em>and all ordinances in conflict herewith.\u201d Fahey v. State, 11 S. W. Rep., 108, (27 Crim. App., page 146); State v. Cantieny, 24 N.

IT. Miaddox, Chief of Police of the City of Fort Worth, on a charge of violating the grabage ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Relator insists that the ordinance of the City of Fort Worth is unconstitutional on the ground that same is unreasonable. The charter authorizes the City of Fort Worth to pass a garbage ordinance to clean up and keep the'city in a sanitary condition. We do not believe it necessary to quote either the clause of the charter or the ordinance, in detail on this question. The ordinance, among other things, provides that it is only after night-soil, and other matter becomes a nuisance that the city intervenes, and limits its removal to its licensed officer. Section 11 of said article reads, as follows: \u201cAny person shall have the right to remove or have removed from his own premises any stable manure, swill or other garbage having a value (but in no event to include night-soil) provided he removes the same or has it removed before it becomes a nuisance, and provided further, that all swill, dish-water, slops or other garbage of a watery kind shall be removed in water-tight vessels or receptacles with tight covering preventing the escape of same or offensive odor therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">There are many other salutary provisions of the ordinance such as requiring the offal to be dumped at a certain place, etc. We hold that the above ordinance is reasonable and that relator has no ground for complaint. The authorities are too numerous on this question to be cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Relator is therefore remanded to the custody of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">\n<em>Relator remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
