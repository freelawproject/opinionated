This charge is not correct. It is upon the weight of the evidence, and appellant had a right to act upon the reasonable appearance of danger, and the court should have properly told the jury that if the defendant believed that he was \"in personal danger, or in danger of serious bodily injury, and assaulted Miller, so believing, viewing the facts from the defendant\u2019s standpoint, or if the jury have a reasonable doubt of said facts, then they should find him not guilty. Where personal violence is offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>to a defendant, lie does not have to resort to all necessary means to protect his life, nor would he be guilty if he used more force than it subsequently developed was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">For the error pointed out the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
