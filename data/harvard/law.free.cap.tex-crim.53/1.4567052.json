S. Lasley upon the stand and propounded to him this question: \u201cDo you know the general reputation of the defendant, Dolly Owens, in the community in which she lives as to chastity?\u201d Appellant objected on the ground that same was improper, irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent, for the reason that defendant\u2019s character for chastity was not an issue in the case and could not be proved by the State by general reputation, unless the defendant sought to show her good character in said respect. The objection was overruled, and the witness stated: \u201cIt is that she is a common whore and a common prostitute.\u201d Bills Nos. 2 and 3 complain of the same matter. This court has several times held that the character of a house as a disorderly one may be established by common reputation, but the proof must directly implicate the person charged with keeping it in order to convict. See Sara v. State, 22 Texas Crim. App., 639; Loraine v. State, 22 Texas Crim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>App., 640; Burton v. State, 16 Texas Crim. App., 156; Allan v. State, 15 Texas Crim. App., 320; Gamel v. State, 21 Texas Crim. App., 357. It follows, therefore, that the court erred in permitting the witness to testify to the general reputation of appellant being a common prostitute, in order to establish ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">The judgment is accordingly reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
