Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AOy\">Appellant was convicted of assault to murder and his punishment assessed at confinement, for two years, in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We find no bills of exception in the record. Appellant\u2019s first insistence is that the court erred in failing to define manslaughter to the jury, and to submit aggravated assault. The facts in this case show that Tom Smith, the injured party, was riding along the road at night and passed appellant who was walking. As he passed, appellant spoke to him saying, \u201cWho are you?\u201d prosecuting witness answered, \u201cYou know who I am,\u201d and rode on. After he had passed appellant some feet, appellant holloed to him and said, \u201cGo to hell, you son-of-a-bitch.\u201d The injured party rode back and asked the appellant what he meant by calling him a son-of-a-bitch. Appellant replied he was mistaken in the man. The injured party rode on and when he had preceded appellant some forty or fifty yards, appellant shot him with buckshot. The balls all entered the back of the head and body. The above is the State\u2019s statement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Appellant\u2019s statement of the affair is as follows: That he was walking along the road going home when the injured party passed him and appellant holloed and said, \u201cYou did not tell me who you are,\u201d when Smith replied, \u201cYou son-of-a-bitch, I have not got time to fool with you.\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cDamn you then, go on to the creek.\u201d When appellant made this statement, the injured party turned, came back to the defendant and said, \u201cYou son-of-a-bitch I will kill you,\u201d drawing his pistol. Defendant replied, \u201cI mistook you.\u201d After the injured party rode off, the defendant said, he thought he had better load his gun to protect himself and he put two buckshot shells in the same, and he says that it appeared to him that the injured party was starting back towards him, when he drew his gun and fifed; that he thought it was a negro. The proof shows, however, that it was a moonlight night and appellant and injured party were well acquainted with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">This being the state of the record we do not believe the court erred in failing to charge on manslaughter, or aggravated assault, since appellant\u2019s own statement shows that he shot in self-defense which the court properly charged upon, presenting every phase thereof. The State\u2019s case and the physical facts, show that he did not shoot in self-defense, and, hence the issue of aggravated assault was not in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The next ground of the motion for a new trial is that the court erred in the following charge: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to make an assault with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>deadly weapon upon a negro with the specific intent to kill him, but that he made a mistake as to the identity of the person he intended to assault and that he otherwise made the assault on Tom Smith with the specific intent to kill him, then yon are charged that the defendant would he guilty of an assault with intent to murder the same as if the assault had been made upon the negro.\u201d He insists that this charge is erroneous in that the court does not qualify same and make the guilt of appellant depend upon the fact that he was not acting in self-defense. The charge must be treated as a whole. When so examined, we find that the court properly, as stated above, charged on self-defense and no possible injury could have accrued to appellant in the omission of said statement in the above criticised charge. Appellant does not complain of the charge on self-defense. In fact, no just criticism could he made thereon. We find no error in this record and the jury were amply warranted in the verdict rendered.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b137-8\">[Rehearing denied February 26, 1908.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Henderson, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
