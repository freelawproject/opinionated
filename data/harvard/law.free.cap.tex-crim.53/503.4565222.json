An inspection of the record demonstrates that the facts alleged in the\" State\u2019s motion are true, and in this state of the record, under the authorities, the State\u2019s motion to dismiss must be granted. Article 883 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is as follows: \u201cAn appeal is taken by giving notice thereof in open court, and having the same entered of record.\u201d Construing this statute, our 'courts have held: \"\u201cThat unless such notice appears in the record on appeal, and that it was given and entered of record in the court below, the appeal will be dismissed.

It is therefore ordered that the appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
