Ike Johnson recovered his mule from Miller. The defendant claimed that he had gotten the mule fifteen miles from Mineral Wells from the possession of his brother-in-law, Ed Howell. This witness was never placed upon the stand. Defendant claimed that several persons were present when he got the mule from Howell. These witnesses were all placed upon the stand and testified to the\u2019falsity of this assertion of the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number><em>Ford &amp; Patterson, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Any\">On question of charge of court on accomplice testimony: Oates v.

The State filed an exception to the plea, which was sustained by the court, and said plea was stricken out, and appellant excepts. This question was decided against appellant\u2019s contention in the case of Pearce v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 507; 17 Texas Ct. Rep., 447. We there held that the jurisdiction of the court cannot attach until, first, the property has been within the terms of the statute in the county; and, second, that the indictment has been preferred. It takes these steps, at least the return of the indictment, to attach the jurisdiction of a district court. The bare arrest of appellant in Palo Pinto County and an examining trial before a justice of the peace would not defeat the jurisdiction of the District Court of Wise County.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Bill of exceptions No. 2 complains of the following charge: \u201cAnd if you believe that after the defendant took said mule and before the 10th day of January, 1908, he, the defendant, brought said mule into Wise County, Texas, and had said mule in his possession in said Wise County, Texas, you will find defendant guilty.\u201d Appellant insists that said charge is erroneous in that it assumes before the jury that defendant took the mule, and is a charge on the weight of the testimony, and authorizes the jury to convict defendant on the possession alone. We do not think appellant\u2019s criticism is correct. The whole charge reads as follows: \u201cIf in this case you believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did, in the County of Palo Pinto and State of Texas, at any time within five years next before the 10th day of January, 1908 (which is the date of the filing of the indictment in this case), fraudulently take from the possession of Ike Johnson, the mule as alleged in the indictment, without the consent of the said Ike Johnson and with the intent to deprive the said Ike Johnson of the value of the same, and to appropriate it to the use of him, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>said defendant, and that- the said Ike Johnson was at the time the owner of said mule, and if you believe that after the defendant so took the said mule, and before the 10th day of January, 1908, he, the defendant, brought said mule into Wise County, Texas, and had said mule in his possession in said Wise County, Texas, you will find the defendant guilty and so say, and assess his punishment at confinement in the penitentiary for any time not less than two nor more than ten years.\u201d As suggested, taking the charge as a whole, it is a proper presentation of the law of theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The last insistence of appellant is that the court erred in his charge on accomplice testimony, because same allowed a conviction on too low degree of proof. The charge is erroneous under the rule laid down in Burrel Oates v. State, 103 S. W. Rep., 859, but appellant\u2019s suggestion does not point out the error therein complained of, since we there held that the charge was a charge on. the weight.of evidence. We are not called upon to review any error except that pointed out in the motion for a new trial or in bills of exception. It is not an accurate criticism upon the charge to say that it authorizes a conviction on too low a degree of proof. Furthermore, although erroneous, the charge could not have injured appellant in this case since the evidence, to our minds, does not suggest that any of the witnesses in this case were accomplices. The witness Miller, to whom the party sold the animal, bought it in the ordinary open market, various parties standing near, in the town of Decatur. He (Miller) says he rather suspieioned appellant may have stolen the animal by the price he paid for it,which was some $20 or $25 less than the market value of the mule. This testimony, and this is all, does not suggest that Miller was an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">There is no error in this record that authorizes a reversal of this case, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
