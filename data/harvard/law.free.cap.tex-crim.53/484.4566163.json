The above special charge is not correct. The facts show clearly that appellant sold the whisky.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-17\">The orders of the commissioners court are in all respects formal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-18\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-19\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
