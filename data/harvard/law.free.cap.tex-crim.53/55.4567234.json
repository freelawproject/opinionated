The court overruled the challenge and appellant, exercising his right under the law, challenged three of these five jurors, and that defendant was compelled to go to trial with the jury having two of the five jurors on it; and though the said jurors testified they had no prejudice against the defendant, had formed no opinion as to his guilt or innocence and that they would give him a fair and impartial trial, yet appellant insists that said jurors were disqualified. The fact that a juror has sat in a case of a codefendant for the same theft for which the defendant was being tried is no cause for challenge to the array. See Bowman v. State, 41 Texas, 417. It is no ground for challenge to the array that the jury heard and tried a case against another party charged with an offense of the same character. Anderson v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 96. \u00a1Nor is it ground for challenge that some of the jurors summoned had sat on the trial of another person for the same offense with which the defendant was charged. See Staley v. State, 29 S. W. Rep., 272. In the case of Arnold v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 1, we held that it was no ground for challenge that the jury had tried a defendant in a case for selling liquor in March where they were empaneled to try a case for selling in June. See also Wade v. State, 12 Texas Crim. App., 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u2022 The jurors were not disqualified and the court did not err in not sustaining appellant\u2019s peremptory challenge. There are no other questions \u2022 requiring review.

In this case we have two joint defendants in the same offense, though prosecuted by separate charges with a common witness, and after further considering the facts, we think that these jurors were also disqualified under the principle laid down in the Holmes case. Accordingly the rehearing is granted, and the judgment reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
