After the original application was granted by this court, the sheriff came in and made return showing that he held relator in custody under a writ of arrest issued by John C. Bradley, Clerk of the Criminal Court of Jefferson County, Alabama. Second, a warrant of arrest issued by J. P. Williams, justice of the peace, precinct No. 1, Dallas County, Texas. Third, an authorization for the person of Henry Coleman, issued to Bobert Li. Collier on Jan. 7, 1908, by B. B. Comer, Governor of the State of Alabama, a copy of which is attached. Fourth, an executive warrant for the custody of Henry Coleman, issued on the 13th day of January, 1908, by Ms Excellency, T. M. Campbell, Governor of the State of Texas.

Heflin, Solicitor of Jefferson County, Alabama, signed and sworn to on the 6th day of January, A. D. 1908, which petition prays for the extradition of relator to the end that he may be returned to the State of Alabama to be prosecuted for the crime of murder; (c) a warrant of arrest issued by S. L. Weaver, Judge of the Criminal Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, for the arrest of the relator on a charge of murder, the said warrant being issued in January 6, 1908; (d) a requisition issued by the Governor of the State of Alabama, directed to the Governor of the State of Texas, requesting that the relator be apprehended and delivered to Robert L. Collier, to be conveyed to the State of Alabama to be prosecuted for the crime of murder of which he stands charged in the State of Alabama; (e) a written authorization issued by the Governor of the State of Alabama, which confers authority on Robert L.

Belator filed what he terms a contravention of the last statement but after a careful perusal of same, we find that there is no dispute thereof offered of the statement that he is the person wanted under the Governor\u2019s warrant, but insists that after he committed the homicide, he remained in Alabama for some time, then went to Georgia and had been living in Texas, a number of years, but in no respect docs he dispute the fact that he is the same person for whom the Governor of this State issued his requisition, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>executive warrant. We do not deem it necessary to comment in detail on the evidence on this question, but this, as we understand it, is the legal effect and proof upon the question as to relator\u2019s identity. Then we are relegated back to the question of the sufficiency of the papers upon which the executive warrant is issued. In approaching the question in this case, we deem it appropriate and quite apt to quote the language used by that great jurist, Judge Roberts, in the case of Hibler v. State, 43 Texas, 197, in discussing the duty of one Governor to honor a requisition, when properly made:</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u201cThis provision of the Constitution of the United' States, requiring the surrender of fugitives from justice, is in the nature of a treaty stipulation between the States of the Union, .and it is equally binding upon each State and all of the officers thereof for its faithful execution, as though it was a part of the Constitution of each State, whether Congress had passed laws relating thereto or not. Those laws have been passed to establish uniformity in the mode of performing this constitutional duty resting upon each State\". When its execution is put into active operation by the proper authority of this State, the Governor, based upon the authentic information and demand as required by law, it is equally obligatory upon all of the officers of this State as is the ^enforcement of any criminal proceeding under the Constitution and laws of this State; and any undue means resorted to for the purpose of thwarting or preventing the due execution of this duty of the State are equally to be reprehended. This may be done by abusing and perverting the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus as well as by any other means. This is a great writ of liberty, by being left unshackeled with forms and conditions in the mode of obtaining it. Therefore it can easily be obtained where there is no foundation for it in fact or in law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We recognize, as suggested by the learned judge, that the beneficent writ of habeas corpus unshackeled, as it is and ought to be, can be used as a means of frustrating the orderly proceedings and due administration of the laws of this State, and we hold that in this case that relator has abused the principle of the writ, in that there is no merit in his insistence that he is illegally restrained of his liberty. But under relator\u2019s insistence we will now proceed to pass upon many, if not all of his insistences why he should be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u2022 We will first consider the supposed defects in the papers issued by the Governor of this State. It will be seen from the warrant above copied that the Governor says Henry Coleman stands charged by indictment before the proper authorities with the crime of murder; whereas, in truth and in fact, he is charged by an affidavit, as indicated by the affidavit of Elisha A. Reeves, above copied. This is a mere clerical error, since we can look, and must look to both papers, that is,, the executive warrant and the affidavit, and when construed together it clearly appears to have been a clerical error, in using the word \u201cindictment\u201d in the executive warrant. The Supreme Court of Hew Hampshire, in the case of Hew Hampshire v. Martha S. Muncy, says:' \u201cA governor\u2019s warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>for the arrest of a fugitive from justice is not void because it describes the offense as uttering forged wills, where the indictment in each count charged the uttering and publication as true of a certain forged instrument purporting to be a will/ where, by reference to the indictment, the meaning of the warrant is rendered plain and definite.\u201d So in this case, by reference to the warrant of the executive, it will be seen that it was the sheerest inadvertence that the word \u201cindictment\u201d instead of \u201caffidavit\u201d was used. Furthermore, said last cited case holds, that a finding that an accused is a fugitive from justice is not precluded by the fact that the indictment shows that the offenses were committed more than six years before the indictment was found. The application of the last eitel principle is pertinent, in this: Appellant insisted by his affidavit and testimony that by reason of the fact that he remained in Alabama for sometime after the homicide, moved to Georgia, remaining in constant communication with the authorities in Alabama, or at least his whereabouts being well known by them, and moved from the last named State to Texas, where he has lived a number of years, precludes the conclusion that he is a fugitive from justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">This proposition is furthermore answered by Judge Roberts in the 43 Texas in the case of Hibler v. State. It is there held that \u201ca person who commits a crime in one State for which he is indicted and departs therefrom, and is found in another State, may well be regarded as a fugitive from justice in the sense in which it is here used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">It seems that after the arrest of relator that the sheriff of Dallas County, who now has him in charge, was furnished an indictment, which indictment does not state the county or the State in which the crime was committed, nor the date thereof. The statement is made in the evidence that this indictment was furnished the sheriff by the officers of the State of Alabama. It will be noted, however, that the Governor of this State granted the requisition upon an affidavit, and not upon an indictment. The affidavit was made and the requisition granted prior to the time the indictment was found, and is in no sense a predicate for assaulting the validity of the executive warrant of this .State. However, even if appellant\u2019s insistence be correct, in the case of Ex parte Pearce, 32 Texas, Crim. Rep., 301, this court decided this question against appellant in the following language: \u201cIn the case at bar there is no question <em>as to </em>the nature of the crimes charged, and that they are offenses against the laws of Alabama. Embezzlement and theft are crimes in every State of the Union. Neither time nor place are essential elements in said crimes. We do not think an indictment failing to charge time and venue must necessarily be fatally defective in every State in the Union, whatever be its statutes or forms or proceeding. In the case of Noles v. The State, 24 Alabama, 672, this question was passed on by the Supreme Court, which held that the then Code, dispensing with the necessity of allegation of time and venue, but requiring proof thereof, was not against the Bill of Eights; that the accusation of the commission of crime is the gravamen of the indictment that could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>dispensed with, but the particulars as to time, place and circumstance, not, constituting essential elements in the crime, may be dispensed with by statute, and be left as a matter of proof in establishing jurisdiction.\u201d So, if relator was held, as he insists, under an indictment that states no venue; that states no time, under the above excerpt from the decision last cited, it will be seen that, under the laws of the State of Alabama, these are not requisites of an indictment in said State. The indictment is preferred by a grand jury of Jefferson County, Alabama. So, even conceding, as stated, relator\u2019s insistence that the requisition was granted upon the indictment above described, still this would not vitiate the proceedings or entitle relator to be discharged. In the Pearce case last cited the lamented Judge Hurt very aptly puts the duty of this court on the question of requisition, as follows:</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b122-9\">[Rehearing denied June 24, 1908,\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u201cOur position upon this question is, that if it reasonably appears upon the trial of the habeas corpus that the relator is charged by indictment, in the demanding State, Avhether the indictment be sufficient or not under the law of that State, the court trying the habeas corpus will not discharge the relator because of substantial defects in the indictment under the laws of the demanding State. To require this would entail upon the court an investigation of the sufficiency of the indictment in the demanding State, when the true rule is, that if it appears to the court that he is charged by indictment with an offense, all other prerequisites being complied with, the applicant should be extradited.\u201d The last expression of this court upon this question was in the case of Ex parte Denning, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 629; 18 Texas Ct. Rep., 740. The requisition in that case presented to the Governor, contained the following requisites: \u201c(1) That the affidavit had been lodged in the demanding State. (2) The demand was made by the Governor of that State, stating that the affidavit was authentic. This left no discretion to the Executive of this State. This law is mandatory when these two requirements are made, and there is hut one thing for the executive of this State to do, and that is to issue the warrant, after ascertaining that the party was in fact a fugitive within the borders of this State, the manner of which ascertainment is left entirely to the direction of the Governor of the fugitive State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The papers before us are in all things formal, and as stated at the outset of this opinion, there can be no serious cavil over the fact that the sheriff of this county legally holds said relator under said executive warrant and he is hereby remanded to the custody of said A. L. Led-better, sheriff of Dallas County, to be turned over by him to Robert L. Collier, who has heretofore been authorized by the Governor of Alabama to receive him and carry him from this State to the State of Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\n<em>Remanded to custody.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
