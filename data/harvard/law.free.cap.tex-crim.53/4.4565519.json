'</p>\n<p id=\"b26-21\">Bill of exceptions Ho. 1 shows the following: \u201cWhile defendant was on the stand as a witness in his own behalf, the following question was propounded to him by his counsel: \u2018State whether or not at the time you begun work for B. S. Foreman, and at the time you are accused of the sale alleged in the indictment you had been led to believe and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>honestly believe that the liquors sold in the said Foreman\u2019s place of business were non-intoxicating beverages.\u2019 The court sustained the State\u2019s objection to same on the ground that the testimony was irrelevant and immaterial. If permitted, the defendant would have stated that \u2018Mr. Foreman told me at the time I went to work for him, which was about two weeks prior to the date alleged in the indictment, that the liquors sold by him were non-intoxicating, and I believed at the time of the alleged sale to Mr. Miller that the cold drinks sold to said Miller in said Foreman\u2019s place of business were in fact non-intoxicating beverages.\u2019 \u201d This testimony was admissible, and the court erred in refusing to admit same. We have heretofore held that, if a party honestly believes the liquor sold is not an intoxicant, said fact can be proven. Here the defense proposed to prove by the party who employed appellant that he was informed that the liquor was not intoxicating, and so believing he sold same. This testimony was admissible. See Walker v. State, 49 Texas Crim. Rep., 345; 98 S. W. Rep., 843; and Covington v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 48; 100 S. W. Rep., 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Bill of exceptions Ho. 2 shows the following: The State, over appellant\u2019s objection, was permitted to introduce in evidence the following instrument, in writing, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u201cInternal Revenue Service, 4th District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Collector\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Dallas, Texas, February 27, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">Collector\u2019s Certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-11\">I hereby certify that it appears from the records of my office that license was issued, as follows, viz:</p>\n<p id=\"b27-12\">Kind of stamp\u2014Retail Malt Liquor Dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-13\">Serial number, 7847.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">Date of Issue, August 28, 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-15\">To whom Issued, B. S. Foreman.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-16\">Issued for period, commencing August 1, 1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-17\">Place of Business: Rule, Texas. Locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-18\">Amount paid: Eighteen and. 33-100 Dollars ($18.33).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-19\">In witness whereof, my official seal and signature, this the 27th day of February, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-20\">(Seal) P. B. Hunt, Collector.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-21\">Appellant objected to same because it was not shown by any testimony whatever, that the defendant had any knowledge of the existence of the said license, or that it had ever been issued to said Foreman, or that he had any knowledge that the said Foreman, his employer, had said license; because the said instrument was wholly immaterial and irrelevant to any issue in the case on trial, and was calculated to injure and prejudice the rights of the defendant. There is no authority in this State for the introduction of the internal revenue collector\u2019s certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>cate. The statute makes admissible an examined copy where proof of said fact is made; then the examined copy of the internal revenue collector\u2019s books can be admitted, but there is no statutory authority for the introduction of the collector\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">Appellant complains' of the following charge of the court: \u201cYou are charged that, if you believe from the evidence beyond', a reasonable doubt that the defendant and any other person acting together sold intoxicating liquors to M. P. Miller at the time and place alleged in the indictment in this case, and that each and both of said persons were present at the time of such sale, and each knew the unlawful act in making said sale, then the defendant would be guilty regardless of whether it was the defendant or such other person who actually delivered to said Miller such intoxicating liquor, or received the pay therefor.\u201d This charge is correct. All parties are principals in misdemeanor cases. Besides, the evidence shows, according to the testimony of the prosecuting witness, that appellant was present at the time of the sale; aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">For the error of the court in excluding the testimony above discussed, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
