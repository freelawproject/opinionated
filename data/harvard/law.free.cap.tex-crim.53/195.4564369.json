The defendant, well knowing the desperate character of the said Hargrove and knowing that he was a man who usually executed his threats, in anticipation of trouble, took his pistol with him from his place of business to the postoffice and had proceeded only a few steps when he met the said Hargrove and a shooting scrape ensued. As the defendant was coming from dinner he met Sebe Burnett who told him that\u00bb Hargrove was up about his (Hargrove\u2019s) place of business, and that he had not best go up there as Brodie\u2019s place of business and Hargrove\u2019s place were side by side and that he saw some one, whom he took to be Hargrove, up the street, going from him (Brodie) and he (Brodie) went into his barbershop and shaved a man before going to the postoffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u201cThe defendant, Brodie, made no effort to have the said Hargrove placed or put under peace bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">\u201cThe said Hargrove had been away from Bowie since the said 27th. day of March all the time except when he came back to attend his mother\u2019s burial, and at no time did he appear on the streets of Bowie between said dates until on the said 6th day of Sept., 1907.\u201d We do not believe this evidence authorizes an acquittal of the defendant. There are a lot of facts in his motion for a new trial that he says the court judicially knew, which possibly might have changed the result of this decision, but they are not embodied in the statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">We accordingly hold that the evidence is sufficient, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ADr\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
