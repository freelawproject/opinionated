We have carefully read the able brief of appellant\u2019s counsel, in which the affirmative of this issue is strongly presented. We do not believe, however, under the rules long established in this court, that it can be sustained. The witness, Mattie Eerguson, testified in effect that she heard cries of distress by appellant\u2019s wife, and went at once to his house where she found her sitting in her chair crying. She states that she had a knot on the side of her face, and when she asked her \u201cWhat is the matter ?\u201d she stated that \u201cArthur (meaning appellant) has been beating me up.\u201d That at the time appellant was standing in the room by the table on which was a pistol, and' that on her inquiry if he was not ashamed to do his wife that way, he said he was not, and if witness did not like it he would kick her out of there. The fact of any assault was denied by Lucy Houston (mother of defendant) who was present, also by appellant and by his wife. There are some circumstances in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>record which tend to support the testimony of the prosecuting witness. For instance, the defendant testifies as follows: \u201c1 do not know what made the people gather on the railroad tracks. There was a pretty good crowd there. They are a funny kind of people living out there. Where they hear a noise they gang around.\u201d From this and other testimony in the record, it is pretty evident that there was some occurrence out of the ordinary at appellant\u2019s house. The testimony of the witness, Mattie Ferguson, being clear, unequivocal and positively affirming appellant\u2019s guilt, out of deference and respect to the verdict of the jury, we cannot say that there was no evidence against appellant, or that under all the circumstances the testimony in his favor was so absolutely overwhelming as to justify us in setting aside the verdict. Again, the learned trial judge, on whom the duty devolves in a proper case, to set aside the verdict of the jury, declined to do so. He had far better opportunities than we can have of observing the witnesses and passing an intelligent judgment on their credibility, and upon the weight of the evidence. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"A6s\">There is no error in the record, and the judgment of the court below is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\n<em>Affkmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
