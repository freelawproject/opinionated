An accomplice, as the word is here used, means any one connected with the crime committed, either as principal offender, as accomplice, as accessory or otherwise. It includes all persons who are connected with the crime by unlawful act or omission on their part, transpiring either before, at the time, or after the commission of the offense, and whether or not he was present and participated in the com-\" mission of the crime. How, I charge you, that the witness, John Davis, is an accomplice within the meaning of the term as herein used, and that you cannot convict the defendant upon his testimony unless you find that same has been corroborated by other evidence tending to establish that the defendant, did in fact commit the offense charged.\u201d This charge has been condemned by 'this court in many eases. See majority opinion of the court in Burrell Oates v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 39; 16 Texas Ct. Rep., 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">The charge on accomplice being erroneous, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
