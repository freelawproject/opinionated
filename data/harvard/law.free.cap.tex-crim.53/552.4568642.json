The indictment alleges the sale took place the first of September, 1907. Appellant insists that said evidence was inadmissible, since it tended to prejudice appellant and his defense before the jury; that same was irrelevant and immaterial to any issue in the case as he (appellant) was not connected with and had had nothing to do with the club business for over two months before the time the transaction took place that he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>here prosecuted for; that it was no part of the ros gesta;; that it did not show or tend to show any criminal intent on the part of appellant; that there was no evidence of system in the case; all of which objections were overruled by the court. We hold that the above cited evidence was inadmissible. In the case of Harris v. State, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 411; 98 S. W. Rep., 842, we held that on a prosecution for a violation of the local option law where defendant did not put his character in issue, it was error to permit a witness to testify that he had known defendant for a long time, and never knew him to sell medicine or anything else and that he beard he was selling whisky in the vicinity all the time, was inadmissible. If the appellant had been running the clubroom this fact could have been proven, but the evidence showed that he had not been connected with the clubroom for two months. This being true it was error to admit the testimony. 'Under several recent decisions of this court we have held that where a party is charged with selling whisky, tire possession on the part of defendant of large quantities of whisky, or the fact that he is running an establishment where whisky is sold is admissible, but where the evidence excludes the idea that appellant had anything to do with the sale of whisky, it was error for the court to have admitted same.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">For the reason pointed out the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
