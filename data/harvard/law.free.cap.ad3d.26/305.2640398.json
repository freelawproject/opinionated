Accordingly, that part of the order is not appealable as of right <em>(see </em>CPLR 5701 [a] [2]; <em>Housberg v Curtin, </em>209 AD2d 670, 671 [1994]; <em>Abrahamsen v Brockway Glass Co., </em>119 AD2d 612 [1986]), and we decline to grant leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>denying that branch of the plaintiff\u2019s motion which was to disqualify the defendant\u2019s counsel <em>(see Haberman v City of Long Beach, </em>298 AD2d 497, 498-499 [2002]; <em>Olmoz v Town of Fishkill, </em>258 AD2d 447 [1999]). The court correctly determined that the plaintiff did not sufficiently demonstrate the existence of a conflict of interest.
