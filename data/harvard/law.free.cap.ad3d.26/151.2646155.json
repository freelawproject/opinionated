Also on that date, the presentment agency requested an adjournment because the undercover police officer was testifying in another court. The matter was then adjourned to October 29, 1999, one day before the expiration of the 60-day period during which these proceedings must be commenced <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7\u00a7 310.2, 340.1 [2]). On October 29, the agency again requested an adjournment because neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>undercover officer nor the arresting officer was available to testify. Specifically, the undercover had telephoned agency counsel that morning to explain that she had \u201cjust learned\u201d of the rescheduled hearing date and was scheduled for a \u201cspecial assignment\u201d that day. The arresting officer had a regularly scheduled day off and was unable to appear due to child care issues. Counsel further explained that the Police Department had not rescheduled the arresting officer\u2019s day off because it was believed that the undercover would be available to testify. Appellant\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the petition because the agency failed to show good cause for commencing the proceeding beyond the 60-day limit. The court found the agency had met its burden of demonstrating good cause and granted another adjournment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">A fact-finding hearing must be commenced within 60 days after a respondent\u2019s initial appearance when the respondent is not detained <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 340.1 [2]; <em>Matter of Bernard T., </em>92 NY2d 738, 745 [1999]). While the agency may seek a 30-day adjournment of the commencement of the fact-finding hearing on \u201cgood cause shown\u201d (Family Ct Act \u00a7 340.1 [4] [a]), it \u201cmust take all reasonable measures to insure its readiness to proceed\u201d within the prescribed limitations <em>(Matter of Robert B., </em>187 AD2d 347, 349 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We find, based on this record, the agency failed to demonstrate good cause to adjourn the fact-finding hearing. Neither police officer appeared the day the hearing was first scheduled to commence, and no explanation was offered for the arresting officer\u2019s absence. On the adjourned date, the agency again failed to produce a police witness. The agency\u2019s bare excuses that one officer was on \u201cspecial assignment\u201d and it was the other officer\u2019s regular day off, without more, are insufficient to demonstrate good cause to adjourn the hearing beyond the 60-day statutory limitation <em>(see Matter of Darius P., </em>269 AD2d 140 [2000]). The record is barren of any facts to help this Court determine why the undercover officer only learned belatedly of the adjourned date and whether either officer could have appeared later that day to commence the hearing as required by law <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 340.1 [2]). We note that the court failed to respond to the agency\u2019s meager offerings with questions that might have clarified the meaning and importance of the \u201cspecial assignment\u201d on October 29 and why the undercover officer belatedly learned of the hearing date. Thus, we are unable to find good cause to extend commencement of the hearing beyond 60 days <em>(see </em>Family Ct Act \u00a7 340.1 [4] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>We need not reach defendant\u2019s remaining contention in light of our determination.
