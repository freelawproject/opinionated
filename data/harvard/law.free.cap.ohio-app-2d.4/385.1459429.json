On January 6, 1964, the defendants, makers of the cognovit note on which such judgment was entered, filed their motion to have same vacated for the reason that it was based on a deficiency arising after the sale by plaintiff of an automobile of defendants in which plaintiff had a security interest under a security agreement executed by defendants but which \u201csale was not in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 1319.07.\u201d On February 14, 1964, after trial, the trial court filed its separate findings of fact and conclusions of law reading, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-13\">\u201cFrom a preponderance of the evidence, the court finds the facts to be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-15\">\u201c4. In November, 1963, the defendants being in default for payment, plaintiff\u2019s manager asked them to surrender possession of the automobile, which was done. He then gave them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>written notice, * * * mailed by certified mail on November 19, 1963, to their address given in the mortgage, * * * that plaintiff would sell the mentioned Chevrolet automobile at public sale at its office in Findlay, Ohio, on November 29th, 1963, at 10 o\u2019clock a. m., for not less than $150.00, and that they might be held liable for any deficiency resulting. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">\u201c5. On November 29, 1963, no one appeared at plaintiff\u2019s office to bid for said automobile. Either on that day or later, the manager decided to buy it for the plaintiff company at $150.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u201c6. Later, plaintiff sold the car * <em>* * </em>for $250.00, and gave defendants credit for this amount ($250) on their loan account, by entry dated December 6, 1963 [leaving the $660.83 deficiency for which judgment was then taken].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u201cConclusions on Law</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\u201c* * <em>* </em>In order to come within the exception permitted by this statute [Section 1319.07, Revised Code], its provisions must be strictly and literally complied with, and this was not done in the instant case in that the written notice was sent by certified mail rather than registered mail, and no sale was made on November 29, 1963, because no one appeared for such sale. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Judgment was thereupon entered vacating and setting aside the deficiency judgment of December 12, 1963, and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s petition for same. It is from this judgment that plaintiff has appealed on questions of law, claiming that same is based on erroneous conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">The exception set forth in Section 1319.07, to the prohibition of a deficiency judgment provided for by that section, reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">\u2018 \u2018 This section does not apply if the mortgagee, his * * * assigns, gives at least ten days\u2019 written notice to the mortgagor, * * # by mailing it to him <em>by registered mail, </em>at the address of the mortgagor given in the mortgage, of the time, place, and the minimum price for which the mortgaged property may be sold, together with a statement that the mortgagor may be held liable for any deficiency resulting from said sale. * * * Any person may appear at the time and place of sale mentioned in such notice and bid at such sale. At the time and place mentioned in such notice the mortgaged property shall be sold to the highest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>bidder if his bid equals or exceeds the minimum price set forth in the written notice given the mortgagor.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">This section has existed in its present form since October 1,1953, the effective date of the last recodification. Thereafter, by amendment to Section 1.02, Eevised Code, effective on June 27, 1955 (126 Ohio Laws 1164), it was provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">\u201cAs used in the Eevised Code, unless the context otherwise requires:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">\u201c(I) \u2018Eegistered mail\u2019 shall include \u2018certified mail.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">By amendment, effective January 10, 1961 (129 Ohio Laws 582, 585), the latter language was changed to read, \u201c (I) \u2018Eegistered mail\u2019 includes certified mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">There was not in 1955, or thereafter, anything in the context of Section 1319.07, Eevised Code, or in the context of any other part of the Eevised Code, which required the term \u201cregistered mail\u201d in that section to be defined in any manner other than to include certified mail. Under these circumstances the effect of the amendment of Section 1.02 on June 27, 1955, and thereafter on January 10,1961, was to write into Section 1319.07 that the term \u201cregistered mail\u201d is defined as including \u201ccertified mail.\u201d And this conclusion remains true even though by the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, effective January 1,1962, it was required by Section 1309.44 (0) that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbX\">\u201cTo the extent that they give rights to the debtor and impose duties on the secured party, Section 1319.07 of the Eevised Code * * # may not be waived or varied except * # * [as to matters not here applicable].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">This merely means that the requirements as to notice in Section 1319.07 cannot be waived or varied but, as before, mailed notice must be by registered mail, which by definition includes certified mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">It will be noted from that part of Section 1319.07 herein-before quoted that the mortgaged property shall be sold to \u2018 \u2018 any person [who] may appear at the time and place of sale mentioned in such notice\u201d and who qualifies as the highest bidder. The trial court held that \u201cno sale was made on November 29, 1963, because no one appeared for such sale.\u201d There can be no doubt that the plaintiff, conducting the sale at its own office, was present at the time and place of sale. In view of the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>finding that \u201ceither on that day or later, the manager decided to buy it for the plaintiff company at $150.00,\u201d the court must have concluded that the plaintiff company could not qualify as a buyer at a public sale conducted by it. However, that is not the case, for in addition to coming within the category of \u201cany person\u201d referred to in Section 1319.07, Revised Code, it is specifically provided by Section 1309.47 (C), a part of the Uniform Commercial Code, also here applicable, that \u201cthe secured party may buy at any public sale.\u201d The plaintiff was thus qualified to become a buyer at that time and place and, the evidence failing to show that plaintiff\u2019s purchase was made at some other time, the deficiency judgment should not have been set aside on the ground that no sale was made. <em>Central National Bank </em>v. <em>Irvine, </em>78 Ohio Law Abs. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">This court finding that the Municipal Court erred in its conclusions of law with respect to the requirements of notice and the fact of sale, and by reason thereof committed further error prejudicial to the plaintiff in its judgment setting aside and vacating the deficiency judgment and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s petition, such judgment is reversed and vacated, thus reinstating the deficiency judgment of December 12, 1963; and this court, entering the judgment the Municipal Court should have entered, overrules the motion to vacate filed by the defendants on January 6,1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-7\">Younger, P.
