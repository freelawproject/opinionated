Cost shall be taxed as in habeas corpus proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Petitioner\u2019s stated grounds relied upon for relief were in substance: (1) That he was not advised of his right to have court-appointed counsel for his defense; (2) no pre-indictment affidavit charging the first four counts; (3) <em>the first four counts of the indictment do not charge a violation of the statute, Section 2907.10, Revised Code, </em>\u201cin that the charges do not specify the most essential elements \u2014 unlawfully, maliciously and forcibly\u201d; and (4) <em>the fifth count of the indictment does not charge a violation of the statute, Section 2907.15, Revised Code, </em>in that \u201cit does not contain the essential elements \u2014 unlawfully and maliciously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The trial court filed a decision which we quote in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u2018 \u2018 The document, which petitioner has labeled a petition, alleges that in 1954 he pleaded guilty to four counts of breaking and entering in the night season and one count of breaking and entering in the daytime for which he was sentenced to serve 1 to 15 years on each of the first four counts and 1 to 5 years on the fifth count, the sentences to be served concurrently. The files and records show that this was in case number 4999. The entry in this case, so far as pertinent, reads: \u2018The indictment was read in open court to the said defendant and thereafter his constitutional and statutory rights were fully explained to him by the court. The defendant declined counsel and upon being inquired of as to his plea to each of the five counts contained in said indictment, answered that he was guilty on each and every count as charged.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\u201cSince the court \u2018fully explained\u2019 to petitioner his constitutional rights, it is apparent petitioner\u2019s right to counsel was explained. That the court did not overlook explaining petitioner\u2019s right to counsel is apparent, for immediately after the full explanation the entry recites that petitioner \u2018declined counsel.\u2019 The court is therefore satisfied that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The decision was followed by this journal entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201cThis cause coming on for hearing on the petition of Herbert Porter, a prisoner at Marion Correctional Institution, seeking vacation of his sentence on five counts, the court finds that the petition and the files and records of the case satisfactorily show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief. It is therefore considered that the petition be dismissed at petitioner\u2019s costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8q\">The decision affirmatively shows that the court considered and passed upon petitioner\u2019s stated ground for relief (1) <em>only. </em>No mention is made of stated grounds relied upon for relief (2), (3) and (4) in the petition. Apparently the court did not consider or pass upon such stated grounds relied upon for relief (2), (3) and (4) or determine the issues thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Stated grounds relied upon for relief (2), (3) and (4) are of prime materiality. They deserve careful scrutiny by the court in the light of <em>State </em>v. <em>Cimpritz, </em>158 Ohio St. 490, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Wozniak, </em>172 Ohio St. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Such stated grounds relied upon for relief (2), (3) and (4) raise issues which, in our opinion, entitle the prisoner to a prompt hearing thereon. The indictment is certainly a part of the record of the case and must be considered at that hearing. The indictment does not contain, in any count thereof, the words \u201cunlawfully\u201d or \u201cmaliciously\u201d or \u201cforcibly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The finding of the court, that \u201cthe petition and the files and the records of the case satisfactorily show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,\u201d is contrary to law, constituted an abuse of discretion, and constituted error prejudicial to the prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">This petitioning prisoner is, in our opinion, entitled to appointment of counsel under Section 2953.24, Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">It is, therefore, ordered that this cause be remanded to the Common Pleas Court for a prompt hearing, appointment of counsel for the prisoner, and determination of all the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The judgment denying relief to the petitioning prisoner is vacated, and this cause is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Coshocton County for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b356-12\">Rutherford, P.
