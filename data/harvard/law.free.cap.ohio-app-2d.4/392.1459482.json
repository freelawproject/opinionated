Plaintiff has not perfected an appeal or assigned any errors as to that judgment. Nor do we consider the liability of Boop to Gaines, and thus to American, for the amount of the damages to Gaines\u2019 Edsel which was established by the judgment upon which the supplemental petition is based, for the parties have not contested such judgment or liability. It further appears conceded by all the parties that the following condition in American\u2019s policy precluded Boop from receiving any benefits thereunder as a consequence of driving Gaines\u2019 car:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">\u201c7. No benefit to Bailee: <em>The insurance afforded by this policy shall not enure directly or indirectly to the benefit of any carrier, or bailee liable for loss to the </em>automobile.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The pertinent provisions of Home\u2019s policy are as follows, with emphasis added :</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\">Under Part I \u2014 Liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">\u201c \u2018owned automobile\u2019 means a private passenger * * * automobile * <em>* * owned by the named insured, and includes a temporary substitute automobile;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201c \u2018temporary substitute automobile\u2019 means any automobile * # # <em>while temporarily used as a substitute for the owned automobile </em># * * <em>when withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, </em># *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Under Part III \u2014 Physical Damage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201cCoverage E \u2014 Collision: <em>To pay for loss caused by collision </em>to the <em>owned automobile or to a nonowned automobile </em>but only for the amount of each such loss in excess of the deductible amount stated in the declarations as applicable hereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">\u201cDefinitions. <em>The definitions of * * </em># <em>\u2018owned automobile,\u2019 \u2018temporary substitute automobile,\u2019 * * * in Part I apply to Part 111, </em>and under Part III: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">\u201c \u2018nonowned automobile\u2019 means a private passenger automobile * * * not owned by the named insured # * *, other than a temporary substitute automobile, while said automobile <em>* * * </em>is in the possession or custody of the insured or is being operated by him; * * #.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\"><em>\u201cOther Insurance-. </em>If the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by Part III of this policy, the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability of this policy bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; provided, however, <em>the insurance with respect to a temporary substitute automobile or nonowned automobile shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">The trial court concluded, in its opinion, <em>that </em>under the definitions in the Home policy Gaines\u2019 car was a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile\u201d which, by definition, became an \u201cowned automobile\u201d covered by the collision provisions of the policy, which coverage \u201cwould have been available to Gaines\u201d and was the only coverage available to American, as the subrogee of Gaines, and that there was, therefore, no \u201cother\u201d or \u201cexcess\u201d insurance. Judgment was entered in the amount of $1,170, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>being the total loss of $1,270 less the $100 deductible, and Home now assigns as error that the judgment is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">It is basic to the issue before us that, as subrogee of Gaines, American\u2019s right of recovery is limited by and may rise no higher than Gaines\u2019 right of recovery. Gaines had collision coverage under his American policy and actually recovered $1,245 from American. Boop had collision coverage under his Home policy and, in appropriate circumstances, could have recovered from Home for collision damage to his Oldsmobile as an \u201cowned automobile.\u201d Except for the application of the \u201cOther Insurance\u201d clause of the Home policy it is also clear that Boop would also have a right to recover from Home for any collision damage incurred to an automobile such as Gaines\u2019 Edsel used by Boop as a \u201ctemporary substitute automobile.\u201d The risks covered by both the American and Home policies were <em>collision </em>risks and there was no provision in the Home policy covering any <em>liability </em>risk, such as Boop\u2019s liability, if any, to Gaines, the owner of the \u201ctemporary substitute automobile,\u201d arising from Boop\u2019s use of the automobile. Gaines was thus not a party insured under the specific terms of the Home policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Gaines\u2019 rights do not arise as a specifically insured party under the Home contract but, if they exist at all, exist as statutory rights under the provisions of Section 3929.06, Revised Code. Under that statute Gaines is a statutory subrogee to Boop\u2019s rights under the Home policy, as operator of the damaged automobile, and cannot rise above Boop\u2019s rights against Home. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>125 Ohio St. 581; <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>98 Ohio App. 127; and <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>170 Ohio St. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">What then are Boop\u2019s rights against Home, as limited by the other insurance clause hereinbefore quoted? Boop, who was the only \u201cinsured,\u201d as the term is used in the first portion of that clause, had no other insurance against the collision loss to Gaines\u2019 car because no other collision policy was issued to Boop and he was excluded from coverage under Gaines\u2019 policy by the operation of the bailee clause. The pro-rata coverage portion of the other insurance clause in the Home policy was not therefore applicable. However, with respect to Gaines\u2019 Edsel, the temporary substitute automobile operated by Boop, there was \u201cother valid and collectible insurance\u201d covering the collision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>loss, specifically, the collision insurance issued by plaintiff, American, to Gaines, and upon which Gaines had collected. Such being the case, under the latter part of the other insurance clause in the Home policy, the Home insurance was excess insurance over the American insurance, and Boop could have collected from Home only that part of the loss, within the limits of the Home policy, as was in excess to that part of the loss covered by the American policy. The total loss being $1,270, by applying the $100 deductible the Home policy covered only $1,170, and by applying the $25 deductible the American policy covered $1,245. The $1,170 not being in excess of $1,245, Boop could have recovered nothing from Home under the Home policy, nor could his subrogee Gaines, nor could Gaines\u2019 subrogee American. Though not in point, our conclusions here are consistent with those of the Supreme Court in <em>Motorists Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Ins. Co., </em>1 Ohio St. 2d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">For the prejudicial error of the Municipal Court in determining that the Home policy provided primary coverage on the loss here involved, the judgment of that court is reversed and vacated and this court, entering the judgment which the Municipal Court should have entered, finds for the defendant Home and dismisses the supplemental petition at the costs of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-6\">Yotjnger, P.
