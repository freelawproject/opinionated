J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">The plaintiff, appellant herein, claims in this appeal from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County, that the trial court erred in sustaining a demurrer to his petition, arid then dismissing the petition on the ground that at the time of plaintiff\u2019s injury and damage he was subject to the Ohio automobile \u201cguest statute,\u201d Section 4515.02, Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\">It is alleged in the petition that on june 21, 1964, the defendant, Christy Anderson, drove his automobile to the Dayton-Biltmore Hotel in Dayton, Ohio, where the plaintiff and he were registered guests, and invited him to ride as his guest to church; \u201cthat as plaintiff approached said car, the defendant, standing on the curb, opened and held the door on the right side for the plaintiff to enter, and then as plaintiff was entering, slammed it shut and caught and crushed the right leg and foot of plaintiff between the d\u00f3or and the frame of said automobile; * * * that said injuries and damages w\u00e9re by reason of the negligence and carelessness of the defendant in failing to see that plaintiff had not entered the car and in closing said door upon plaintiff\u2019s leg and foot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Compensatory damages were sought in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The so-called, \u201cguest statute,\u201d Section 4515.02, Revised Code, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b20-7\">\u201cThe owner, operator, or person responsible for the operation of a motor vehicle shall not be liable for loss or damage arising from injuries to or death of a guest, resulting from the operation of said motor vehicle, while such guest is being transported without payment therefor in or upon said motor vehicle, unless such injuries .or death are caused by the willful or wanton misconduct of such operator, owner, or person responsible for the operation of said motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">The petition does not charge any acts of willful or wanton misconduct, thereby pleading a case, even though the plaintiff may be said to have been a guest \u201cbeing transported without payment therefor in or upon said motor vehicle.\u201d The pleading charges only ordinary negligence, and it is sufficient to withstand demurrer only if it may b\u00e9 said that the facts alleged are suffi,cient to be reasonably construed as saying that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>was riot a guest of the defendant being transported in or upon the defendant\u2019s autoriiobile at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-4\">Throughout the plaintiff\u2019s argument, it is. insisted that \u201cthe court erred in holding that the injury received was caused or resulted from the operation of defendant\u2019s motor vehicle1;\u201d and that it likewise erred in holding \u201cthat at the time plaintiff was injured he was being transported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The Ohio \u201cguest statute,\u201d <em>supra, </em>is in derogation of common law and, as a consequence, must be strictly construed. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Fairley, </em>141 Ohio St. 327; <em>Vest, a Minor, </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>158 Ohio St. 78; and <em>Clinger </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>166 Ohio St. 216. If, therefore, the status of the plaintiff, Economou, falls within any category other than'a guest being transported in or upon the automobile of the defendant, Anderson, at the time of his injury, the petition states a cause of action, and the demurrer was wrongfully sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Consistent with the thought of this court in the case of <em>Clinger </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in 166 Ohio St. 216, <em>supra, </em>we hold that in factual situations such as we have here, the controlling words of the statute (Section 4515.02, Bevised Code) are \u201cwhile being transported * * * in or upon said motor vehicle\u201d and that the words \u201ctransport\u201d or \u201ctransported\u201d ordinarily imply movement of something from one place to another. See opinion of Zimmerman, J., at page 219 in 166 Ohio St.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">In harmony with sound reasoning, we are compelled to hold that the injured man, at the time of the accident, was not a guest being transported in or upon the motor vehicle. A person in the process of entering an automobile parked at a curbstone is not being transported in any sense of the word. In order to claim the benefit of the lessened liability in the statute, it must appear-that the owner, operator, or person responsible for the operation of an automobile, invited a guest to ride, and, as a result of the operation of the automobile, while in the process of. being driven from one place'to another, the guest was injured. A contrary ruling in this ease would require the court to add to, or delete words from, the statute. This we cannot do.\". : V.- ' \u2022'</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">If it may be said that: closing the door on one\u2019s, parked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>automobile preparatory <em>to </em>driving it away constitutes a part of the operation of the car, nevertheless, a guest who has partly entered a parked, stationary automobile is not at that time being transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Am\">Brenneman and Hunsicker, J.J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
