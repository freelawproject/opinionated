The respondent answered, admitting some facts and disputing others. On November 22, 2002, a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline conducted a hearing. At the hearing, the parties submitted to the panel an agreed stipulation of facts, stipulated violations, stipulated exhibits, and a stipulated jointly recommended sanction of a suspension from the practice of law for 12 months, with six months stayed. Additionally, respondent testified, and three mitigation witnesses also testified on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">{\u00b6 2} The stipulations and evidence before the panel established that in May 1981, respondent was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio. In July 1999, Karen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Longstreth, a former employee of respondent, filed a civil action in common pleas court against respondent as well as a grievance with relator based on the same facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">{\u00b6 3} In her civil complaint as amended, Longstreth alleged sexual harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and battery. She specifically asserted that on October 20, 1998, respondent appeared unexpectedly at her home and \u201csexually assaulted\u201d and \u201cforcibly raped\u201d her, behavior that she characterized as \u201cintentional, non-consensual, sexually violent conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">{\u00b6 4} In August 1999, respondent answered the complaint and described his October 1998 visit to Longstreth\u2019s home but denied the allegations of sexual harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and battery. Respondent specifically denied any physical contact with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">{\u00b6 5} In October 1999, respondent testified in a deposition and denied that on the day in question \u201che kissed, had physical or sexual contact or intercourse with Longstreth in her apartment.\u201d Respondent also denied in his deposition that he \u201chad ever had any type of sexual relationship\u201d or \u201csexual contact with an employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">{\u00b6 6} Subsequent DNA analysis established a match between respondent\u2019s blood and a semen stain on a skirt belonging to Longstreth. Thereafter, in March 2001, respondent filed a motion for a continuance in this civil action and signed an affidavit, appended to the motion, in which he continued to deny any sexual conduct with Longstreth. The trial court granted a brief continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">{\u00b6 7} During the trial, which started on April 30, 2001, another ex-employee of respondent testified that she had worked for respondent in 2000 and 2001, and also at times between 1994 and 1998. The witness testified to a sexual relationship with respondent during her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">{\u00b6 8} Thereafter, respondent testified at trial that he did have a consensual sexual relationship with the witness while she was an employee. Further, respondent admitted that certain denials he made in his pretrial deposition relating to kissing, physical contact, or sexual relations with employees were untrue. He additionally admitted that he had had \u201csex a couple of times\u201d with a third employee. Respondent also testified that in October 1998, when he visited Longstreth at her home, they had had consensual sexual relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">{\u00b6 9} After deliberation, the jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent on all counts of Longstreth\u2019s complaint. Thereafter, the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for a new trial and plaintiffs motion for attorney fees and expenses. The Court of Appeals for Trumbull County recently affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment awarding plaintiff her attorney fees, expenses, and a new trial. <em>Long</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>streth v. Kafantaris </em>(Feb. 24, 2003), Trumbull App. No. 2001-T-0111, 2003 WL 470213.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">{\u00b6 10} Based on the evidence and the stipulated violations, the panel found that respondent\u2019s conduct violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), DR 1-102(A)(5) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and DR 7-102(A)(3) (concealing or knowingly failing to disclose that which he is required by law to reveal).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">{\u00b6 11} In mitigation, the panel noted and the parties stipulated that respondent had fully cooperated with relator throughout this matter. Further, respondent testified on his own behalf and described his history and background, including his arrival in this country as a young immigrant from Greece, the struggles he underwent in school not knowing English as a native language, and his efforts to become assimilated into American life. The panel noted that respondent was \u201cvery close to his four sons and embarrassed that they had to face this [issue] with their friends at church, at school and in the community. He said that he was \u2018overwhelmed by shame\u2019 \u201d over the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">{\u00b6 12} A trial court judge, another attorney, and respondent\u2019s brother testified as character witnesses on respondent\u2019s behalf. Additionally, fellow lawyers and respondent\u2019s friends and relatives, in 20 separate letters submitted to the panel, attested to respondent\u2019s honesty, character, and reputation. The panel found that this evidence \u201cspoke eloquently to the fact\u201d that respondent \u201cwas a well respected, highly regarded attorney and respected member of the general community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">{\u00b6 13} The panel agreed with the sanction that was jointly recommended by the parties, namely, that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for twelve months, with six months stayed, and that respondent pay the costs of the proceeding. The board adopted the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">{\u00b6 14} Based on the foregoing, we find that the suspension and partial stay recommended by the parties, the panel, and the board are appropriate. As we noted in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Trumbo </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 369, 373, 667 N.E.2d 1186, \u201c[R]espect for the law and our legal system is the <em>sine qua non </em>of [the] right to continuance on the rolls. * * * All our Disciplinary Rules and all our Ethical Considerations are founded on respect for the law, for the court system, for the judges, for counsel and, of course, for clients.\u201d Respondent lied in his answer to the complaint filed against him, in his deposition, and in an affidavit submitted to the trial court about his relationships with his employees. These lies warrant an actual suspension from the practice of law. Cf. <em>Trumbo, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 369, 667 N.E.2d 1186 (continually lying to clients, lying to court, and to Disciplinary Counsel warranted indefinite suspension); <em>Medina Cty.

Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab1\">Geoffrey Stern and Irene K. Makrides, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for one year, with six months of the suspension stayed on the conditions that respondent refrain from any acts in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility and that respondent pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b225-8\">Resnick, F.E.
