Kovach, suffered an industrial injury on November 1, 1995, while employed by appellant Timken Company. At that time, he was working as a scale counter. From the date of injury through July 14, 1996, claimant received temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">{\u00b6 2} On July 15, 1996, claimant temporarily returned to work at a lower-paying janitorial position that could be performed with his medical restrictions. Self-insured Timken paid claimant wage-loss compensation pursuant to R.C. 4123.56(B) during this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">{\u00b6 3} Because claimant\u2019s union contract prohibited him from remaining in a temporary position beyond a fixed period, claimant left his janitor position on November 1, 1998. With no new positions available to accommodate claimant\u2019s restrictions, Timken resumed paying TTC and continued doing so through July 17, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">{\u00b6 4} On August 12, 1999, Timken orally offered claimant a position as a heat-treatment utility worker that would pay more than the position he had held at the time of his injury. While the lifting requirements of the job would occasionally exceed claimant\u2019s restrictions, Timken allegedly orally assured claimant that he would be \u201caccommodated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">{\u00b6 5} Claimant declined the heat-treatment utility worker position, resulting in his permanent assignment to the earlier janitorial position pursuant to the union contract. Timken, in turn, refused to pay wage-loss compensation based on claimant\u2019s rejection of the heat-treatment utility-worker position.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">{\u00b6 6} The issue whether Timken was required to pay wage-loss compensation after offering the higher-paying position eventually came before appellee Indus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>trial Commission of Ohio. A district hearing officer awarded wage-loss compensation, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c[Claimant\u2019s earnings during this period were less than the claimant\u2019s Average Weekly Wage as a result of a medical impairment causally related to the industrial injury in this claim, and the claimant has completed [sic] with the requirements of Ohio Administrative Code 4125-1-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe Self-Insured employer alleged that the claimant was offered a higher paying job on 08/12/1999 as a heat treat operator, but declined this position. Thus, the employer apparently argues that claimant\u2019s wage loss after 08/12/1999 is not due to the industrial injury herein, but rather is due to the claimant\u2019s refusal of a new job. The Hearing Officer finds this argument unpersuasive for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cFirst, Ohio Administrative Code 4125 \u2014 1\u201401(D)(2) provides that the claimant\u2019s failure to accept a good faith offer of suitable employment is a factor to consider in a wage loss claim. However, the rule goes on to state that such offers \u2018will not be given consideration\u2019 if the employer of record fails to make the offer <em>in writing </em>and includ[e] a \u2018reasonable description of the job duties, hours, and rate of pay.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cHere, the employer alleges that the claimant was <em>orally </em>offered the heat treat job on 08/12/2000 [sic, 1999]. However, no evidence has been presented to corroborate Ms. Stelluto\u2019s testimony that this offer was made in writing. Further, the written job description, dated 07/13/1999 is not only not a job <em>offer </em>itself, it also fails to contain the job\u2019s hours or rate of pay. Thus, the employer\u2019s alleged job offer cannot be considered pursuant to the Ohio Administrative Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cEven assuming that the claimant did receive a written job offer on 08/12/2000 [sic, 1999], the Hearing Officer finds that the heat treat operator\u2019s job offered to the claimant is not within the restrictions imposed by Dr. Reichert. The claimant\u2019s restrictions include no repetitive lifting above 25 pounds, and <em>no </em>lifting above 50 pounds. However, the 07/13/2000 job description provided by the employer states that this job requires some lifting over 50 and 75 pounds. Although the employer argued that this is rarely required, it is, nevertheless, part of the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cMs. Stelluto stated that the employer would have accommodated the claimant by providing a helper to assist the claimant with heavy lifting. However, there is no evidence that this accommodation was promised to the claimant at the time of the alleged job offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cFinally, the Hearing Officer finds the 08/12/1999 journal entry from Mr. Lawrence, the claimant\u2019s supervisor, to be insufficient to corroborate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>employer\u2019s job offer, as it provides no details of the meeting, states only that the claimant <em>\u2018will </em>be offered job\u2019 (emphasis added), and indicates that the claimant \u2018must take old job.\u2019 The claimant testified that he had never worked as a heat treat operator, and thus this was not his \u2018old job.\u2019 The Hearing Officer accepts the claimant\u2019s testimony on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cFor these reasons, the Hearing Officer rejects the employer\u2019s arguments regarding the alleged job offer on 08/12/2000 [sic 1999].\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 16} With only slight modification, the order was administratively affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 17} Timken turned to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, which declined to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to vacate its order of wage-loss.compensation. It upheld the commission\u2019s reasoning and rejected Timken\u2019s assertion that wage-loss compensation was inappropriate absent evidence that claimant had searched for other comparably paying employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">{\u00b6 18} This cause is now before this court upon appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">{\u00b6 19} The purpose of wage-loss compensation is to return to work those claimants who cannot return to their former position of employment but can do other work. Ideally, that other work generates pay comparable to the claimant\u2019s former position. Where it does not, wage-loss compensation covers the difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">{\u00b6 20} Receipt of such compensation hinges on whether there is a causal relationship between injury and reduced earnings, more specifically, on a finding that \u201cclaimant\u2019s job choice was motivated by an injury-induced unavailability of other work and was not simply a lifestyle choice.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Kaiser Found. Hosp. Cleveland </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 405, 407, 704 N.E.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">{\u00b6 21} The requirement of a causal relationship is often satisfied by evidence of an unsuccessful search for other employment at the preinjury rate of pay. <em>State ex rel. Ooten v. Siegel Interior Specialists Co. </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 255, 256, 703 N.E.2d 306. Because claimant allegedly refused a comparably paying position at Timken and did not search for another job, Timken asserts that claimant is ineligible for wage-loss compensation. Timken\u2019s position is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">{\u00b6 22} Relying on the Ohio Administrative Code, Timken asserts that a job search is mandatory. We have said otherwise. In <em>Ooten, </em>we indicated that a job search is \u201cnot universally required.\u201d Id. And in <em>State ex rel. Brinkman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 171, 718 N.E.2d 897, we excused the claimant\u2019s lack of a job search when he had secured lucrative, albeit part-time, employment with a realistic possibility that it would change to full-time.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">{\u00b6 23} <em>Brinkman </em>and <em>Ooten </em>respectively involved part-time employment and self-employment \u2014 two categories of employment subject to enhanced scrutiny \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ensure that wage-loss compensation is not subsidizing speculative business ventures or life-style choices.\u201d <em>Brinkman, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 173, 718 N.E.2d 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 24} The employment at issue herein is full-time, not part-time, which lessens- \u2014 -but does not eliminate \u2014 these concerns. Indeed, \u201cin <em>some </em>situations, the commission may require a claimant with full-time employment to nevertheless continue looking for \u2018comparably paying work.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Yates v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 142, 2002-Ohio-2003, 766 N.E.2d 956, \u00b6 38. For regardless of the character of the work, \u201cthe overriding concern in all of these cases \u2014 as it has been since the seminal case of <em>State ex rel. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. Morse </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 210, 648 N.E.2d 827 \u2014 is the desire to ensure that a lower-paying position \u2014 regardless of hours \u2014 is necessitated by the disability and not motivated by lifestyle choice. And this is a concern that applies equally to regular full-time employment.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 25} In determining whether to excuse a claimant\u2019s failure to search for another job, we use a broad-based analysis that looks beyond mere wage loss. This approach was triggered by our recognition that \u201c[w]age-loss compensation is not forever. It ends after two hundred weeks. R.C. 4123.56(B). Thus, when a claimant seeks new post-injury employment, contemplation must extend beyond the short term. The job that a claimant takes may have to support that claimant for the rest of his or her life \u2014 long after wage-loss compensation has expired.\u201d <em>Brinkman, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 174, 718 N.E.2d 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 26} in <em>Brinkman, </em>a job search was deemed unnecessary where the claimant secured a part-time job with a high hourly wage and a realistic possibility of being offered a full-time position. Conversely, in <em>Yates, </em>evidence of a good-faith job search <em>was </em>required of a claimant with full-time employment who was making drastically reduced postinjury wages. We stressed in <em>Yates </em>that the claimant had voluntarily relocated to a place with a high rate of unemployment and was grossly underutilizing her college degree and real estate license.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">{\u00b6 27} In the case before us, our broad-based analysis allows us to consider the fact that claimant\u2019s current employment is with Timken \u2014 the same company at which he was injured. This militates against requiring a job search because claimant has some time invested with Timken. He has years towards a company pension. Moreover, his longevity may have qualified him for additional weeks of vacation or personal days. Much of this could be compromised if claimant were to leave Timken for a job elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Brinkman </em>held that it was inappropriate to ask a claimant to \u201cleave a good thing\u201d solely to narrow a wage differential. Given claimant\u2019s years of service with Timken, the benefits he receives there outweigh a higher-paying position he might be able to get at a new company. Thus, we apply <em>Brinkman\u2019s </em>rationale and preserve claimant\u2019s eligibility for wage-loss compensation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Day, Ketterer, Raley, Wright &amp; Rybolt, Ltd., Darrell N. Markijohn and Stephen E. Matasich, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ARa\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and William J. McDonald, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">{\u00b6 29} Timken argued that claimant\u2019s failure to seek other employment, failure to file wage statements, and failure to register with OBES, as required by the Administrative Code, made him ineligible for wage-loss compensation. However, the majority found that Timken paid claimant wage-loss compensation during his first stint as a janitor from July 15, 1996, through November 1, 1998, without requiring any of those things.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c[T]he evidence indicates that the employer waived several of the requirements for filing wage-loss applications. Here, the employer provided a light-duty job and paid wage-loss compensation for years, waiving the requirements of filing at OBES, doing a job search, etc. When the employer reinstated claimant to another janitorial job after a period of TTD [temporary total disability], it was reasonable for claimant to believe that he would report for work as before and receive wage-loss compensation without filing a job search log, registering with OBES, etc. Given that the employer waived the requirements from July 1996 to August 1999, claimant would not reasonably have known that the waiver was withdrawn as of his job refusal in August 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 31} Timken finally argues that claimant declined its offer of employment as a more highly paid heat-treatment utility worker and that under the Administrative Code, claimant thereby forfeited wage-loss compensation. There are two flaws in this assertion. First, Ohio Adm.Code 4125-l-01(D)(2)(a) requires such offers to be in writing and to describe duties, hours, and rate of pay. Timken did not do this. Second, the position offered by Timken required tasks that conflicted with claimant\u2019s medical restrictions, and Timken was vague as to how it would accommodate claimant if he took the position. Given these two deficiencies, the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that claimant did not unreasonably decline an offer of suitable comparably paying employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">{\u00b6 32} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b153-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Cook, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b153-10\">F.E. Sweeney, J., dissents and would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
