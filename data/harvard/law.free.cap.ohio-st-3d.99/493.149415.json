Williams, was convicted of the rape and aggravated murder of his girlfriend, Catrise Gregory, and of a rape-murder capital specification. After a penalty hearing, the trial court sentenced Williams to death. He appeals from his convictions and death sentence. Although we affirm his convictions, we find that the penalty phase of Williams\u2019s trial was affected by reversible error. We therefore reverse the death sentence imposed in this case and remand the cause to the. Lucas County Court of Common Pleas for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">{\u00b6 2} In 1995, 17-year-old Catrise Gregory was a student at Bowsher High School in Toledo; she also worked afternoons and weekends at a Taco Bell restaurant. About a year before she was murdered, Catrise began dating appellant, 21-year-old Shawn Williams. By the fall of 1995, Williams was seeing Catrise almost daily.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">{\u00b6 3} Catrise permitted Williams to keep her car most of the time. He routinely drove Catrise to and from school and work, meanwhile keeping her car all day. Frequently, after driving Catrise home, Williams kept her car overnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">{\u00b6 4} In October 1995, Catrise told her mother that she was pregnant by Williams. She also told some of her friends. Catrise told her friend Sabrina Harris that she and Williams had been trying to conceive a child. According to Harris, Williams knew about Catrise\u2019s pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">{\u00b6 5} In November 1995, the relationship between Catrise and Williams began to deteriorate, and on Thanksgiving Day (November 23), 1995, Catrise told a friend that she \u201cwas going to break up with [Williams].\u201d Near the same time, she also told her mother that she wanted to end her relationship with Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">{\u00b6 6} Friday, December 8, 1995, was the last day Catrise was seen alive. That afternoon, she worked from 4:00 until after 9:00 p.m. at Taco Bell, and then she got permission to leave early because she was not feeling well. However, she could not leave right away because Williams had her car. Between 9:30 and 9:45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>p.m., Williams finally came to pick up Catrise. Before she left, Catrise told her coworker Antoine Lewis that she intended to break up with Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">{\u00b6 7} Catrise never made it home on the night of December 8, nor did she report for work as scheduled the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 8} At approximately 8:00 or 9:00 a.m., December 9, a Toledo resident noticed Catrise\u2019s car parked on the street in front of his house. The following night, Toledo police officers approached the car in response to a 911 call. They found Catrise\u2019s body in the driver\u2019s seat, slumped over the steering wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 9} Dr. Diane Scala-Barnett, a deputy coroner and forensic pathologist for the Lucas County Coroner\u2019s Office, conducted the autopsy and concluded that Catrise had been strangled. Scala-Barnett found bruises on Catrise\u2019s nose and ear and \u201cfairly extensive bruising\u201d underneath her upper lip. There were also abrasions on her chin and neck and a laceration on her neck. Scala-Barnett concluded that Catrise\u2019s injuries were inflicted between one and six hours before her death. According to Catrise\u2019s coworker Antoine Lewis, Catrise had no visible injuries when he saw her last.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 10} Scala-Barnett found a bruise on Catrise\u2019s labia minora that had also been inflicted between one and six hours before her death. According to ScalaBarnett, such an injury is generally caused by a forceful attempt to penetrate the victim\u2019s vagina and \u201cnormal sexual activity\u201d would not cause such an injury. After finding that bruise, Scala-Barnett took cervical and vaginal swabs because the injuries indicated a possible sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">{\u00b6 11}. Catrise\u2019s mother, Antoine Lewis, and Sabrina Harris all attended Catrise\u2019s funeral, but none of them saw Williams there. Catrise\u2019s friend LaAmora Dawson saw Williams at the funeral but not at the cemetery afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">{\u00b6 12} On December 14, Toledo Police Detective James Scott located Williams and asked him to come to the police station with him so that a detective could talk to him about Catrise. Williams' agreed. When he got into Scott\u2019s car, Williams began to cry.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">{\u00b6 13} At the station, Detective Harold Mosley interviewed Williams. (Scott was also present during most of the interview.) Mosley began by asking Williams whether he knew why Mosley wanted to talk to him. Williams said that he did and said that he was \u201csurprised that [Mosley] hadn\u2019t talked to him before.\u201d Williams appeared anxious and emotional.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">{\u00b6 14} Williams told the detectives that he had last seen Catrise on Friday, December 8. He said that he had picked Catrise up at the Taco Bell that night between 9:30 and 9:45 p.m. and that she was angry with him because he was late. According to Williams, they went to his mother\u2019s house but left because nobody was home. They then went to Williams\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house and sat outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>for about half an hour, talking. When Catrise told Williams that she had to work the next day, Williams went inside the house, and Catrise drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">{\u00b6 15} Williams told the officers that 10 or 15 minutes after Catrise left, he walked to his cousin\u2019s house. After another 10 or 15 minutes, he left his cousin\u2019s house with a female acquaintance who gave him a ride to Cherry Street, and he walked to the nearby house of another female acquaintance. After a brief visit, he took a taxi to his brother\u2019s house, where he spent the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">{\u00b6 16} Mosley asked Williams whether he had had sex with Catrise at his mother\u2019s house. Williams said that he had not and claimed that the last time he had had sex with Catrise was on Tuesday, December 5. Mosley asked Williams whether he had killed Catrise. Williams was visibly upset by the question, but he denied killing Catrise.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 17} Semen extracted from the underwear on Catrise\u2019s body was subjected to DNA testing and was compared with known DNA samples from Williams. Angela Lineen, supervisor of the DNA laboratory at the Medical College of Ohio (\u201cMCO\u201d), determined that the semen from the underwear contained DNA that was consistent with the DNA sample from Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">{\u00b6 18} According to Dr. Ming You, also of MCO, Williams\u2019s DNA pattern would occur in 1 in 250,000 African-Americans, 1 in 12.4 million Hispanics, and 1 in 33.4 million Caucasians. Moreover, all genetic markers found in the underwear could be attributed to either Catrise or her assailant; there was no evidence that a third party had contributed DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">{\u00b6 19} Brian Wraxall of the Serological Research Institute, a private consulting laboratory, examined DNA from sperm cells found on the cervical swab taken during the autopsy. The DNA was consistent with Williams\u2019s DNA, but a conclusive match could not be made; one-fourth of the general male population could not be excluded as the source.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">{\u00b6 20} Wraxall also noted that the large quantity of sperm on the swab and the large number of sperm having intact tails indicated that sexual intercourse had taken place within 24 hours before Catrise\u2019s death, on a conservative estimate. He explained that bodily functions cause sperm to break down quickly inside the body, but those functions stop when a person dies. Thus, the more sperm and the more sperm with intact tails found after death, the briefer the interval between intercourse and death. According to Wraxall, since Catrise was alive at 9:30 p.m. on Friday, December 8, 1995, the time she left Taco Bell, the sperm could not have been deposited on Tuesday, December 5, which is when Williams claimed to have last had sex with Catrise.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">{\u00b6 21} Jeffrey Williams, a forensic scientist in the serology DNA analysis unit of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, examined a slide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>made using the vaginal swab taken during the autopsy of Catrise\u2019s body. Like Wraxall, he also found large numbers of sperm with intact tails and concluded that intercourse likely took place no more than 24 hours before death.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">{\u00b6 22} A two-count indictment was returned against Williams. Count One charged him with aggravated murder while committing rape. R.C. 2903.01(B). Specification One, a death-penalty specification, alleged that Williams committed the aggravated murder while committing rape and that he was the principal offender in the aggravated murder. R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). Count Two charged Williams with rape. R.C. 2907.02(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">{\u00b6 23} The jury found Williams guilty of both counts and of the specification. When the jury returned its guilt-phase verdict, Williams assaulted one of his attorneys. Shortly thereafter, the court adjourned for the weekend. Defense counsel did not visit Williams in jail over the weekend between the guilt and penalty phases, a step they said they would have taken but for the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">{\u00b6 24} When court reconvened the next Monday, both defense attorneys moved to withdraw from the case. The judge asked each attorney whether he could fulfill his obligation to represent Williams zealously. The attorney who had been assaulted said that he could not. He admitted that he was afraid of Williams and that he felt that the assault had \u201cpoisoned the relationship.\u201d His co-counsel could not definitively answer the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">{\u00b6 25} Despite these answers, the trial court was not persuaded that the assault had rendered the attorneys unable to zealously represent Williams. The court therefore denied leave to withdraw. The penalty phase proceeded, and the jury recommended a death sentence for the aggravated murder. The trial judge sentenced Williams to death. Williams appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">I. Jury Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">A. Juror\u2019s Repudiation of Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">{\u00b6 26} On Friday, March 19, 1999, the jury returned its guilt-phase verdict of guilty on both counts and on the death specification. The jury was polled; each juror was asked whether this was his or her vote, and each answered, Wes.\u201d The signed verdict forms were filed that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">{\u00b6 27} On Monday, March 22, before the penalty phase began, the jurors were individually asked by the court whether they could set aside Williams\u2019s assault on his attorney the previous Friday. After being questioned, juror Middlebrooks asked to speak to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">{\u00b628} Middlebrooks said that she was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Williams was guilty of rape. She acknowledged that the guilt-phase verdict was hers, and when asked, \u201cAre they still your verdicts?\u201d she said, \u201cYes.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>But she said that her vote on the rape charge did not reflect her opinion; she said that she had signed the form because of pressure from other jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 29} The next day, an order was entered in the trial court\u2019s journal stating that the defendant had been found guilty of Counts 1 and 2 and the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 30} In his first proposition of law, Williams contends that a juror may repudiate her vote at any time until the jury\u2019s verdict has been entered on the trial court\u2019s journal. Since the jury\u2019s guilt-phase verdict had not been journalized at the time that Middlebrooks sought to retract her vote, Williams contends that his motion for a new trial should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 31} In support of this argument, Williams quotes <em>Mapes v. Coyle </em>(C.A.6, 1999), 171 F.3d 408, a federal decision interpreting Ohio law as follows: \u201cA juror may change her mind at any time <em>before the verdict is entered </em>* * (Emphasis added.) Id. at 424. However, other language in <em>Mapes </em>makes clear that \u201centered\u201d means affirmed when polled: \u201c[A] juror may change his mind <em>between the jury room and the court room.\u201d </em>Id. at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 32} Moreover, <em>Mapes </em>is distinguishable from this case. In <em>Mapes, </em>a juror gave an ambiguous response <em>when the jury was </em>polled; <em>Mapes </em>held that the trial court should have inquired to determine whether the juror had changed her mind. <em>Mapes </em>did not involve the issue raised in this case: whether a juror may change her mind <em>after </em>being polled and affirming that the verdict is her own, but <em>before </em>the verdict has been journalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">{\u00b6 33} Similarly, in <em>State v. Brown </em>(1953), 110 Ohio App. 57, 12 O.O.2d 227, 168 N.E.2d 419 \u2014 the Ohio case on which <em>Mapes </em>principally relied \u2014 a juror equivocated when the jury was polled. The court of appeals held that the juror had a right to change her vote, and that the trial court should have directed the jury to deliberate further. The court observed: \u201cA juror may, after coming into court, change his vote, and so express himself to the court <em>when the poll is taken.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at 61, 12 O.O.2d 227, 168 N.E.2d 419. Thus, neither <em>Mapes </em>nor <em>Brown </em>supports the broad proposition that a juror may repudiate her vote at any time <em>before journalization of the verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">{\u00b6 34} Numerous cases hold that the verdict becomes final once the jury has been polled and each juror has assented to the verdict in open court. \u201cA verdict is final if (1) the deliberations are over, (2) the result is announced in open court, and (3) the jury is polled and no dissent is registered.\u201d <em>United States v. White </em>(C.A.5, 1992), 972 F.2d 590, 595. See, also, <em>United States v. Dakins </em>(C.A.D.C. 1989), 872 F.2d 1061, 1065; <em>United States v. Williams </em>(C.A.9,1993), 990 F.2d 507, 513; <em>Boykins v. United States </em>(D.C.1997), 702 A.2d 1242, 1247, 1249; <em>Tinch v. State </em>(1997), 113 Nev. 1170, 946 P.2d 1061, 1064; <em>Ross v. State </em>(1975), 24 Md.App. 246, 249-256, 330 A.2d 507, reversed on other grounds (1976), 276 Md. 664, 350 A.2d 680. Compare <em>State v. Knight </em>(1988), 143 Wis.2d 408, 421 N.W.2d 847 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>(verdict not final until accepted by trial court and verdict is deemed accepted when received and announced in open court).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>United States v. Dakins, </em>supra, the court specifically rejected a claim similar to that urged by Williams \u2014 that a juror could repudiate her vote at any time until the verdict was file-stamped and docketed: \u201cThe time at which the courtroom clerk attended to the strictly clerical task of file-stamping the verdict form and docketing the verdict is immaterial. * * * A verdict becomes immutable by the jury once announced in open court, or when it has been confirmed by a poll, if ordered.\u201d 872 F.2d at 1065. Accord <em>Boykins v. United States, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 36} We agree with these cases. In our view, the jury poll is well suited to serve as the benchmark of finality. The poll is a solemn ceremony whose formality signals the conclusive nature of the verdict to all who are present. <em>Ross v. State, </em>supra, 24 Md.App. at 255, 330 A.2d 507. The poll focuses each juror\u2019s attention on the verdict and gives each a clear-cut opportunity \u201cto declare in open court her assent to or dissent from the [verdict].\u201d <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 121, 734 N.E.2d 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 37} The function of the poll is \u201cto enable the court and the parties to ascertain with certainty that a unanimous verdict has in fact been reached and that no juror has been coerced or induced to agree to a verdict to which he has not fully assented.\u201d <em>Miranda v. United States </em>(C.A.1, 1958), 255 F.2d 9, 17; see, also, <em>Hessler. </em>Once that function has been accomplished, there is no compelling reason to let individual jurors change their minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 38} Thus, we hold that once a poll of the jurors has been completed and all have assented to the verdict, a juror may not thereafter rescind or modify his or her vote. Accordingly, Williams\u2019s first proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">B. Jury Selection</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 39} In his fourth proposition of law, Williams contends that two prospective jurors were improperly dismissed for cause. He argues that under <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776, and R.C. 2945.25(C), it is improper to excuse a prospective juror for cause in the death-qualification process unless the juror unequivocally states that he would not recommend death under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 40} However, the constitutional standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause based on his views on capital punishment is whether the juror\u2019s views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and oath. <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 412, 424, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841; <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E.2d 984, paragraph three of the syllabus. We have held that if a juror satisfies the <em>Witt </em>criterion, he may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>excluded for cause under the catchall provision of R.C. 2945.25(0) even when he does not satisfy the more specific R.C. 2945.25(C). <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 139, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795; <em>State v. Beuke </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 29, 38, 526 N.E.2d 274. Williams invites us to overrule these holdings, but we decline. See, e.g., <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 329, 652 N.E.2d 1000. Williams\u2019s fourth proposition of law is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 41} Prospective juror Nissen was excluded for cause based on his views regarding capital punishment. In his fifth proposition of law, Williams contends that it was improper to exclude Nissen even under the <em>Witt </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 42} Nissen was opposed to the death penalty due to his religious beliefs. The judge asked him whether he could \u201cfollow the instructions and apply the instructions of law and fairly consider imposing the death penalty if appropriate in a case.\u201d Nissen said, \u201c[I]f beyond a reasonable doubt I still think I would stay with my belief.\u201d The judge then asked, \u201c[I]f the aggravating factors overcame the mitigating factors and the Court instructs you that you must impose the death penalty, are you saying that you could not apply the law in that case and vote to impose the death penalty?\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d Nissen said.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 43} However, under questioning by defense counsel, Nissen seemed to contradict himself. He stated that he could follow the trial court\u2019s instructions even if the evidence supported a decision to recommend death.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 44} The trial judge then asked, \u201cDoes that mean in spite of your religious views if based upon the evidence and the instructions of law beyond a reasonable doubt the Court has instructed you under certain circumstances if you find aggravating factors outweighing mitigating factors you must impose the death penalty, would you do that?\u201d Nissen replied, <em>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I could.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial court granted the state\u2019s challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 45} A trial court\u2019s resolution of a challenge for cause will be upheld on appeal unless it is unsupported by substantial testimony. <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 203, 211, 58 O.O.2d 409, 280 N.E.2d 915. Nissen\u2019s answers supported the trial court\u2019s decision. The trial court informed Nissen that the jury must impose the death penalty if it found that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating circumstances and asked him whether he would follow such an instruction. Nissen said that he did not think that he could. Thus, the court could find that his ability to perform his duty in accordance with the court\u2019s instructions was substantially impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">{\u00b6 46} Williams contends that once his counsel elicited Nissen\u2019s statement that \u201cI can follow his instructions,\u201d the inquiry should have immediately ended. Therefore, he asks us to disregard all that Nissen said after that point. But the trial judge has discretion over the scope, length, and manner of voir dire. See <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 40; <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 190, 702 N.E.2d 866. Where, as here, the juror appears to contradict an earlier statement that he could not vote to impose the death penalty, a judge does not exceed his discretion by trying to resolve the contradiction. The judge did not have to take the statement elicited by defense counsel as the juror\u2019s last word on the subject. See <em>Frazier, </em>supra, 73 Ohio St.3d at 328, 652 N.E.2d 1000. Williams\u2019s fifth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 47} In his sixth proposition of law, Williams contends that prospective juror Smith should have been excused for cause. Smith stated on voir dire that because of the training police officers receive, he \u201cprobably would\u201d believe a police officer\u2019s testimony as to what he had observed more than he would believe similar testimony by a layperson. When asked if he could set that opinion aside, Smith said, \u201cI would like to believe I could set it aside, but honestly I can\u2019t say yes or no to that question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 48} However, when questioned further, Smith stated that he would not automatically give the testimony of police officers greater credence or weight than other witnesses but would weigh such testimony in the same way that he would weigh other testimony. Thus, substantial testimony supports the denial of the defense challenge for cause. <em>Wilson, </em>supra. Williams\u2019s sixth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">II. Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 49} In his 12th proposition of law, Williams contends that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. See, generally, R.C. 2953.02; <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 102-103, 684 N.E.2d 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 50} We begin our analysis by considering whether the evidence of guilt was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. On sufficiency-of-the-evidence review, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">{\u00b6 51} We find that the evidence is sufficient to establish Williams\u2019s guilt of the crime of which he was convicted. Williams points out that there were no witnesses to the crimes and that he did not confess. And although the exact time of Catrise\u2019s death is unknown, he further claims that no witness saw him with Catrise \u201cnear the time of her death.\u201d But Catrise was murdered between 9:30 p.m., December 8 (when Williams picked her up from work) and 9:00 a.m., December 9 (when her car was first seen parked on Addington Drive). Her body was found in her car, which was the same car that Williams had picked her up in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Williams had a motive: Catrise was carrying his child, her pregnancy was a source of tension between them, and she intended to break up with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 52} We reject Williams\u2019s claim that there is no physical evidence tying him to the crimes. The presence on the cervical and vaginal swabs of numerous sperm cells with tails intact shows that some person had sexual intercourse with Catrise no more than 24 hours before her death. The presence on Catrise\u2019s underwear of semen with DNA consistent with Williams\u2019s DNA is evidence that Williams was that person. Moreover, because Catrise practiced good hygiene, it can be inferred that the semen on her underwear got there near the time of her death, rather than three days before \u2014 which is when Williams claimed to have last had sex with Catrise.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 53} Because DNA evidence involves \u201cstatistics and probabilities,\u201d Williams contends that it is not \u201cactual evidence.\u201d We disagree with that conclusion. Williams further claims that the DNA evidence was inconclusive. That is true only with respect to the cervical swab taken during the autopsy, which could only narrow the suspect field down to 25 percent of the male population. But the DNA extracted from Catrise\u2019s underwear was consistent with Williams\u2019s DNA, and that particular DNA pattern would be consistent with only 1 in 250,000 African-Americans, 1 in 12.4 million Hispanics, and 1 in 33.4 million Caucasians.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 54} Moreover, Williams told police that he had last had sex with Catrise three days before her death. The physical evidence noted above indicates that Williams lied about this. The trier of fact was at liberty to infer consciousness of guilt from Williams\u2019s lie. See <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 96, 100, 545 N.E.2d 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 55} The nonconsensual nature of the intercourse that occurred within 24 hours of her death was indicated, in part, by the fact that Catrise was murdered soon thereafter. As the United States Supreme Court has observed, being murdered is \u201c \u2018a fate more frequent among rape victims than friendly sex partners.\u2019 \u201d <em>Calderon v. Thompson </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 538, 561, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728, quoting <em>Thompson v. Calderon </em>(C.A.9, 1997), 120 F.3d 1045, 1073 (Kleinfeld, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">{\u00b6 56} At trial, Dr. Scala-Barnett, the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy, testified that \u201c[w]hen you see a strangulation death in a female, it is our experience that it is more than likely associated with a sexual assault.\u201d Further, Dr. Scala-Barnett testified that \u201cin sexual assault victims when the victims are females, the most likely cause of death is strangulation.\u201d Thus, the jury could have drawn a reasonable inference from the facts that the intercourse was nonconsensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">{\u00b6 57} Catrise also had bruises and other injuries under her upper lip, her nose, ear, chin, and neck. She had no visible injuries when she left work at 9:30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>p.m. on December 8. The injuries she suffered certainly permit the inference that the sexual intercourse was nonconsensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 58} Catrise also had a bruise on her labia minora. Like her other injuries, that bruise was inflicted between one and six hours before Catrise\u2019s death. Dr. Scala-Barnett testified that that bruise indicates that someone had attempted to penetrate her vagina by force:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cA. Miss Gregory had a bruise on the labia minora at the 4 o\u2019clock position.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cA. * * * That\u2019s all recent bruise.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">{\u00b6 62} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cQ. And what would cause that type of injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cA. Generally we see that kind of injury from attempts at entrance into the vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">{\u00b6 65} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cQ. Is it normally associated with sexual activity?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cA. Not normal sexual activity, no.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-15\">{\u00b6 68} Dr. Scala-Barnett explained that the genital bruising was a sign indicating that the victim had been raped:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cQ. * * * And what is a rape kit?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cA. A rape kit is when we take samples, specimens for an evaluation for sexual assault. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cQ. Was that done in this particular case?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-19\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-20\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cQ. And why?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-21\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cA. Because <em>you </em>\u2014 when <em>you see injuries to the genitalia, first of all you are suspicious of sexual assault, </em>and that is one way to confirm that that activity may have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-22\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cQ. And was the injury that you saw to the labia minora, was that caused by force?</p>\n<p id=\"b631-23\">{\u00b6 76} \u201cA. That is consistent with being caused by force, yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-24\">{\u00b6 77} On cross-examination, Scala-Barnett reiterated that the bruise was an indicator of rape:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-25\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cQ. Would it be fair to say that but for the bruise to the labia, there was [sic] no other indicia of rape or any type \u2014 anything like that?</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>{\u00b6 79} \u201cA. No. There was [sic] no other stigmata of rape <em>except for the bruise on the genitalia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cQ. And as relates to the labia and that bruising, you indicated that it is consistent with what?</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cA. Forced entry.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 82} Moreover, even though Catrise had previously had a sexual relationship with Williams, the evidence shows that their relationship had deteriorated to the point where Catrise was determined to break up with Williams. Williams admitted to police that Catrise had been angry with him on the last night of her life because he had been late picking her up. Finally, there was testimony that Catrise was feeling ill that night because of her pregnancy. All these facts reduce the likelihood that Catrise would have consented to sexual intercourse with Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 83} Finding the evidence legally sufficient, we turn to Williams\u2019s manifest-weight 'claim. A court considering such a claim \u201creview[s] the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717, paragraph three of the syllabus. See <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 84} Williams challenges the credibility of Detective Mosley\u2019s account of his interrogation. His argument centers on Mosley\u2019s testimony about his interrogation notes. Mosley testified that he did not take notes when he interviewed Williams but prepared his report 18 months later from memory. Some of the facts that Mosley testified to did not appear in his report. Mosley\u2019s supervisor, Sergeant Steve Forrester, testified that Mosley was mistaken: Mosley had taken notes and then used them to write his report. The notes no longer existed at the time of trial because it was \u201ccommon practice\u201d for officers to dispose of rough notes after writing a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">{\u00b6 85} Williams suggests that Mosley\u2019s incorrect testimony about the notes, combined with the loss or destruction of the notes themselves, renders the rest of his testimony incredible. However, Detective Scott corroborated Mosley\u2019s account of the interrogation. Scott specifically recalled Mosley\u2019s asking Williams when he had last had sex with Catrise, and Williams\u2019s replying, \u201cTuesday before she was found.\u201d And Forrester, who had read Mosley\u2019s notes, testified that they were consistent with Mosley\u2019s report and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cThe discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717, paragraph three of the syllabus. This is not such a case. Williams\u2019s arguments fall far short of demonstrating that the jury lost its way and committed a clear miscarriage of justice. Williams\u2019s 12th proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">III. <em>Miranda </em>Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 87} Because they did not consider Williams to be \u201cin custody,\u201d Detectives Mosley and Scott did not administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Williams before interviewing him on December 14, 1995. See <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. In his third proposition of law, Williams contends that the interview was a custodial interrogation, that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were therefore required, and that, because no warnings were given, his statements should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 88} Pursuant to <em>Miranda, </em>statements \u201cstemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant\u201d must be suppressed unless the defendant had been informed of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights before being questioned. \u201cCustodial interrogation\u201d means \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 89} However, police are not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings to everyone they question, even if the questioning takes place at the police station. <em>Oregon v. Mathiason </em>(1977), 429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714. Moreover, \u201can officer\u2019s subjective and undisclosed view concerning whether the person being interrogated is a suspect is irrelevant to the assessment whether the person is in custody.\u201d <em>Stansbury v. California </em>(1994), 511 U.S. 318, 319, 114 S.Ct. 1526, 128 L.Ed.2d 293. Instead, the question is whether the suspect has been arrested or restrained from movement to the degree associated with a formal arrest. <em>California v. Beheler </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 90} Detectives Mosley and Scott were the only witnesses at the hearing on Williams\u2019s motion to suppress. Scott testified that, on December 14, 1995, Mosley asked him to help locate Catrise\u2019s boyfriend \u201cso we could talk to him\u201d about Catrise\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 91} Scott then drove around in an area that he knew Williams frequented. When he saw Williams, Scott pulled over, identified himself as a police officer, and asked Williams whether he would accompany him to the police station, where a detective \u201cwanted to speak to [him] * * * concerning his girlfriend.\u201d Williams agreed to come along. During this encounter, Scott did not draw his weapon, tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Williams that he was under arrest, handcuff him, or force him to accompany him. In fact, Scott never even got out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 92} At the station, Williams was not fingerprinted or photographed. Scott and Williams went upstairs to the detective bureau, where they waited for Mosley in a \u201ccomfortable\u201d reception area.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 93} When Mosley arrived, Scott took Williams into a room and asked him to have a seat. Mosley introduced himself and asked Williams whether he knew why he was asked to come to the station. Williams said he did and added that he was \u201csurprised that [Mosley] hadn\u2019t tried to interview him before.\u201d Mosley asked Williams whether he wanted a drink or needed to use the restroom. Williams turned down both offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 94} Mosley explained to Williams that he was not in custody and was free to leave whenever he wanted.. Williams\u2019s movement was not restricted. Although Scott and Mosley were closer to the door than Williams was, the officers were not blocking the doorway. Mosley did not recall whether he and Scott were wearing side arms at this time. (Mosley usually took his weapon off before interviewing a suspect.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 95} Mosley then began to question Williams, eliciting the statements'that Williams later moved to suppress. The interview ended when Williams asked for an attorney and said that he did not want to talk anymore. Williams\u2019s mother or grandmother came to the station to pick him up, and he left.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 96} As the trial court noted, these facts closely resemble the facts of <em>Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714, supra. In <em>Mathiason, </em>the respondent voluntarily came to the station in response to an officer\u2019s request. The officer interviewed him in a closed office for half an hour, telling him at the outset that he was not under arrest. After the interview, the respondent left.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">{\u00b6 97} The <em>Mathiason </em>court held that the respondent\u2019s statements were admissible, finding \u201cno indication that * * * respondent\u2019s freedom to depart was restricted in any way. * * * It is clear from these facts that Mathiason was not in custody \u2018or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714, quoting <em>Miranda </em>at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602,16 L.Ed.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">{\u00b6 98} Like the respondent in <em>Mathiason, </em>Williams came to the station voluntarily, was not formally arrested, was told before the interview that he was free to leave, and did in fact leave at the close of the interview. Although there are some slight differences between this interview conducted in this case and in Mathiason,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they do not dilute the analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>{\u00b6 99} Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that the detectives behaved in an overbearing or intimidating fashion. In his brief, Williams states that \u201c[t]wo officers, armed, blocked the exit\u201d to the room. But the detectives testified without contradiction that they did not block the exit. And there was no evidence that the detectives were armed. But even if they were, that fact would not measurably strengthen Williams\u2019s argument. Police officers usually carry weapons, and Williams makes no claim that the detectives displayed their weapons in a threatening manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 100} On these facts, the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly correct. Williams\u2019s freedom of movement was not restrained. Therefore, he was not in custody, and there was no need to give him <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Williams\u2019s third proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">IV. Prejudicial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">{\u00b6 101} Catrise\u2019s mother testified that Catrise had intended to carry her pregnancy to term. In his eighth proposition, Williams claims that this testimony was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. We disagree. The state was entitled to suggest a possible motive for the murder, and the testimony of Catrise\u2019s mother indicated that Catrise\u2019s desire to keep her baby was a source of friction between Catrise and Williams: \u201c[T]he relationship didn\u2019t seem like it was working out. He [Williams] could not maintain a job. The car issue came up, and like I said, <em>she wanted to keep her baby and she was going to.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Williams\u2019s eighth proposition is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">V. Guilt-Phase Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 102} In his ninth proposition, Williams contends that the prosecution committed misconduct in the guilt phase of his trial. However, at trial although Williams objected to one statement, he did not object to the other statements that he now claims were improper. Further, the statements, if error at all, do not qualify as plain error. See, generally, <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27-28, 759 N.E.2d 1240. His claims are therefore waived, and his ninth proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">VI. Guilt-Phase Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">{\u00b6 103} In his tenth proposition, Williams alleges two errors in the guilt-phase instructions to the jury. One alleged error involved the following instruction on causation:</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">{\u00b6 104} \u201cThe causal responsibility of the defendant for an unlawfu[l] act is not limited to its immediate or most obvious result. He is responsible for the natural, logical and foreseeable results that follow in the ordinary course of events from an unlawful act. The test for foreseeability is not whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>defendant should have foreseen the injury in its precise form. The test is whether a reasonably prudent person in light of all the circumstances would have anticipated that the death of Catrise Gregory was likely to result from the performance of the unlawful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">{\u00b6 105} Williams contends that this instruction permits a conviction without a finding of specific intent to kill. We have expressed concern that the standard foreseeability instruction may be confusing in aggravated murder cases. <em>State v. Burchfield </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 261, 263, 611 N.E.2d 819. \u201cThe use of that instruction, however, does not require reversal where the instructions as a whole make clear that the jury must find purpose to kill in order to convict.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 100, 656 N.E.2d 643. Here, \u201c[t]he trial court extensively instructed the jury on the requirement of purpose and intent prior to the causation language.\u201d <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 346, 703 N.E.2d 1251. Thus, the causation instruction was not plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 106} The second error that Williams alleges regarding the guilt-phase jury instructions involves the reasonable-doubt instruction. We summarily reject this claim of error on authority of <em>State v. Van Gundy </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 230, 594 N.E.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">VII. Guilt-Phase Ineffective Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 107} In his 11th proposition, Williams contends that his counsel failed to render effective assistance in the guilt phase. To prevail, Williams must show deficient performance, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">{\u00b6 108} Williams contends that his counsel should have objected when prospective jurors Tay and Haudan were excused for cause due to their beliefs on the death penalty. Tay initially said that she could not return a death sentence, and then said that she did not know whether she could and that she was \u201ctoo soft\u201d and \u201ctoo emotional.\u201d Haudan vacillated: at one point he said that he \u201cguess[ed]\u201d he could vote for a death sentence, but he repeatedly said that he did not know whether he could, and he ended by saying that he did not think that he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">{\u00b6 109} It was reasonable for counsel not to object to the exclusion of these jurors; since they could not say conclusively whether they were capable of voting to impose the death penalty, an objection would have had little chance of success.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">{\u00b6 110} During voir dire, the prosecutor described mitigating factors to one prospective juror as \u201cthe good things that the defense would present on Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Williams\u2019s behalf.\u201d Williams faults his counsel for not objecting to this statement. However, counsel had no basis to object. Cf. <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 38, 553 N.E.2d 576 (no basis for objection to court\u2019s explanation during voir dire that aggravating circumstances were circumstances that show an offense was \u201ccruel,\u201d \u201cheinous,\u201d \u201cparticularly terrible,\u201d or \u201cvery bad\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">{\u00b6 111} Williams also contends that counsel should have objected to instructions on causation and reasonable doubt. , However, failure to object to the causation instruction was not prejudicial, because the instructions as a whole made clear that the jury had to find purpose to kill in order to convict. Failing to object to the reasonable-doubt instruction was also not deficient performance; such an objection would have been unsupported by existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 112} Williams contends that counsel should have objected to certain testimony in the state\u2019s case-in-chief that he asserts was introduced only to elicit juror sympathy. For example, Catrise\u2019s mother testified that Catrise had been \u201cvery rebellious\u201d until the age of 15, when she made \u201ca complete turnaround\u201d and began to act like \u201ca normal child,\u201d was interested in school, and attended several proms.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 113} However, not objecting appears to have been a tactical decision by defense counsel, who made their own use of this testimony. Cross-examining Mrs. Gregory, counsel elicited testimony that there had been occasions when Catrise failed to come home at night, and that, at the time of her death, she still had the habit of not coming home when she was upset or did not want to deal with an issue. Defense counsel exploited these points in closing argument: \u201cMrs. Gregory testified that it wasn\u2019t unusual for Catrise not to come home. It wasn\u2019t the first time that she had not come home when she was upset * * *. She said that on those occasions when [Catrise] did not come home, * * * she could not tell you that she was with [Williams].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 114} Williams also contends that other details about Catrise\u2019s life were offered solely to elicit juror sympathy. He points specifically to evidence that Catrise worked and was one of the best employees, she practiced good hygiene, and took care of her appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">{\u00b6 115} But each of these facts was relevant to the issue of Williams\u2019s guilt. It was relevant that Catrise worked because she was last seen alive when Williams picked her up from her workplace. The fact that she was a good employee helped narrow the time of her death; Catrise was scheduled to open the Taco Bell on Saturday morning, December 9, but she failed to report to work that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">{\u00b6 116} Finally, Catrise\u2019s concern with her appearance and cleanliness was relevant to the issue of rape. Williams told police that he had last had sex with Catrise the Tuesday before her body was found, but semen with DNA consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>with Williams\u2019s was on the underwear that was on Catrise\u2019s body. Hence, in order to believe Williams\u2019s claim, the trier of fact would have to believe that on Friday Catrise was wearing the same underwear that she had worn on the previous Tuesday. Catrise\u2019s habit of cleanliness shows that it was unlikely that she would do that. Cf. <em>State v. Allen </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 626, 633, 653 N.E.2d 675 (\u201cTestimony that [the victim] was an immaculate housekeeper was relevant to show that she likely would have wiped [the defendant\u2019s] fingerprint off her glasses had he placed it there before the murder\u201d). Thus, the testimony concerning Catrise\u2019s habits was relevant to show that Williams lied about the last time that he had had sex with Catrise.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 117} Because the testimony at issue was relevant to guilt and was not used to elicit the jury\u2019s sympathy, it was admissible. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 354, 528 N.E.2d 910. Counsel\u2019s failure to object to this testimony was not deficient performance, because such objections would have had no merit and would likely have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">(\u00b6 118} Williams contends that his counsel should have objected to the \u201cirrelevant\u201d testimony that he did not attend Catrise\u2019s funeral or go to the cemetery after the funeral. We find no prejudice. There is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the guilt phase would have been otherwise if Williams had objected to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 119} Williams contends that the state introduced irrelevant testimony regarding his prior arrests and that his counsel did not ask that it be stricken. However, Williams has misread the record. Detective Scott was asked when he had tried to locate witnesses in relation to the murder. He testified, \u201c[F]rom that time to the present time that I believe he [Williams] was arrested, off and on during that time.\u201d Defense counsel thought at first that Scott had referred to Williams being arrested \u201coff and on\u201d; however, when the testimony was read back, counsel realized that Scott had been referring to when he was looking for witnesses, and therefore counsel had no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 120} Williams next contends that counsel should have asked to have juror Daney removed from the jury. Daney was employed in a hospital cardiac unit, and she worked during the trial. The father of state witness Sergeant Forrester was a patient in the cardiac unit, being cared for by Daney. One evening during the trial, Daney had a two-minute conversation with Forrester, who was visiting his father. They talked only about Forrester\u2019s father. The state called the occurrence to the court\u2019s attention, and the court questioned Daney.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">{\u00b6 121} Daney stated that a recurrence was highly unlikely because she was not going to return to work during the trial and Forrester\u2019s father was to be transferred out of her unit. The conversation was not prejudicial; the situation was not going to recur, and Daney said that it would not affect her and pledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>not to discuss the matter with the other jurors. Counsel\u2019s decision to let Daney stay did not deprive Williams of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">{\u00b6 122} Williams contends that his counsel failed to put on a sufficient defense because they did not call defense witnesses whom he requested that they call. Latrice Lofton and Tara Morris would have testified that on the night of December 8, 1995, they drove Williams from his cousin\u2019s house to Lashon Grover\u2019s house. Grover would have testified that Williams visited him that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">{\u00b6 123} Defense counsel explained that they did not call these witnesses because their testimony would have partly confirmed Detective Mosley\u2019s account of what Williams told him. Williams protested this decision, insisting that he wanted the witnesses to be called.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">{\u00b6 124} Defense counsel\u2019s decision not to call the witnesses appears to have been a strategic decision. Moreover, it was a reasonable one. Counsel regarded Mosley\u2019s credibility as the \u201clinchpin\u201d of the state\u2019s case, and they had impeached it with some success by showing that Mosley testified inaccurately concerning his interrogation notes. Calling the witnesses would have undermined that strategy to some extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">{\u00b6 125} In general, \u201ccounsel\u2019s decision whether to call a witness falls within the rubric of trial strategy and will not be second-guessed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749. See, also, <em>State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, \u00b6 118. Moreover, \u201cstrategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>supra, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. The record shows that Williams\u2019s counsel investigated, ascertained what the witnesses would say, and made an informed, conscious choice between strategic options. On this record, we do not find that counsel performed deficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">{\u00b6 126} Indeed, Williams concedes that this strategy \u201cmight be sound in the proper case.\u201d Despite this concession, Williams claims that he received ineffective assistance because counsel disobeyed his instructions to call these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">{\u00b6 127} We disagree. \u201cNonfundamental rights, those rights that primarily involve trial strategy and tactics, are waivable by defense counsel on the defendant\u2019s behalf.\u201d <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 530, 684 N.E.2d 47. Decisions about what evidence to present and which witnesses to call are in this category and are committed to counsel\u2019s professional judgment. Id. See, also, <em>Brecheen v. Reynolds </em>(C.A.10, 1994), 41 F.3d 1343, 1368-1369, fn. 22; <em>United States v. Teague </em>(C.A.11, 1992), 953 F.2d 1525, 1531; <em>State v. Dulany </em>(Mo.1989), 781 S.W.2d 52, 57; <em>Shelton v. State </em>(1968), 3 Md.App. 394, 401, 239 A.2d 610; 1 American Bar Assn. Standards for Criminal Justice (2d Ed.1980) 4-65 to 4-66, Section 4-5.2(b). Williams\u2019s 11th proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>VIII. Penalty-Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">{\u00b6 128} Serious problems arose during the penalty phase of this case. Chief among these was the defendant\u2019s physical assault on one of his attorneys and the trial court\u2019s subsequent refusal to permit counsel to withdraw from the case. As we shall see, this incident likely resulted in later penalty-phase errors (improper prosecutorial arguments and an erroneous jury instruction) going uncorrected because of counsel\u2019s failure to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">{\u00b6 129} We find that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, the erroneous instruction, and the nearly total breakdown of communication between Williams and his counsel combined to render the sentencing in this case fundamentally unfair. The death sentence therefore cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">A. Denial of Counsel\u2019s Motion to Withdraw</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">{\u00b6 130} When the jury returned its guilt-phase verdict, Williams punched Spiros Cocoves, one of his defense attorneys, in the face. The assault happened in the courtroom and in front of the jury. Immediately after the assault, Cocoves indicated that he was willing to continue as Williams\u2019s counsel. Shortly thereafter, the court adjourned for the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">{\u00b6 131} On the following Monday, both Cocoves and his co-counsel, Ronnie Wingate, filed motions to withdraw. Cocoves told the court that during the weekend he had given a great deal of thought to whether he should continue representing Williams. He stated that his relationship with Williams had \u201ceroded\u201d and that Williams was refusing to talk to him. Cocoves asserted that there had been \u201ca breakdown in the attorney-client relationship of such magnitude as to jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">{\u00b6 132} The judge asked each attorney whether he could fulfill his obligation to represent Williams effectively and zealously. Cocoves said, \u201c[L]acking a definite answer I would have to say that no, I cannot.\u201d Wingate stated that he could not \u201cdefinitively\u201d answer that question either.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">{\u00b6 133} Cocoves explained that he was afraid of Williams and that the assault had \u201cpoisoned the relationship.\u201d Cocoves indicated that he would not be able to consult with Williams \u201cwithout some fear of getting popped one, and that [that] fear would almost inevitably be communicated to the jury, which would result in some prejudice to Mr. Williams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">{\u00b6 134} The trial court nonetheless denied counsel\u2019s motions to withdraw. In his second proposition of law, Williams contends that the trial court thereby abused its discretion because the assault had irreparably harmed the attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">{\u00b6 135} \u201cAn indigent defendant * * * must demonstrate \u2018good cause\u2019 to warrant substitution of counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Iles </em>(C.A.6, 1990), 906 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>1122, 1130. We have indicated that a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship will warrant substitution if the breakdown is so severe as to jeopardize the defendant\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 286, 292, 525 N.E.2d 792. See, also, <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 73, 717 N.E.2d 298. The trial court\u2019s decision is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Iles, 906 F.2d at 1130-1131, fn. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">{\u00b6 136} On the particular set of facts present in this record, we find that the trial court did abuse its discretion in denying counsel\u2019s motions to withdraw. Cocoves confessed that he was afraid of Williams, and he had good reason to be. With laudable candor, Cocoves and Wingate each stated that they could not continue to fulfill their professional obligation to their client.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">{\u00b6 137} Indeed, the incident had already begun to diminish the effectiveness of defense counsel. Cocoves and Wingate told the court that they ordinarily would have spent most of the weekend before the penalty phase with their client discussing mitigating factors. Here such discussions were especially important because Williams had previously refused to talk to counsel about mitigation. However, because of the assault, counsel did not contact Williams over the 'weekend. We note the difficult position in which counsel found themselves. But counsel\u2019s inability to discuss the case with Williams exemplifies why the motions to withdraw should have been granted. After the assault, there was a complete breakdown in communications between counsel and client.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">{\u00b6 138} By denying the motions, the trial court put counsel in an untenable position. They had very little communication with Williams, they were frightened of him, and they worried that their fear would be revealed to the jury through their body language when at the defense table with Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">{\u00b6 139} This is particularly damaging to a defendant during the penalty phase of a capital case when counsel must humanize the defendant for the jury, show his character in the best light available, and bring his good qualities to the fore. The attorneys in this case recognized \u2014 and demonstrated \u2014 that they could not continue to represent Williams zealously.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">{\u00b6 140} On the unique facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to recognize that good cause existed to grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And the result of that error, as we discuss below, was that Williams was denied the effective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>B. Penalty-Phase Errors</p>\n<p id=\"AQ0u\">1. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">{\u00b6 141} In his 15th proposition of law, Williams contends that misconduct by the prosecution so tainted the penalty phase that it denied him a fair sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">{\u00b6 142} We agree with Williams that extensive prosecutorial misconduct took place. The prosecutor asked the jury to weigh, as aggravating circumstances, a number of facts that are not statutory aggravating circumstances. R.C. 2929.04(A). These nonstatutory. aggravating circumstances included the final thoughts of the murder victim, the suffering of the victim\u2019s mother, and the death of the victim\u2019s unborn child.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">{\u00b6 143} The prosecutor began by telling the jury that it should consider whether the \u201caggravating circumstance <em>combined with the nature and circumstances of the crime here outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The state concedes that this argument was improper. Although the jury must consider the nature and circumstances of the crime, it is well settled that the nature and circumstances of the crime may not be weighed against the mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 356, 662 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">{\u00b6 144} Next, the prosecutor discussed the suffering of Catrise\u2019s mother: \u2018You also have the impact on her family, her mother never going to get to hold her again, her mother never going to get to hold her grandson, because that\u2019s part of the facts and circumstances of this crime.\u201d The suffering inflicted on Catrise\u2019s mother by the murder would not have been admissible if offered as evidence. See, generally, <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 445-446, 709 N.E.2d 140. The prosecutor\u2019s invocation of it in argument was likewise improper. See <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 679, 687 N.E.2d 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">{\u00b6 145} The prosecutor went on to describe the purported last thoughts and feelings of Catrise herself:</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">{\u00b6 146} \u201c[T]his is the person who fathered the child that she was carrying in her womb, puts his hands around her throat and chokes her, and she knows she is dying and she knows she can\u2019t do anything to protect her unborn fetus in those 30 seconds to a minute and a half * * *, the person one time she loved but just wanted to get away from, she could not do anything to stop it. She could not protect her child. That\u2019s part of the facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">{\u00b6 147} We have long held that prosecutors may not speculate about what the victim was thinking when she died. See <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 283, 581 N.E.2d 1071; <em>Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 357-358, 662 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">{\u00b6 148} The prosecutor put great stress upon the fact that Catrise\u2019s unborn child died with her:</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>{\u00b6 149} \u201cHe not only killed the 17-year-old girl, very young, but he also killed an unborn male fetus that would have survived, that would have been born. He killed the next generation. That\u2019s part of this case too, the victim impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">{\u00b6 150} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">{\u00b6 151} \u201c* * *[H]e made the choice to end the life of the fetus, because he knew she was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">{\u00b6 152} \u201cHe knowingly killed his next generation, and that\u2019s part of the facts and circumstances I think you must consider in this case. * * * That\u2019s what you have to put on the side of the board, of the ledger board, where you talk about the <em>aggravating circumstances </em>of this case. <em>That\u2019s what you have to weigh against the mitigating factors that have been presented to you. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The prosecutor thereby expressly told the jury that the nonstatutory circumstances he had discussed in his argument \u2014 including the suffering of Catrise and her mother and the death of Catrise\u2019s unborn child \u2014 were aggravating circumstances. In fact, none of these circumstances are statutory aggravating circumstances. See R.C. 2929.04(A). \u201c[I]t is improper for prosecutors in the penalty phase of a capital trial to make any comment before a jury that the nature and circumstances of the offense are \u2018aggravating circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 356, 662 N.E.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">{\u00b6 153} In his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor returned to the death of Catrise\u2019s unborn child: \u201cThis chart, he [defense counsel] talks about parole. What parole does, it gives him [Williams] hope. That\u2019s something Catrise Gregory doesn\u2019t have. That\u2019s something her unborn child doesn\u2019t have. In fact, at 2029, that child would have been 34 years old, but he didn\u2019t even take his first breath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">{\u00b6 154} We therefore reject the state\u2019s claim that the prosecutor made only an \u201cisolated error.\u201d Given the brevity of the state\u2019s closing arguments,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is not an exaggeration to say that they were dominated by prosecutorial error. And every error had the same tendency: to urge the jury to consider the most emotional aspects of the crime as if those aspects were legitimate aggravating circumstances. See <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 407-409, 613 N.E.2d 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">2. Instructional Error</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">{\u00b6 155} In his 17th proposition, Williams claims that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that \u201c[m]itigating factors * * * may be considered by you as extenuating or reducing the degree of the defendant\u2019s blame or punishment.\u201d We agree. As we said in <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 498, 709 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>484, \u201cMitigation is not about blame or culpability, but rather about punishment.\u201d In <em>State v. Lawrence </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 24, 28-29, 541 N.E.2d 451, we found that a similar penalty-phase instruction referring to blame, combined with other errors, was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">3. Plain-Error Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 156} We realize that defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments or to the incorrect instruction. (See our discussion under the heading \u201cIneffective Assistance of Counsel,\u201d which follows.) However, we find that these errors constituted plain error. See, generally, <em>State v. Barnes, </em>supra, 94 Ohio St.3d at 27-28, 759 N.E.2d 1240. The errors were obvious: the prosecutor\u2019s comments were inflammatory and flagrantly improper, and using the word \u201cblame\u201d in mitigation instructions has been held erroneous since <em>State v. Lawrence, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 157} Moreover, the improper comments and the instruction distorted the jury\u2019s understanding of the weighing process: the argument by increasing the number of aggravating circumstances and the instruction by misleading the jury as to the purpose of mitigating factors. Considering that the jury reached its recommended penalty only after first reporting a deadlock, we conclude that these errors, taken together, were outcome-determinative. See <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">{\u00b6 158} In his 16th proposition of law, Williams claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in the penalty phase. This proposition has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">{\u00b6 159} To begin with, defense counsel failed to object to the obvious prosecutorial misconduct in the closing argument. The state contends that defense counsel may have made a tactical decision not to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper statements. And it is true that declining to object to a closing argument is often a reasonable tactical choice. See, e.g., <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 539, 747 N.E.2d 765. It is also true that \u201cjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential,\u201d and we \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">{\u00b6 160} However, in this case we find that that presumption is overcome by the conduct manifested in the record before us. This was not a case in which counsel merely declined to object to a few instances of misconduct. Here, counsel sat mute through an argument that was dominated by misconduct and laden with the potential for unfair prejudice to the defendant. \u201cFrom counsel\u2019s function as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>assistant to the defendant derive[s] the overarching duty to advocate the defendant\u2019s cause * * <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">{\u00b6 161} More to the point, counsel made this choice after one of them had been physically assaulted by Williams and after both had admitted having serious misgivings about their ability to continue vigorous advocacy on Williams\u2019s behalf. We recognize that defense counsel were in an untenable position after the trial court denied them leave to withdraw. They had to represent a violent, willful, contentious client whom they feared. Yet even such a client is entitled to counsel who \u201cbring to bear such skill and knowledge as will render the trial a reliable adversarial testing process.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. On the unusual and compelling facts present in this record, we simply do not find it possible to blandly assume that counsel\u2019s inaction, in the face of clear and persistent misconduct, was the product of a conscious tactical decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 162} We further note that counsel failed to object to the incorrect instruction that mitigating factors may be considered to reduce the degree of the defendant\u2019s blame. We cannot see any possible advantage to Williams by not asking the trial court to correct this erroneous instruction. Moreover, we must again take into account the depth to which the relationship between counsel and client had sunk after Williams attacked Cocoves. When viewed against that backdrop, counsel\u2019s inaction does not appear to have been a tactical decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 163} Having identified these \u201cunprofessional errors,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at .694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, we turn to the issue of prejudice. At this stage, the question is whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. \u2018When a defendant challenges a death sentence * * *, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer * * * would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\u201d Id. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">{\u00b6 164} We believe that such a probability exists. Substantial mitigating factors existed in this case. The nature and circumstances of the offense are mitigating, inasmuch as this appears to have been a crime of passion. The penalty-phase testimony of Williams\u2019s mother, grandfather, and two sisters showed that Williams grew up without a father; that Williams nonetheless has a strong, close-knit family that loves him and will stand by him; and that he reciprocated their love and contributed to the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">{\u00b6 165} Moreover, the jury struggled to return a recommendation of death. After about six and one-half hours of deliberation, the jurors arrived at what they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>thought was a deadlock. After the court told them to review their instructions, the jurors deliberated for about eight and one-half hours longer before reaching unanimity on a recommended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">{\u00b6 166} Had Williams\u2019s counsel not made the errors noted above, it would have been even harder for the jury to recommend death. Counsel could have prevented or neutralized the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct by objecting to his improper closing arguments. Had they done this, the jury would not have had nonstatutory aggravating circumstances to weigh against the mitigating factors. Counsel should also have brought to the trial court\u2019s attention the erroneous instruction on mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">{\u00b6 167} While we express no view on whether the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors, we find a reasonable probability that the penalty-phase outcome would have been different but for the errors of defense counsel. It follows that Williams did not receive the effective assistance of counsel contemplated by the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 168} Accordingly, we sustain Williams\u2019s 2d, 15th, 16th, and 17th propositions of law. We affirm Williams\u2019s convictions of rape and aggravated murder with a rape-murder specification, vacate the sentence of death, and remand the cause for a new mitigation hearing pursuant to R.C. 2929.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b646-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

Williams\u2019s interview was longer than Mathiason\u2019s; there were two officers in the room with Williams; and an officer picked Williams up and drove him to the station, whereas Mathiason made his own way to the station.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b641-11\">. Nothing in the record suggests that Williams\u2019s misconduct was committed with the purpose of manipulating the trial court to his advantage.

I write separately because of my conviction that appellant should not be subject to a penalty of death on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">{\u00b6 170} Beyond a reasonable doubt, Shawn Williams killed Catrise Gregory. For that unconscionable crime he should be punished severely. However, he should not be sentenced to death, because evidence of rape, the death-penalty specification in this case, is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">{\u00b6 171} Williams would not be subject to the death penalty absent his conviction for rape. The primary evidence of rape is a doctor\u2019s testimony that a bruise on Catrise\u2019s labia minora could not have been caused by \u201cnormal sexual activity.\u201d That seems a bold statement given the wide range of consensual sexual activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>practiced in our society. I find it difficult to believe that the bruise could only have been caused by rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">{\u00b6 172} Williams and Catrise had a history of having consensual sex. Given that, I have considerable doubt that the sperm found on a cervical swab and in Catrise\u2019s underwear could only have been deposited there as a result of Williams raping her. I do not believe that the circumstantial evidence supports, beyond a reasonable doubt, a conviction of rape and the concomitant death specification. Accordingly, I would reverse Williams\u2019s rape conviction and his rape specification conviction and remand the cause for sentencing based solely on the murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">{\u00b6 173} Proposition of Law No. 1: Because a verdict is final only when it is entered on the journal, a juror may retract her verdict before it is entered on the journal, and when she does, a new trial must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 174} Proposition of Law No. 2: Where the attorney client relationship has been irreparably harmed, the trial court must appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">{\u00b6 175} Proposition of Law No. 3: Where a defendant is summoned off the street, taken back to the police station, questioned in a small room by two officer [sic] sporting their sidearms [sic], [and], the interrogation is custodial in nature, the fact that the defendant was not arrested at that time does not change the nature of the interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">{\u00b6 176} Proposition of Law No. 4: Jurors who do not unequivocally state that they could not impose the death penalty and can follow the court\u2019s instructions may not [be] dismissed for cause juror [sic] under R.C. 2945.25(C) and <em>Witherspoon v.
