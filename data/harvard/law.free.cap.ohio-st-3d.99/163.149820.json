State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 411, 2002-Ohio-6662, 780 N.E.2d 262, is not controlling here. <em>Hillyer </em>addressed what constituted a motor vehicle policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>under a former version of the statute because the statute lacked a definition of the term, which has since been provided by the legislature. Significantly, the policy at issue here is subject to a later 1997 amended version of R.C. 3937.18, which defined \u201cautomobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance\u201d for purposes of the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage statute. Former R.C. 3937.18(L), 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2377.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 3} Pursuant to <em>Ross v. Farmers Ins. Group of Cos. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 281, 695 N.E.2d 732, the statutory law in effect on the date of issue of each new policy is the law to be applied. Thus, analysis of this policy turns on the question of whether the residence-employee exception in this particular policy comports with the legislature\u2019s definition of an automobile liability policy, rather than a judicial interpretation of an undefined statutory phrase. Accordingly, this case should be resolved by applying the 1997 amended version of R.C. 3937.18 rather than the analysis in <em>Hillyer. </em>Albeit by a different analysis, I would reach the same conclusion as the majority, that the residence-employee exception in this policy is insufficient to transform it into a motor vehicle insurance policy. Specifically, the policy in this case does not constitute proof of financial responsibility as required by R.C. 4509.01.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 4} The 1997 version of R.C. 3937.18(L) defined \u201cautomobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance\u201d as \u201c[a]ny policy of insurance that serves as proof of financial responsibility, as proof of financial responsibility is defined by division (K) of section 4509.01 of the Revised Code, for owners or operators of the motor vehicles specifically identified in the policy of insurance.\u201d R.C. 4509.01(E) defines \u201c[pjroof of financial responsibility\u201d as \u201cproof of ability to respond in damages for liability, on account of accidents occurring subsequent to the effective date of such proof, arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle in the amount of twelve thousand five hundred dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident, in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and in the amount of seven thousand five hundred dollars because of injury to property of others in any one accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 5} These are the statutory benchmarks by which it must be determined whether the instant policy must provide UM/UIM coverage. I conclude that it need not. I am persuaded by the rationale of the Tenth District Court of Appeals in <em>Gibbons-Barry v. Cincinnati Ins. Cos., </em>10th Dist. No. 01AP-1437, 2002-Ohio-4898, 2002 WL 31087264. In that case, the appellant argued that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>homeowner\u2019s policy can serve as \u201cproof of financial responsibility\u201d when the residence-employee exception provides certain limited liability coverage. The appellant also argued in <em>Gibbons-Barry </em>that the policy \u201cspecifically identified\u201d the affected motor vehicles as those \u201cowned or operated by or rented or loaned to an insured.\u201d Accordingly, the appellant concluded that the homeowner\u2019s policy was an \u201cautomobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance\u201d as defined in R.C. 3937.18(L)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 6} The Tenth District rejected that argument, concluding that the policy in that case could not serve as proof of financial responsibility, reasoning:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cHere, the minimal coverage offered under the homeowner\u2019s policy does not rise to the level of \u2018proof of financial responsibility\u2019 because it is extended to only one person \u2014 appellant\u2019s \u2018residence employee.\u2019 Thus, the policy fails to provide any liability coverage if \u2018two or more' persons\u2019 are injured or die in an accident, much less coverage for the two or more persons in the amount of $25,000. Further, the policy fails to provide any liability coverage for property damage from any motor vehicle accident, whether or not a \u2018residence employee\u2019 is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMoreover, the homeowner\u2019s policy fails to fulfill the purpose for which \u2018proof of financial responsibility\u2019 is required in the first place. Instead of \u2018minimizing] those situations in which persons are not compensated for injuries and damages sustained in motor vehicle accidents,\u2019 reliance on a homeowner\u2019s policy with a \u2018residence employee\u2019 exception as \u2018proof of financial responsibility\u2019 would only provide coverage to a select group of persons and little or no coverage for damages resulting from vehicular accidents. R.C. 4509.101(J). Therefore, the homeowner\u2019s policy cannot serve as \u2018proof of financial responsibility.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cSecond, the homeowner\u2019s policy is not an \u2018automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance\u2019 because neither the declarations page nor the policy itself \u2018specifically identifies\u2019 any motor vehicles. In order to be \u2018specifically identified,\u2019 the motor vehicles referred to in the policy \u2018must be precisely, particularly and individually identified.\u2019 <em>Burkholder [v. German Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Mar. 15, 2002), Lucas App. No. L-01-1413], supra [2002 WL 398223], at \u00b6 21. However, the policy at issue here identifies the [a]ffected motor vehicles only as those \u2018owned or operated by or rented or loaned to an insured.\u2019 As we recently held in our decision in <em>Dixon, </em>such a general description does not satisfy the requirement of R.C. 3937.18(L)(1) that the motor vehicles be \u2018specifically identified.\u2019 <em>Dixon [v. Professional Staff Mgt., </em>10th Dist. No. 01AP-1332, 2002-Ohio-4493], supra [2002 WL 2005689], at \u00b6 33.\u201d <em>Gibbons-Barry </em>at \u00b6 42-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 10} In the present case, appellants try to create a motor vehicle policy out of the residence-employee section of a farm owner\u2019s policy. For the very same reasons expounded upon by the Tenth District, appellants in this case are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>entitled to underinsured/uninsured motorist coverage by operation of law. Appellants\u2019 policy likewise limits coverage to liability for bodily injury to the residence employee and not to any other person who may be injured in an accident. Thus, the policy could not serve as proof of financial responsibility pursuant to R.C. 4509.01(K) and would not constitute a motor vehicle policy for the purposes of R.C. 3937.18(L).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ama\">Connelly, Jackson &amp; Collier, L.L.P., Steven P. Collier and Anthony E. Turley, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqv\">Bahret &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., Robert J. Bahret and Kevin A. Pituch, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A8P\">Boyk &amp; Crossmock, L.L.C., and Steven L. Crossmock, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 11} Although appellants in this case and in <em>Gibbons-Barry </em>argued at great length whether the vehicles involved were \u201cspecifically identified,\u201d that issue need not be reached, as the policy could not serve as proof of financial responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 12} Because the homeowner\u2019s policy is not an \u201cautomobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance\u201d as defined in R.C. 3937.18(L), I would find that appellee was not required to offer uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage as part of the policy and that such coverage does not arise by operation of law. Therefore, appellant is not entitled to recover for damages due to her son\u2019s death under her farmowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n<judges id=\"b294-7\">Carr, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">. This conclusion was foreshadowed by the majority in <em>Hillyer </em>at \u00b6 25. However, this was not central to the analysis. Rather, it appears to be an acknowledgement that the legislature had defined the term after the issuance of the policy in <em>Hillyer </em>but before the case had been resolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
