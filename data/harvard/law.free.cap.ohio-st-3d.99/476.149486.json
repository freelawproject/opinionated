The union seeks to end the city of Cleveland\u2019s practice of temporarily rescheduling fire fighters\u2019 work shifts, a practice that has become known as \u201carrowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Under the collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between the union and the city, the union fire fighters annually select one of three 24-hour shifts, designated as A, B, and C, followed by 48 hours off work. The fire fighters also have an additional 24-hour shift off every third week, and an extra 24-hour shift off every ninth week. The result of the additional days off makes their average time worked 45.33 hours per week over a nine-week period.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">{\u00b6 3} Arrowing began in the 1960s, before the city and the fire fighters had a collective bargaining agreement. Arrowing was purportedly introduced to balance manpower across various shifts. The term derived from drawing an arrow on the company\u2019s schedule from one shift to a different shift to show the shift change for a given day. Arrowing a shift changes the usual 48 hours off before and after a fire fighter\u2019s shift. Instead, the fire fighter receives only 24 hours off before the arrowed shift and 72 hours off after the arrowed shift, or, vice versa, 72 hours off before and only 24 hours off after. The fire fighters receive regular pay for arrowed shifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">{\u00b6 4} The first CBA between the parties was executed in 1977 and was silent as to arrowing. The CBA has been renegotiated every three years. Although arrowing has never explicitly been addressed in a CBA between the parties, in response to language added to the CBA by the city in 1989 that may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>construed to permit arrowing, the union attempted to negotiate the prohibition of arrowing in the 1992,1995, and 1998 agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">{\u00b6 5} The dispute culminated with the union filing a grievance in 1999, protesting the city\u2019s practice of arrowing. The arbitrator determined that the CBA permitted arrowing and that arrowing was a binding past practice of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">{\u00b6 6} The Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas vacated the arbitrator\u2019s decision in a judgment entry without opinion, ordering that arrowing was to immediately cease. The court also scheduled a hearing regarding the union\u2019s request for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 7} The Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court upheld the common pleas court\u2019s vacation of the arbitrator\u2019s decision, but also reversed that part of the decision ordering the city to cease arrowing and scheduling a hearing regarding compensation for the affected fire fighters. The court reasoned that the common pleas court erred because it was limited to vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award and restoring the parties to their positions prior to the vacated order. The court held that the terms of the CBA did not authorize arrowing, but significantly, the court did not hold that the CBA actually prohibits arrowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 8} Determining that the appellate court\u2019s opinion still left open the possibility of future arbitration and litigation of the issue and that an arbitrator could later find that the CBA did not prohibit arrowing, the union brought this appeal. The city cross-appealed, asking that the arbitrator\u2019s decision be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 9} The union argues that arrowing violates the express terms of the CBA. We agree. Given the confused procedural posture of this case, we conclude that the proper disposition is a vacation of the arbitrator\u2019s award, which in effect affirms in part and reverses in part the appellate court\u2019s decision. We examine parts of both the arbitrator\u2019s and appellate court\u2019s decisions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">{\u00b6 10} The arbitrator focused primarily on two sections of the CBA in deciding that the CBA permitted arrowing. The arbitrator determined that Article VIII, entitled \u201cHours of Duty,\u201d standing alone would prohibit arrowing. That section of the CBA states that \u201cthe normal work week shall consist of one (1) twenty-four (24) consecutive hour shift, followed by forty-eight (48) consecutive hours off work with an additional twenty-four (24) consecutive hours off work once every three (3) weeks so that no person shall average more than forty-eight (48) hours per week within said three (3) week period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">{\u00b6 11} However, the arbitrator went on to find that when Article VIII is read in conjunction with Article V, \u201cSeniority,\u201d arrowing is actually authorized by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>CBA. Article V reads in part, \u201cA shift selection within the Union [sic, \u2018Unit\u2019?] or Battalion may be changed by a Company, Unit Commander or Battalion Commander where a discipline or morale problem must be solved, or for efficient operation of the Unit or Battalion.\u201d The arbitrator interpreted Article V to allow the changing of a single day\u2019s shift, rather than simply allowing management to permanently change a fire fighter\u2019s annual shift selection. The arbitrator concluded that the two articles read in conjunction allowed arrowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2711.10 provides, \u201cIn any of the following cases, the court of common pleas shall make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration if * * * (D) [t]he arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 13} The public policy favoring arbitration requires that courts have only limited authority to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities v. Mahoning Cty. TMR Edn. Assn. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 80, 84, 22 OBR 95, 488 N.E.2d 872. Accordingly, we have held that a reviewing court is limited to determining whether the award draws its essence from the CBA and whether the award is unlawful, arbitrary, or capricious. <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Findlay Edn. Assn. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 129, 551 N.E.2d 186, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cAn arbitrator\u2019s award draws its essence from a collective bargaining agreement when there is a rational nexus between the agreement and the award, and where the award is not arbitrary, capricious or unlawful.\u201d <em>Mahoning, </em>supra, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">{\u00b6 14} The union argues that the arbitrator\u2019s decision does not draw its essence from the CBA. The city points to the phrase \u201cfor efficient operation of the Unit or Battalion\u201d in Article V to argue that the CBA permits arrowing. However, we are persuaded by the appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the language in Article V refers to changes in the overall shift selection for the year, imposed after employees have selected one of the A, B, or C shifts on a seniority basis. The article is entitled \u201cSeniority\u201d and obviously does not refer to the temporary day-by-day changing of shifts to balance manpower levels. The plain language of the CBA clearly does not allow arrowing. Accordingly, the common pleas court and appellate court did not err in finding that the arbitrator exceeded his powers, because his award did not draw its essence from the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">{\u00b6 15} The arbitrator also concluded that arrowing is a binding past practice, \u201cestablished and recognized by both parties * * * practiced openly and notoriously for more than 30 years.\u201d However, arrowing cannot be interpreted as a binding past practice because of the union\u2019s continuing vehement fight against its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Other states have contemplated the factors required for a past practice to be binding. The predominant definition, and the one used by both the arbitrator and the union, requires that to be binding on parties to a collective bargaining agreement, a past practice must be (1) unequivocal, (2) clearly enunciated, and (3) followed for a reasonable period of time as a fixed and established practice accepted by both parties. <em>Celanese Corp. of Am. </em>(1954), 24 Labor Arb. Reports 168,172.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We think this a sound and logical test, and hereby adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 17} Under this newly adopted test, it is clear that arrowing cannot be considered a binding past practice, because the union did not accept the practice. The facts in the record are inadequate to properly examine the first two prongs of the test. The arbitrator merely summarily stated that the practice was \u201cunequivocal and clearly enunciated and acted upon.\u201d The arbitrator\u2019s opinion provides no further assessment of those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">{\u00b6 18} An examination of the first two prongs of the test is unnecessary, however, because there is ample evidence to adequately address the third prong. The third prong of the test requires that the practice be followed for a reasonable period of time as a fixed and established practice <em>accepted by both parties. </em>The city argues that the union in effect agreed to the practice because it failed to file a grievance for over 20 years. Nevertheless, filing a grievance is not the only vehicle for disagreement for the union. The union repeatedly attempted to negotiate language into CBAs to prohibit the practice or remove language that may have been construed to support the practice, so that the CBA would clearly and indisputably prohibit the further use of arrowing by the city. The history of the negotiations on this issue sufficiently demonstrates the union\u2019s complete lack of acceptance of arrowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">{\u00b6 19} The union also asks us to close the loophole created by the appellate court\u2019s caveat that \u201c[t]his is not, however, a determination that the CBA prohibits arrowing\u201d and to hold that the CBA expressly prohibits arrowing. Given our discussion above, we conclude that arrowing expressly violates the CBA. There is no question that arrowing violates the Article VIII requirement that fire fighters\u2019 hours of duty follow a 24-hour-on and 48-hour-off schedule because it results in fire fighters having only 24 hours off between work days. Because we have also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>examined and rejected the theory that arrowing is a binding past practice, we see no other avenue by which an argument may be made that arrowing is permissible. Therefore, we hold that arrowing violates the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b6 20} Finally, the union asserts that the appellate court erred in determining that the trial court exceeded its authority in granting a cease-and-desist order and scheduling a hearing for determination of compensation for affected fire fighters. The appellate court correctly examined the judge\u2019s statutory authority to vacate and modify an arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant to R.C. 2711.10 and 2711.11. R.C. 2711.10 limits a common pleas judge\u2019s authority to vacate an arbitrator\u2019s award to certain specified circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R.C. 2711.11 allows for modification or correction of an award under different circumstances that do not apply to this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the appellate court\u2019s decision on this issue. The parties may continue arbitration on the issue of compensation for affected fire fighters.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b609-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

However, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s erroneous rulings that (1) arrowing is not an established past practice and (2) arrowing violates the CBA. The record unequivocally demonstrates that arrowing has been a long-established past practice that predated the CBA and continued for 15 years thereafter without objection by the union and for 22 years without a grievance being filed \u2014 despite the numerous renegotiations of the CBA prior to 1992. Moreover, even if arrowing was not an established past practice, I agree with the appellate court below that arrowing is permitted pursuant to the city\u2019s reservation of rights under Article II of the CBA and pursuant to R.C. 4117.08 and 4117.10(A). In either event, the portions of the arbitrator\u2019s award denying the grievance concerning that practice and determining that arrowing does not violate the CBA draw their essence from the CBA and are not unlawful, arbitrary, or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">{\u00b6 22} The majority correctly notes that arrowing began in the 1960s, that the parties entered into collective bargaining agreements every three years from 1977 to 1992, and that the union did not attempt to prohibit or limit the practice of arrowing in the CBA until 1992. The union did not file a grievance protesting the city\u2019s practice of arrowing until 1999 \u2014 more than 30 years after the practice began and 22 years after the parties executed the first CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 23} I agree with the majority that the express language in the CBA does not specifically allow arrowing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, I agree with the majority and the appellate court that Article V of the CBA is limited to the issue of seniority and does not expressly permit arrowing, as argued by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 24} Resolution of this case, however, hinges on the issue of past practices. The city argues that the union in effect agreed to the practice of arrowing by its inaction for a substantial period of time. The history of the parties\u2019 practices supports this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 25} When a collective bargaining agreement is silent as to a work-scheduling practice, management\u2019s past practice is an acceptable way of addressing the issue. <em>Ingersoll-Rand </em>(2003), 118 Labor Arb. Reports 275 (Goldstein, Arb.); <em>Bonnell/Tredegar Industries, Inc. v. Natl.

Coop. Assn. v. Local Union 816, Internatl. Bhd. of Elec. Workers </em>(C.A.6, 1981), 646 F.2d 264, 268, citing <em>Detroit Coil Co. v. Internatl. Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, Lodge 82 </em>(C.A.6, 1979), 594 F.2d 575, 579 (\u201cAn arbitrator may properly incorporate the past practices of the parties or the \u2018common law of the shop\u2019 into the written collective bargaining agreement where that document is silent or ambiguous on a matter\u201d). This case must be analyzed in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">{\u00b6 27} I agree with the majority that Ohio should adopt the three-prong test for determining the existence of a past practice in labor cases promulgated in <em>Celanese, </em>supra, 24 Labor Arb. Reports at 172.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under <em>Celanese, </em>a past practice must be (1) unequivocal, (2) clearly enunciated, and (3) followed for a reasonable period of time as a fixed and established practice accepted by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 28} It is the application of the <em>Celanese </em>past-practice test to the facts in this case that causes me to part company with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 29} The majority finds the arbitrator\u2019s opinion that the practice of arrowing was \u201cunequivocal and clearly enunciated and acted upon\u201d deficient because that opinion \u201cprovides no further assessment of those issues.\u201d But no further assessment of those issues is necessary. Arbitrator O\u2019Connell correctly noted: \u201cThe Association\u2019s contention that there is no set standard policy overlooks the point that the practice is simple and easily recognized on its face. Moreover, arrowing is established and recognized by both parties. It has been practiced openly and notoriously for more than 30 years.\u201d The practice of arrowing between the city and fire fighters began in the 1960s and has been consistently and repetitively<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> applied without challenge at least until 1992 and without the filing of a grievance until 1999. The nature of that practice is not genuinely in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>dispute, and there is no credible evidence in the record that the parties had any real uncertainty as to what constituted arrowing. Likewise, the city\u2019s practice of arrowing had been openly enunciated and followed for over 30 years. Therefore, the first two prongs of the <em>Celanese </em>past-practice test have been satisfied in this case and are established by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 30} Under the third prong of the <em>Celanese </em>past-practice test, the practice must be (i) followed for a reasonable period of time (ii) as a fixed and established practice (iii) accepted by both parties. <em>Celanese, </em>supra, 24 Labor Arb. Reports at 172. In this case, arrowing has remained a fixed and established practice, unchallenged for 15 years after the first CBA. Arrowing existed for 30 years before the union filed its grievance. Such an extended period is more than a reasonable period of time. See, e.g., <em>Detroit </em>(1992), 99 Labor Arb. Reports 326, 328 (Kanner, Arb.) (four-year-old past practice recognized).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 31} Only the question of acceptance remains for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">{\u00b6 32} An express agreement between the parties is <em>not </em>necessary to prove acceptance of a past practice. <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. </em>(1959), 33 Labor Arb. Reports 374 (Valtin, Arb.).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">{\u00b6 33} When evidence demonstrates that the parties had knowledge of a particular course of conduct, agreement may be <em>implied </em>when there is a continued failure on the part of one party to object to the other\u2019s activity. <em>Willys Motors, Inc. </em>(1954), 22 Labor Arb. Reports 289 (Allen, Arb.).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">{\u00b6 34} The majority concludes that \u201c[t]he history of the negotiations on this issue sufficiently demonstrates the union\u2019s complete lack of acceptance of arrowing.\u201d I disagree with this erroneous conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">{\u00b6 35} The history of this issue unequivocally demonstrates the fire fighters\u2019 and their union\u2019s acceptance of arrowing as a practice for at least 15 years. From the 1960s to 1977, Cleveland\u2019s fire fighters lived with arrowing as part of the work-scheduling process. There is no evidence that the union objected to the then-established practice of arrowing when the union negotiated the first CBA in 1977. There is no evidence that the union objected to the practice of arrowing or sought to prohibit or limit that practice from 1977 to 1992, even though the CBA was renegotiated every three years during that period. In fact, the union did not attempt to negotiate a prohibition or limitation of the practice of arrowing until 1992 \u2014 decades after the practice began and 15 years after the first CBA with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">{\u00b6 36} Silence as to a past practice during subsequent collective bargaining, absent the clear manifestation of a contrary intention, evidences acceptance of that practice. See Cox <em>&amp; </em>Dunlop, The Duty to Bargain Collectively During the Term of an Existing Agreement (1950), 63 Harv.L.Rev. 1097, 1116-1117. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>best summary of this principle is provided by arbitrator Samuel Chalfie: \u201cA collective bargaining agreement is not negotiated in a vacuum. Rather it is negotiated in a setting of past practices and prior agreements. It may be reasonably assumed that the parties, in shaping bargaining demands as to wages and employee benefits, do so with silent recognition of existing unwritten benefits and working conditions.\u201d <em>Diamond Natl. Corp. </em>(1969), 52 Labor Arb. Reports 33, 35 (Chalfie, Arb.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These past practices essentially constitute the \u201cindustrial common law.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers, </em>supra, 363 U.S. at 581-582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 37} Additionally, a union\u2019s failure to file a grievance may be construed as acceptance of a past practice.

Reports 942, 944-945 (Holman, Arb.).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 38} In addition to waiting 15 years to attempt to negotiate a prohibition of or limitation on arrowing, the union waited yet another seven years before it filed its grievance challenging arrowing in this case. The union\u2019s inaction during those extended periods evidences acceptance of the practice of arrowing long <em>before </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>union belatedly attempted to challenge arrowing. Indeed, if the union had demonstrated a \u201ccomplete lack of acceptance of arrowing,\u201d as found by the majority, and if the CBA prohibits arrowing, as the majority holds, there would have been no need for the union to seek to negotiate a prohibition against arrowing during the CBA negotiations in 1992, 1995, and 1998. If the union really believed that arrowing was not an accepted past practice or was a prohibited practice in 1992 (or before that date), all the union had to do was file a grievance. The union\u2019s decision to pursue this issue by negotiations, not grievance, at that time, speaks volumes, especially given the obvious sophistication of the union and its experienced legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 39} The union\u2019s failure to object to the practice of arrowing for 15 years and its failure to file a grievance for 22 years are more than ample evidence of the union\u2019s acceptance of arrowing as a past practice for purposes of the third prong of the <em>Celanese </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 40} Since arrowing satisfies all of the requirements for a past practice under the <em>Celanese </em>test adopted by the majority, the city\u2019s practice of arrowing constitutes an accepted past practice in this case. Under Article II of the CBA and pursuant to R.C. 4117.08 and R.C. 4117.10(A), arrowing, as an established past practice, does not violate the CBA. The arbitrator\u2019s award to that effect draws its essence from the CBA and is not unlawful, arbitrary, or capricious. <em>Findlay City School Dist. Bd. of Bdn. v. Findlay Edn. Assn. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 129, 551 N.E.2d 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 41} However, as correctly determined by the majority and the appellate court, the CBA does not specifically authorize arrowing. The arbitrator\u2019s decision that it does authorize arrowing exceeded his authority. The trial court could properly vacate the arbitrator\u2019s ruling for correction of that specific error.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 42} Because arrowing is an accepted and permitted past practice, there is no loophole to close by holding, as the majority does, that the CBA expressly prohibits arrowing. Arrowing is neither authorized nor prohibited by the CBA. Arrowing is permitted as a recognized long-standing past practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">{\u00b6 43} Any change or limitation to the past practice of arrowing should come through collective bargaining, not judicial fiat. Indeed, the judicial activism of the majority threatens the United States Supreme Court\u2019s long-recognized \u201cindustrial common law\u201d in Ohio and ultimately may be detrimental to the protection of Ohio\u2019s union workers in the future. The majority\u2019s approach \u2014 that a long-standing past practice may be unilaterally nullified merely by one party\u2019s belated attempt to prohibit or limit that practice during later collective bargaining \u2014 establishes a dangerous precedent that could haunt Ohio\u2019s union workers by leading to the nullification of past practices that protect union workers. The past-practice doctrine has been successfully employed by union workers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>protect their rights. See, e.g., <em>Weston Paper &amp; Mfg. Co. </em>(1981), 76 Labor Arb. Reports 1273 (Bowles, Arb.) (union established a consistent past practice entitled to protection); <em>Printing Industry of Metro. Washington, D.C. </em>(1981), 77 Labor Arb. Reports 911 (Epstein, Arb.).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">{\u00b6 44} Some of the matters which arbitrators have held to be the subject of a binding past practice include attending to personal matters during shift,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> funeral leave,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> severance pay,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> maternity leave,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> wash-up time,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> crew sizes,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> coffee breaks,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> lunch periods,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> shift preferences,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> seniority of foremen,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> jury duty pay,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> payment of union officials for time spent at arbitration hearings,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and holiday pay for Saturdays.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 45} Long-established past-practice rights of Ohio\u2019s union workers will now be exposed to the dangers of future judicial nullification, instead of collective bargaining. Such judicial intervention unilaterally changes the parties\u2019 bargaining position, which can work to the detriment of union workers in future past-practice cases. All management will have to do now to satisfy the majority\u2019s lack-of-acceptance test is seek to negotiate a prohibition or limitation of an established past practice beneficial to workers during the next collective bargaining process. Simply put, if an established past practice that continued for 15 years without objection and 22 years without grievance can be judicially eviscer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ated in this case, how can any other established past practice expect to survive judicial extermination? That is why modification or termination of accepted and long-established past practices is best left to the collective bargaining process, as correctly noted by the appellate court below in this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ApKg\">Joseph W. Diemert Jr. &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., Joseph W. Diemert Jr., Thomas M. Hanculak and Jeffrey J. Sokolowski, for appellant and cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A1m\">Duvin, Cahn &amp; Hutton and Jon M. Dileno, for appellee and cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 46} Even assuming arguendo that arrowing is not an established past practice in this case (which it is), the appellate court below was correct in ruling that the practice (1) is not expressly prohibited or limited by the CBA, (2) does not violate any state or local laws, and (3) is consistent with the city\u2019s reservation of rights under Article II of the CBA. Therefore, the city has the right to engage in arrowing under the facts before this court. R.C. 4117.08 and 4117.10(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 47} For the reasons stated above, I would (1) affirm the arbitrator\u2019s decision denying the grievance and the portion of the appellate court\u2019s ruling consistent therewith, (2) affirm the appellate court\u2019s ruling that the CBA does not expressly permit arrowing and vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award as to that specific issue, (3) affirm the appellate court\u2019s ruling that the trial court did not have legal authority to issue a cease-and-desist order, and (4) reverse the remaining lower court\u2019s rulings to the extent inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b616-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">. The city argues that the practice of arrowing was a practice affecting \u201chours of work\u201d at the time Section (B)(7), Article IX of the CBA was negotiated. However, Article IX deals with vacations, not overtime or shift changes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b611-8\">.

The standards for determining the existence of a past practice have also been stated as including consistency (an ongoing application without numerous exceptions or contradictions) and repetition (application over a period of time from which a consistent pattern of behavior emerges).

See, also, <em>Eau Claire Cty. </em>(1981), 76 Labor Arb. Reports 333, 335 (McCrary, Arb.) (\u201cthe parties will be presumed to have been aware of the instant practice as bargaining for the current agreement took place in the context of the practice. In addition, due to the parties\u2019 awareness of the instant practice and the County\u2019s failure to repudiate the practice during the negotiations, it is reasonable to conclude that the parties intended for the practice to continue in force\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\">. Likewise, arbitrator Marvin Feldman, in <em>Teledyne Monarch Rubber </em>(1980), 75 Labor Arb. Reports 963, ruled that management had the right to assign management personnel to reset microprocessor equipment where in the past the union failed to challenge that practice by grievance. His reasoning is particularly instructive: \u201cIt might be further noted that the bargaining unit had never grieved for such work during their entire course of bargaining history at the facility, which dates back some eight years at the time of hearing and which had been accomplished, according to Company testimony, over a thousand times by management personnel. Thus it appears that the bargaining unit, while it may choose to police the contract of collective bargaining as it sees fit from time to time, cannot waive a right forever and then attempt to grieve one workload when the workload has been accomplished a thousand times at least prior without protest. * * * [F]ailure of the bargaining unit to protest such activity as it was occasioned throughout the course of years at the facility leads this arbitrator to believe that as a matter of fact the bargaining unit realized over that period of years that they as a matter of fact had no right to the workload which is grieved in this particular matter at this particular time.\u201d Id. at 965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">. <em>Reno v.
