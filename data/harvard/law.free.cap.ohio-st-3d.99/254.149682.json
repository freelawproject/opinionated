On February 6, 2002, we accepted jurisdiction in case No. 2001-1165, the underlying case, solely to determine whether a landlord has a duty to mitigate damages caused by a tenant who breaches a commercial lease and abandons the leasehold. Subsequently, in case No. 2001-2259, Frenchtown petitioned us to accept jurisdiction over two procedural issues involving the same parties and transaction as in the underlying case. We consolidated Frenchtown\u2019s appeals; however, at no point did we accept jurisdiction over the issues raised in case No! 2001-2259, nor did we order the parties to brief those issues pursuant to the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, the only issue before us is whether a landlord has a duty to mitigate damages caused by a tenant who breaches a commercial lease and abandons the leasehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">{\u00b6 3} This case is before us from the Seventh District Court of Appeals, which affirmed in part and reversed in part summary judgment in Frenchtown\u2019s favor and held that Frenchtown bore a duty to mitigate its damages after Lemstone, Inc. (\u201cLemstone\u201d) breached its lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-18\">{\u00b6 4} Frenchtown owns Frenchtown Square Shopping Center, a mall located in Monroe, Michigan. Lemstone is an Illinois corporation doing business as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Christian bookstore.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 3,1989, Frenchtown leased store space in its mall to Lemstone for a period of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 5} Frenchtown leased other mall space to Alpha Gifts, a business that, in 1998, began to sell items similar or identical to products sold by Lemstone. Lemstone argues that competition from Alpha Gifts reduced its profitability to the point where it could no longer meet its rent obligations under the lease. Approximately six months prior to lease expiration, Lemstone ceased conducting business at Frenchtown Square and abandoned its store space. For the balance of the lease\u2019s term, Lemstone did not pay rent to Frenchtown, and Frenchtown did not relet the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 6} Frenchtown sued Lemstone for rent due, incidental fees, and taxes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lemstone answered that Frenchtown failed to mitigate its damages, and it filed multiple counterclaims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ultimately, the trial court granted summary judgment in Frenchtown\u2019s favor on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">{\u00b6 7} On appeal, Lemstone maintained ten assigned errors. The appeals court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment in part but held that Frenchtown, as a commercial lessor, had a duty to mitigate damages when Lemstone abandoned the leasehold. Accordingly, the appeals court remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether Frenchtown had properly mitigated its damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 8} From the Seventh District\u2019s judgment, Frenchtown filed the instant appeal. This case is now before us as a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">{\u00b6 9} A certain duality inheres to leases. Specifically, because they are contractual instruments by which parties convey interests in real property, they are arguably susceptible of both contract law and property law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">{\u00b6 10} Under common law, a lessor bore no obligation to mitigate damages when a lessee abandoned the leasehold. The common law allowed a lessor to \u201cstand by and do nothing, arbitrarily refusing to accept any new tenant.\u201d Solomon, The Commercial Landlord\u2019s Duty to Mitigate Damages (Feb.1988), 122 N.J.Law. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Fundamentally, a duty to mitigate did not exist because leases were viewed as transfers of property interests. The lessor did not simply permit the lessee to occupy the lessor\u2019s property; rather, the lessee owned an abstract portion of the land, albeit for a limited duration, and rent was a fixed obligation. \u201cThus, when a tenant abandoned the leasehold, he was viewed as having vacated his estate,\u201d not that of the lessor. <em>Rubin v. Dondysh </em>(1989), 146 Misc.2d 37, 45, 549 N.Y.S.2d 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 12} Conversely, under the common law of contracts, mitigation is a fundamental tenet of a damage calculus. Contracts are the mutual exchange of promises, with each party holding an expectation of certain obligations and benefits. Thus, contract law acknowledges that mitigation, otherwise known as the doctrine of avoidable consequences, may justly place an injured party \u201cin as good a position had the contract not been breached at the least cost to the defaulting party.\u201d <em>F. Ent, Inc. v. Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 154, 159-160, 1 O.O.3d 90, 351 N.E.2d 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 13} As Frenchtown and Lemstone acknowledge, a \u201cmodern trend\u201d is eroding the common-law approach of treating leases strictly as conveyances of real property. Barker, Commercial Landlords\u2019 Duty upon Tenants\u2019 Abandonment \u2014 To Mitigate? (Summer 1995), 20 J.Corp.L. 627. Many states, via legislative or judicial mandate, have addressed a commercial or residential lessor\u2019s duty to mitigate. <em>Austin Hill Country Realty, Inc. v. Palisades Plaza, Inc. </em>(Tex. 1997), 948 S.W.2d 293, fn. 1. Although relatively few jurisdictions have expressly determined a commercial lessor\u2019s duty, the trend favors Lemstone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>{\u00b6 14} Previously, this court refrained from determining whether a commercial landlord has a duty to mitigate his damages. In <em>F. Ent., Inc., </em>we considered \u201cwhether the trial court applied the correct rule as to measure of damages for breach of the contract * * Id. at 156, 1 0.0.3d 90, 351 N.E.2d 121. Because the parties did no more than contract to enter into a commercial lease, <em>F. Ent., Inc. </em>did not implicate the transfer of a leasehold interest. Although we held that \u201crecovery of damages by the prospective lessor is limited to only those damages arising from the breach which could not, by reasonable effort on his part without undue risk or expense, have been averted or reduced,\u201d we did not specifically address the question raised herein. Id. at 160, 1 0.0.3d 90, 351 N.E.2d 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 15} Further, in <em>Dennis v. Morgan </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 417, 417, 732 N.E.2d 391, we addressed \u201cwhether, absent specific provisions in the lease, a landlord\u2019s election to terminate a lease agreement releases a tenant from liability for rent not yet due at the time of eviction.\u201d We stated, \u201cLessees are potentially liable for rents coming due under the agreement as long as the property remains unrented. The important corollary to that is that <em>landlords have a duty,' as all parties to contracts do, </em>to mitigate their damages caused by a breach. Landlords mitigate by attempting to rerent the property. Their efforts to do so must be reasonable, and the reasonableness should be determined at the trial level.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 419, 732 N.E.2d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Dennis, </em>we noted that certain real property leases are susceptible of contract-law principles, including mitigation. Because the duty to mitigate extends to lessors of real property, we need not explore the theoretical arguments that attempt to classify leases as conveyances of real property, as contracts, or as a hybrid of these two concepts. Accordingly, the narrow issue before us is whether the duty to mitigate is applicable to commercial leases.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 17} Frenchtown argues that failing to exempt commercial leases would create an incentive for tenants to abandon property, thereby encouraging vandalism and punishing the injured party. These are long-standing arguments against treating leases as contracts but do nothing to distinguish commercial leases from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>other types of leases. Further, there is merit to Lemstone\u2019s argument that a rule that permits landlords to \u201cstand by and do nothing\u201d while still reaping the benefit of its lease agreement would encourage vacant properties at least as much as a rule disfavoring mitigation. In fact, if Frenchtown did not take reasonable steps to relet its Frenchtown Square property following Lemstone\u2019s abandonment, then it contributed to the problem it asks us to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 18} In an attempt to distinguish commercial leases from other types of leases, Frenchtown argues that the overall mix of shopping-center tenants is a material aspect of the bargained-for performance in a shopping-center lease. Essentially, by employing contract-law principles, Frenchtown argues that a proper mix of tenants creates a synergistic effect, and a rule that encourages abandonment will detrimentally affect not only the lessor, but also the other tenants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While we acknowledge that where two or more shops adjoin, a symbiotic relationship may exist, we decline to create a rule of law that distinguishes between single- and multishop commercial settings. The duty to mitigate arises in all commercial leases of real property, just as it exists in all other contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 19} We emphasize that our holding does not require a lessor to accept just any available lessee. The duty to mitigate requires only reasonable efforts. Thus, the tenant mix may reasonably factor into a lessor\u2019s decisions to relet. Finally, whether the breaching tenant caused damages beyond the failure to pay rent is a measure of damages. Our holding that contract principles apply to the calculation of damages extends to all damages provable by the lessor. If the breaching tenant caused harm such that the lessor\u2019s profitability is affected, then that harm is compensable to the extent it is proved. This, as well as the reasonableness of introducing a replacement lessee, is a question for the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 20} As we stated in <em>Dennis, </em>landlords owe a duty to mitigate their damages caused by a breaching tenant. That rule flows from the premise that modern leases are more than simply property-interest transfers; rather, leases possess contractual qualities that often include myriad covenants and duties and arise from a bargained-for relationship. In a practical sense, lessors and lessees contract for the use of property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, barring contrary contract provisions, a duty to mitigate damages applies to all leases.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AEf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>David A. Fantauzzi, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AA\">Nadler Nadler &amp; Burdman Co., L.P.A., Donn D. Rosenblum and Peter B. Grinstein, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A0rN\">Thompson Hi\u00f1e L.L.P., William C. Wilkinson, Dena M. Kobasic and Andrew H. Cox, urging reversal for amici curiae Simon Property Group, Inc., Glimcher Realty Trust, The Richard E. Jacobs Group, and Forest City Enterprises, Inc.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">{\u00b6 21} We see no valid reason to exempt commercial leases from the duty to mitigate. A lessor has a duty to mitigate damages caused by a lessee\u2019s breach of a commercial lease if the lessee abandons the leasehold. The lessor\u2019s efforts to mitigate must be reasonable, and the reasonableness should be determined by the trial court. Failure to mitigate damages caused by a breach of a commercial lease is an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 22} Accordingly, we affirm the appeals court\u2019s decision and remand this case to the trial court on the question of mitigation, and for a determination of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

Although the mall is located in Michigan and Lemstone is incorporated in Illinois, this action arose in Ohio because Frenchtown is an Ohio general partnership with offices in Youngstown, Ohio, and the lease is governed by Ohio law, pursuant to the lease\u2019s choice-of-laws provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-13\">.
