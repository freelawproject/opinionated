Boehler, has an allowed workers\u2019 compensation claim arising from a 1988 industrial injury sustained while employed by appellant, American Standard, Inc. In 1997, appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio reinstated temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d). Early the following year, American Standard moved the commission to terminate TTC, stating that claimant had achieved maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d) and was gainfully employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 2} As to the latter claim of gainful employment, American Standard filed surveillance reports, photographs, and videotapes that documented claimant\u2019s activities at various apartment rental units that he owned. Through these, American Standard hoped to show that claimant was receiving rental income from these properties and was performing work activities there, which American Standard equated with gainful employment. It also alleged that claimant was engaged in physical activities that conflicted with his assertion of an inability to return to his former position of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 3} American Standard\u2019s second claim was dealt a severe blow when its own examining physician, Dr. S.S. Purewal, examined the tapes and other evidence and concluded that the captured activities were <em>not </em>inconsistent with claimant\u2019s assertion that he could not return to his job as a tank loader/inspector. Dr. Purewal did, however, opine that the claimant had reached MMI \u2014 an opinion shared by Dr. Richard N. Kepple.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">{\u00b6 4} The claimant rested on a series of C-84 physician reports supplemental prepared by attending physician Dr. Andrew J. Gase between November 13, 1997, and August 13, 1998. Collectively, these reports certified the claimant as unable to return to his former position from November 6, 1997, through December 13, 1998, due to his allowed back condition. When asked on these C-84s whether the condition had \u201creached a treatment plateau at which no fundamental functional or physiological change can be expected despite continuing medical or rehabilitative intervention,\u201d Dr. Gase checked the box for \u201cno.\u201d When questioned on the same form as to whether claimant was \u201ca candidate for vocational rehabilitation services focusing on return to work,\u201d he responded, \u201cyes, if he [claimant] gets treatment for his severe neurogenic pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">{\u00b6 5} At the commission hearing, surveillance evidence revealed claimant\u2019s presence at his rental units over a five-day period when other workers were clearly engaged in some sort of interior renovation. Claimant was occasionally seen instructing workers, \u201cassisting with picking up things, passing tools,\u201d \u201chelping to attach the paneling to the walls,\u201d and \u201cscraping the walls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">{\u00b6 6} Claimant denied physical participation in any of the rental renovations alleged. He did, however, admit to being on the premises on the observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>occasions. He also testified to receiving approximately $1,700 per month in rental income.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">{\u00b6 7} A commission staff hearing officer denied American Standard\u2019s motion, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cMr. Boehler is merely involved in a passive investment, as the owner of residential and commercial rental property * * *. Claimant owned some of these rental properties prior to the injury allowed in this claim. Prior to the injury, claimant was able to perform maintenance himself. Subsequent to the injury, claimant had to hire independent contractors to perform the work at his rental properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe surveillance video submitted by the employer, as well as the surveillance photos they submitted, does <em>not </em>indicate that claimant was personally performing any work on his rental properties. Instead, they corroborate claimant\u2019s testimony that he had hired outside contractors to perform the work and that he was sometimes on the job-site to observe the progress being made or to indicate what he wanted done.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThis Staff Hearing Officer hereby finds that the aforesaid activities by the claimant were reasonable actions by a person who has a substantial capital investment in the form of a passive investment in rental properties and, furthermore, that said activities do <em>not </em>rise to the level [of] self-employment as alleged by the employer. Therefore, it is the specific finding of this Staff Hearing Officer that claimant was NOT engaged in sustained remunerative employment from 5/16/96 through the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cFurthermore, in regard to the employer\u2019s Motion, filed 2/2/98, which requested termination of Temporary Total Disability Compensation on the basis of both claimant\u2019s \u2018self-employment\u2019 and on a medical basis, the following findings are made. * * * In regard to the medical evidence, the 7/9/98 report from an orthopedic specialist, S.S. Purewal, M.D., * * * specifically indicates that he had \u2018reviewed the video tapes that were made on 8/15/97, 2/13 \u2014 /S [sic] and 4/3/98. These tapes show Mr. Boehler moving about with some <em>limp on his right leg which he tends to drag.\u2019 </em>Dr. Purewal went on to state that \u2018After reviewing the additional material discussed above, it is my opinion that this patient is <em>not capable of returning to his former position of employment </em>* * *.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThis Staff Hearing Officer further makes note of the fact that claimant originally underwent a multiple level lumbar hemi-laminectomy on 4/7/89. Following this surgery, claimant had physical therapy, was rehabilitated and returned to work. Claimant experienced an exacerbation and underwent a fusion on 10/21/92. Again, claimant was rehabilitated and returned to work. He was able to work until March of 1993, when his condition again deteriorated to the point that he was unable to work. He participated in rehabilitation * * * and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Rehabilitation Consultant found the claimant to be \u2018very motivated to participate in this rehabilitation program so he can return to work.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTherefore, this Staff Hearing Officer finds claimant to be a highly motivated individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cClaimant\u2019s attending physician, Andrew J. Gase, M.D., indicates, on the C-84 Attending Physician\u2019s Report dated August 13, 1998, that claimant has a \u2018chronic radiculopathy with foot drop\u2019 and \u2018increased pain radiating down left leg and almost entire right leg with right foot drop, unable to sit in chair with legs bent, difficulty raising right knee\u2019. Dr. Gase then indicates that the claimant has <em>not </em>reached maximum medical improvement and that claimant is a candidate for vocational rehabilitation \u2018If he gets treatment for his severe neurogenic pain\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTherefore, it is the finding of this Staff Hearing Officer that the claimant has <em>not </em>yet reached maximum medical improvement.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">{\u00b6 16} Further consideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">{\u00b6 17} American Standard unsuccessfully petitioned the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for a writ of mandamus. Finding \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s decision, the court of appeals denied the writ, prompting American Standard\u2019s appeal here as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">{\u00b6 18} TTC is prohibited to one who (1) has reached MMI, (2) has actually returned to some form of remunerative employment, or (3) is medically capable of returning to the former position of employment. <em>State ex rel. Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 632, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586. American Standard\u2019s challenge has, at times, touched on all three, but has now narrowed to points (1) and (2). Ultimately, its position fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">\n<em>Work Activities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">{\u00b6 19} Again, <em>Ramirez </em>forbids TTC to those who are medically able to return to the former position of employment or who actually are \u201cworking\u201d \u2014 i.e., exchanging labor for pay \u2014 regardless of the nature or location of the work. <em>State ex rel. Parma Community Gen. Hosp. v. Jankowski, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 340, 2002-Ohio-2336, 767 N.E.2d 1143. Disqualifying activities, therefore, have a medical or remunerative component. If the activities are medically inconsistent with the alleged inability to return to the former job, it matters not whether the claimant is paid for them. TTC is barred. Id. at \u00b6 15. Paid activities bar TTC, regardless of the physical or medical nature of the work. Even sporadic activities of either type can foreclose TTC. <em>State ex rel. Blabac v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 113, 717 N.E.2d 336. Thus, claimant\u2019s actions mean nothing if American Standard cannot prove that they were either remunerative or medically inconsistent with the claim of inability to return to his former job. American Standard fails to do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>{\u00b6 20} American Standard repeatedly notes the physicality of claimant\u2019s purported actions but never overtly accuses claimant of engaging in activity irreconcilable with his claimed inability to return to his former position. Perhaps that is because American Standard knows that it cannot prevail, given the opinion of its own physician, Dr. Purewal, that claimant\u2019s observed actions do not contradict his assertion that he cannot return to his old job.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">{\u00b6 21} The remaining consideration \u2014 remuneration\u2014is barely discussed by the employer. American Standard says only that in addition to his TTC, claimant was getting $1,700 per month. That amount, however, represents rental income not wages \u2014 a critical distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">{\u00b6 22} TTC compensates for the loss of earnings a claimant sustains while his or her injury heals. <em>State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 42, 44, 517 N.E.2d 533. This means that TTC is precluded when the claimant begins to earn again, i.e., when he or she is paid money in direct exchange for labor. <em>State ex rel. Ford Motor Co. v. Indus. Comm., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 20, 2002-Ohio-7038, 780 N.E.2d 1016, supports this, by refusing to disqualify claimants whose activities \u201cproduced money only secondarily\u201d or were \u201conly indirectly related to generating income.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23 and 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">{\u00b623} The disputed amount in this case was not given in exchange for claimant\u2019s labor \u2014 it was paid pursuant to a contractual rental agreement. Certainly it can be argued that if claimant\u2019s apartments were not kept up, rental income could evaporate. There are, however, two key flaws in this logic. First, it runs counter to <em>Ford. </em>There, claimant\u2019s industrial injury not only removed him from his former job but also kept him from his side business of mowing lawns. Claimant was forced to hire others to do this work and paid them accordingly. Ford argued that claimant\u2019s act of signing payroll checks to these workers constituted \u201cwork\u201d so as to foreclose TTC. We disagreed, writing that \u201cthis claimant\u2019s activities did not, in and of themselves, generate income; claimant\u2019s activities produced money only secondarily, e.g., claimant signed the paychecks that kept <em>his employees </em>doing the tasks that generated income.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">{\u00b6 24} In the case before us, rental upkeep generated income secondarily. It was the contractual relationship between claimant and his tenants that directly compelled the payment of money. It was not directly generated by the claimant\u2019s labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">{\u00b6 25} Second, American Standard confuses the concept of remuneration with claimant\u2019s physical presence at the rental site. If claimant had never visited his properties and had never participated in their rental or upkeep, leaving those tasks to others, claimant would still have received his rental income. Few would argue that in such a case, TTC would be precluded. This indeed suggests that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the pivotal point of American Standard\u2019s position is claimant\u2019s physical presence at the rental units. Nothing, however, prevents claimant from going there. The only thing that <em>is </em>barred is claimant\u2019s participation in any activities that are medically inconsistent with his allegation of an inability to return to his former position of employment or that <em>directly </em>generate income, and there is evidence of neither here.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 26} <em>Ford, </em>acknowledged the perils of situations such as that at issue, cautioning that \u201cthis rationale must be applied on a case-by-case basis and only when a claimant\u2019s activities are minimal. A claimant should not be able to erect a facade of third-party labor to hide the fact that he or she is working.\u201d Id., 98 Ohio St.3d 20, 2002-0hio-7038, 780 N.E.2d 1016, at \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">{\u00b6 27} We conclude, therefore, that the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that claimant\u2019s actions did not constitute sustained remunerative employment that would bar TTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>MMI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Ramirez </em>held that TTC is payable only to those with temporary disabilities. Therefore, a claimant who has reached MMI forfeits TTC. MMI describes a condition that has become permanent, i.e., one that will, \u201c \u2018with reasonable probability, continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vulcan Materials Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 25 OBR 26, 494 N.E.2d 1125, quoting <em>Logsdon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 508, 28 O.O. 429, 57 N.E.2d 75, paragraph two of the syllabus. Dr. Gase specified that the claimant was not MMI, and the commission relied on his opinion in awarding TTC. American Standard criticizes that reliance, arguing that (1) other evidence indicates MMI and (2) Dr. Gase\u2019s report is flawed. Neither challenge has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">{\u00b6 29} The commission\u2019s decision need only be supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936, syllabus. Thus, the presence of contrary evidence is immaterial, so long as the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard has been met. And, in our case, Dr. Gase\u2019s reports certainly satisfy that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">{\u00b6 30} Contrary to American Standard\u2019s representation, Dr. Gase\u2019s C-84s are not fatally ambiguous or equivocal. American Standard argues that Dr. Gase\u2019s rejection of MMI is contradicted by his physical findings, which, American Standard contends, demonstrate MMI. This fails for two reasons. First, the commission is the exclusive interpreter of evidence presented. <em>State ex rel. Middlesworth v. Regal Ware, Inc. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 214, 216, 754 N.E.2d 774. Thus, the commission could freely interpret the evidence as it chose and was not required to adopt American Standard\u2019s reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Moreover, even if American Standard\u2019s reading was accepted, it must still be balanced against Dr. Gase\u2019s express certification that claimant has not reached MMI. As we have said, when evidence can be read in two different ways, the commission does not abuse its discretion in choosing one over the other. <em>State ex rel. Copeland v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 238, 559 N.E.2d 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, American Standard contends that it is inappropriate to allow Dr. Gase\u2019s recommendation for vocational rehabilitation to negate a finding of MMI. It relies on this quote from the court of appeals in <em>State ex rel. Matlock, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 648, 659, 598 N.E.2d 121:</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[TJhere is a distinction in the case law between physical rehabilitation and'occupational-type therapy related to the condition\u2019s improvement, and vocational rehabilitation or job training related to claimant\u2019s vocational improvement. The former type of rehabilitation can signify continuing possibility of medical improvement while the latter cannot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">{\u00b6 34} American Standard uses well-intentioned physician responses to bureau-designed questions as a trap for the unwary. The bureau\u2019s C-84 asks \u2014 without qualification of the word \u201crehabilitative\u201d \u2014 \u201cHas the work related injury(s) or disease reached a treatment plateau at which no fundamental functional or physiological change can be expected despite continuing medical or rehabilitative intervention?\u201d The physician is required to check \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d The form then asks, \u201cIs the injured worker a candidate for vocational rehabilitation services focusing on return to work?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">{\u00b6 35} Dr. Gase answered \u201cno\u201d to the former and \u201cyes\u201d to the latter. This is not inconsistent. The initial negative response indicates that claimant\u2019s condition can be improved by further medical or rehabilitative measures. Thus, a \u201cyes\u201d answer to the second question is completely consistent. American Standard, however, wishes to focus exclusively on one thing \u2014 the presence of a single word, \u201cvocational\u201d before the word \u201crehabilitation\u201d in Question 2. We are not persuaded that the first question dealing squarely with the issue of MMI has been made so ambiguous by a single word in the second question. In this case, Dr. Gase afSrmed that rehabilitation would facilitate the claimant\u2019s return to work. We find, therefore, that the commission did not abuse its discretion in determining that claimant had not reached MMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">{\u00b6 36} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-12\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
