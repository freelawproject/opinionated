Ackerman, engaged in \u2014 or was capable of engaging in \u2014 sustained remunerative employment while receiving permanent total disability compensation (\u201cPTD\u201d). Because the performance of \u2014 or ability to perform \u2014 sustained remunerative employment bars PTD, that finding triggered compensation termination and declarations of both overpayment and fraud. See <em>State ex rel. Schultz v. Indus. Comm., </em>96 Ohio St.3d 27, 2002-Ohio-3316, 770 N.E.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">{\u00b6 2} There are two strikingly different portraits of claimant contained in the record. There is no question that claimant received massive injuries in a 1969 auto accident that occurred in the course of and arising from his employment. Nor is there any question that claimant received considerable income in the years that followed due to his involvement in various business enterprises and investments. The character and extent of claimant\u2019s involvement are less clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">{\u00b6 3} The record, for example, contains three newspaper articles about claimant published in local Florida newspapers, two in 1975,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 1987 respectively. One 1975 article is entitled \u201cA Dynamo: Del Ackerman Causes Sparks to Fly.\u201d It reads in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>{\u00b6 4} \u201cIt is difficult \u2014 maybe impossible \u2014 to capture some personalities on paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThere is the indefinable word \u2018charisma,\u2019 much used and abused the last few years. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cSimply put, charisma means T don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got \u2014 but you\u2019ve got it.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is with Del Ackerman. When he talks, sparks fly. He sets off little vibrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c* * <em>* </em>Maybe it is because he would rather do business with the Florida Cracker than the blueblood. Maybe it is because he is a natural born huckster and promoter.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cDelbert H. Ackerman owns Del\u2019s Markets. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cHe also has full or part ownership of several other businesses but he prefers to remain in the background in those.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cAnd he has plans for expansion of his convenience store chain, and diversification into other merchandising fields.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-13\">{\u00b6 13} A second 1975 article stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe Ackermans moved to Naples in August, 1972 and now operate Del\u2019s 6-12 Grocery stores on Airport Road, Kelly Road and the Isles of Capri Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cDel\u2019s injuries have not prevented him from building up a business that has often required him to work up to 18 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c T figure I\u2019m lucky that I can still walk around\u2019 he said. \u2018If you want to get anything done you have to keep at it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">{\u00b6 17} Finally, there was a 1987 article entitled \u201cDel Ackerman on duty 24 hours a day.\u201d After describing his accident, the article states:</p>\n<p id=\"b155-18\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cToday, Del Ackerman, entrepreneur, showman, local personality, moves from one business venture to another with a briskness in his walk that makes a mockery of the doctors\u2019 statements that he would never get out of the wheelchair. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c* * * [Cjlearly some of the lingering pain is still there. It is now controlled, if not completely beaten, by Del\u2019s own strenuous fitness program which has helped to strengthen his body sufficiently to fight what he has come to accept as mere discomfort \u2018which isn\u2019t going to get in the way of me enjoying life.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Claimant, in his own words, was \u201cnot going to stay home and feel sorry for myself.\u201d This was a sharp contrast to the claimant\u2019s words in his 1992 PTD application, where he wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThis injury ruined my life. I was always the \u2018Number One\u2019 worker but because of this injury I was ruined for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">{\u00b6 22} And:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cI do no meal preparation, no home repairs, no laundry. I just stay around the house. * * * I only watch television. I used to be very active, but after the injury, I can do nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 24} The above clippings all precede his allegation of PTD \u2014 a point claimant understandably stresses. Claimant, however, provides no evidence that his medical conditions deteriorated so significantly in five years that the \u201c24-hour man\u201d of 1987 could claim in 1992 that he had been \u201cruined for life\u201d and was incapable of anything other than watching TV. It is within this context that the facts unfold below.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">{\u00b6 25} Claimant\u2019s 1992 PTD application was granted in 1994, and compensation was awarded retroactively to March 15, 1991. In 1999, his response to an annual Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation inquiry indicated that he had done some work during the previous year. This admission triggered a bureau investigation that revealed much more extensive business activity involving at least five identifiable enterprises. Relevant information for each is set forth individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\n<em>Grocery/Convenience Stores</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">{\u00b6 26} These enterprises have been variously referred to as \u201cDel\u2019s 6-12 Grocery,\u201d \u201cDel\u2019s Markets,\u201d and \u201cDel\u2019s 24 Hour Store.\u201d Evidence suggests the existence of, at one time, at least three stores, and clearly confirms two. The bulk of the evidence, however, relates to a store on Thomasson Drive. A 1992 credit application listed the store as a proprietorship and claimant as its president.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">{\u00b6 27} Claimant\u2019s answers to interrogatories that had been prepared for a 1993 motor vehicle accident insurance claim indicated that claimant was \u201c[s]elf-employed from 1987 to 1995, as owner of grocery store located at 2802 Thomas-son Drive, Naples, Florida 34112; Rate of pay is $52,000 per year. No employment after 1995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">{\u00b6 28} In response to another interrogatory as to whether claimant had \u201clost income, benefits, or earning capacity\u201d as the result of his 1993 accident, he wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cYes; shortly after the accident, I lost approximately one month\u2019s work for doctors visits, therapy and surgery. I have lost work time over the past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>four years every now and then because of flare-ups. Altogether, I have lost about $10,000 income, calculated at a salary of $4,000-$5,000 per month.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\n<em>Del\u2019s Wholesale</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 30} The character of the enterprise referred to as \u201cDel\u2019s Wholesale\u201d is somewhat unclear. The bureau\u2019s investigative report seems to consider it a business separate from the grocery stores, but a state of Florida document gives it the same address as the Thomasson Drive store.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 31} An April 4, 1994 liquor license permit for Del\u2019s Wholesale indicated that claimant\u2019s license had been transferred to his wife, Nancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\n<em>Delr-Jak Corporation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">{\u00b6 32} The only information contained in the record about this enterprise is that the claimant was a silent partner in this enterprise that was doing business as USA Cab Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">\n<em>Enterprise RenNar-Car</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">{\u00b6 33} This is the work to which claimant admitted in his 1999 bureau contact letter. Claimant was hired on August 8, 1997, as a courtesy driver and apparently worked intermittently through the following March. Relevant evidence included (1) claimant\u2019s assertion that he was capable of full-time work and would work overtime, (2) claimant\u2019s written statement that he was willing to do \u201cwhatever it takes to get the job done and what ever hours it takes to cover,\u201d and (3) claimant\u2019s termination form indicating that he was quitting due to \u201cillness/injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">\n<em>Naples Daily News</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">{\u00b6 34} Claimant\u2019s involvement with a newspaper delivery route began sometime in 1997. While wife Nancy was named as an independent contractor with the newspaper and received checks in her name, four employees of the Naples Daily News told investigators that it was claimant who did all the work, loading his vehicle with the papers and distributing them along his designated route. These bundles of papers weighed between approximately 20 and 25 pounds. Nancy\u2019s involvement was limited to selling subscriptions. When asked why his wife was receiving the paychecks when he was doing all the work, claimant stated that his accountant had told them to do it that way. In 2000, the Naples Daily News paid Nancy $35,000 for the paper route and $38,728 for the subscription sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">{\u00b6 35} Based on its investigation, the bureau moved to terminate PTD and to declare an overpayment. The commission granted the motion, making four relevant findings based on the evidence cited above. It (1) declared overpaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>PTD received by claimant from March 15, 1991, through April 4, 1994, based on claimant\u2019s grocery store ownership; (2) declared overpaid PTD from April 7, 1997, through November 2, 2000, based on claimant\u2019s activities with Enterprise Rent-a-Car and the Naples Daily News, (3) terminated further PTD effective November 2, 2000; and (4) found that claimant had committed fraud in collecting these payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">{\u00b636} Claimant challenged these findings in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. With the exception of changing the date when overpayment began on the second period from April 7 to August 7, 1997, the court of appeals upheld the commission\u2019s order in its entirety. Claimant now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">{\u00b6 37} Claimant does not seriously challenge the termination of compensation subsequent to November 2, 2000, nor does he vigorously deny that he engaged in activities inconsistent with the receipt of PTD from August 7, 1997, to November 2, 2000. Claimant instead concentrates on the first period of overpayment and the declaration of fraud. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\n<em>March 15, 1991, through April 4, 1994</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">{\u00b6 38} Claimant contends that in declaring this period overpaid, the commission (1) equated business ownership with sustained remunerative employment and (2) relied on newspaper articles that predate PTD.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">{\u00b6 39} Claimant validly asserts that the mere fact of business ownership, without more, should not defeat eligibility for compensation. See <em>State ex rel. Ford Motor Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>98 Ohio St.3d 20, 2002-Ohio-7038, 780 N.E.2d 1016. Claimant errs, however, in declaring that \u201cmore\u201d must be <em>physical </em>activity. Sedentary activities can constitute sustained remunerative employment as well, including those administrative and executive decisions necessary to the management of a business.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">{\u00b6 40} Claimant counters that there is no direct evidence that he exercised any administrative or executive authority in conjunction with the grocery stores. We find, however, sufficient evidence to permit the commission \u2014 in its evidentiary prerogative \u2014 to make this inference. See <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">{\u00b6 41} As cited by the commission, claimant\u2019s own characterization of his employment status in the 1997 interrogatories was as <em>\u25a0\u201c[s]elf-employed </em>from 1987 to 1995, as owner of grocery store * * *; Rate of pay is $52,000 per year. No employment after 1995.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In that same document, claimant also stated that since 1993, he had lost \u201capproximately one month\u2019s <em>work </em>for doctor\u2019s visits * * *. I have lost <em>work </em>time over the past four years every now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>and then * * *. Altogether I have lost about $10,000 in income, calculated at a <em>salary </em>of $4,000-$5,000 per month.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ak\">Cline, Cook &amp; Weisenburger Co., L.P.A., Clint M. McBee and Steven B. Winters, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Arh\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Keith D. Blosser, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">{\u00b6 42} These statements are \u201csome evidence\u201d that claimant himself considered his involvement with the store(s) to be \u201cwork\u201d for which he was remunerated. His statements also established that these efforts were sustained. Even when viewed independently of the news articles describing claimant\u2019s drive and work ethic, claimant\u2019s statements are sufficient to justify a declaration of overpayment for the disputed period.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\n<em>April 7, 1997, through November 2, 2000</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">{\u00b6 43} The commission declared this period to be overpaid based on claimant\u2019s employment at Enterprise Rent-a-Car and the Naples Daily News. Claimant does not deny that from August 7, 1997, through November 2, 2000, he engaged in sustained remunerative employment. He does deny participating in such activities from April 7, 1997, through August 6, 1997, and the evidence \u2014 as the court of appeals found \u2014 bears this out. The court of appeals, therefore, changed the overpayment start date to August 7, 1997. Claimant objects, asserting that since the commission erred on the start date, the entire overpayment declaration must be vacated. We reject this argument as untenable on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\n<em>Fraud Declaration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">{\u00b6 44} Claimant criticizes the declaration of fraud, arguing that the requisite element of nondisclosure is lacking. See <em>Gaines v. Preterm-Cleveland, Inc. </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 54, 514 N.E.2d 709. Claimant bases his assertion on his belated disclosure of his employment at Enterprise Rent-a-Car. This, however, ignores the years that he did not disclose his employment in two other remunerative endeavors \u2014 his grocery store(s) and the newspaper route. The commission did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in declaring fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">{\u00b6 45} Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b159-12\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Cook, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-13\">. Both articles refer to claimant\u2019s upcoming 13th surgery as being six years after his accident. For this reason, a 1975 date has been ascribed to these undated articles.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
