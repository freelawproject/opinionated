Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 186, 2002-Ohio-7217, 781 N.E.2d 927. I dissented from paragraph two of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the <em>Ferrando </em>syllabus, in which the court merely presumed the prejudicial effect of an insured\u2019s breach of a subrogation provision in an insurance policy. Id. at \u00b6 105. I believe that an insured\u2019s breach of a subrogation-related provision of an insurance policy is per se prejudicial. There is no need for the additional time and expense of a factual inquiry into the issue. This is particularly so in a <em>ScottPontzer </em>case, in which a party may be asserting an extremely stale claim or one in which the possibility of collection from the tortfeasor never existed, and therefore the usual issues of the insurer\u2019s refusal to defend or participate never arose. See <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A3h\">Clark, Perdue, Roberts <em>&amp; </em>Scott Co., L.P.A., and Paul O. Scott, for appellant and cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AF3\">Keener, Doucher, Curley &amp; Patterson, L.P.A., and Thomas J. Keener, for appellees and cross-appellants Transcontinental Insurance Company and Continental Casualty Company.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 5} As I explained in <em>Ferrando, </em>the rights of the insurer are actually prejudiced by the breach of a consent-to-settle or subrogation provision of an insurance policy. If a tortfeasor has been released from further liability, it is my opinion that any inquiry is a useless exercise that merely prolongs the tortuous routes created by <em>Scottr-Pontzer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">{\u00b6 6} Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the decision to remand. In addition, I would allow the cross-appeal by Transcontinental Insurance Company and Continental Casualty Company.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
