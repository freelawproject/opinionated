Brown, filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Summit County for a writ of mandamus. Brown sought the writ to compel appellee, the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, to grant him jail-time credit for the days he spent at a community-based correctional facility. On January 30, 2003, the common pleas court concluded that Brown was entitled to 183 days credit for the time served in the Summit County Jail. In February 2003, the court of appeals dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">{\u00b6 2} For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing Brown\u2019s mandamus complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">{\u00b6 3} Brown failed to comply with R.C. 2969.25(C). With his complaint, Brown filed an affidavit that attempted to comply with R.C. 2969.21 et seq., but he did not file the certified statement of his prison cashier setting forth the balance in his inmate account for each of the preceding six months, which was required by R.C. 2969.25(C). \u201cThe certified statement of the prison cashier required by R.C. 2969.25(C) concerning [Brown\u2019s] inmate account would have allowed [Brown] to support his bare, conclusory assertion that he was indigent.\u201d <em>State ex rel.

Court of Common Pleas </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 176, 177-178, 724 N.E.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">{\u00b6 4} Moreover, Brown had an adequate remedy at law by appeal to raise any error by the trial court in calculating his jail-time credit. <em>State ex rel. Jones v. O\u2019Connor </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 426, 704 N.E.2d 1223; R.C. 2731.05.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Lee Shawn P.
