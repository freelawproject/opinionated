Gardner of Cleveland, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0061172, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in May 1993. On August 13, 2001, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, filed a complaint charging respondent with several violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility, including DR 7-106(C)(6) (engaging in undignified or discourteous conduct which is degrading to a tribunal) and 8-102(B) (knowingly making a false accusation about a judge). A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the matter and, based on stipulations and respondent\u2019s testimony, made findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The record establishes that in 2001, respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth District on behalf of a client convicted of driving under a court-ordered license suspension. Respondent challenged the conviction as a denial of due process, arguing that his client had not received sufficient notice of the crime with which he had been charged. Respondent essentially acknowledged that his client was guilty of driving in violation of a court order; however, he maintained that the police officer had mistakenly charged his client with driving in violation of Ohio\u2019s Financial Responsibility Act (\u201cFRA\u201d), a crime of which his client was not guilty. The court of appeals affirmed the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>{\u00b6 3} In a motion seeking reconsideration or, in the alternative, certification of the case as a conflict to this court, respondent accused the panel that decided his client\u2019s appeal of being dishonest and ignoring well-established law. He declared that the panel had issued an opinion so \u201cresult driven\u201d that \u201cany fair-minded judge\u201d would have been \u201cashamed to attach his/her name\u201d to it. He then added that the panel did not give \u201ca damn about how wrong, disingenuous, and biased its opinion is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 4} Throughout the several pages that followed, respondent inveighed against the panel, contrasting it with \u201cfair-minded Ohio appellate districts\u201d and stating that \u201c[n]o matter how bad [the] panel wants to skew or ignore the facts,\u201d it could only conclude that his client had been improperly charged. He lamented that \u201chonesty and truth [were] damned\u201d in the panel\u2019s opinion and that the panel\u2019s \u201cdesire to be \u2018tough on crime\u2019 [had] blind[ed] it to basic law and fairness.\u201d Respondent then posed these questions: \u201cWhy does this panel only apply the law as a hammer to crush citizens and not as a shield to protect their basic rights?\u201d and \u201cIs having a prosecutorial bent [so] hard to let go of that truth must be cast aside to achieve a particular result?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent went on to accuse the panel of having \u201cdistorted the truth\u201d and having \u201cmanufactured a gross and malicious distortion.\u201d His discussion continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if this panel had the basic decency and honesty to write and acknowledge these simple unquestionable truths in its opinion? Would writing an opinion that actually reflected the truth be that hard? Must this panel\u2019s desire to achieve a particular result upholding a wrongful conviction of a man who was unquestionably guilty of an uncharged offense \u2014 necessarily justify its own corruption of the law and truth? Doesn\u2019t an oath to .uphold and follow the law mean anything to this panel?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cIs that claim that \u2018We are a nation of laws, not men\u2019 have any meaning after reading the panel\u2019s decision? Can\u2019t this panel have the decency to actually address \u2014 rather than to ignore \u2014 the cases cited by [the client] which demonstrate beyond any doubt that he was convicted of an offense he was never charged with having violated?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIn this ease, beyond the ignored concepts of the law and truth, lies that of policy. As a policy matter, is this court really encouraging all officers in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Eighth District to charge a generic statute \u2014 or Chapter or Title \u2014 and not the particular offense they are accusing a citizen of violating? In the name of God, WHY? What is so difficult with a police officer doing his job in an intelligent manner? Why must this panel bend over backwards and ignore well established law just to encourage law officers to be slovenly and careless? In <em>State v. Homan </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 421 [732 N.E.2d 952], didn\u2019t the Ohio Supreme Court just state that officers actually have to follow the rules strictly? Doesn\u2019t that mean anything to this panel?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cPerhaps, if this panel is not strong enough to admit its obvious prosecutorial bias in its opinion, it will discover the internal fortitude to certify this matter to the Ohio Supreme Court under Rule IV of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 10} The board\u2019s panel found, consistent with the parties\u2019 stipulation, that respondent had violated DR 7-106(0(6). The panel also found respondent in violation of DR 8-102(B) by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 11} In recommending a sanction, the panel considered that respondent had no previous record of discipline and had apologized for the manner in which he expressed his frustration about the affirmance of his client\u2019s conviction. Respondent also recognized during the hearing that his response to the court of appeals\u2019 opinion was neither appropriate nor professional. However, while respondent professed to understand the need to challenge judicial decisions only in an appropriate manner, he confirmed his continued belief that the court of appeals during his .client\u2019s appeal had skewed and ignored the facts, disregarded honesty and truth, and violated their oaths to decide cases fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 12} The panel recommended the sanction suggested by the parties \u2014 that respondent be publicly reprimanded for the cited misconduct. The board adopted the findings that respondent violated DR 7 \u2014 106(C)(6) and 8-102(B), but rejected the panel\u2019s sanction. The board recommended, based on his \u201coutrageous behavior toward a tribunal,\u201d that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months, with all six months stayed on the condition that he commit no further violations of the Disciplinary Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">{\u00b6 13} In objections to the board\u2019s finding that he violated DR 8-102(B) and its recommendation, respondent argues that his accusations are federally protected free speech because they are opinions and thus immune from disciplinary measures in the same way that mere opinions are not actionable in defamation. He also argues that even if his attacks were capable of being proved true or false, relator nevertheless failed to prove that respondent knowingly made \u201cfalse\u201d accusations for the purpose of DR 8-102(B). We review these arguments to determine whether respondent\u2019s statements, which specifically accuse the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>late court panel of prosecutorial bias and corrupting the law in order to sustain an unlawful conviction, may be disciplined as professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The First Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 14} The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c[i]t is unquestionable that in the courtroom itself, during a judicial proceeding, whatever right to \u2018free speech\u2019 an attorney has is extremely circumscribed. * * * Even outside the courtroom, a majority of the Court in two separate opinions in the case of <em>In re Sawyer, </em>860 U.S. 622 [79 S.Ct. 1376, 3 L.Ed.2d 1473] (1959), observed that lawyers in pending cases were subject to ethical restrictions on speech to which an ordinary citizen would not be.\u201d <em>Gentile v. Nevada State Bar </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 1030, 1071, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 115 L.Ed.2d 888. See, also, <em>In re Disciplinary Action Against Garaas </em>(N.D.2002), 652 N.W.2d 918, 925. An attorney\u2019s speech may be sanctioned if it is highly likely to obstruct or prejudice the administration of justice. <em>Gentile </em>at 1075, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 115 L.Ed.2d 888. These narrow restrictions are justified by the integral role that attorneys play in the judicial system, which requires them to refrain from speech or conduct that may obstruct the fair administration of justice. Id. at 1074, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 115 L.Ed.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 15} Thus, attorneys may not invoke the federal constitutional right of free speech to immunize themselves from even-handed discipline for proven unethical conduct. <em>In re Sawyer </em>(1959), 360 U.S. 622, 646, 79 S.Ct. 1376, 3 L.Ed.2d 1473 (Stewart, J., concurring in result). The First Amendment does not shield an attorney from discipline for falsely suggesting \u201cunseemly complicity\u201d by the judiciary in unlawful or unethical practices. Id. at 633, 79 S.Ct. 1376, 3 L.Ed.2d 1473. Such false statements, whether by attorneys or others, enjoy no constitutional protection when they are made with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for their truth. <em>Garrison v. Louisiana </em>(1964), 379 U.S. 64, 75, 85 S.Ct. 209, 13 L.Ed.2d 125. Although neither <em>Sawyer </em>nor in <em>In re Snyder </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 634, 105 S.Ct. 2874, 86 L.Ed.2d 504, definitively so held, all of the justices who participated in those decisions assumed or stated that a lawyer\u2019s false accusations of criminal conduct directed against named judges could be the basis for discipline. <em>In re Palmisano </em>(C.A.7, 1995), 70 F.3d 483, 487. \u201cEven a statement cast in the form of an opinion (T think that Judge X is dishonest\u2019) implies a factual basis, and the lack of support for that implied factual assertion may be a proper basis for a penalty.\u201d Id. at 487, citing <em>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co. </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 1, 110 S.Ct. 2695, 111 L.Ed.2d 1. While <em>Milkovich </em>is a defamation case not involving attorney discipline, it demonstrates that the First Amendment does not protect any individual who knowingly makes false statements or expresses opinions that imply false statements of fact. <em>In re Complaint Against Harper </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 211, 673 N.E.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Thus, the First Amendment does not insulate an attorney from professional discipline even for expressing an opinion, during court proceedings, that a judge is corrupt when the attorney knows that the opinion has no factual basis or is reckless in that regard. Respondent\u2019s contention that his statements are protected as unverifiable opinions is incorrect. <em>Milkovich </em>rejected the premise that the First Amendment mandates an inquiry into whether a statement is one of opinion or of fact. Id. at 18-19,110 S.Ct. 2695, 111 L.Ed.2d 1. Accordingly, the United States Constitution offers respondent no protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Section 11, Article I, Ohio Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"AR2\">{\u00b6 17} This court has never addressed the question of whether the Free Speech Clause of the Ohio Constitution, Section 11, Article I, forbids imposing discipline on an attorney for criticizing a judge during a pending court proceeding. DR 8-102(B) specifically permits such discipline where a lawyer knowingly makes a false accusation against a judge. Section 11 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cEvery citizen may freely speak, write, and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of the right; and no law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 19} The tension between Section 11 and DR 8-102(B) lies at the heart of this case. Under Ohio law, speech that may violate DR 8-102(B) may be otherwise protected by the state Constitution. When the statement in question cannot reasonably be interpreted by the ordinary reader as stating actual facts about an individual, the statement is protected as the free expression of opinion under Section 11. <em>Harper, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 229, 673 N.E.2d 1253; <em>McKimm v. Ohio Elections Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 139, 144, 729 N.E.2d 364. Thus, the Ohio Constitution goes beyond the federal Constitution in that certain false statements of opinion are protected. This protection exists as a separate and independent guarantee ancillary to freedom of expression and requires a reviewing court to determine whether the language in question is fact or opinion. <em>Vail v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 279, 649 N.E.2d 182, certiorari denied (1996), 516 U.S. 1043, 116 S.Ct. 700, 133 L.Ed.2d 657; <em>Wampler v. Higgins </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 111, 117-118, 752 N.E.2d 962. The test for deciding whether a statement is fact or opinion is an objective one based on a totality of circumstances and on the specificity, verifiability, general context, and social context of the words used. Id. at 126, 752 N.E.2d 962; <em>McKimm, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 145, 729 N.E.2d 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 20} <em>In re Complaint Against Judge Harper, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 211, 673 N.E.2d 1253, employed this distinction to publicly reprimand a judge for airing a campaign advertisement that falsely accused her judicial opponent of being associated with dishonest lawyers intent upon corrupting the legal system. Although the <em>Harper </em>court did not explicitly apply the totality-of-circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>test for distinguishing fact from opinion, the accusation in that case was sufficiently specific and weighed in favor of sanction. The advertisement in effect charged the judge\u2019s opponent with a crime \u2014 conspiring to fix cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">{\u00b6 21} To accuse a court of appeals of affirming a conviction out of prosecutorial bias and corruption is no less specific. Such allegations are charges of criminal or unethical activity and, therefore, constitute classic examples of statements having a well-defined meaning. <em>Wampler, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 128, 752 N.E.2d 962, citing <em>Ollman v. Evans </em>(C.A.D.C.1984), 750 F.2d 970, 979-980. Accord <em>Standing Commt. on Discipline, U.S. Dist. Court, Cent. Dist. of Calif. v. Yagman </em>(C.A.9, 1995), 55 F.3d 1430, 1440 (statements that can reasonably be understood as imputing specific criminal or other wrongful acts are not entitled to constitutional protection merely because they are phrased in the form of an opinion). Allegations of criminal or ethical misconduct are also readily capable of being proved or disproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, allegations of corruption made in documents filed in court, unlike allegations raised in a political campaign, are not what the average reader would reasonably consider to be an opinion. A courtroom is not a forum for personal or political grandstanding, and the attorneys who practice in it \u201cpossess, and are perceived by the public as possessing, special knowledge of the workings of the judicial branch of government.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Assn. v. Porter </em>(Okla.1988), 766 P.2d 958, 969. Lawyers\u2019 statements made during court proceedings are \u201clikely to be received as especially authoritative.\u201d <em>Gentile, </em>501 U.S. at 1074, 111 S.Ct. 2720, 115 L.Ed.2d 888. Thus, in the context of his motion and that appeal, respondent\u2019s statements are reasonably understood to be factual assertions of the appellate court\u2019s corruption and prosecutorial bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, we reject respondent\u2019s contention that his attacks against the court of appeals represented any sort of \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d or \u201cimaginative expression\u201d for which he might escape sanction. <em>Harper, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 229, 673 N.E.2d 1253, quoting <em>Milkovich, </em>497 U.S. at 20, 110 S.Ct. 2695, 111 L.Ed.2d 1. Nor could respondent\u2019s accusations be \u201c \u2018loosely definable\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018variously interpretable\u2019 \u201d as his criticism of the law as applied by the panel. <em>Wampler, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 128, 752 N.E.2d 962, quoting <em>Ollman, </em>750 F.2d at 980. Accord <em>In re Sawyer, </em>360 U.S. at 634, 79 S.Ct. 1376, 3 L.Ed.2d 1473. Respondent charged with \u201ccrystal clarity,\u201d <em>Wampler, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 129, 752 N.E.2d 962, that the panel\u2019s affirmation of his client\u2019s conviction resulted not from error, but from prosecutorial bias and corruption. For this offense against the integrity and impartiality of the court of appeals and the judicial system, he may be held responsible. <em>Harper, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 229, 673 N.E.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Knowledge</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">{\u00b6 24} DR 8-102(B) provides that a lawyer \u201cshall not knowingly make false accusations against a judge or other adjudicatory officer.\u201d Respondent claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>that this prohibition required relator to prove that his accusations of prosecutorial bias and corruption were false and that he subjectively knew that they were false. Relator urges us to apply an objective test.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 25} Respondent advocates the \u201cactual malice\u201d standard applicable in defamation cases under <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964), 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686; <em>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 485, 511, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502, fn. 30. At least three states have used the actual-malice standard in attorney discipline cases, that is, they have framed the issue as whether the lawyer uttered the statement with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard as to its truth. If no knowledge or recklessness is found, these courts have declined to discipline lawyers for accusing judges in public of bias. See <em>In re Green </em>(Colo.2000), 11 P.3d 1078, 1085; <em>Oklahoma Bar Assn. v. Porter, </em>766 P.2d 958; <em>Ramsey v. Bd. of Professional Responsibility </em>(Tenn.1989), 771 S.W.2d 116, certiorari denied (1989), 493 U.S. 917, 110 S.Ct. 278, 107 L.Ed.2d 258. Similarly, in <em>Butler v. Alabama Judicial Inquiry Comm. </em>(Ala.2001), 802 So.2d 207, the court modified an over-broad judicial canon by incorporating the actual-malice test for judicial campaign speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 26} We, however, agree with the majority of courts that have addressed this issue and adopt \u201can objective standard to determine whether a lawyer\u2019s statement about a judicial officer is made with knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity.\u201d Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct (4th Ed.1999) 566, Rule 8. This standard assesses an attorney\u2019s statements in terms of \u201c \u2018what the reasonable attorney, considered in light of all his professional functions, would do in the same or similar circumstances\u2019 * * * [and] focuses on whether the attorney had a reasonable factual basis for making the statements, considering their nature and the context in which they were made.\u201d <em>Yagman, </em>55 F.3d at 1437, quoting <em>United States Dist. Court, E. Dist. of Wash. v. Sandlin </em>(C.A.9, 1993), 12 F.3d 861, 867.

Defamation actions seek to remedy an essentially private wrong by compensating individuals for harm caused to their reputation and standing in the community. Ethical rules that prohibit false statements impugning the integrity of judges, by contrast, are not designed to shield judges from unpleasant or offensive criticism, but to preserve public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of our system of justice. See <em>In re Terry, </em>271 Ind. 499 [502], 394 N.E.2d 94, 95 (1979); <em>In re Graham, </em>453 N.W.2d 313, 322 (Minn.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThough attorneys can play an important role in exposing problems with the judicial system, <em>see Oklahoma ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. Porter, </em>766 P.2d 958, 967 (Okla.1988), <em>false </em>statements impugning the integrity of a judge erode public confidence without serving to publicize problems that justifiably deserve attention. * * * [A]n objective malice standard strikes a constitutionally permissible balance between an attorney\u2019s right to criticize the judiciary and the public\u2019s interest in preserving confidence in the judicial system: Lawyers may freely voice criticisms supported by a reasonable factual basis even if they turn out to be mistaken.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 31} We similarly conclude that the state\u2019s compelling interest in preserving public confidence in the judiciary supports applying a standard in disciplinary proceedings different from that applicable in defamation cases. Under the objective standard, an attorney may still freely exercise free speech rights and make statements supported by a reasonable factual basis, even if the attorney turns out to be mistaken. Accord <em>In re Chmura, </em>461 Mich, at 544, 608 N.W.2d 31. Accordingly, we hold that an attorney may be sanctioned for making accusations of judicial impropriety that a reasonable attorney would believe are false.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">{\u00b6 32} Relator does not contest that it bore the burden of proof on this issue. Thus, we determine that a reasonable attorney would believe that respondent\u2019s accusations were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">{\u00b6 33} Respondent obviously disagreed with the court of appeals\u2019 analysis and disposition of his client\u2019s appeal. But as relator aptly points out, he made no real inquiry into the court\u2019s integrity at all prior to launching his attacks, even ignoring his law partner\u2019s advice against making the accusations of bias and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>corruption. A failure to investigate charges of judicial impropriety when EC 8-6 admonishes attorneys to \u201cbe. certain\u201d that their criticism has merit demonstrates reckless disregard for truth. This is particularly true where, as here, the attorney proceeds against the advice of a close colleague in whom he has previously shown confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">{\u00b6 34} Moreover, we have reviewed the court of appeals\u2019 opinion for evidence of bias and corruption and see nothing that could possibly be characterized as anything other than error, if that. Respondent simply assumed that the judges had conspired to defy their individual oaths to faithfully and impartially discharge the duties incumbent on their respective judicial offices to the best of their ability and understanding. R.C. 3.23. He thereby violated DR 8-102(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 35} We find respondent in violation of DR 7-106(C) and 8-102(B). We also find that his misconduct warrants a more serious sanction than that recommended by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 36} Unfounded attacks against the integrity of the judiciary require an actual suspension from the practice of law. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. West </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 5, 706 N.E.2d 760 (18-month suspension, 12 months stayed on conditions); <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Hartwell </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 258, 520 N.E.2d 226 (one-year suspension). Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for a period of six months. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

During the trial and appeal, respondent emphasized that the crimes of driving under a court-ordered license suspension and driving under an FRA license suspension were different subsections of the general ordinance prohibiting driving under suspension. He argued that his client had actually been charged with the \u201cwrong\u201d crime because the charging officer had identified only the general ordinance on the client\u2019s ticket, the officer had described the suspension as \u201cFRA,\u201d and the officer\u2019s trial testimony suggested that he had intended to charge the client with an FRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>suspension violation. On the authority of <em>Barberton v. O\u2019Connor </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 218, 17 OBR 452, 478 N.E.2d 803, paragraph two of the syllabus, the court of appeals held that the client was sufficiently charged because the general ordinance noted on the ticket allowed the client with \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d to know exactly the charge against him. <em>Lakewood v. Cirino </em>(Feb. 1, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 78057, 2001 WL 91225, appeal not allowed (2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 1414, 748 N.E.2d 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b552-13\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1U\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">{\u00b6 37} I concur with the majority\u2019s judgment and most of its analysis. However, I do not believe that Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and DR 8-102(B) are in conflict because I do not believe that the Ohio Constitution protects \u201cfalse statements of opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">{\u00b6 38} The majority indicates that there is a conflict between DR 8-102(B) and Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution because DR 8-102(B) prohibits \u201cfalse accusations against a judge\u201d while the Ohio Constitution protects \u201ccertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>false statements of opinion.\u201d I believe that the Ohio Constitution protects opinions but not false statements of opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 39} In support of its position, the majority cites <em>In re Complaint Against Harper </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 211, 229, 673 N.E.2d 1253, and <em>McKimm v. Ohio Elections Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 139, 144, 729 N.E.2d 364. The cited portion of <em>McKimm </em>merely holds that alleged defamatory statements must be examined from a reasonable reader\u2019s perspective to distinguish <em>fact </em>from <em>opinion. </em>In <em>Harper </em>we recognized that an opinion is often \u201c \u2018rhetorical hyperbole,\u2019 \u201d which cannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts. <em>Harper, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 229, 673 N.E.2d 1253, quoting <em>Greenbelt Coop. Publishing Assn., Inc. v. Bresler </em>(1970), 398 U.S. 6, 14, 90 S.Ct. 1537, 26 L.Ed.2d 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 40} I believe that a <em>false statement </em>of opinion connotes a deceitfulness that is absent in hyperbole. Accordingly, a distinction must be drawn between statements that may be reasonably interpreted by the ordinary reader as stating actual facts about an individual versus statements that can reasonably be interpreted by the reader as a free expression of an opinion only of the author. See <em>Harper, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 229, 673 N.E.2d 1253; <em>McKimm, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 144, 729 N.E.2d 364. Stating that a <em>\u201cfalse statement </em>of opinion\u201d is protected by the Ohio Constitution precariously and unnecessarily blurs the line between a mere opinion, which is protected by the Ohio Constitution, and a false statement of fact, which is not always protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 41} Accordingly, I believe that the better approach is to state that the Ohio Constitution protects opinions, but not false statements of opinion. Otherwise, I' concur with the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b553-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALL\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">{\u00b6 42} In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Grimes </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 607, 614 N.E.2d 740, a case involving a, lawyer who made an off-color reference about a judge to a newspaper reporter and a smart-aleck remark to another judge in court, I dissented from the majority\u2019s decision to impose a public reprimand. In <em>Grimes, </em>I wrote that the conduct at issue was out of character and inconsequential, but also that \u201c[o]ur legal system relies upon vigorous advocacy, which occasionally leads to spirited interplay between lawyers and judges\u201d and that we \u201cought not rule in a way that may affect that friction.\u201d 66 Ohio St.3d at 610, 614 N.E.2d 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">{\u00b6 43} I feel much the same way about the respondent in this case. By all accounts, his behavior was out of character. Certainly, a motion for reconsideration in an appellate court, while a public document, would receive about as much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>scrutiny from the public if it were written on the wind. The offending statements were between this attorney and the bench, and were presented in such a way that only the bench and opposing counsel would see them.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9E\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AhmJ\">James A. Vollins, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 44} That being said, the disturbing thing about this case that separates it from <em>Grimes </em>is that the comments here were not made off-the-cuff in a moment of anger. They were written down, edited, and presumably cheeked for spelling. The attorney then made copies and filed his motion with the court. At any time he could have thought better of his comments and retracted them. It is a tried and true practice that the first thing a lawyer should do with a fiery pleading or letter is to file it under his or her pillow.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 45} The respondent here did not do that, or if he did sleep on it, made a mistake in filing it with the court. He admits as much, and thinks he deserves a public reprimand. I agree, especially given the virtually nonpublic release of his comments.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
