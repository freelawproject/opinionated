The charge alleged that appellees, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., and two alleged agents (collectively, \u201cCountrywide\u201d), engaged in sex discrimination and family-status discrimination by not considering Mrs. Williams\u2019s salary during the loan-application process because she was on maternity leave. On August 3, 1999, HUD notified Countrywide of the charge. HUD referred the charge to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (\u201cOCRC\u201d). On August 10, 1999, OCRC received the charge and began its investigation. OCRC filed an administrative complaint against Countrywide on July 13, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">{\u00b6 2} Countrywide moved for summary judgment, claiming that the one-year statute of limitations had run before OCRC filed the complaint. OCRC filed the complaint one year and 20 days after the Williamses\u2019 charge was filed with HUD. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, and the court of appeals affirmed. The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">{\u00b6 3} The principal issue in this case is whether R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) is a statute of limitations for the filing of complaints by OCRC or whether it is a directory provision to encourage the orderly processing of discrimination claims. We hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>that R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) is mandatory. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 4} R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) states that any complaint issued by OCRC based on the filing of a charge of unlawful discriminatory practice \u201cshall be so issued within one year after the complainant filed the charge.\u201d In <em>Dorrian v. Scioto Conservancy Dist. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 102, 56 O.O.2d 58, 271 N.E.2d 834, paragraph one of the syllabus, this court stated that \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 shall be construed as mandatory unless there appears a clear and unequivocal legislative intent that [it] receive a construction other than [its] ordinary usage.\u201d Accord <em>State v. Golphin </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 543, 545-546, 692 N.E.2d 608. We consider the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) to indicate unambiguously that the provision is mandatory. See <em>State ex rel. Gen. Motors Corp. v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 111, 114, 4 O.O.3d 241, 362 N.E.2d 1221 (holding similar language in predecessor statute mandatory).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 5} Interpreting R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) to be anything other than a mandatory statute of limitations would disserve defendants and claimants. Defendants would be required to choose between being exposed to liability for actions long past and filing for writs of mandamus to force OCRC to act. Such a choice would subject defendants to undue burdens and be inconsistent with the legal principles requiring parties to act on claims or lose them.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">{\u00b6 6} We hold that the one-year time limit contained in R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) is mandatory, not directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">{\u00b6 7} Concluding that R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) is mandatory does not fully resolve this case. OCRC argues that, in any event, it did file within the mandatory one-year period. Relying on Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-01(D), OCRC contends that the filing date of the original charge is August 10, 1999, because that is the date on which it received the charge from HUD. If August 10, 1999, were the filing date, then the administrative complaint, which was filed on July 13, 2000, would be timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">{\u00b6 8} Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-01(D) states that \u201c[a] charge filed with * * * the department of housing and urban development (HUD) which indicates it is also filed with the commission is deemed filed with the Ohio civil rights commission on the date it is received at one of the commission offices.\u201d According to the rule, the date of receipt is deemed the filing date only when the charge indicates a dual filing. OCRC\u2019s argument fails because the charge, when submitted by the complainants, did not indicate that it was filed with both HUD and OCRC. Further, there is no indication that the Williamses ever filed the charge with OCRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">{\u00b6 9} We conclude that Ohio Adm.Code 4112-3-01(D) does not change the filing date in this case. Accordingly, the statute of limitations began to run on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>June 23, 1999, and expired June 23, 2000. OCRC\u2019s complaint, filed July 13, 2000, was untimely, and the trial court properly dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 10} Finally, OCRC argues that the Williamses have a property interest in the case before us and that a determination that OCRC filed the complaint outside the statute of limitations would deprive them of due process. This argument would be more compelling if the Williamses were not pursuing a class action against Countrywide for the same alleged discriminatory practice. See <em>Williams v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>6th Dist. No. L-01-1473, 2002-Ohio-5499, 2002 WL 31270283. We conclude that whatever property interest the Williamses have is being protected in their separate suit against Countrywide.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 11} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-8\">Moyer, C.J., F.E.

Consequently, the failure of OCRC to issue a complaint within one year after the Williamses filed their charge with the Department of Housing and Urban Development did not deprive OCRC of authority to proceed with the action and was not a proper basis for summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">{\u00b6 13} The majority focuses exclusively on the general rule of statutory construction that \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 shall be construed as mandatory unless there appears a clear and unequivocal legislative intent that [it] receive a construction other than [its] ordinary usage.\u201d <em>Dorrian v. Scioto Conservancy Dist. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 102, 56 O.O.2d 58, 271 N.E.2d 834, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-15\">{\u00b6 14} The majority fails to acknowledge, however, that this court has long recognized an exception to the general rule in eases such as this where the statutory language relates to \u201cthe manner or time in which power or jurisdiction vested in a public officer is to be exercised.\u201d <em>Schick v. Cincinnati </em>(1927), 116 Ohio St. 16, 155 N.E. 555, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cA statute specifying a time within which a public officer is to perform an official act regarding the rights and duties of others is directory merely, unless the nature of the act to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>performed or the phraseology of the statute or of other statutes relating to the same subject matter is such that the designation of time must be considered a limitation upon the power of the officer.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Barnell </em>(1924), 109 Ohio St. 246, 255, 142 N.E. 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Farrar </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 467, 32 O.O. 542, 66 N.E.2d 531, this court held, at paragraphs one, two, and three of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c1. A statute is mandatory where noncompliance with its provisions will render illegal and void the steps or acts to which it relates or for which it provides, and is directory where noncompliance will not invalidate such steps or acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 17} <em>\u201c2. </em>As a general rule, statutes which relate to the essence of the act to be performed or to matters of substance are mandatory, and those which do not relate to the essence and compliance with which is merely a matter of convenience rather than substance are directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c3. As a general rule, a statute providing a time for the performance of an official duty will be construed as directory so far as time for performance is concerned, especially where the statute fixes the time simply for convenience or orderly procedure; and, unless the object or purpose of a statutory provision requiring some act to be performed within a specified period of time is discernible from the language employed, the statute is directory and not mandatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">{\u00b6 19} This court has continued to apply the rule set forth in <em>Farrar, </em>not <em>Dorrian, </em>in situations such as the one currently at issue. See, e.g., <em>State v. Bellman </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 208, 210, 714 N.E.2d 381; <em>In re Davis </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 520, 522, 705 N.E.2d 1219; <em>State ex rel. Webb v. Bryan City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 27, 31, 10 OBR 178, 460 N.E.2d 1121. As this court explained in <em>Webb, Dorrian </em>applies only to the question \u201cwhether there was a mandatory duty to act, and not when the act was to be done.\u201d Id. at 31, 10 OBR 178, 460 N.E.2d 1121. That is not the type of issue before us. There is no dispute that OCRC did perform the required substantive act by filing a complaint in this case. The only issue is whether the language of R.C. 4112.05(B)(7), that a complaint by OCRC \u201cshall be so issued within one year after the complainant filed the charge,\u201d is mandatory or directory. Consequently, this court should apply the rule of statutory construction set forth in <em>Farrar </em>and <em>Bamell, </em>not <em>Dorrian. </em>See <em>In re Davis, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 522, 705 N.E.2d 1219; <em>Webb, </em>10 Ohio St.3d at 31, 10 OBR 178, 460 N.E.2d 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">{\u00b6 20} Applying <em>Farrar </em>and <em>Bamell </em>to the statutory language at issue, that a complaint \u201cshall\u201d be issued within one year of the claimant\u2019s charge, the time requirement is mandatory only if R.C. 4112.05, or related statutory language, evinces a purpose to limit the authority of OCRC to issue a complaint beyond the one-year period. See <em>Bellman, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 210, 714 N.E.2d 381. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>no such language to be found anywhere in R.C. Chapter 4112. In fact, this legislation is completely silent on the consequences of OCRC\u2019s failure to issue a complaint within the one-year period. Thus, there is no clear legislative intent that the one-year period set forth in R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) was intended to limit the authority of OCRC to act beyond that time. The legislature failed to specify any consequences for a late filing, which certainly suggests that it did not intend a late filing to lead to dismissal of the complaint. See <em>Bellman, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 210, 714 N.E.2d 381 (contrasting statutory speedy-trial requirements that explicitly state that dismissal is a consequence of noncompliance with the time requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 21} In addition to the language used in a statute, the character of a given statute may also be determined by consideration of \u201cthe nature, context and object of the statute\u201d and \u201cthe consequences of the various constructions.\u201d <em>Farrar, </em>146 Ohio St. at 473, 32 O.O. 542, 66 N.E.2d 531; <em>Barnell, </em>109 Ohio St. at 259, 142 N.E. 611. See, also, <em>In re Davis, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 522-523, 705 N.E.2d 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 4112.08 provides that R.C. Chapter 4112 \u201cshall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes.\u201d R.C. 4112.05(A) provides that the OCRC \u201cshall prevent any person from engaging in unlawful discriminatory practices, provided that, before instituting the formal hearing authorized by division (B) of this section, it shall attempt, by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion, to induce compliance with this chapter.\u201d The purpose of R.C. Chapter 4112 is to protect victims of discrimination. See <em>Helmick v. Cincinnati Word Processing, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 131, 543 N.E.2d 1212, paragraph one of the syllabus. OCRC was entrusted with the duty of investigating and remedying the Williamses\u2019 claim that they had been the victims of unlawful discrimination, on behalf of the Williamses and the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 23} The purpose of R.C. Chapter 4112 would clearly be thwarted if the failure of OCRC to pursue remedies on behalf of alleged victims in a timely manner would always lead to dismissal of the complaint. In <em>Brock v. Pierce Cty. </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 253, 260, 106 S.Ct. 1834, 90 L.Ed.2d 248, the United States Supreme Court noted, when construing similar language in a federal statute:</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cWe would be most reluctant to conclude that every failure of an agency to observe a procedural requirement voids subsequent agency action, especially when important public rights are at stake. When, as here, there are less drastic remedies available for failure to meet a statutory deadline, courts should not assume that Congress intended the agency to lose its power to act.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>{\u00b6 25} The District of Columbia Court of Appeals construed the word \u201cshall\u201d in a similar statute to be directory. <em>JBG Properties, Inc. v. Dist. of Columbia Office of Human Rights </em>(D.C.App.1976), 364 A.2d 1183, 1186. The court focused on the purpose of Human Rights Law in the District of Columbia, to aid both the individual claimant and the public at large in ending employment discrimination, and quoted a passage from 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (3d Ed.Rev. 1973) 443-444, Section 57.19:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c \u2018[F]or obvious reasons founded in fairness and justice, time provisions are often found to be directory merely, where a mandatory construction might do great injury to persons not at fault, as in a case where slight delay on the part of a public officer might prejudice private rights or the public interest. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cFor the reason that individuals or the public should not be made to suffer for the dereliction of public officers, provisions regulating the duties of public officers and specifying the time for their performance are in that regard generally directory. A statute specifying a time within which a public officer is to perform an official act regarding the rights and duties of others is directory unless the nature of the act to be performed, or the phraseology of the statute, is such that the designation of time must be considered a limitation of the power of the officer. [Footnotes omitted.]\u2019 \u201d Id. at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 28} No one disputes that the Williamses filed their charge with OCRC within the time limits set forth in R.C. 4112.05(B)(1), the limitations period set forth for claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 29} The majority is concerned that defendants will be unduly burdened if the one-year time period of R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) is not construed as a statute of limitations. \u201c[I]t is not insignificant that the section is not in any way the typical limitation imposed on the plaintiffs to ensure that they expeditiously pursue their claims and to protect defendants against stale claims.\u201d <em>West Virginia Human Rights Comm. v. Garretson </em>(1996), 196 W.Va. 118, 125, 468 S.E.2d 733 (construing a similar provision in a West Virginia state statute). The Williamses timely filed their charge with OCRC, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development notified the defendant, Countrywide Home Loans, within a few weeks. Any concerns that OCRC will be filing complaints years after the alleged discriminatory conduct occurred, thereby prejudicing defendants are unfounded. OCRC has an incentive to prosecute claims in a timely manner because it does not want its evidence to become stale any more than defendants do.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">{\u00b6 30} In addition to thwarting the purpose of the statute, the consequence of the majority\u2019s construing this language as mandatory is that claimants will be deprived of due process whenever OCRC fails to timely issue complaints. In <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co. </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 422, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265, the United States Supreme Court held that a claimant who timely filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>charge under the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Act had a property interest in the statutory procedures and that he could not be deprived of those procedures simply because the state agency had failed to meet a filing deadline. I can see no sound legal basis to distinguish the due process argument raised in <em>Logan </em>from the argument raised by the Williamses here. It is a well-settled principle of statutory construction that courts should liberally construe a statute to save it from constitutional infirmities. <em>State v. Sinito </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 98, 101, 72 O.O.2d 54, 330 N.E.2d 896. Consequently, the word \u201cshall\u201d as it is used in R.C. 4112.05(B)(7) must be construed as directory.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Arx\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, Douglas R.

See, e.g., <em>Housing Opportunities Made Equal, Inc. v.
