For the reasons that follow, we reject them. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and compared his sentence to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 2} Around 9:00 p.m. on May 13, 1987, William and Juanita Leeman returned to their home in Springfield Township in Hamilton County, Ohio. Once inside, William Leeman confronted a burglar, who proceeded to kill 55-year-old William and 53-year-old Juanita with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">{\u00b6 3} These murders went unsolved for ten years. In August 1997, Larry Hughbanks, the defendant\u2019s brother, and Gary Hughbanks Sr., the defendant\u2019s father, informed police that Hughbanks had murdered the Leemans.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">{\u00b6 4} Hughbanks was tried and convicted of the aggravated murders of the Leemans and sentenced to death. To establish Hughbanks\u2019s guilt, the state introduced a confession, testimony that Hughbanks\u2019s accurately described the layout of the Leeman home and the Leemans\u2019 personal property, and two of Hughbanks\u2019s knives, which were linked to the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">{\u00b6 5} Hughbanks had gone to the Leeman home during the evening of May 13, 1987, to commit burglary. After looking through the windows to ensure that no one was home, Hughbanks broke in through a back window. Hughbanks went to the master bedroom and took William\u2019s wallet and jewelry from the dresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">{\u00b6 6} When the Leemans came into the house, William confronted Hughbanks in a bedroom. Hughbanks attacked William with a knife, stabbed him repeatedly, and then slit his throat. According to Hughbanks\u2019s confession, the attack was over in \u201ca matter of seconds.\u201d After Hughbanks slit William\u2019s throat, he chased Juanita into the living room, grabbed her, and slit her throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">{\u00b6 7} Hughbanks washed in the bathroom and left a bloody hand towel in the sink. He then left the house through the back door, ran through the back yard into adjoining woods, and traveled along a creek to a nearby school. Hughbanks was gone by the time police officers arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">{\u00b6 8} After being attacked, Juanita stumbled out the front door of her home. While bleeding profusely, she somehow moved from the patio to the driveway, then down the driveway, before collapsing near the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>{\u00b6 9} At approximately 9:25 p.m. that evening, Police Officer Pat Kemper was driving his patrol car when he saw someone lying on the driveway at the Leemans\u2019 house \u201cwaving [her] arm in a real slow motion * * * to get attention.\u201d Kemper noticed that the person was covered in blood. Upon stopping, Kemper asked, \u201cWho did this to you[?]\u201d Juanita was conscious, but when she started to talk, \u201cblood was gurgling out of her throat, and the whole side of her face just fell open * * *.\u201d Juanita died of her injuries at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 10} Police officers entered the Leemans\u2019 house and found William\u2019s body in the master bedroom. There were signs of a violent struggle; part of the bedroom wall was bashed in, a lamp was turned over, and blood was smeared on the wall. There was a pool of blood on the carpet between the bed and the wall and a pool of blood under William\u2019s head. The telephone cord had been cut, and open dresser drawers appeared to have been searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 11} A \u201clarge puddle of blood\u201d on the living room carpet indicated where Juanita had been attacked. A trail of blood leading out the front door, onto the front porch, and down the driveway showed Juanita\u2019s line of travel after the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 12} Blood smears on an unlocked back screen door suggested that the killer had left that way. On the day after the murders, a police bloodhound tracked the killer\u2019s scent using the hand towel Hughbanks had left in the sink. The bloodhound followed the scent out the back door, down a hill, and into the creek that borders the Leemans\u2019 back yard. The bloodhound then traveled along the creek for a quarter of a mile before losing the scent near a neighborhood school.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 13} The police investigation did not uncover any trace evidence, hair fibers, or fingerprints that could identify the killer. Between May 1987 and August 1997, the police checked out \u201chundreds of leads,\u201d but the killer remained unidentified.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">{\u00b6 14} During the summer of 1997, Larry Hughbanks told the police that Gary Hughbanks Jr., his brother, had killed the Leemans. Larry told police that Hughbanks was living in Arizona, but that before leaving, Hughbanks had said, \u201c[I] did it, and * * * threw the knife in some woods.\u201d Gary Hughbanks Sr., the defendant\u2019s father, soon thereafter went to the police station \u201cto talk * * * about his son murdering the Leemans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">{\u00b6 15} In August 1997, Larry and Gary Sr. met with John Jay, an investigator with the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and Mark Piepmeier, an assistant county prosecutor. Larry turned over a survival knife with a ball compass on the end of the handle. Larry said that Hughbanks \u201chad thrown that knife in a wooded area back in the early part of 1988 out in Amelia, Ohio, when they lived in a trailer.\u201d Gary Sr. also implicated Hughbanks in the Leeman murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Subsequent police interviews of Jerry Shaw, Hughbanks\u2019s uncle, and Howard Shaw, Hughbanks\u2019s cousin, resulted in additional information implicating Hughbanks as the Leemans\u2019 killer. Lisa Leggett, identified as Hughbanks\u2019s \u201cex-common-law wife,\u201d provided police with another survival knife with a ball compass on the handle that had belonged to Hughbanks. In May 1987, Leggett and Hughbanks had lived near the Leeman home. According to Leggett, the knife was \u201cleft behind by [Hughbanks] when they split.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 17} In September 1997, Tucson, Arizona police arrested Hughbanks. During a police interview on September 9, 1997, Hughbanks denied any involvement in the Leeman murders. Thereafter, Hughbanks remained in police custody in Arizona pending extradition to Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 18} Several days later, on September 16, 1997, Tucson police detectives interviewed Hughbanks again. Hughbanks admitted breaking into the Leemans\u2019 house and said that two accomplices had been with him during the burglary. Later, Hughbanks said that a fourth man might have also been at the scene. Hughbanks admitted confronting William in the bedroom after the Leemans arrived home but stated that an accomplice had stabbed William and cut his throat. Hughbanks stated that he did not know where Juanita had been and said that his accomplice had \u201cprobably got her first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 19} As Hughbanks\u2019s interview progressed, Hughbanks acknowledged telling his father, brother, and uncle, \u201cI killed somebody.\u201d Hughbanks then said, \u201cI went in to commit a burglary. I got scared. I fought with the guy. * * * And I probably ran after the woman and killed her, too.\u201d Hughbanks also admitted that he was by himself when he broke into the home and killed the Leemans. Hughbanks said that he had been \u201ccompletely surprised\u201d by William and had tried to \u201cget away from him in the bedroom.\u201d Hughbanks indicated that he \u201cprobably\u201d tried to get away by getting out the window, but said, \u201cI think he pulled me back.\u201d Hughbanks stated that he had killed the Leemans with a \u201cmilitary knife,\u201d which he had found in an \u201cammo box\u201d in the Leemans\u2019 bedroom closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b620} When asked about Juanita\u2019s location during her husband\u2019s murder, Hughbanks replied, \u201cProbably behind me, watching me, and then after I cut his throat, she took off running out of the house and I went after her.\u201d Hughbanks said that he caught her in the living room and added, \u201cI figured I cut her enough that she \u2014 she\u2019d bleed to death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 21} Hughbanks admitted that he had kept the knife with him when he fled the scene. Hughbanks stated that after he had left the Leemans\u2019 house, he ran towards the woods and creek behind the house. Hughbanks \u201cgot the blood off [himself] in the creek\u201d and then followed the creek to Greener School. Later, Hughbanks threw away the costume jewelry that he had taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>{\u00b6 22} The grand jury indicted Hughbanks on two counts of aggravated murder. Count 1 charged Hughbanks with the aggravated murder of William Leeman while committing burglary. Count 2 charged Hughbanks with the aggravated murder of Juanita Leeman while committing burglary. The grand jury also indicted Hughbanks for aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 23} Each count of aggravated murder contained three identical death penalty specifications: murder for the purpose of escaping detection or apprehension pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), murder as part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more people pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and, as the principal offender, murder while committing or attempting to commit aggravated burglary pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 24} At trial, Leonard Leeman, the victims\u2019 son, testified that to the best of his knowledge, Hughbanks did not know his parents and had never been inside their house prior to the murders. After reading Hughbanks\u2019s confession, Leonard testified that Hughbanks accurately described the white Formica breakfast bar in the kitchen, the presence of military photographs of the Leemans\u2019 children on the hallway wall, and the location of Afghans in the closet. Moreover, Hughbanks had accurately described the Leeman back yard, the hill leading to the creek, and the path to Greener Elementary School. However, Leonard testified that his parents had not kept any survival knives in their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 25} Detective Kemper pointed out that Hughbanks\u2019s confession accurately described the victims\u2019 wounds and where in the house the attacks took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 26} Dr. Lee Lehman, who was a deputy coroner for Hamilton County in 1987, performed autopsies on both victims. William had been stabbed 17 times. One stab wound was almost four and one-half inches deep. William died as the result of multiple stab wounds to his head, neck, thorax, and extremities.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">{\u00b6 27} Juanita had a \u201cnine-inch by four-inch area of criss-crossing cuts across her throat * * * [and] through the voice box, or larynx, which would prevent her from screaming or talking.\u201d Dr. Lehman concluded that Juanita had died from multiple stab wounds to her head, chest, neck, and extremities.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">{\u00b6 28} Dr. Lehman testified that all of these wounds were caused by a \u201cfairly heavy knife\u201d that was \u201cat least an inch or more in width, and * * * at least four inches in length.\u201d State\u2019s exhibits 45 and 46, the two knives recovered by police as possible murder weapons, were of a type that could have caused the wounds inflicted on the Leemans. Serological testing of the knives failed to reveal any trace of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">{\u00b6 29} At trial, the defense did not present any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">{\u00b6 30} The jury convicted Hughbanks as charged and recommended the death penalty. The trial court sentenced Hughbanks to death on each count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>aggravated murder and sentenced him to a prison term of 10 to 25 years for aggravated burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 31} The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences. The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\n<em>Pretrial issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 32} <em>Denial of Bond. </em>In his fifth proposition of law, Hughbanks contends that the trial court\u2019s denial of a reasonable bond prior to trial violated his constitutional right to assist counsel in the preparation of his defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 33} Section 9, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides: \u201cAll persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, except for a person who is charged with a capital offense where the proof is evident or the presumption great * * *.\u201d It is the trial court\u2019s role to determine whether a capital defendant should be admitted to bail. <em>State ex rel. Reams v. Stuart </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 314, 188 N.E. 393, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">{\u00b6 34} Hughbanks argues that the trial court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the proof or presumption warranted a denial of bail. However, Hughbanks never requested such a hearing and thereby waived this issue. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 752 N.E.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">{\u00b6 35} Moreover, following conviction, \u201cany error concerning the issue of pretrial bail is moot.\u201d <em>State v. Patterson </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 264, 271, 673 N.E.2d 1001. Thus, we overrule the fifth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">{\u00b6 36} <em>Funding of defense experts. </em>In his first proposition of law, Hughbanks claims that he was not provided with adequate funding for an expert on substance abuse, a coroner, or a crime-scene investigator. In his third and fourth propositions of law, Hughbanks claims that he was not provided with adequate funding for an independent pathologist or a neuropharmacologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>Ake v. Oklahoma </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 68, 74, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53, the United States Supreme Court held that the state must provide a psychiatric expert for the defense when the defendant has made a preliminary showing that his sanity will be a significant factor at the trial. Although <em>Ake </em>dealt only with a defendant\u2019s entitlement to a psychiatric expert, we have recognized that due process may require the state to provide other types of expert assistance to an indigent criminal defendant. <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 149, 694 N.E.2d 932. Moreover, R.C. 2929.024 requires the trial court to provide expert assistance when \u201creasonably necessary for the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>representation of a defendant charged with aggravated murder * * See <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 150, 749 N.E.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>Mason, </em>we held that the state must provide an indigent criminal defendant with funds to obtain expert assistance when the defendant has made a particularized showing that (1) there exists a reasonable probability that the requested expert would aid the defense and (2) denial of that expert assistance would result in an unfair trial. Whether the showing has been made is determined by the trial court in the exercise of its sound discretion. <em>Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 144, 694 N.E.2d 932, syllabus. See, also, Sup.R. 20(IV)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 39} We find that Hughbanks\u2019s claims in his first, third, and fourth propositions of law were waived. Hughbanks never requested that the trial court provide funds for an expert on substance abuse, a coroner, a crime-scene investigator, an independent pathologist, or a neuropharmacologist. The court \u201cneed not consider an error\u201d when the complaining party \u201ccould have called, but did not call\u201d the matter to the trial court\u2019s attention. <em>Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cNotice of plain error * * * is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus. Because there is no plain error, we conclude that the first, third, and fourth propositions of law lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 40} Hughbanks never requested funding for any of the five experts and never made a \u201cparticularized showing\u201d suggesting a \u201creasonable probability that the requested expert would aid\u201d in his defense as required by <em>Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 144, 694 N.E.2d 932, syllabus. Further, the facts, as discussed below, demonstrate that denial of the requested expert did not result in an unfair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 41} Despite a general assertion in the first proposition of law that Hugh-banks needed a crime-scene investigator, a coroner, and an expert on substance abuse, Hughbanks has not explained how these experts would have helped his defense. In the face of overwhelming evidence of Hughbanks\u2019s guilt, the defense strategy was to concede his guilt during the trial phase and to contest the appropriateness of a death sentence during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 42} Our review of the record shows a thorough, professional, and well-documented police investigation even though ten years had elapsed between the time of the murders and Hughbanks\u2019s identification as the murderer. Thus, the defense did not need a crime-scene investigator. Nor is there any reason to believe that an expert on substance abuse would have made any difference to the defense case. Further, since the cause of death was not an issue, it is unclear what value a coroner would have provided to the defense. Under these circumstances, we find that Hughbanks has failed to show a particularized need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>these experts and has not shown how the failure to employ these experts denied him a fair trial. See <em>State v. Nields </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 12, 752 N.E.2d 859 (need for an investigator, crime-scene investigator, and a coroner not established); <em>Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 63, 752 N.E.2d 904 (crime-scene investigator and general investigator not justified); <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 151, 749 N.E.2d 226 (investigator, crime-scene investigator, and a coroner not warranted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">{\u00b6 43} In his third proposition of law, Hughbanks makes the broad assertion that an \u201cindependent pathologist could have conducted his own investigation and testing.\u201d The coroner examined the victims, and the autopsies were thoroughly documented and photographed. There was no mystery about the cause, manner, or timing of the deaths. Hughbanks has failed to show a particularized need for this expert and has not shown that the lack of an independent pathologist resulted in an unfair trial. See <em>Nields, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 12, 752 N.E.2d 859 (need for an independent pathologist not established); <em>Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 63, 752 N.E.2d 904 (forensic pathologist not justified); <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 151, 749 N.E.2d 226 (independent pathologist not required).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 44} In his fourth proposition of law, Hughbanks claims that a neuropharmacologist could have conducted an analysis and provided an opinion on the effects of his alcohol and drug consumption at the time of his confession. However, Hughbanks\u2019s confession to police on September 16, 1997, was made after he had been in continuous police custody for one week. Moreover, nothing indicates that Hughbanks was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of his confession, and he denied having taken \u201cany drugs or medication that morning.\u201d Thus, a neuropharmacologist would not have helped the defense. Since counsel at trial never suggested that they needed further assistance from a neuropharmacologist, no \u201cparticularized showing\u201d was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">{\u00b6 45} Hughbanks also claims that a neuropharmacologist could have presented mitigating evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration during the penalty phase although he fails to specify the nature of such evidence. Again, this claim is speculative. Moreover, the trial court provided Hughbanks with funds for a neuropsychologist, and two psychiatrists testified as defense witnesses during mitigation. These experts could have advised the defense counsel about how drugs and alcohol had affected Hughbanks\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">{\u00b6 46} Counsel had \u201calternative devices that would fulfill the same functions as the expert assistance sought.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph four of the syllabus. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 284, 288-289, 574 N.E.2d 510 (pharmacologist not justified because several mental health professionals appointed by the court could explain how drugs and alcohol affected the defendant); <em>Nields, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 12, 752 N.E.2d 859 (need for a neuropharmacologist not established because other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>experts were available); <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 151, 749 N.E.2d 226 (neuropharmacologist not required because defense had already allotted funds for a forensic psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">{\u00b6 47} As an alternative argument in his third and fourth propositions of law, Hughbanks claims that his counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request funds for such professionals. Reversal of convictions on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">{\u00b6 48} However, trial counsel were not deficient for failing to make such requests because the trial court would have had no basis to grant the motions, as discussed. See <em>Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 68, 752 N.E.2d 904 (failure to request funds to hire an investigator not ineffective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">{\u00b6 49} Based on the foregoing, we reject the first, third, and fourth propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 50} <em>Voluntariness. </em>In his tenth proposition of law, Hughbanks argues that the waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and his statements and confessions to the police were involuntary. Hughbanks claims that because police were aware of his psychiatric problems and drug use, the police were obligated to have him evaluated by a competent mental health professional before advising him of his rights and interviewing him. Alternatively, Hughbanks argues that the police should have, sua sponte, provided him with a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b6 51} On September 9, 1997, Detective Kemper and William Fletcher, an investigator with the Hamilton County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, interviewed Hugh-banks while he was in police custody in Tucson. Fletcher advised Hughbanks of his <em>Miranda </em>rights before beginning the interview. Hughbanks also read a copy of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and signed a written waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">{\u00b6 52} In response to a question asked by Fletcher, Hughbanks denied taking any drugs or medication on the morning of the interview. Moreover, Fletcher observed nothing in Hughbanks\u2019s comments or behavior that led him to believe that Hughbanks was under the influence of drugs or alcohol during the interview. When asked about his mental history, Hughbanks told Fletcher that he had \u201cconferred with a psychiatrist off and on\u201d over a number of years. Hughbanks stated that Dr. Bernard DeSilva, a psychiatrist from Cincinnati, had treated him. Police did not attempt to call Dr. DeSilva before completing their interview. The police interview lasted several hours; Hughbanks denied any involvement in the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>{\u00b6 53} Following this initial interview, a Tucson detective, Millstone, administered a polygraph examination to Hughbanks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The detective advised Hugh-banks of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and obtained Hughbanks\u2019s consent to take the polygraph prior to the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 54} During the polygraph examination, Hughbanks denied committing the murders. However, results of Hughbanks\u2019s polygraph were inconclusive because of his lack of physiological response. According to the detective, Hughbanks showed \u201cvery little reaction to anything in the galvanic skin response, the pulse, blood pressure readings. Everything was very, very flat which is consistent with drug use.\u201d Hughbanks said that he had injected crystal methamphetamine into his body that morning and showed Millstone a small bruise on his inner arm that was the injection site.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">{\u00b6 55} After the September 9 polygraph test, Hughbanks remained in Tucson in police custody pending extradition to Ohio for the murders. On September 16, 1997, at the request of Hamilton County authorities, Tucson detectives sought to give another polygraph test to Hughbanks. Hughbanks waived his rights and signed a consent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6 56} During the pretest interview, Hughbanks stated that he was in good physical condition and had slept well the previous evening, having gotten eight or nine hours of sleep. Hughbanks disclosed that he- had been treated by Dr. DeSilva for severe depression and a bipolar disorder. He also stated that he had been an inpatient at psychiatric hospitals \u201cseveral different times\u201d over a 15-year period, the last time being six or seven years earlier. Hughbanks told the polygraph administrator that he had been prescribed Lithium, Zoloft, and Trazadone to treat his mqntal condition but had discontinued taking medication about two years before. Hughbanks also stated that he had not been receiving psychiatric care during the previous year.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 57} To the polygraph administrator, Hughbanks \u201cappeared to be normal * * * that day. He said he hadn\u2019t taken drugs recently or in the past 24 hours.\u201d Another detective present during the polygraph examination agreed that Hugh-banks did not appear to be high or under the influence of any drugs. The detectives made no attempt to contact a psychiatrist about Hughbanks\u2019s mental condition prior to administering the polygraph examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">{\u00b6 58} Polygraph test results showed that Hughbanks was deceptive, and detectives confronted Hughbanks with the test results. Hughbanks eventually admitted that he had committed the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>{\u00b6 59} A court, in determining whether a pretrial statement is involuntary, \u201cshould consider the totality of the circumstances, including the age, mentality, and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, intensity, and frequency of interrogation; the existence of physical deprivation or mistreatment; and the existence of threat or inducement.\u201d <em>Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 154, 694 N.E.2d 932, quoting <em>State v. Edwards </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 31, 3 O.O.3d 18, 358 N.E.2d 1051, paragraph two of the syllabus. The same considerations apply to whether Hughbanks voluntarily waived his rights. <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 366, 738 N.E.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 60} Hughbanks acknowledges that he was advised of his rights and waived those rights before making a statement to the police. However, Hughbanks contends that prior to questioning, the police failed to consult a psychiatrist to find out whether his decision to waive his rights and answer police questions was \u201ctruly voluntary.\u201d Alternatively, Hughbanks claims that the police should have, sua sponte, found a lawyer to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">{\u00b6 61} A defendant\u2019s mental condition is but one factor in the totality of circumstances to be considered in determining voluntariness. A defendant\u2019s mental condition may be a \u201csignificant factor in the \u2018voluntariness\u2019 calculus. But this fact does not justify a conclusion that a defendant\u2019s mental condition, by itself and apart from its relation to official coercion, should ever dispose of the inquiry into constitutional \u2018voluntariness.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Colorado v. Connelly </em>(1986), 479 U.S. 157, 164, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473. See <em>State v. Clark </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 261, 527 N.E.2d 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 62} The police officers were not required to consult a psychiatrist or have Hughbanks evaluated by a psychiatrist to ensure that his waiver of rights and his statements were the product of his free will. <em>Connelly </em>rejected the premise that voluntariness of a confession depended on notions of \u201cfree will.\u201d <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. at 170, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473. Rather, \u201cvoluntariness * * * has always depended on the absence of police overreaching, not on \u2018free choice\u2019 in any broader sense of the word.\u201d Id. See <em>Coe v. Bell </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 161 F.3d 320, 341; <em>United States v. Santos </em>(C.A.1,1997), 131 F.3d 16,19.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">{\u00b6 63} The police officers never subjected Hughbanks to threats or physical abuse or deprived him of food, sleep, or medical treatment. Moreover, the police interview and polygraph testing of Hughbanks on September 16 lasted only several hours. We find no evidence of police coercion or overreaching that might show Hughbanks\u2019s confession to be involuntary. See <em>State v. Eley </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 174, 178, 672 N.E.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 64} Hughbanks\u2019s disclosures about his mental condition during the pretest interview on September 16 undermine his claim that his <em>Miranda </em>waiver and his subsequent confession were involuntary. During his pretest interview, Hugh-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>banks informed police that he had not been hospitalized for psychiatric treatment for several years, was no longer receiving psychiatric treatment, and had discontinued taking medication approximately two years earlier. Hughbanks\u2019s tape-recorded interview on September 16 indicates that he was alert and responsive to police questioning and that he was not suffering from any apparent mental problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 65} Finally, Hughbanks\u2019s injection of crystal methamphetamine prior to his first interview on September 9 did not affect the voluntariness of his September 16 confession. Hughbanks remained in police custody between September 9 and 16. The detectives who interviewed Hughbanks on September 16 stated that he appeared normal. Moreover, lines on charts from Hughbanks\u2019s polygraph examination on September 16 were \u201cno longer flat line, he was responsive [and] reacting to the questions.\u201d Hughbanks stated that he had not been taking any drugs recently or within the previous 24 hours. We find no evidence that Hughbanks\u2019s drug use on September 9 had any impact on the voluntariness of his confession or his waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights a week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">{\u00b6 66} In conclusion, the totality of the circumstances shows that Hughbanks voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that his confession to police was voluntary. Moreover, the police officers had no obligation, sua sponte, to supply Hughbanks with a lawyer or consult a psychiatrist prior to questioning him, nor did their failure to do so impact the voluntariness of his confession or the waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, we overrule the tenth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 67} In his 11th proposition of law, Hughbanks argues that his counsel were ineffective by litigating the motion to suppress his pretrial confession without the assistance of supportive psychiatric testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 68} Hughbanks contends that his motion attacking the voluntariness of his confession or the waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d without supportive expert testimony about his mental condition at the time he waived his rights and provided his confession to the police. Hughbanks suggests that his counsel could have called Dr. DeSilva and Dr. Sagi Raju, two psychiatrists who testified for the defense during mitigation, to testify during the hearing on the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 69} We find that counsel\u2019s decision not to present psychiatric testimony during the hearing on the motion to suppress was not deficient performance pursuant to <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. As discussed in the tenth proposition of law, mental illness, absent coercive police activity, is not a sufficient basis for excluding Hughbanks\u2019s statement. The voluntariness of his statement depends on whether the police engaged in coercion and misconduct and not whether Hughbanks was mentally ill. See <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. at 164, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473. Neither Dr. DeSilva nor Dr. Raju <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>testified during mitigation that Hughbanks was incapable of making a voluntary-statement. Moreover, their description of Hughbanks\u2019s mental problems does not support a conclusion that he was unable to voluntarily make a statement or waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Therefore, we reject the 11th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\n<em>Trial issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">{\u00b6 70} <em>Gruesome photographs. </em>In his sixth proposition of law, Hughbanks argues that the trial court erred in admitting gruesome photographs of the victims. However, Hughbanks fails to specify what photographs were objectionable. The record shows that, over defense objection, the trial court admitted crime-scene photographs of William\u2019s body, three autopsy slides of William, and three autopsy slides of Juanita.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 71} In capital cases, nonrepetitive photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible as long as the probative value of the photographs outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257, 513 N.E.2d 267. 'Decisions on the admissibility of photographs are \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">{\u00b6 72} The crime-scene photographs showed different angles of William\u2019s body at the foot of his bed. These photos depicted the crime scene, illustrated the testimony of the detective at the scene, and helped to prove Hughbanks\u2019s intent. See <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 288, 754 N.E.2d 1150; <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 342, 703 N.E.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">{\u00b6 73} One autopsy photograph of William\u2019s torso shows where he had been stabbed. Two others present closeups of William\u2019s face and neck and show where his throat had been slit. Autopsy photographs of Juanita present closeups and different angles of her face and neck and show how her throat had been slit. These exhibits depicted the victims\u2019 wounds, illustrated the coroner\u2019s testimony on the cause of death, and helped prove Hughbanks\u2019s intent. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, \u00b6 36; <em>Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 158, 694 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">{\u00b6 74} We find that the trial court could have reasonably found that the probative value of each photograph and autopsy slide outweighed any prejudicial impact on the jury. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these photographs and autopsy slides. We reject the sixth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">{\u00b6 75} <em>Sufficiency and weight of the evidence. </em>In his second proposition of law, Hughbanks challenges both the sufficiency and the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>{\u00b6 76} In reviewing a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259-260, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 77} Hughbanks provides no explanation on how the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt. At trial, Hughbanks offered no defense to the charges and conceded his guilt. Indeed, the defense counsel informed the jury, \u201c[YJou\u2019re not going to have any trouble with a guilty verdict on this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 78} Hughbanks\u2019s confession to the police, his confession to family members, and other corroborating evidence strongly support the jury\u2019s verdict. Hugh-banks\u2019s confession accurately described the layout of the Leemans\u2019 house, the location of personal property found inside, and the locations where the attacks took place. Moreover, two of Hughbanks\u2019s survival knives, one of which was the probable murder weapon, were introduced into evidence. Thus, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hugh-banks murdered the Leemans during a burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 79} Finally, we reject Hughbanks\u2019s contention that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. \u201cPursuant to R.C. 2953.02, we can overturn a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence in a capital case, but only where the crime was committed after January 1, 1995.\u201d <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 254, 750 N.E.2d 90; see, also, <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b683. The Leemans were murdered in May 1987. Based on the foregoing, we reject the second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">{\u00b6 80} <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In his 12th proposition of law, Hughbanks argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to call as witnesses his family members who had implicated him in the murders. Hughbanks claims that they should have been subject to cross-examination. We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">{\u00b6 81} First, Hughbanks has not supported his claim that the failure to call family members represents deficient performance, as required by <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. The totality of the record before us indicates that the testimony of family members would have only underscored Hughbanks\u2019s guilt. Detective Kemper testified that Larry Hughbanks had told police that Hughbanks admitted killing the Leemans. Investigator Jay testified that Larry provided police with Hughbanks\u2019s survival knife that was introduced as a possible murder weapon. According to other testimony, Hughbanks\u2019s father, uncle, and cousin provided information to the police implicating Hughbanks in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Leeman murders. Additional testimony indicated that Lisa Leggett, Hugh-banks\u2019s \u201cex-common-law wife,\u201d provided police with a survival knife that Hugh-banks owned, as another possible murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cGenerally, counsel\u2019s decision whether to call a witness falls within the rubric of trial strategy and will not be second-guessed by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749; see, also, <em>State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, \u00b6 118. Trial counsel\u2019s decision not to call any family members as witnesses was reasonable given that Hughbanks\u2019s confession had already been introduced at trial and given the fact that that testimony would have been repetitive. Moreover, the trial counsel informed the court that the defense was not calling any family members as witnesses, as a matter of \u201ctrial strategy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 83} We also conclude that the decision to forgo calling family members was not prejudicial. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Such testimony would likely have strengthened the state\u2019s case, since the jury would have viewed Hughbanks\u2019s confession to family members as overwhelming evidence of his guilt. We conclude that Hughbanks\u2019s counsel were not ineffective. <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. We reject the 12th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\n<em>Penalty phase issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">{\u00b6 84} <em>Other acts. </em>In his 13th proposition of law, Hughbanks argues that he was denied a fair trial when the prosecutor was allowed to cross-examine a defense psychiatrist during the penalty phase about Hughbanks\u2019s previous imprisonment, his domestic violence, and his failure to support his children. Hugh-banks claims that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination elicited \u201cother acts\u201d testimony prohibited by Evid.R. 404(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">{\u00b6 85} During the penalty phase, the defense presented the videotaped testimony of Dr. DeSilva, a defense psychiatrist. Dr. DeSilva testified that he had diagnosed Hughbanks with a \u201c[s]chizoaffective disorder\u201d and a \u201cbipolar disorder.\u201d Dr. DeSilva discussed Hughbanks\u2019s family history of mental disorders, the drugs prescribed to treat Hughbanks\u2019s mental problems, and Hughbanks\u2019s hospitalization for mental problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">{\u00b6 86} On direct examination, Dr. DeSilva testified that Hughbanks\u2019s bipolar illness was \u201cinherent\u201d and not caused by his \u201cdrug use alone.\u201d Dr. DeSilva also testified that Hughbanks\u2019s suicide attempts, delusions, and hallucinations were not simply a function of his drug use or alcohol abuse because \u201cthe symptoms persist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">{\u00b6 87} During cross-examination, Dr. DeSilva testified that he would expect Hughbanks\u2019s aberrant and unpredictable behavior to continue even after he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>ceased to consume alcohol and drugs for a long period of time. Over objection, the prosecution asked Dr. DeSilva, \u201cAre you aware he\u2019s been incarcerated on several occasions in the past?\u201d Dr. DeSilva mentioned that he was aware of a prior DUI and stated, \u201cI think once [Hughbanks] was in prison, yes, sir.\u201d The prosecutor then asked Dr. DeSilva, \u201cAre you aware of him having any major difficulties like this in prison when he\u2019s off of this alcohol and drugs?\u201d Dr. DeSilva replied that he did not have any knowledge about Hughbanks\u2019s behavior in confinement. Over further objection, Dr. DeSilva was asked whether he was aware that Hughbanks had been incarcerated for approximately nine months while awaiting trial. Dr. DeSilva answered, \u201cYes.\u201d The prosecutor then asked, \u201cAre you aware of any major problems he\u2019s had while incarcerated, * * * this bipolar disorder rearing its ugly head and causing him to act out of character?\u201d Dr. DeSilva replied, \u201cI have not been informed of anything of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 88} Evid.R. 611(B) provides that cross-examination shall be permitted on all relevant matters and on matters affecting credibility. \u201cThe limitation of * * * cross-examination lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, viewed in relation to the particular facts of the case. Such exercise of discretion will not be disturbed in the absence of a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Acre </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 140, 145, 6 OBR 197, 451 N.E.2d 802; <em>Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 480, 739 N.E.2d 749. Moreover, Evid.R. 705 permits the court, the jury, and adverse counsel to know what facts or data in evidence form the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">{\u00b6 89} Dr. DeSilva\u2019s testimony that Hughbanks\u2019s mental disorder was \u201cinherent\u201d and that his aberrant behavior, delusions, and hallucinations could not be explained by drug and alcohol abuse alone opened the door to cross-examination testing this conclusion. See <em>State v. Noting, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b6 98; <em>Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 263, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768 (\u201c[a] witness may be properly cross-examined as to all relevant facts developed by the examination in chief\u2019). Thus, the state could properly cross-examine Dr. DeSilva about Hughbanks\u2019s behavior in the controlled setting of a prison environment, after the effect of drugs or alcohol had worn off. See <em>State v. Gowdy </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 387, 396, 727 N.E.2d 579. Dr. Nancy Schmidtgoessling, a psychologist, testified on rebuttal that she interviewed Hughbanks after he had been incarcerated for a couple of months and that \u201cnothing\u201d suggested that \u201cthere was anything wrong with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">{\u00b6 90} On direct examination, Dr. DeSilva described problems between Hugh-banks and other family members. Dr. DeSilva described a fight where Hugh-banks\u2019s mother \u201cstruck him in the face * * * to control his behavior at the time. * * * And then he tried to hurt her in return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>{\u00b6 91} Dr. DeSilva was cross-examined regarding his conversations with a clinic\u2019s personnel about Hughbanks\u2019s diagnosis. The prosecutor asked Dr. DeSilva whether there was an \u201cindication of homicidal threats and that he\u2019s not violent or dangerous?\u201d Dr. DeSilva answered, \u201cIn my office, the time I seen [sic] him, he has never been violent, never dangerous, never any homicidal threat.\u201d Over defense objection, the prosecutor then asked, \u201cHow about domestic violence convictions, are you aware of that?\u201d Dr. DeSilva replied, \u201c[T]here was domestic violence, I was aware of at different times, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 92} The defense opened the door to cross-examining Dr. DeSilva about domestic violence, since Dr. DeSilva mentioned during direct examination that Hughbanks had struck his mother. See <em>Gowdy, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 395, 727 N.E.2d 579. Moreover, cross-examination about Dr. DeSilva\u2019s awareness of Hughbanks\u2019s domestic violence convictions was relevant to Dr. DeSilva\u2019s comment that Hugh-banks was not violent or dangerous. Evid.R. 611(B) and 705. See <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 335, 738 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 93} During this cross-examination, the prosecutor inquired about Hugh-banks\u2019s relationship with his children. At one point, the prosecutor asked whether Hughbanks had \u201chad any interaction with them or supported them in any fashion}.]\u201d Dr. DeSilva replied that Hughbanks had tried to support his children and \u201cwas unhappy that he couldn\u2019t do anything more for the children.\u201d In a followup question, the prosecutor asked, \u201cDid [Hughbanks] ever, to your knowledge, manifest that in anyway by supporting them or getting a job to try to support them * * *?\u201d Dr. DeSilva replied, \u201cHe tried. He was * * * not the world\u2019s best person at holding a job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">{\u00b6 94} Because Hughbanks failed to object at trial to evidence about his failing to provide child support, he waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus. See Crim.R. 15(G) (\u201cObjections to receiving in evidence a deposition or a part thereof shall be made as provided in civil actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">{\u00b6 95} The cross-examination of Dr. DeSilva about Hughbanks\u2019s failure to provide child support was irrelevant and tended to portray Hughbanks in a negative light. Nevertheless, we find that it did not result in outcome-determinative plain error. Dr. DeSilva\u2019s reference to Hughbanks\u2019s child support was isolated and of minor significance given the gravity of the offenses charged against Hughbanks. See <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 161, 749 N.E.2d 226 (erroneous admission of defendant\u2019s failure to provide child support deemed harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">{\u00b6 96} Based on the foregoing, we reject the 13th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">{\u00b6 97} <em>Cross-examination of expert witness. </em>In his 14th proposition of law, Hughbanks claims that the prosecutor improperly cross-examined Dr. DeSilva <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>during the penalty phase by asking him whether Hughbanks met the legal definition of insanity at the time of the murders. Hughbanks did not object to this testimony at trial and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b6 98} During cross-examination at the penalty phase, Dr. DeSilva was asked, \u201cAre you familiar with the guidelines in Ohio for insanity, and one of the guidelines is your inability to conform your acts to the law?\u201d Dr. DeSilva replied, \u2018Yes, it\u2019s a legal guideline.\u201d Dr. DeSilva was then asked, \u201cAnd are you aware that he was actually recently examined by Dr. Schmidtgoessling for that very subject * * *?\u201d Dr. DeSilva said that he was \u201cnot aware of that.\u201d Following this exchange, Dr. DeSilva was asked, \u201cAre you aware that Dr. Schmidtgoessling\u2019s finding was that there\u2019s nothing at all to suggest during the time of this offense * * * that the defendant was suffering from any type of mental disease or defect, or that he was unable to know the wrongfulness of his alleged acts?\u201d Dr. DeSilva said, \u201c[Tjhat\u2019s not what we discussed * * * and * * * if she made that statement, I would say that statement is not quite accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 99} Hughbanks argues that the prosecution improperly cross-examined Dr. DeSilva about Hughbanks, since sanity was not at issue during the penalty phase. We reject this argument. Hughbanks raised his mental disorder as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor. Thus, cross-examination of Dr. DeSilva about Hughbanks\u2019s sanity was relevant, since the \u201cissues involved are similar: whether a \u2018mental disease or defect\u2019 existed and, if so, whether and to what degree it may have impaired his cognition and volition.\u201d <em>State v. Cooey </em>(1989) 46 Ohio St.3d 20, 33, 544 N.E.2d 895; see, also, <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 203, 661 N.E.2d 1068. Accordingly, we reject the 14th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">{\u00b6 100} <em>Jury verdict as a recommendation. </em>In his 15th proposition of law, Hughbanks claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions violated <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi </em>(1985), 472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231, by indicating that the jury\u2019s verdict was merely a recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 101} Before voir dire and over defense objection, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201cin the sentencing phase, * * * you\u2019ll hear information, you\u2019ll deliberate, and basically you will come back to me, the Court, and tell me the sentencing recommendation. But please understand, we use that word, recommendation, but whatever sentencing recommendation that you give me will be the sentencing in regards to this particular case.\u201d The trial court\u2019s penalty-phase instructions stressed that the jury should \u201cassume that the recommendation shall be the sentence of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">{\u00b6 102} We have repeatedly rejected similar complaints alleging a <em>Caldwell </em>violation. See, e.g., <em>State v. Durr </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 93, 568 N.E.2d 674; <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 326-327, 686 N.E.2d 245. In this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>there was no <em>Caldwell </em>violation, since the trial court\u2019s instructions accurately stated the law, emphasized the jury\u2019s responsibility to impose a sentence, and did not induce reliance on the prospect of appellate review. See <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 109. We reject the 15th proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\n<em>Constitutional issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 103} In his seventh proposition of law, Hughbanks argues that requiring that mitigating factors be proven by a preponderance of the evidence violates the Ohio and United States Constitutions. His claim is without merit. <em>Delo v. Lashley </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 272, 275-276, 113 S.Ct. 1222, 122 L.Ed.2d 620. See <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 171, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264. In any event, the trial court instructed the jury during the penalty phase that \u201cthe State has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances * * * outweigh the factors in mitigation. Gary Hughbanks does not have any burden of proof.\u201d We reject the seventh proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 104} In his eighth proposition of law, Hughbanks challenges the trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt during the penalty phase of the trial. We summarily reject this challenge. See <em>State v. Goff </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 131-132, 694 N.E.2d 916; <em>Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 69, 752 N.E.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 105} In his ninth proposition of law, Hughbanks disputes the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes. We summarily reject this challenge. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 454, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 179, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\n<em>Independent Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 106} The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughbanks murdered William and Juanita Leeman to escape detection or apprehension pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(3), as a course of conduct pursuant to R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and, as the principal offender, while committing or attempting to commit aggravated burglary pursuant to.R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The trial court merged the (A)(3) and (A)(7) specifications prior to imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 107} Hughbanks called five mitigation witnesses, made an unsworn statement, and introduced documentary evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">{\u00b6 108} Dr. Raju treated Hughbanks when he was hospitalized for psychotic behavior in June 1986. Hughbanks \u201ccomplained about hearing voices and noises telling him to kill himself. And he also expressed] some homicidal thoughts.\u201d Hughbanks mentioned \u201cmultiple problems at home\u201d and admitted \u201cdrinking alcohol for the past month every day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>{\u00b6 109} During his hospitalization, Hughbanks expressed feelings of \u201chelplessness and hopelessness.\u201d He stated that he could not \u201ccontrol the fear of losing self control and hurting himself or somebody else.\u201d Hughbanks was hospitalized for 14 days and was treated with Lithium and Thorazine. Hughbanks\u2019s final diagnosis was that he suffered from a \u201cmajor affective disorder and bipolar disorder, which is of manic episode [and] drug and alcohol abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 110} Hughbanks was readmitted to the hospital in August 1986 following \u201can overdose of drugs that were prescribed to him.\u201d He was hospitalized for fewer than three days and was treated with \u201cpsychotropic medication as well as some medication for agitated behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 111} Dr. DeSilva treated Hughbanks for \u201cabout a five-year period\u201d during the 1980s. Dr. DeSilva also had treated Gary Sr. a couple of years prior to his treatment of Hughbanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 112} Gary Sr. was diagnosed and treated for a \u201cmixture of paranoid schizophrenia with some schizoaffective features.\u201d Gary Sr.\u2019s mental disorders resulted in his hospitalization on a couple of occasions during the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 113} Dr. DeSilva testified that Gary Sr.\u2019s illness had a \u201c[v]ery serious impact\u201d on his wife and children and that \u201che could never remember the relationship being very good * * Hughbanks was abused by his father and was sometimes \u201cbeaten\u201d or \u201cthreatened with beatings.\u201d Moreover, Gary Sr.\u2019s illness may have affected the defendant, since the diagnosis of schizophrenia \u201cruns in families. There is a genetic tendency and sometimes a familial augmentation [and] anywhere from three to five percent of the population is genetically prone to schizophrenia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 114} Hughbanks was diagnosed with a \u201c[s]chizoaffective disorder\u201d and \u201c[b]ipolar Type II\u201d illness with \u201cintermittent concomitant drug abuse and alcohol abuse.\u201d Hughbanks\u2019s bipolar disorder was identified by his \u201cvariations in mood * * * from a manic phase and then * * * fairly fast to the depressed phase.\u201d Dr. DeSilva testified that Hughbanks experienced hallucinations similar to his father\u2019s. Hughbanks saw \u201csomething very much like * * * what his father saw, * * * a red-eyed devil or a red-eyed man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">{\u00b6 115} Dr. DeSilva testified that \u201cmost of [Hughbanks\u2019s] hospitalizations and interventions were because of suicidal intent.\u201d Hughbanks \u201creally wanted to die * * * [since] he felt that he could not handle life as it was.\u201d Hughbanks was treated with Lithium, but he \u201ccould not stay on it long enough.\u201d He was also treated with Chloroform, Thorazine, and Antabuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-14\">{\u00b6 116} During cross-examination, Dr. DeSilva testified that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Hughbanks has an organic brain disorder or is mentally retarded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Dr. DeSilva stated that Hughbanks\u2019s bipolar disorder was responsible for his aberrant behavior, excessive reactions, and flamboyant statements. Dr. DeSilva testified that he would expect Hughbanks\u2019s aberrant behavior to continue even after he was off alcohol and drugs for a long period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 117} Under cross-examination, Dr. DeSilva disputed the diagnosis of a Dr. Feuss that Hughbanks suffered from an antisocial personality disorder and not from schizoaffective or bipolar disorders. Dr. DeSilva disagreed with Dr. Nancy Schmidtgoessling\u2019s findings that, at the time of the 1987 murders, Hughbanks was not suffering from any type of mental disease or defect and was able to appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts. Dr. DeSilva disagreed with Dr. Schmidtgoessling\u2019s diagnosis even though Dr. Schmidtgoessling\u2019s more recent evaluation of Hughbanks included intelligence tests and the MMPI-II. Intelligence testing showed that Hughbanks had a full-scale IQ of 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 118} Records show that Dr. DeSilva told the court clinic that Hughbanks was \u201ccrazy before he was born\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t competent to stand trial.\u201d However, Dr. DeSilva acknowledged that he had not seen Hughbanks in at least a year when he stated this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 119} Larry Kramer, Hughbanks\u2019s uncle, lived near the Hughbanks family while Hughbanks was growing up. Kramer and Gary Sr. also worked together. Kramer stated that the Hughbanks family \u201calways had financial problems\u201d and \u201c[m]any a time they would cook on a Coleman stove because their electricity would be turned off.\u201d However, Gary Sr. had a \u201cfancy for cars\u201d and would drive a nice car even if the family did not have enough to eat.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">{\u00b6 120} Dr. DeSilva treated Kramer for paranoid schizophrenia. Kramer introduced Gary Sr. to Dr. DeSilva, who treated Gary Sr. for his mental problems. Kramer felt that Hughbanks\u2019s mother also had a mental disorder. She experienced a \u201clot of depression,\u201d and she\u2019s \u201chad a very pitiful life.\u201d During cross-examination, Kramer testified that Hughbanks\u2019s mother loved Hughbanks very much, never physically abused him, and taught him the difference between right and wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">{\u00b6 121} Larketa Ann Hughbanks, Hughbanks\u2019s younger sister, grew up with Hughbanks and another brother. Larketa and her siblings had very few friends because if \u201c[Gary Sr.] didn\u2019t like them, of [sic] if he disapproved of them, they weren\u2019t to come back around.\u201d Gary Sr. often made Larketa and her siblings \u201cgo to bed at 5:30 in the afternoon or 6 o\u2019clock.\u201d Larketa and her brothers \u201cused to call him the Warden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">{\u00b6 122} Larketa testified that Hughbanks tried to kill himself on several occasions by taking an overdose of pills, slitting his wrist, and trying to jump off a balcony. Hughbanks also talked about hearing and seeing things. For example, Hughbanks once described seeing a black figure \u201cwith red piercing eyes.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Larketa stated that Hughbanks becomes \u201cvery irate\u201d and \u201cnot normal when he\u2019s not on his Lithium.\u201d However, \u201c[w]hen he\u2019s on the Lithium, he\u2019s very mellow. He can handle things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 123} Evangeline Hughbanks, the defendant\u2019s mother, was 16 years old when she married Gary Sr., who was then 15, in 1965. Evangeline had three children, including Hughbanks, who was born on August 29, 1966. Hughbanks was born with a \u201cruptured omphalocele, which is an open stomach.\u201d Hughbanks underwent surgery and was almost two months old before leaving the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 124} Evangeline testified that Gary Sr. was a \u201cvery abusive\u201d husband and used to beat her. Gary Sr. never physically abused Hughbanks or his siblings. Evangeline disciplined the children, including spanking them and using the belt on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 125} Larry Hughbanks, the defendant\u2019s younger brother, has had numerous legal problems. He has stolen guns, been sentenced as a pedophile, and spent approximately six years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">{\u00b6 126} In .making a final plea for Hughbanks, Evangeline said, \u201c[P]lease don\u2019t kill my son. It hasn\u2019t been easy for him, for me, for my children. Please don\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">{\u00b6 127} During cross-examination, Evangeline testified that Hughbanks had relationships with three women. He married Brenda Williams in August 1984, and their relationship lasted four months. Hughbanks next had a relationship with Lisa Vanselow, and \u201cthey had four children together.\u201d He then had a relationship with Kelly Richards, and they had a little boy. According to Evangeline, Hughbanks beat each of these women.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">{\u00b6 128} In his unsworn statement, Hughbanks told the jury, \u201c[Y]ou did the right thing in finding me guilty.\u201d He told the Leeman family, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it happened. I wish it would have never happened. And if my life being taken gives you comfort of your mother and father being gone, then so be it. It\u2019s out of my hands. I can\u2019t undo what\u2019s been done, and I will not beg for my life, because I don\u2019t deserve that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">{\u00b6 129} Further, Hughbanks stated, \u201cI have a mental illness, but I will not use that as the blame for what has happened.\u201d Finally, Hughbanks said, \u201cI was the only one that night, so you need not worry about anyone else being out there. I did this. And there\u2019s no, no excuse I can give in the world for saying that it was right. None.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">{\u00b6 130} <em>Rebuttal evidence. </em>Dr. Schmidtgoessling, a psychologist at the Community Diagnostic and Treatment Center, performed a sanity evaluation on Hughbanks. She interviewed Hughbanks, conducted psychological testing, an IQ test, and reviewed his jail records. During her initial interview of Hughbanks on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>November 24, 1997, he \u201crepeatedly stated * * * he had not done this offense.\u201d Dr. Schmidtgoessling testified that \u201c[h]e was very clear in his speech. He was very well organized in his thoughts. He did not appear to be particularly high in his mood or dejected. * * * [Tjhere was nothing to suggest that there was anything wrong with him.\u201d After conducting her evaluation, Dr. Schmidtgoessling concluded that Hughbanks was sane at the time of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 131} Dr. Schmidtgoessling visited Hughbanks on May.23 and May 29, 1998, just prior to his trial. Hughbanks stated \u201cthat he was not having any hallucinations, did not have any bizarre thoughts, his mood was stable.\u201d During these interviews, Hughbanks admitted committing the murders because he was frightened and angry. According to Dr. Schmidtgoessling, Hughbanks said that Mr. Leeman had put him in this position, \u201cthat is to say, he was caught inside this house accosted. And he said that\u2019s the reason he fought back and stabbed Mr. Leeman.\u201d Hughbanks explained that he killed Mrs. Leeman because \u201cshe had seen him and could identify him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 132} Dr. Schmidtgoessling diagnosed Hughbanks as having \u201csome sort of a mood disorder, a possible substance abuse and dependence, and a character disorder.\u201d She testified that other doctors may have diagnosed Hughbanks with more serious mental disorders while he was still under the influence of illicit drugs. However, Dr. Schmidtgoessling testified that Hughbanks was \u201cnot delusional, was not bizarre in thought. He said that he was stable at the time that these things happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 133} On cross-examination, Dr. Schmidtgoessling agreed that immediately before trial, Hughbanks was tearful, upset, and \u201crepeatedly stated that he was sorry he had done this.\u201d Dr. Schmidtgoessling also agreed that Hughbanks \u201cdoes much better in a structured environment, one in which there [are] no substances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\n<em>Sentence evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">{\u00b6 134} We find nothing in the nature and the circumstances of the offenses to be mitigating. Hughbanks murdered William Leeman after William surprised Hughbanks in the act of burglarizing the Leeman home. According to Hugh-banks\u2019s confession, he attempted to avert confrontation. Hughbanks explained that he killed William only after William tried to stop Hughbanks from fleeing. Hughbanks\u2019s explanation suggests that he was more a frightened burglar than a cold-blooded killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">{\u00b6 135} Hughbanks\u2019s explanation is not supported by other facts surrounding the murders. Hughbanks stabbed William 17 times and slit his throat. Moreover, Hughbanks did not flee after killing William. Instead, Hughbanks chased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Juanita Leeman as she tried to escape, and, after catching her, slit her throat. The facts establish two horrific murders that lack any mitigating features.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">{\u00b6 136} We find that Hughbanks\u2019s history and background provide some mitigating factors. Hughbanks was raised in an abusive and dysfunctional family. Moreover, Gary Sr.\u2019s financial problems had a serious impact on the family while Hughbanks was growing up.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 137} Mental illness affected many members of Hughbanks\u2019s family. His father was a paranoid schizophrenic, his mother suffered mental problems, and his uncle was treated for paranoid schizophrenia. Undoubtedly, the mental illness of these family members adversely affected Hughbanks\u2019s growth and development.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 138} Almost ten years passed between the murders and Hughbanks\u2019s arrest for the murders. During this time, Hughbanks was briefly married to one woman and lived with two other women. According to his mother, Hughbanks was the father of a number of children. Little information was disclosed about Hughbanks\u2019s work history between 1987 and 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 139} The following statutory mitigating factors are inapplicable here: R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (\u201cduress, coercion, or strong provocation\u201d), (B)(5) (lack of a criminal record), and (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 140} The R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) factor is entitled to some weight, since Hugh-banks was 20 years old at the time of the murders. See <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 431, 709 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 141} Hughbanks\u2019s mental illness does not qualify as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) factor. Dr. DeSilva diagnosed Hughbanks with a schizoaffective disorder and a bipolar disorder. Hughbanks\u2019s mental problems necessitated hospitalization in the 1980s prior to his commission of the Leeman murders. However, psychiatric testimony failed to establish that Hughbanks lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law at the time the murders were committed. Moreover, Dr. Schmidtgoessling insisted that Hughbanks suffered only from a personality disorder and substance abuse. See <em>State v. Allard </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 482, 502, 663 N.E.2d 1277 (bipolar disorder did not qualify as an R.C. 2929.04[B][3] factor absent testimony that the defendant lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law). There was no evidence that Hughbanks is mentally retarded; intelligence testing showed that he has an IQ of 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">{\u00b6 142} Nevertheless, we give considerable weight to Hughbanks\u2019s mental illness as another relevant mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). See <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 8-9, 564 N.E.2d 408 (lifelong mental illness involving psychotic lapses and paranoid ideation as one of the mitigating \u201cother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>factors\u201d). Moreover, Hughbanks\u2019s hospitalization and treatment for his psychiatric problems occurred near the time of the offenses in the 1980s. Hughbanks\u2019s mental condition may have improved; that fact would help to explain Dr. Schmidtgoessling\u2019s 1997 diagnosis and evaluation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ato\">Michael K. Allen, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Ronald W. Springman Jr., Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AKq\">Faulkner &amp; Tepe, L.L.P., A. Norman Aubin and Herbert E. Freeman, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 143} Hughbanks\u2019s expressions of remorse during his unsworn statement are entitled to weight under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). See <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 300, 731 N.E.2d 159; <em>State v. White </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 433, 456, 709 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 144} In summary, we find that Hughbanks\u2019s youth, his family background, his mental illness, and his remorse are entitled to some weight in mitigation. Even so, we conclude that the aggravating circumstances in each count outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Hughbanks\u2019s course of conduct in multiple killings during the course of burglarizing the Leeman home is a grave aggravating circumstance. Hughbanks\u2019s mitigating evidence pales in significance when compared with the aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 145} Finally, we find that the death sentence is proportionate when compared with other \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d murders. See <em>Tibbetts, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 174, 749 N.E.2d 226; <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 131, 734 N.E.2d 1237; <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 574, 715 N.E.2d 1144. The death sentence is also proportionate with the sentence imposed in other aggravated-burglary murders. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 423, 739 N.E.2d 300; <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 56, 630 N.E.2d 339; <em>State v.
