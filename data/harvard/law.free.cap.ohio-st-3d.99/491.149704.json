Foster of Dayton, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0001884, was admitted to the Ohio bar in November 1980. On October 7, 2002, relator, Butler County Bar Association, charged respondent with several violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline considered the cause on the parties\u2019 agreed stipulations and respondent\u2019s statement of mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">{\u00b6 2} The stipulations established that during antagonistic collection proceedings, respondent directed certain unprofessional e-mails and other correspon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>dence to the older brother of a pro se litigant. In an August 21, 2000 transmission, respondent threatened: \u2018Your dear little brother only serves to make my life more miserable. In turn, I will make his as miserable as possible.\u201d In a July 11, 2001 letter, he asked whether the brother\u2019s family had \u201cbeen * * * seriously inbreed [sic] in the last few generations\u201d and observed that the family\u2019s \u201cgene pool [was] in serious need of a filter, at best, or has been reduced to a gene pond.\u201d On July 13, 2001, respondent described the brother in a letter as an \u201canencephalic cretin\u201d with a \u201csingle operating brain cell\u201d whose \u201cbrain-dead ravings\u201d and \u201canal rantings\u201d were characteristic of the \u201clunatic fringe.\u201d Respondent also enjoined the brother: \u201cNext time you get your panties all in a wad, please copulate independently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 3} The parties stipulated and the panel found that this conduct, among some of respondent\u2019s other vilifications, violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6) (conduct that adversely reflects on an attorney\u2019s fitness to practice law), 7-101(A)(l) (failure to seek client\u2019s lawful objectives through reasonably available permissible means), and 7-102(A)(l) (legal action taken to harass or maliciously injure another).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 4} In recommending a sanction, the panel considered letters from the judiciary assuring that respondent ordinarily practiced in a professional and competent manner and that this episode was an isolated instance. The panel also considered that respondent had no prior disciplinary record and was willing to accept the consequences of his actions. However, the panel also expressed concern over respondent\u2019s lack of remorse and appreciation for the fact that he is bound by rules of civility and professionalism that the laity is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 5} The panel thus rejected the parties\u2019 suggestion that respondent receive a public reprimand and recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for six months, with the entire period stayed. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and its recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 6} We agree that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), 7-101(A)(1), and 7-102(A)(l). In <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Riebel </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 290, 292, 23 O.O.3d 279, 432 N.E.2d 165, where an attorney used offensive and abusive language against opposing counsel and his client, we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cIt is within the real meaning and intent of our Code of Professional Responsibility that lawyers should always be cognizant of the necessity for good manners, courtesy and discourse, both to client and other practitioners, as being part of our professional ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe zeal employed by an attorney in guarding the interests of his clients must always be tempered so as not to inject his personal feelings or display a demeanor that subjects parties to a proceeding or opposing counsel to certain indignities.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A90\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Gregory K. Pratt, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ar6E\">Mark S. Foster, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b621-3\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent\u2019s conduct might have been a reaction to aggressive behavior; as a lawyer, however, he is not permitted to respond in kind. \u201cPart of the role of an attorney is to remove himself from the emotions of the moment and provide objective counsel and representation to clients. To perform that role, attorneys must hold themselves to the highest standards of professionalism.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Jackson </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 386, 388, 704 N.E.2d 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">{\u00b6 10} In <em>Riebel </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>we issued the offending attorneys public reprimands. Here, however, because respondent\u2019s conduct displays a pattern of escalating abusive language, we consider the recommended six-month stayed sanction appropriate. Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months, but this sanction is stayed provided that he does not commit any other professional misconduct during the suspension period. If respondent violates this condition, the stay will be lifted and respondent will serve the entire six-month suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b621-6\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
