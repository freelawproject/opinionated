Lehtinen, M.D., and defendants-appellants Michael Mervart, M.D., and Michael West, M.D., all of whom were neurosurgeons, organized as a professional association under the name of Drs. Lehtinen, Mervart and West, Inc. (\u201cAssociation\u201d). The parties agree that the Association, also an appellant, was organized under the Professional Association Act, R.C. Chapter 1785, for the sole purpose of rendering medical services. Each physician owned one-third of the Association\u2019s stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">{\u00b6 3} Dr. Lehtinen died testate on December 28, 1997. It is undisputed that at the time of Dr. Lehtinen\u2019s death, no provision existed in the Association\u2019s articles of incorporation or in any other document to govern the disposition of a deceased shareholder\u2019s shares. Plaintiff-appellee, Patricia J. Lehtinen, is Dr. Lehtinen\u2019s surviving spouse and the executor of his estate. Appellee is not a licensed physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">{\u00b6 4} In the aftermath of Dr. Lehtinen\u2019s death, Dr. Mervart assured appellee that she would receive fair compensation for her late husband\u2019s interest in the Association. To that end, a financial evaluation of the corporation was prepared by the Association\u2019s accountant and presented at a shareholder\u2019s meeting held on January 16, 1998. According to the minutes of that meeting, it was the accountant\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe present fair market value of Dr. Lehtinen\u2019s interest was between $70,000 to $75,000.\u201d Also according to the minutes, it was decided that for the immediate future Drs. Mervart and West would draw only their normal salaries from the Association and that \u201c[ejxcess funds would be accumulated and disbursed to Pat Lehtinen towards the corporation buy-out of Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Lehtinen\u2019s interest.\u201d Three weeks later, the Association\u2019s accountant met with appellee and informed her of these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">{\u00b6 5} This plan was never implemented, however, and neither the Association nor Drs. Mervart and West made any payments to appellee toward the purchase of Dr. Lehtinen\u2019s interest. According to Dr. Mervart, the corporate officers were advised that \u201cwe were legally unable to disburse the assets of the corporation until [certain malpractice] lawsuits [that were pending against the Association] had been settled.\u201d Thus, \u201cwe were unable to [buy out Dr. Lehtinen\u2019s interest].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">{\u00b6 6} Drs. Mervart and West continued to practice under the Association\u2019s existing corporate name. In the Association\u2019s 1998 annual report to the Secretary of State, Dr. Mervart certified that as of June 30, 1998, all of the Association\u2019s shareholders, including \u201cDavid E. Lehtinen (deceased 12/28/97),\u201d were duly licensed to practice medicine in the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">{\u00b6 7} Meanwhile, without appellee\u2019s knowledge, Drs. Mervart and West were engaged in negotiations to sell the practice to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. According to Dr. Mervart, however, they were advised by an attorney not to dispose of the Association\u2019s assets. Whether and to what extent the corporate assets actually came under the ownership or control of the Cleveland Clinic is a source of contention between the parties. In any event, Drs. Mervart and West each withdrew a $20,000 year-end bonus from the Association in November 1998 and then entered into employment with the Cleveland Clinic on December 1, 1998. At that point, Drs. Mervart and West ceased performing services for the Association, which no longer had any employees, and leased the Association\u2019s offices and equipment to the Cleveland Clinic. The Association was not liquidated, however, and Drs. Mervart and West continued to draw a salary from the Association as well as from the Cleveland Clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">{\u00b6 8} On March 26, 1999, appellee filed a complaint against the Association and Drs. Mervart and West seeking an equitable accounting and a constructive trust, as well as damages for conversion and on account. The complaint was later amended to add a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Drs. Mervart and West. The gravamen of the complaint is that \u201c[t]he [Association], Dr. Mervart and Dr. West have refused to make any payment to the Estate for Dr. Lehtinen\u2019s shareholder and creditor interest and have converted and utilized * * * all of the assets of the [Association] for their own financial gain and benefit to the exclusion of, and without remuneration to, the Plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">{\u00b6 9} In June 2000, the Association and Drs. Mervart and West filed motions for summary judgment as to all counts of appellee\u2019s amended complaint. They argued that appellee lacks standing to bring this action because, as a nonprofessional, she is statutorily precluded from owning shares in a professional association. In support, appellants relied on R.C. 1785.07, which permits a shareholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>of a professional association to sell or transfer his or her shares only to another member of the same profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">{\u00b6 10} On January 4, 2001, the trial court granted appellants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, finding only that \u201cno genuine issue of material fact remains as to [plaintiffs] claims, and that the corporation and the individual doctors are each entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 11} In reversing the judgment of the trial court, the court of appeals essentially found that a decedent\u2019s title to shares of stock in a professional association passes by law to his or her estate\u2019s personal representative and that R.C. 1785.07\u2019s restriction on the disposition of shares applies only to voluntary transfers and not to transfers by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 12} The cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 13} The sole issue presented for our review is whether R.C. 1785.07 precludes a personal representative from acquiring and holding title to the decedent\u2019s shares in a professional association pending administration of the estate when the personal representative is not a member of the profession.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 14} By way of background, Ohio professionals were traditionally prohibited from practicing in the corporate form. See <em>Land Title Abstract &amp; Trust Co. v. Dworken </em>(1934), 129 Ohio St. 23, 31, 1 O.O. 313, 193 N.E. 650. Consequently, they were denied the various tax and business advantages that usually inure from incorporation. The Professional Association Act, R.C. Chapter 1785, effective October 17, 1961, \u201cwas passed simply and solely to enable the self-employed professional person to share in some of the many tax benefits long afforded to employees of nonprofessional enterprises, particularly in the tax bonanza of qualified pension and profit-sharing plans.\u201d 2 Cavitch, Ohio Corporation Law (2002) 18-2, Section 18.1. See, also, Vesely, The Ohio Professional Association Law (1962), 13 W.Res.L.Rev. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>{\u00b6 15} However, while the General Assembly was willing to provide the authority to enable Ohio professionals to obtain the benefits of corporate treatment under the Internal Revenue Code, it was not willing to endow the professional association with all of the attributes of a general corporation. Instead, a professional association organized under R.C. Chapter 1785 is \u201csubject to numerous restrictions presumably intended to protect the public against the possibility of having unlicensed persons provide professional services, either indirectly by controlling professional corporations as shareholders or directors, or directly as employees of professional corporations.\u201d Smith, Professional Corporations in Ohio: The Time for Statutory Revision (1969), 30 Ohio St.L.J. 439, 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, R.C. 1785.07 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA shareholder of a professional association may sell or transfer that shareholder\u2019s shares in the association only to another individual who is duly licensed, certificated, or otherwise legally authorized to render within this state the same professional service as that for which the association was organized * <em>* </em>* \u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">{\u00b6 18} While R.C. 1785.07 clearly prohibits a shareholder of a professional association from transferring his or her shares to a nonprofessional, the statute is silent with respect to transfers by operation of law, such as upon a shareholder\u2019s death. As explained by Smith, supra, 30 Ohio St.L.J. at 452:</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cWhile the statute presents a number of problems for voluntary transfers, at least the shareholder can refrain from making the transfers. However, there are a number of circumstances in which transfers must be made, such as the death or disqualification of a shareholder. The statute\u2019s silence on these points raises serious problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">{\u00b6 20} In particular, \u201c[t]he shares of a corporation are personal property,\u201d R.C. 1701.24(A), and \u201c[t]he title to personal property of a deceased person passes to his personal representative, his executor or administrator, pending the settlement of the estate, whether he dies testate or intestate.\u201d <em>Winters Natl. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Riffe </em>(1965), 2 Ohio St.2d 72, 31 O.O.2d 56, 206 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, unlike a beneficiary or specific legatee, \u201can executor\u2019s title to stock in an estate is acquired by operation of law.\u201d 18 Corpus Juris Secundum (1990) 511, Corporations, Section 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">{\u00b6 21} There is some surface plausibility to appellants\u2019 argument that had the General Assembly intended to limit the transfer restrictions of R.C. 1785.07 to voluntary transfers or to make an exception for transfers by operation of law, it would have followed the approach taken by some other state legislatures and specifically included a provision to that effect. For example, Utah\u2019s professional corporation act provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>{\u00b6 22} \u201c[A] shareholder may <em>voluntarily </em>transfer shares of capital stock in a professional corporation only to:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(a) persons who are duly licensed to render the same specific professional services as those for which the corporation was organized.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Utah Code Ann. 16-11-7. See <em>Riche v. N. Ogden Professional Corp. </em>(Utah App.1988), 763 P.2d 1210, 1213, affirmed (1989), 784 P.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 24} More directly, Michigan\u2019s act provides that \u201c[s]hares of a corporation organized under this act shall not be sold or transferred except to an individual who is eligible to be a shareholder of the corporation or <em>to the personal representative or estate of a deceased or legally incompetent shareholder.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Mich.Comp.Laws Ann. 450.230. See Smith, supra, 30 Ohio St.L.J. at 452-453. And New York\u2019s Business Corporation Law, Section 1511, specifically provides that \u201c[n]othing herein contained shall be construed to prohibit the transfer of shares by operation of law or by court decree.\u201d See <em>Udel v. Udel </em>(1975), 82 Misc.2d 882, 884, 370 N.Y.S.2d 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">{\u00b6 25} The force of appellants\u2019 argument, however, dissipates upon closer analysis. Absent a provision to the contrary, restrictions on the transfer of corporate shares of stock, whether contained in the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or in a separate agreement among the shareholders, are overwhelmingly held to apply only to voluntary transfers and not to transfers by operation of law. <em>Durkee v. Durkee-Mower, Inc. </em>(1981), 384 Mass. 628, 428 N.E.2d 139; <em>Castonguay v. Castonguay </em>(Minn.1981), 306 N.W.2d 143. Thus, while there is some disagreement as to whether restrictions on the transfer of shares should apply to subsequent transfers by an executor to specific legatees or to others, there is no disagreement that title to the decedent\u2019s shares initially passes to the estate\u2019s personal representative notwithstanding the restriction. See <em>Colbert v. Hennessey </em>(1966), 351 Mass. 131, 140, 217 N.E.2d 914; <em>In re Trilling &amp; Montague </em>(E.D.Pa.1956), 140 F.Supp. 260; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. N. Attleborough Chapter of Am. Red Cross </em>(1953), 330 Mass. 114, 111 N.E.2d 447; <em>Stern v. Stern </em>(C.A.D.C.1945), 146 F.2d 870; 18A American Jurisprudence 2d (1985) 572-573, Corporations, Section 694; 18 Corpus Juris Secundum, supra, Corporations, Section 220 et seq.; Annotation, Restrictions on Transfer of Corporate Stock as Applicable to Testamentary Dispositions Thereof (1975), 61 A.L.R.3d 1090, 1094, Section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">{\u00b6 26} Under these same principles, the court in <em>Riche, </em>supra, held that certain restrictive provisions appearing in a medical association\u2019s articles of incorporation and stock-redemption agreement, which prohibited the transfer of shares to persons who are not licensed to render medical services, did not preclude the shares of a bankrupt shareholder from being transferred to an unlicensed creditor pursuant to a court-ordered trustee\u2019s sale. While the Utah <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>statute referred to above puts a transfer restriction on only voluntary transfers of shares, the corporation\u2019s restrictions in <em>Riche </em>were not expressly limited to voluntary transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">{\u00b6 27} In considering the applicability of these transfer restrictions, the court in <em>Riche </em>explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cAlthough the statute, the articles, and the agreement prohibit the transfer of stock to anyone who is not a member of the medical profession, these prohibitions did not preclude the transfer in this case. Restrictions on the sale of corporate stock are held to apply only to \u2018voluntary\u2019 transfers. <em>See, e.g., Castonguay v. Castonguay, </em>306 N.W.2d 143, 145 (Minn. 1981) (stock restrictions did not apply to court-ordered assignment pursuant to judgment of divorce). Indeed, this doctrine has apparently been incorporated in [Utah Code Ann.] \u00a7 16-11-7, quoted above, which expressly refers only to voluntary transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe same result is reached in this case by giving the corporation\u2019s stock repurchase agreement its plain meaning. The agreement does not even purport to restrict involuntary transfers of stock, such as the one in the instant case which occurred pursuant to a court-ordered trustee\u2019s sale. <em>See Durkee v. Durkee-Mower, Inc., </em>384 Mass. 628, 428 N.E.2d 139, 142 (1981).\u201d Id., 763 P.2d at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 30} Appellants would have us distinguish all of the foregoing cases on the basis that they involve either \u201crestrictive stock agreements\u201d or statutes that \u201cexpressly distinguish between Voluntary\u2019 and \u2018involuntary1 transfers.\u201d Appellants, however, have offered no authority for making such distinctions. On the other hand, courts have held that restrictive statutory provisions equivalent to R.C. 1785.07 do <em>not </em>encompass transfers by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">{\u00b6 31} Thus, in <em>Street v. Sugerman </em>(Fla.1967), 202 So.2d 749, the Supreme Court of Florida held that Fla.Stat.' 621.09 and 621.11 do not preclude a nonprofessional judgment creditor from levying upon shares of stock in a professional service corporation and having them sold to satisfy the judgment. Fla.Stat. 621.09 provides that \u201c[n]o corporation organized under the provisions of this act may issue any of its capital stock to anyone other than * * * an individual who is duly licensed * * * to render the same specific professional services as those for which the corporation was incorporated.\u201d Fla.Stat. 621.11 provides that \u201c[n]o shareholder of a corporation organized under this act may sell or transfer her or his shares in such corporation except to another * * * individual [who is] eligible to be a shareholder of such corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">{\u00b6 32} The Florida Supreme Court agreed with the district court of appeals that these provisions do not prevent an execution <em>by law </em>and explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>{\u00b6 33} \u201cWe noted in the case of <em>In re The Florida Bar, </em>Fla., 133 So.2d 554, 4 A.L.R.3d 375, that professional service corporations evolved and were designed primarily for the purpose of allowing various professions, not previously privileged to incorporate, to form organizations that would legitimately qualify for certain tax or retirement advantages available to corporations. The privilege of incorporation was most definitely not created or extended in order that those availing themselves of the benefits could be cloaked with an immunity inimical to legal order and public interest. Thus, it is our judgment that Chapter 621, Florida Statutes, F.S.A., does not serve to prevent an execution and sale, by law, of shares of stock in a professional service corporation for satisfaction of a judgment creditor.\u201d Id., 202 So.2d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">{\u00b6 34} A similar conclusion was reached in <em>Gulf Mtge. &amp; Realty Invest, v. Alten </em>(1980), 282 Pa.Super. 230, 422 A.2d 1090, where a judgment creditor sought to execute upon shares of stock in a Pennsylvania professional corporation. The Pennsylvania Professional Corporation Act provides that \u201cowners of shares in a professional corporation shall be licensed persons and any issuance or transfer of shares in violation of this restriction shall be void.\u201d 15 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. 2923 (derived from 15 Pa.Stat. 2911[a]). The court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cAlthough the Act may prevent unlicensed persons from exercising control of shares obtained by judicial sale, it does not prevent the shares from being seized and sold to licensed persons or back to the corporation, or otherwise disposed of upon dissolution of the corporation.\u201d Id., 282 Pa.Super. at 239, 422 A.2d 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">{\u00b6 36} Similar results have been obtained under comparable statutes in cases involving claims for spousal or child support. See <em>Brody v. Poliakoff </em>(Fla.App.1997), 689 So.2d 441; <em>El-Amin v. Adams </em>(May 16, 1995), Va.App. No. 0292-94-2, 1995 WL 293043.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">{\u00b6 37} Nevertheless, appellants would distinguish these cases on the basis that they involve \u201cinvoluntary transfers to satisfy debts.\u201d According to appellants, in the present case \u201ca professional voluntarily sought to transfer his shares to his non-professional wife. Thus, the transfer at issue is not an involuntary transfer to a non-professional judgment creditor, but rather a voluntary transfer to a non-professional spouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">{\u00b6 38} Appellants\u2019 argument in this regard is, in fact, a variation on the consistent but misguided theme, interwoven throughout their briefs, that because Dr. Lehtinen died testate, \u201cthe shares transferred pursuant to [his] will, not by \u2018operation of law.\u2019 \u201d Appellee brought this action in her capacity as the personal representative of Dr. Lehtinen\u2019s estate, and whatever rights of inheritance she may have to his personal property as a beneficiary under his will are irrelevant to these proceedings. Title to Dr. Lehtinen\u2019s shares vested in appellee upon her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>appointment as executor and passed to her by operation of law irrespective of any specific bequest. See <em>Riffe, </em>supra, 2 Ohio St.2d at 77, 31 O.O.2d 56, 206 N.E.2d 212; 18 Corpus Juris Secundum, supra, at 511, Corporations, Section 220; Annotation, supra, 61 A.L.R.3d at 1094-1095, Section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, appellants contend that \u201c[b]y allowing professionals to bequeath their shares to non-professionals, the Court of Appeals opens the door to non-professional control of professional associations organized under R.C. Chapter 1785.\u201d Appellants argue that professional associations will now be faced with a number of issues, \u201csuch as whether the non-professional executrix or heir must be given notice of shareholder\u2019s meetings, whether he or she may vote at the meetings, and whether he or she is entitled to receive dividends on the shares.\u201d Appellants also argue that while such an event may eventually prompt the Secretary of State to cancel the association\u2019s charter pursuant to R.C. 1785.06, there could still be \u201ca window of opportunity during which a non-professional can exercise control,\u201d since the certification is made on an annual basis. Besides, appellants continue, \u201c[e]ven if the cancellation process were an effective safeguard [against nonprofessional influence], * * * professional associations still would face cancellation of their charters and the disruption and burdens that entails.\u201d In appellants\u2019 view, professional associations should not be forced to endure these burdens \u201cmerely because a shareholder died.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cOnce a disqualified person * * * acquires stock [in a professional corporation] by an involuntary transfer, the usual remedy is to compel dissolution of the corporation pursuant to the applicable statute.\u201d <em>Riche, </em>supra, 763 P.2d at 1214. In other words, when a nonprofessional obtains control of shares of a professional corporation by operation of law, \u201cthe corporation could be dissolved and thus prevent noncompliance with statutory restrictions.\u201d <em>Alten, </em>supra, 282 Pa.Super. at 241, 422 A.2d 1090. This would obviate the issue of control and effectively deal with any problem associated with \u201cthe scope of the rights of a nonprofessional in such a stock interest.\u201d <em>Sugerman, </em>supra, 202 So.2d at 751. And since nothing in R.C. Chapter 1785 precludes a professional association from being dissolved voluntarily, see R.C. 1701.86 and 1785.08, there need not be any \u201cwindow of opportunity during which a non-professional can exercise control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">{\u00b6 41} Moreover, most, if not all, of these problems, including dissolution and reincorporation, can be avoided by providing for the consequences of a shareholder\u2019s death in the association\u2019s articles of incorporation or in a separate \u201cbuy-sell\u201d or share-purchase agreement. See 2 Cavitch, Ohio Corporation Law, supra, at 18-8 to 18-9, Section 18.34; Anderson\u2019s Ohio Corporation Law (2000) 375-376, Section 16.25; M. Thomas Arnold, Incorporation of Professionals in Ohio: Past, Present, and Future (1981), 15 Akron L.Rev. 191, 208-209; Smith, supra, 30 Ohio St.L.J. at 451-452; Vesely, supra, 13 W.Res.L.Rev. at 199-200. In any event, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>find nothing in the statute to indicate that the General Assembly sought to ensure the continuity of the corporate form under these circumstances.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A8\">Shannon C. Strachan, Neil McGinness and Hal D. Cooper, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A9n\">McDonald, Hopkins, Burke &amp; Haber Co., L.P.A., and Dan L.

Whetzel, urging affirmance for amicus curiae Ohio State Bar Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 42} Thus, it is our judgment that if the General Assembly had intended to require that a personal representative be professionally qualified in order to acquire title to the decedent\u2019s shares in a professional association organized under R.C. Chapter 1785, it would have included a specific provision to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 43} Accordingly, we hold that R.C. 1785.07, which permits a shareholder of a professional association to sell or transfer his or her shares only to another individual who is a member of the same profession, does not preclude a personal representative who is not a member of the profession from acquiring and holding title to the decedent\u2019s shares in a professional association pending administration of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 44} We stress, however, that since this holding is based on the theory that title to a decedent\u2019s shares vests in his or her estate\u2019s personal representative by operation of law, it does not encompass the distinct issue of whether R.C. 1785.07 prohibits any further transfers by the personal representative to nonprofessional heirs or legatees or to others not professionally qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">{\u00b6 45} For all of the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-10\">Moyer, C.J., F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, Batchelder, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b206-11\">William G. Batchelder, J., of the Ninth Appellate District, sitting for Cook, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\">. Although not mentioned by the parties, we sua sponte address whether the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment constitutes a final appealable order. Along with its answers to appellee\u2019s complaint and amended complaint, appellant Association filed certain counterclaims that were never formally adjudicated or dismissed. While the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment purports to be \u201cfinal,\u201d it does not specifically determine that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay.\u201d Civ.R. 54(B). Nevertheless, these counterclaims seek only the dismissal of appellee\u2019s complaint and declaratory judgment on matters that are mooted by the entry of summary judgment. In <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 21, 540 N.E.2d 266, we explained that \u201ceven though all the claims or parties are not expressly adjudicated by the trial court, if the effect of the judgment as to some of the claims is to render moot the remaining claims or parties, then compliance with Civ.R. 54(B) is not required to make the judgment final and appealable.\u201d Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to determine the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
