Com. </em>376; <em>Tidd Pr. </em>797; <em>Arch. Pr. </em>433. It does not determine the rights of the parties. <em>Manhattan Life Ins. Co. v. Broughton, </em>101 <em>U. </em>S. 121. There is no statute in New Jersey which changes this common law rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">But the defendant insists that the plaintiff is barred of his action by our statute concerning .set off.. <em>Rev.,p. </em>1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Its provisions are, in substance, that, where two parties are mutually indebted, their debts may be set off against each other; that, if one of such parties sue the other, it shall be lawful for the defendant at the trial (after proper pleading) to set off the debt due him, and any defendant failing to set off his debt shall thereafter be precluded from bringing any action for such debt; that, if on the trial a balance appears to be due to the plaintiff, he shall have a verdict and judgment therefor, but if the debt due the defendant equals or exceeds the plaintiff\u2019s debt, the defendant shall have a verdict and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>judgment, which verdict and judgment, in case of excess,, shall be for the balance due him.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The object of the statute is to prevent two actions between-the same parties, by compelling them to do justice to each-other in a single suit, with regard to all matters capable of adjustment therein. <em>Stryker v. Beakman, 3 Halst. </em>209; <em>Nolin </em>v. <em>Blackwell, 2 Vroom </em>170. The procedure contemplated is one-in which there shall be a verdict (or something equivalent) and a judgment thereon. Such a procedure would, at common-law, be conclusive upon the plaintiff as to the claims for which-he sued; the statute makes it conclusive upon the defendant as to the claims which he might have set off But if the course-of the litigation be such that the plaintiff is not concluded by it, the object of the statute is not attained; and in that case-it is impossible, consistently with justice, to give effect to the clause precluding the defendant from- bringing an action on-his claim. For, if by the operation of the statute the defendant\u2019s claim be rendered incapable of supporting an action, it will also be incapable of legal use by way of set off. <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Hatkinson, Penn. </em>*751; <em>Nolin </em>v. <em>Blackwell, 2 Vroom </em>170 <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Kaiser, </em>11 <em>Id. </em>286. Tlius, while the plaintiff might maintain a second suit upon his claim, the claim of the-defendant would be nullified without satisfaction and without the accomplishment of the statutory purpose of preventing-double litigation* We deem it reasonable and for the sake of justice necessary to hold that, if in the original action the demand of the plaintiff is not legally determined, neither is the demand of the defendant. The termination of the suit, without a result conclusive upon both parties, leaves them- both as they were before its institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">It is not to be inferred from this decision that a- plaintiff) against whom a defendant has pleaded a set off) may not compel the final settlement of the set off in that proceeding. The set off is in the nature of a cross \u00e1ction, so that both parties become actors. In such a case the court will not permit the plaintiff to discontinue, if the defendant insists on a judgment which will end the controversy. <em>Estell </em>ads. <em>Franklin, </em>5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>Dutcher </em>264. For the same reason, the court should not allow the defendant to force an inconclusive result, by non-suiting the plaintiff, when the latter insists on a verdict and judgment which will finally determine the litigation. If, however,' in spite of such insistance, a non-suit be entered, it &lt;can collaterally have no other effect than if suffered voluntarily. Technically it is considered a voluntary non-suit <em>(Runyon </em>v. <em>Central R. R. Co., </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>556), except for the purpose of having the opinion of the court ordering it reviewed on error. <em>Voorhees </em>v. <em>Woodhull\u2019s Exrs., </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>482.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the .demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
