L., p. </em>325) provides that in the several counties of this state where the financial statement of the county collector is published in the newspapers, the county collector shall publish such statement in all the newspapers in his county that are designated by the governor and comptroller to publish the laws, together with \u25a0such other newspapers of the county as are designated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u25a0board of freeholders within thirty days after the annual meeting of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">A special law relating to the county of Monmouth, passed' in 1873 <em>(Pamph.

It would not be a general law unless it applies to all counties where financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>statements are published in newspapers. <em>New Brunswick </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>15 <em>Vroom </em>165.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">An interpretation of the law of 1889 must be adopted which will uphold it as a general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The limitation of thirty days in the general law of 1889-, refers to the time within which the board of freeholders may, designate additional newspapers in which the statement shall be published, and not,to the time within which the collector shall publish-in the papers designated by the governor and, comptroller. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The relator is' entitled to the writ applied for.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
