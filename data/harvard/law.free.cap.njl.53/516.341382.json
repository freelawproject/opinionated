Cox, a physician,, against the executors of George Vusler, deceased, to recover a bill for medical services rendered to .the testator\u2019s wife between March 27th, 1883, and October 2d of the same year.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The testator died in May, 1886. The court certified that prior to May, 1880, the testator and his wife lived together for five or six years; that on or about the 5th of May the testator\u2019s wife, in his absence, moved away from his house and left him, and went to her brother\u2019s house, a few miles away; that she removed from her husband\u2019s house everything that belonged to her; that when she took away the last load of goods she told her husband that she was going to leave and was not coming back again ; that the testator, after his wife left, lived with his sons until his death; that his wife never returned to him, but continued to reside at her brother\u2019s house, and that it was during her illness at her brother\u2019s house that the plaintiff rendered the professional services sued for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">The court further certified that it did not appear that the wife had any reason for leaving her husband, and that it did not appear that the plaintiff had any knowledge that the testator\u2019s wife was not living with him\u2014the doctor denying that he knew anything about it.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-7\">Argued at February Term, 1891, before Justices Depue, Van SYCKEL'and Scuddee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-8\">For the plaintiff in <em>certiorari, George M.

Under such circumstances the' presumption is in favor of the wife\u2019s authority to contract on behalf of her husband. 1 <em>Ev. Pr. &amp; A. </em>166; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Herbert, </em>12 <em>Vroom </em>454; <em>Jolly </em>v. <em>Rees, </em>15 <em>C. B., N. S., </em>628; <em>Notes to Manby </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>3 <em>Sm. Lead. Cas. (9th ed.) </em>1757.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">But where the husband and wife are living in a state of separation, the presumption is against the authority of the-wife to bind the husband by her contract. Under such circumstances the general rule is that the husband is not liable.. To this rule there are two exceptions pertinent to this inquiry,, the first of which is where husband and wife separate and live in a -state of separation by mutual consent, without any provision for her maintenance or means of her own for her support; the other, where the wife leaves her husband under-the stress of his misconduct of such a character as in law is-regarded as a justifiable cause for the wife\u2019s quitting her-husband\u2019s society. In such cases, the presumption being- against the liability'of the husband for the wife\u2019s contract,, the burden' of proof - is upon the party seeking to enforce against him a liability for her contract. He 'must show affirmatively the special circumstances which shall fix the responsibility- on the husband in order to establish his cause of action.. <em>Mainwaring </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>1 <em>Moo. &amp; M. </em>18; <em>Johnston </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>3 <em>Hurlst. </em>&amp; <em>N. </em>261, 268; <em>Blowers </em>v. <em>Sturtevant, </em>4 <em>Den. </em>46; <em>Breinig </em>v. <em>Meitzler, </em>23 <em>Penna. St. </em>156; <em>Snover </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>1 <em>Dutcher </em>94; 2 <em>Kent </em>147. The cases, English and American, on this subject,, are collected in the American editions of Smith\u2019s Leading Cases under the head of Manby <em>v. </em>Scott.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The certificate of the Court of Common Pleas states that it did not appear that the wife had any reason- for- leaving her husband, and the facts set out in the certificate tend to show that she left of her own volition, and without any 'justifiable cause!</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Nor will the fact that the plaintiff had no knowledge that the wife was living separate from her husband avail to relieve the plaintiff from the burden of proof Independently of agency, express or implied' from cohabitation, the liability of the husband upon contracts made by the wife pledging his credit arises'from .the acts or misconduct of the husband. As was said by Lord Selborne, there is no- mandate in law from the fact of marriage only, making the wife the agent in law of her husband to bind him and pledge-his credit, except in the particular case of necessity\u2014a necessity which may arise where the husband has deserted the wife, or has by his conduct compelled her to live apart from him. <em>Debenham v. Mellon, </em>6 <em>App. Cas. </em>24, 31. On any other hypothesis a wife living separate from her husband without justifiable cause, or even through her own misconduct, would have it in her power to pledge his credit by seeking persons with whom to deal who were unaware of the- family relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">There being no proof of facts from which agency might be implied, and from the fact that the wife was living apart from her husband, the presumption being that she had no authority to bind the husband, the plaintiff could make no ease against the husband except on proof of those, particular, circumstances from which the husbaud\u2019s liability would result as a mandate in law. To make out .a cause of action against- the husband, the plaintiff was bound to prove those speqial circumstances from which alone the husband\u2019s liability for the plaintiff\u2019s demands would result;-,-Without such .proof 4)ej .had no case.</p>\n<p id=\"AbGv\">\u2022 Upon the case as certified the Court of Common Pleas gave judgment for the plaintiff. That judgment was erroneous, and should be reversed. ' - &gt; . \u2022&lt;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
