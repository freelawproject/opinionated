The overruling of this offer is the single ground of complaint. The offer was to prove that the defendant obtained an adjournment in the justice\u2019s court; that the justice before the arrival of the day to which the cause had been adjourned announced that he Avould be absent on that day, but would try the cause on another named; that defendant, both on the first adjourned day as well'as upon the day named by the justice, attended at the times and places mentioned as the times and places for the trial, and found that the justice was absent; that the justice had held his court in another place, and there tried the cause and rendered the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\">The Court of Common Pleas overruled this offer, and proceeded to try the cause and rendered judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-6\">Argued at June Term, 1890, before Justices Reed and \u2018Garrison.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-7\">For the prosecutrix, <em>John J.

Where the court for the trial of small causes had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action, relief can be had either by <em>certiorari </em>or by appeal. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Middlesex Common Pleas, </em>13 <em>Id. </em>386. But when the cause of action is Avithin the jurisdiction of the court, and there ivas lack of jurisdiction over the party appealing by reason of irregular adjournments, the taking of an appeal operated as a Avaiver of the irregularity. The remedy was by <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
