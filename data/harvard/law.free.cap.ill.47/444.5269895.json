The cause is brought to this court, and the decision of the court below, in overruling the demurrer is assigned for error.</p> <p id=\"b454-8\" pgmap=\"454\">From the earliest period in the history of the common law, pleas in abatement have not been favored by the courts, and hence, great precision has been required, both in the substance and structure of such pleas. And the rules governing them have been less relaxed in modern practice than in other branches of pleadings, or in the practice which obtains in common law courts. And it is for the reason that such pleas tend to delay justice, and hinder parties from recovering .their rights. They do not go to the merits of the controversy, but simply to form in the proceeding.</p> <p id=\"b454-9\" pgmap=\"454\">We find that as early as Lord Coke\u2019s time it was the recognized doctrine that a corporation aggregate could not appear in person to an action. 1 Coke Litt. 66 b. And we find the same rule announced in Comyn\u2019s Digest, Pleader 2, B. 2, where it is said, speaking of a corporation aggregate: \u201c But the corporation must appear by attorney, appointed under their common seal.\u201d And Chitty, vol. 1, p. 551, lays down the rule, that \u201cA plea by a corporation aggregate, which is incapable of a personal appearance, must purport to be by attorney.\u201d This plea does not purport to be by attorney, but by the president and secretary of the corporation. The plea says the company, \u201c by its president and secretary, comes and says,\u201d &amp;c. In this, the plea was defective and in violation of the rules of pleading. The demurrer should, therefore, have been sustained to the plea. For this error the judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b454-11\" pgmap=\"454\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
