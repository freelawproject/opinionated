If the views of the counsel for the city be correct, then any private gentleman in the city, who shall give his guest a glass of wine or beer on Sunday, would be liable to the penalty. Such could not have been the intention of the legislature, and the language of the ordinance forbids such a construction.</p> <p id=\"b81-12\" pgmap=\"81\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b81-13\" pgmap=\"81\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
