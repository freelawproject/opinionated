O hables Emebson, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEH\" pgmap=\"233(21) 234(187)\">Hamsher and wife conveyed, by mortgage, to Thomas O. Smith, a lot in Decatur, in which they had a homestead, without waiving or releasing it in the deed. Subsequently the same parties conveyed by mortgage, to Coe and Yan Duyn, the same premises, and in the deed to them, the homestead was waived and released in due form. Smith\u2019s mortgage was dated January 12th, 1858; Coe and Yan Duyn\u2019s mortgage dated December' 10th, 1860. January 25th, 1862, Smith filed his bill, praying a foreclosure, mailing Coe and Yan Duyn parties defendant. Coe and Yan Duyn filed a cross-bill praying that their mortgage be decreed the first lien, and that it be foreclosed, having set up the same facts in answer to complainant\u2019s bill. The court in \u25a0 the decree finds that the premises were abandoned by Hamsher, in the spring of 1861. Upon these facts, the court gave a decree to complainants, ordering the premises sold and the proceeds applied to Smith\u2019s mortgage, and the remainder, if there should be any, was to be applied to the Coe and Yan Duyn mortgage, and the final remainder to Hamsher. The rendition of this decree, postponing Coe and Yan Duyn\u2019s mortgage to the Smith mortgage, is the error assigned.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b234-6\" pgmap=\"234\">Mr. H.
