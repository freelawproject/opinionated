Edward Y. Bice, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-11\" pgmap=\"115\">This was an action of assumpsit, brought by Ballinger against Christopher, at the March term, 1867, of the Circuit Court of Macoupin county, to recover upon a promissory note. Judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, and defendant appeals to this court. The only question made in this court is, whether a promise, with or without a consideration, to dismiss the suit, can be pleaded in bar.</summary><p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-12\" pgmap=\"115\">The facts appear in the opinion of the court.</p><attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-13\" pgmap=\"115\">Mr. John I.

The defendant paid ten dollars as the amount of the costs, but the plaintiff proceeded with his suit.</p> <p id=\"b116-4\" pgmap=\"116\">Instead of taking issue on this plea, the plaintiff should have interposed a demurrer to it, which would have brought up the sufficiency of the defence, and no court would hesitate to decide the promise to dismiss the suit was no bar to its prosecution.</p> <p id=\"b116-5\" pgmap=\"116\">If pleaded in abatement, it might possibly have authorized a dismissal, or if a motion supported by affidavit had been made to dismiss, it might have been successful; but, as a bar, it was of no effect.</p> <p id=\"b116-6\" pgmap=\"116\">If the defendant has sustained damages by the non-performance of the agreement, he may, perhaps, maintain an action therefor, if he can show there was a consideration for the plaintiff\u2019s promise, good in law, which we think would be difficult.</p> <p id=\"b116-7\" pgmap=\"116\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b116-8\" pgmap=\"116\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
