This, we think, is an erroneous view of the statute. There is not one word in the branch of the statute on which this indictment is founded, making that a requisite. Section 127 of the statute makes criminal, open lewdness, or other notorious act of public indecency, tending to debauch the public morals\u2014keeping open any tippling house on the Sabbath day or night, maintaining or keeping a lewd house, etc. It is classed under the head of offences against the public morality, health and police, and to constitute it, the actual sale of liquors of any kind, on the Sabbath day or night, is not a \u25a0 requisite. The offense is in keeping a tippling house open on the Sabbath day or night.</p> <p id=\"b337-7\" pgmap=\"337\">The proof, then, on the part of the prosecution, should be, that the defendant kept a tippling house, and that would be established by proof that he kept a grocery or drinking saloon, for the sale of strong drinks. \u201c A tippling house\u201d is defined to be \u201ca public drinking house.\u201d In such houses, the usual stimulating beverages are kept on sale. In this, beer only was sold. Beer was the defendant\u2019s specialty. Some prefer one kind of \u201c tipple,\u201d some another, and these houses are usually so furnished and kept as to accommodate the various tastes of their customers. There are tipplers of beer, as well as of other strong drinks, and the keeper of a beer saloon, when that alone is sold, is, in the light of our statute, the keeper of a tippling house.</p> <p id=\"b337-8\" pgmap=\"337(55) 338(158)\">To establish the offense charged, it was only necessary for the prosecution to show that the defendant kept a beer saloon, where beer was sold by the glass or \u201c drinkthat to this saloon the public had free access on the Sabbath day as on week days, and every facility afforded those who might enter to obtain their favorite \u201c tipple.\u201d The proof in this case fulfills these requirements. The saloon was used as a sitting room for the boarders at the house, and accessible to every one from the public street, on the Sabbath, as on week days, and although proof was not required that the defendant should actually sell beer on that day, there was proof that beer was sold on the Sabbath day in the saloon. It makes no difference how much or how little he sold, or whether he sold any, and the fact that he sold one glass of beer goes to prove that the saloon was kept open for the purpose of selling it by the glass, and is a clear violation of the statute. By keeping open the saloon on the Sabbath day, the defendant showed his readiness and willingness to sell his liquors. He sold on that day all that was called for\u2014one glass.</p> <p id=\"b338-6\" pgmap=\"338\">It is not meet that the law should be evaded under the pretence that the saloon was defendant\u2019s sitting room. It was also accessible to the public, and could readily become the resort \u00f3f the idle and the vicious, and thus be productive of the evil consequences the statute was designed to prevent.</p> <p id=\"b338-7\" pgmap=\"338\">On the point, the particular Sabbath day was not proved, this we think was wholly unnecessary. Proof that the offense was committed on a Sabbath day within eighteen months before the indictment was found, was sufficient, and a recovery thereon could be pleaded in bar of any other indictment for the same offence alleged to have been committed on any Sabbath day within that time. The instructions conform to the views herein expressed.</p> <p id=\"b338-8\" pgmap=\"338\">Perceiving no error in the record the judgment must be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b338-9\" pgmap=\"338\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
