The employee was an experienced buffing machine operator. A skin weighing about eight pounds is placed upon the table of the machine and drawn into the machine between a set of twenty-four inch rolls. One of the rolls is covered with abrasive. Pressure of the abrasive roll against the skin is applied by means of a foot treadle. The skin is held back by the operator so that it is buffed uniformly. A day\u2019s work consists of buffing two hundred fifty to three hundred skins.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The employee was fifty-three years of age at the time of his death on April 15, 1953. The employee had been suffering from a heart disease at least since the late fall of 1949 and had last seen a physician on December 16, 1950. The employee complained of a pain in the left arm and shoulder and reported that he secured relief by taking the nitroglycerin pills the doctor had prescribed for him. The family physician testified that the employee\u2019s work could have accelerated the condition of his heart and caused his death sooner than it might otherwise occur, and that \u201cordinary stress and strain of work could possibly produce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>death.\u201d The employee\u2019s wife testified that he was pleasant and cheerful during the lunch hour and that he also stated to her that he had worked hard during the morning and the work was heavy. The medical expert for the insurer testified that there was no causal connection between the employment and the death of the employee. The death certificate stated there was no relation between the occupation and the death. Whether there was any causal connection between the employment and the death was a matter for experts in medical science. It was beyond the knowledge of ordinary laymen.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">To be entitled to an award the claimant was required to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the strain and exertion of the employment precipitated the heart attack which resulted in the employee\u2019s death. This she has failed to do. <em>Falco\u2019s Case, </em>260 Mass. 74. <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 355. <em>Herlihy\u2019s Case, </em>267 Mass. 232. <em>De-Filippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, 534. <em>Hainan </em>v. <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. </em>296 Mass. 219, 223-224.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The final decree is reversed and a decree is to be entered dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
