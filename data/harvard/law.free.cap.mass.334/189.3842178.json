In each declaration it was alleged that by the defendant\u2019s failure to use due diligence in furnishing heat the plaintiff \u201cincurred considerable expense and suffered great damage in business and profits, and was deprived of the enjoyment of . . . [thej premises.\u201d In response to the defendant\u2019s motion in each case to specify \u201call items of damage which the plaintiff claims to have suffered\u201d the plaintiff specified \u201cLoss of man hours of work by employees. Discomfort of lessee and employees, and inability to perform usual duties. Electricity consumed to operate heating blowers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The lease was for a term of two years beginning June 1, 1953, of the first and second floors of an unheated building at 38 Plympton Street, Boston, to be used in the sale and distribution at wholesale of hardware, kitchen and house<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>hold wares, and similar products. There was evidence that the defendant owned an- adjacent industrial building equipped with a central heating system \u201cfired\u201d by oil and during the summer of 1953 connected this system with the leased premises. She installed a blower type unit heater on each floor and in December added two additional blowers, leaving the plaintiff to make the necessary electrical connections between the blowers and its meter. It also purchased two \u201ccontrols.\u201d There were frequent complaints of insufficient heat. Its employees \u201ccould not perform their usual functions . . . [and] on one morning in December, 1953, there was a skim of ice over the water in the toilet bowl.\u201d It was required because of cold to purchase a \u201cspace\u201d heater for each floor. In November, 1954, the defendant took down the piping and blowers, reinstalled and relocated all heaters, replaced the piping, and added three heaters. Since then the heat has been adequate. According to expert testimony based on a survey made on or about May 31, 1954, the \u201cfour unit heaters were inadequate to heat the premises even if properly installed, but they were not properly installed.\u201d Expert witnesses for the plaintiff testified subject to the defendant\u2019s objections and claims for a report of the evidence \u201cthat the fair yearly rental value of the premises heated was $3,434, and . . . unheated . . . was $2,382,\u201d and \u201cthat the reasonable value of fuel to supply heat for the premises for one year commencing June 1, 1953, was $1,050.\u201d The objections were \u201cbased on the fact that plaintiff\u2019s specifications did not include the difference in value of the premises heated and unheated, as an item of damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The judge found for the plaintiff in the respective amounts of $569.79, $175.32, and $482.13, and reported the cases on the admissibility of the above testimony and his denial of certain rulings requested by the defendant. The Appellate Division ordered the reports dismissed and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The evidence was sufficient to warrant findings that during the periods' covered by the plaintiff\u2019s actions the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>fendant failed to use due diligence in furnishing heat to the leased premises. On such findings the plaintiff would be entitled to recover as damages the difference between the value of the leasehold with the covenant unbroken and its value with the covenant broken. <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Stowell, </em>138 Mass. 431. <em>A. W. Banister Co. </em>v. <em>P. J. W. Moodie Lumber Corp. </em>286 Mass. 424, 427, and cases cited. <em>Bloom, South &amp; Gurney, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>289 Mass. 376, 378. That this was the rule of damages recognized by the judge and made the basis of his ultimate findings seems evident from his allowance in each case of the defendant\u2019s request numbered 5, reading, \u201cIf the court should find for the plaintiff, then the measure of damages applicable in this action is the difference in value of the premises, heated as stipulated in the lease, and the value of said premises as they were in fact heated, and this difference cannot exceed the reasonable cost of supplying heat for said premises as provided in the lease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The plaintiff, however, did not allege as an item of its damage diminution in value of its leasehold. It is bound by its specifications with which its proof must substantially conform. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Crompton &amp; Knowles Loom Works, </em>305 Mass. 327, 329. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Transit Authority, </em>323 Mass. 21, 23. It was therefore error to admit the evidence to which the defendant objected because not material to any issue presented by the specifications. As for this reason the decision of the Appellate Division must be reversed we do not pause to consider the correctness of the rulings on the defendant\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The decision of the Appellate Division is reversed and the cases are remanded to the trial court for a new trial preliminary to which motions to amend the specifications and perhaps the declarations may, in the discretion of the court, be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
