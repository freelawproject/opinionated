He was awarded total incapacity compensation from April 8 to May 28, 1945, and from December 3, 1945, to February 6, 1950, when the maximum payments under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 34, as amended, had been reached. In 1951, after a hearing, the employee was awarded permanent and total disability compensation of $20 a week under \u00a7 34A, inserted by St. 1935, c. 364, as amended, and he is still receiving that compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">None of the awards described above is the subject of the present appeal. This appeal arises out of a proceeding before the board to compel the insurer, under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 30, as it stood at the time of his injury, to pay for medical services rendered to him in connection with his illness, and expenses incidental thereto. These services consisted of medical treatment rendered by a psychiatrist (Dr. Landau), a cardiologist (Dr. Ayman), and a family physician (Dr. Golden); the incidental expenses were for drugs and taxi hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The issues before the board were (1) whether the case was an \u201cunusual\u201d one or one \u201crequiring specialized or surgical treatment\u201d within the meaning of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 30, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 181; (2) whether the services of Doctors Landau, Ayman and Golden were adequate and reasonable and whether their charges therefor were reasonable; and (3) whether the amounts expended for drugs and taxi hire were expenses which the insurer was required to pay under \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The board found that the case was an unusual one requiring \u201cspecialized and surgical treatment\u201d; that the services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>rendered by the three physicians were \u201cadequate and reasonable\u201d; and that the charges therefor, as reduced by the board, were reasonable. The board likewise found that the amounts expended for drugs and for taxi hire for the transportation of the employee to and from a hospital and doctors\u2019 offices were expenses within the meaning of \u00a7 30. The board ordered the insurer to pay for these services and expenses. In the Superior Court a decree was entered in accordance with the board\u2019s decision, from which the insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The employee\u2019s right to compel the insurer to pay for medical services and incidental expenses is found in St. 1943, c. 181.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See amendments by St. 1946, c. 233, and St. 1948, c. 159. Relying on <em>Meuse\u2019s Case, </em>270 Mass. 29, the insurer argues that its obligation to pay for such services and expenses came to an end when the maximum amount payable under \u00a7 34 had been paid. We are of opinion that <em>Meuse\u2019s Case </em>is not controlling. That case was decided in 1930 prior to the enactment of St. 1935, c. 364 (now \u00a7 34A), which provided for payment of compensation for \u201ctotal and permanent\u201d incapacity after an employee had received the maximum payments for total incapacity under \u00a7 34. It was there held that the obligation of the insurer to pay for medical and hospital services in an unusual case did not extend beyond the compensation period fixed by the act, then \u00a7 34. But with the enactment of \u00a7 34A the board had jurisdiction to order payment of compensation for permanent and total incapacity after the maximum payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>allowed by \u00a7 34 had been reached, and that jurisdiction was exercised here. On the reasoning in <em>Meuse\u2019s Case </em>a necessary concomitant to this enlargement of the board\u2019s jurisdiction is an extension of its authority to order the insurer to pay for medical and hospital services and expenses incidental thereto, for that case decided in effect that the board\u2019s jurisdiction to order payments for such services and expenses was coextensive with its jurisdiction to order compensation payments. The fact that by St. 1948, c. 159, which was not applicable to the case at bar, the Legislature dealt expressly with the question here presented, does not convince us that prior to the amendment the law was otherwise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Under the statute here applicable (St. 1943, c. 181) the obligation to furnish the employee with medical and hospital services and expenses necessarily incidental thereto for a period in excess of two weeks exists only \u201cin unusual cases or cases requiring specialized or surgical treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board, as stated above, found that the case was unusual and was one requiring specialized and surgical treatment. Since the former finding was warranted by the evidence and was sufficient to justify the board\u2019s decision, we lay to one side, without intimation or decision, the question whether this was a case requiring \u201cspecialized or surgical treatment.\u201d See <em>Haggerty\u2019s Case, </em>298 Mass. 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In a number of decisions this court has stated the factors that are pertinent in determining whether a case is \u201cunusual.\u201d In none of them did the court undertake to define the meaning of the word, but has considered in each case whether the board in its discretion could properly reach its conclusion on the evidence before it. <em>Huxen\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 292. <em>Rys\u2019s Case, </em>245 Mass. 244. <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Mass. 533. <em>Meuse\u2019s Case, </em>262 Mass. 95. \"The nature of the injury is of importance in deciding whether the case is an unusual one within the statute. But the cause of the injury or the unusual nature of the happening is not the final test. The statute has reference to injuries which develop unexpected or unusual complications, requiring the services of experts or unusual treatment.\u201d <em>Moore\u2019s Case, </em>255 Mass. 533, 535-536. <em>Meuse\u2019s Case, </em>262 Mass. 95, 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The employee\u2019s injuries here could be found to be unusual when all of the features of the case are considered together. His initial injury, to be sure, was a blow on the head that was not particularly severe. He was able to work for three days before receiving medical treatment, and after a series of tests which were negative he commenced working again, only to be laid off after six months because of unsatisfactory work apparently caused by his head symptoms. There was evidence that since that time his condition has shown steady deterioration and that he is suffering from a post-traumatic neurosis'which has resulted in subjective or emotional symptoms of pain in his head and chest. These symptoms, it could be found, have seemingly become organic in nature and the employee is now afflicted with defective vision, stabbing pain behind the eyes, angina pectoris, and hypertension. We are of opinion that the finding of the board that this was an unusual case was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The insurer argues that, even if the employee is entitled to medical services and expenses, any such right is limited to services and expenses incurred in treatment of the particular condition for which he is receiving compensation. It contends that the services of the three physicians and the drugs prescribed by them for which payment is sought had no reference to the condition for which the employee is receiving compensation under \u00a7 34A. We find no merit in this contention. There is ample evidence in the record in support of the board\u2019s finding that the services rendered by the above mentioned doctors were furnished in connection with the persistent complaints and symptoms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>employee resulting from his original injury. The applicable statute (St. 1943, c. 181) expressly provides for the furnishing of \u201cmedicines if needed.\u201d The board\u2019s finding that the expenses for drugs were incurred as a result of prescription by the attending physicians was warranted by the evidence, and it rightly ruled that they were expenses within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The insurer also argues that the board erred in ordering the insurer to pay the taxi bill incurred by the employee in being transported to and from a hospital and doctors\u2019 offices. The insurer\u2019s position is that it is not liable for services which are not part of a physician\u2019s treatment and which are rendered solely upon an employee\u2019s request. For this proposition it cites <em>Golden\u2019s Case, </em>240 Mass. 178, where this court reversed a decree ordering an insurer to pay the fees of a masseuse employed by an injured employee at his own request and not under the direction or control of a physician. That case is authority for the proposition that treatments which are nob given by order of or under control of a physician are not \u201cmedical . . . services\u201d within the meaning of the statute, but it does not aid the insurer here. By reason of an amendment (St. 1927, c. 309, \u00a7 5) enacted after that decision the insurer was required to pay also for \u201cexpenses necessarily incidental to such services.\u201d This is broad enough to include matters not embraced by the words \u201cmedical . . . services\u201d such as transportation to and from hospitals or doctors\u2019 offices, provided such transportation is reasonably necessary. There is sufficient evidence in this record to support the board\u2019s finding that the taxi hire was \u201cnecessarily incidental\u201d to the medical services furnished to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The decree is affirmed. The employee\u2019s request that the whole costs of the proceeding be assessed against the insurer under \u00a7 14 is denied, for it cannot fairly be said that the case was defended without reasonable ground. Costs and expenses of this appeal under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 11A, inserted by St. 1945, c. 444, as amended, shall be allowed by the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"Af0\">So <em>ordered_</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The material portions of St. 1943, c. 181, are: \u201cDuring the first two weeks after the injury, and, in unusual cases or cases requiring specialized or surgical treatment, in the discretion of the department, for a longer period, the insurer shall furnish adequate and reasonable medical and hospital services, and medicines if needed, together with the expenses necessarily incidental to such services. The employee may select a physician other than the one provided by the insurer; and in case he shall be treated by a physician of his own selection, or where in case of emergency or for other justifiable cause a physician other than the one provided by the insurer is called in to treat the injured employee, the reasonable cost of the physician\u2019s services shall be paid by the insurer, subject to the approval of the department. Such approval shall be granted only if the department finds that the employee was so treated by such physician or that there was such emergency or justifiable cause, and in all cases that the services were adequate and reasonable and the charges reasonable.\u201d ,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> It was there provided that the provisions of \u00a7 30 \u201cshall be applicable so long as such services are necessary, notwithstanding the fact that maximum compensation under other sections of this chapter may have been received by the injured employee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\"> Section 30, by reason of St. 1946, c. 233, \u00a7 1, now provides that the \u201cinsurer shall furnish to an injured employee adequate and reasonable medical and hospital services, and medicines if needed, together with the expenses necessarily incidental to such services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
