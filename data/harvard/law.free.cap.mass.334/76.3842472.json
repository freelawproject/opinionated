The indictments are grounded upon G. L. (Ter. Ed.) &lt;\u25a0 c. 264, \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 19, inserted by St. 1951, c. 805, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>also \u00a7 18A, so inserted, declaring the Communist Party to be \u201ca subversive organization.\u201d See now St. 1954, c. 584, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Both cases are reported by a judge of the Superior Court before trial and without any rulings by him on the questions of law involved. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 278, \u00a7 30A, inserted by St. 1954, c. 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">These cases, we think, like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilbert, ante, </em>71, also decided this day, fall within the area of prosecutions for sedition which the Supreme Court of the United States has just held in <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>350 U. S. 497, has been exclusively preempted by statutes of the United States. For reasons similar to those more fully set forth in the <em>Gilbert </em>case we think that the statutes of the United States to which reference is there made preclude State action on these indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In each case the defendant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment must be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-15\"> \u201cSection 23.
