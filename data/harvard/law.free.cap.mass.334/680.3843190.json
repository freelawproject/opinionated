The findings of the single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>member include the following. The deceased suffered a heart attack in November, 1950. In October, 1952, he suffered another heart attack which occurred in these circumstances. On October 29, 1952, the deceased, in the course of his employment, crawled on his hands and knees under a building in order to reach some pipes and shut off the water. In so doing he was compelled to assume an exceedingly awkward position and overexerted himself. As a consequence he had difficulty in breathing, suffered pain in his chest, and had pain and numbness in both arms. He was able to extricate himself only with the assistance of another person. At the time this occurred the deceased had a \u201cpreexisting arteriosclerotic condition with hypertension and a developing chronic myocardosis. \u201d The single member found that the deceased \u201creceived a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment on October 29,1952, as a result of overexertion which aggravated his preexisting heart condition and hastened his death, \u201d and that he was totally incapacitated from October 29, 1952, until his death on March 21, 1953. Death, he found, resulted from the injury. The single member further found that the self insurer was \u201cnot prejudiced in respect to the issues of notice and claim. <em>\u201d </em>The claimant was awarded dependency compensation at the rate of $20 weekly from October 29, 1952, subject to the provisions of the act, and the self insurer was ordered to pay the sum of $500 into the State treasury pursuant to the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 65N, inserted by St. 1945, c. 623, \u00a7 3, and as amended by St. 1949, c. 689. The reviewing board affirmed and adopted the decision of the single member.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">On appeal to the Superior Court by the self insurer a decree was entered that the finding of the reviewing board that the self insurer \u201cwas not prejudiced in respect to the issue of notice and claim is not warranted on all the evidence . . . and that . . . the claim [be] dismissed. \u201d The claimant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The sole question presented is whether the findings of the board on the issue of prejudice were warranted. We are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>opinion that they were not, and that the decree below was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 41, \u201cNo proceedings for compensation for an injury shall be maintained unless a notice thereof shall have been given to the insurer or insured as soon as practicable after the happening thereof, and unless the claim for compensation with respect to such injury has been made within six months after its occurrence, or, in case of the death of the employee . . . within six months after death.\u201d Section 44 provides that \u201cWant of notice shall not bar proceedings, if it be shown that the insurer, insured or agent had knowledge of the injury, or if it is found that the insurer was not prejudiced by such want of notice.\u201d And by \u00a7 49 it is provided that \u201cFailure to make a claim within the time fixed by section forty-one shall not bar proceedings under this chapter ... if it is found that the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">As stated above, the injury which is the basis of the present claim was sustained on October 29, 1952. No notice of the injury was given to the self insurer during the deceased\u2019s lifetime. And the claimant does not contend that the self insurer had any knowledge of the injury. In any event there was no evidence that would support such a finding. The first notice of the injury that the self insurer had was the filing of the present claim by his widow on January 12, 1954, almost ten months after her husband\u2019s death and considerably more than a year from the time of his injury. Thus there was a failure to give notice required by \u00a7 41 \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d after the happening of the injury and also a failure to file a claim within six months after death as required by that section. This was fatal unless it can be said, as the board found, that the self insurer was not prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The burden of proving lack of prejudice with respect to both the failure to give notice and the delay in presenting the claim was on the claimant. <em>Kangas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155, 158. <em>McGowan\u2019s Case, </em>288 Mass. 441, 444. <em>Booth\u2019s Case, </em>289 Mass. 322, 325. Since this burden requires proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>of a negative \u2014 a difficult and often impossible burden to sustain \u2014 it has been held that the claimant is not required \u201c 'to exhaust the possibilities of prejudice and displace them. <em>. . \u201d Kangas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155, 158. The circumstances, without evidence directed to disproving particular forms of prejudice, may of themselves warrant an inference by the board of want of prejudice. But there is no presumption requiring such inference in the absence of affirmative evidence of prejudice. Or, stated differently, the claimant\u2019s burden is not sustained by surmise or conjecture. <em>Kangas\u2019s Case, supra. Hatch\u2019s Case, </em>290 Mass. 259, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">One of the most common instances of prejudice is the inability of the insurer to procure evidence at a time remote from the injury. However, if the facts are so clear that prompt notice and investigation could not have unearthed anything more favorable to the insurer, prejudice by delaying or hampering investigation is negatived. But \u201ccaution must be used in applying this rule, for it is often hard to say, long after the event, that a prompt investigation would not have revealed anything of value.\u201d <em>Kangas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155, 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In the present case it cannot be said that the natural inference from the testimony is that no prejudice resulted to the self insurer from the failure to give notice and the delay in filing the claim. It is to be noted that the deceased was suffering from a heart ailment for a considerable time before the alleged injury on October 29, 1952. And it is also to be noted that the board found that this condition was aggravated by the overexertion and that this aggravation was the cause of his death almost five months later. This was a case, then, where a speedy investigation was particularly important in order to determine the reality and effect of the alleged injury, for conceivably such an investigation might have revealed that the employee\u2019s preexisting condition was not aggravated by the overexertion and that his subsequent death was due to that condition rather than the alleged injury. From a careful examination of the evidence we are of opinion that it affords no basis for a finding of want of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>prejudice. <em>Kansas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155. <em>Booth\u2019s Case, </em>289 Mass. 322. In the cases relied on by the claimant there were factors \u2014 not present here \u2014 which would warrant a finding of no prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-17\"> <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>241 Mass. 36. <em>Wnukowski\u2019s Case, </em>296 Mass. 63. <em>Watson\u2019s Case, </em>322 Mass. 581. <em>Tassone\u2019s Case, </em>330 Mass. 545. <em>Charron\u2019s Case, </em>331 Mass. 519.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
