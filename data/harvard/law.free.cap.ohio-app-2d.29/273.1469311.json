First of all, there is always some question in every case as to relationship between the injury or some previous injury and what particular thing happened in this accident. In my judgment the jury is entitled to know the complete background and any previous accident that the Plaintiff has been jn * * #.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV8\">\"We feel that the trial court permitted the defense counsel to range near the peripheral limitation, if not beyond the allowable limitation, of cross-examination, as to the plaintiff\u2019s other prior injuries. The general rule is set forth in the annotation in 69 A. L. R. 2d 593, at page 596:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfD\">\u201cMost of the cases in which the question has been raised have held or recognized that the plaintiff may properly be cross-examined as to his previous injuries, physical condition, claims, or actions for injuries similar to that constituting the basis of the present action, for the purpose of showing that his present physical condition is not the result of the injury presently sued for, but was caused, wholly or partially, by an earlier injury or preexisting condition * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In the instant case, the plaintiff had alleged an aggravation of a pre-existing back condition, and questioning going to such prior back injuries or other injuries similar to those alleged would be proper, but general questions relating to the circumstances of the prior accident and fall from the country club canopy without relating the prior injuries to the present injuries raises a serious question of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The relevancy of the testimony concerning the prior accident and resulting injuries was never established by the defense. The comments of counsel in closing argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>referring to such prior accident further accentuated that which was irrelevant. It was error for the trial court not to have instructed the jury to disregard all of such testimony and references.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">However, we must hold that the court\u2019s failure to do so did not result in prejudicial error in this regard in that the court gave a proper instruction to the jury on the issue of the aggravation of a pre-existing injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">On the other hand, the matter of admitting the testimony relating to the photograph of the site of the previous accident, and the later allowance of such picture in evidence as Exhibit A was quite a different thing. We feel that the display of such picture and questions concerning the destruction of the canopy from which this appellant had fallen, and the distance he had fallen, may well have unduly influenced the jury as to the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The plaintiff was awarded $2,250 by the jury as compensation for his injuries sustained in the automobile accident. The jury, in the absence of the testimony, exhibits, and comments of defense counsel relative to the prior injury, could well have returned quite another verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">To the extent that the jury had paraded before them the matter of the falling canopy and resulting injuries, and may have been influenced thereby in the amount of the verdict rendered, this plaintiff has been prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">It is our opinion, therefore, that the trial court committed error prejudicial to this plaintiff, and that the latter should be afforded a new trial of his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The judgment of the Franklin County Common Pleas Court is hereby reversed and this matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\"><em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded. </em>'</p>\n<judges id=\"b290-11\">Troop, P.
