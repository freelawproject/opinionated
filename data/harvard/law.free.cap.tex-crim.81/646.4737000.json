In deference to this contention we have reviewed the record, in the light of the decisions of this court giving weight to the conclusions of the trial judge, and, granting the correctness of his findings on conflicting evidence (Vernon\u2019s C. C. P., p. 910, and cases cited), we adhere to the opinion that the burden rests upon the State to show, by \u201cproof evident,\u201d that a capital crime was committed, and that relator was the guilty agent. Branch\u2019s Grim. Law, p. 49, and cases cited. Observing the established practice in this court, we omit a discussion of the evidence. Sharp v. State, 1 Texas Crim.
