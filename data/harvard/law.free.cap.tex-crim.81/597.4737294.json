Appellant had a daughter Effie, about seventeen years old. Deceased had a son Clarence, about grown. Clarence had been courting Effie and waited on her\" from week to week. They had agreed to he married, or at least Clarence had asked appellant for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>her. Appellant had no particular objection to Clarence, but it seemed Effie had another beau and the indications are he preferred the other beau to Clarence, and while he did not decline to let Clarence have her, he deferred the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Appellant left his home one morning, went several miles away on some business and did not return until after night between 9 and 10 o\u2019clock. That morning Clarence got a buggy, went to the school where Effie was attending, got her, they were married, and he took her to his father\u2019s. That night when appellant returned home, his wife told him that Clarence had taken Effie, and she understood that they had married. Appellant, thereupon, late at. night, got on his horse, took his shotgun, loaded it and went the several miles to deceased\u2019s, reaching there about 1:30 at night. Deceased and all his family, including Effie and Clarence, were in bed \u25a0 asleep. Appellant hailed and woke them all up. Deceased\u2019s house had three rooms to it, two adjoining and a kitchen attached to one of them.' Clarence and Effie were in one room; the deceased, his wife and his other children were in the other room. There was a door from each room, about the center of it, to the outside and a door in the partition between the two rooms. When appellant woke deceased and his family, deceased got up, lit a light and went to the front door of the room he occupied and called to know who it was. Appellant told him, and demanded to know if his daughter Effie was there and demanded that she come out and that deceased have her to come out. Deceased called to her and told her that her father wanted her% She had heard his call for-her but did not go to the door or out to him. The testimony up to this point seems to be uncontradicted. , The State\u2019s testimony by deceased\u2019s wife and his two daughters and Clarence was all to the effect that appellant began cursing and abusing deceased and his family, denouncing their act of stealing his daughter and making serious threats. Appellant in effect denies this and claims that deceased was doing the cursing and abusing him. Who was right in this matter, was a question for the jury. Deceased\u2019s wife and his said children testified that without any provocation appellant then shot and killed deceased. That he shot and killed him is unquestioned. The deceased\u2019s family further testified, all of them, that appellant shot deceased and that then Clarence got the gun in the house and at once shot appellant, striking him in the jaw and side of the neck, it seems with small shot; at least the evidence does not show that appellant\u2019s wound was serious. Appellant claims that he was shot first and that he then shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The court in a proper charge submitted all of the issues raised by the testimony, including self-defense and manslaughter. There is no complaint at all of the court\u2019s charg\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The sole question is based on the court\u2019s refusal to give appellant a new trial on what he claimed was newly discovered testimony. The claimed newly discovered testimony was that of Ed Brent and appellant\u2019s daughter Effie. Their affidavits are attached to the motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>a new trial. The State contested the motion by proper pleadings and also attached the affidavit of Effie and of Brent to its contest. This matter is not presented by any bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Brent\u2019s affidavit is to the effect that he was a deputy sheriff of said county and in his official capacity went to deceased\u2019s place soon after he was killed, saw his body and the wound that caused his death. \u201cThat the wound on deceased was on his side and extended almost across his body and the same size up and down and was considerably larger than the wound on defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Effie\u2019s affidavit was to the effect \u201cthat her husband shot her father before her father shot Ben Carter; that she has not before making this affidavit made this statement to anybody except her mother; that she denied this statement to the attorney for her father on the day he was tried for killing the said Ben Carter; that she made a contrary statement the morning after the killing but that such statement was made at the instance and under the direction and orders of her husband, Clarence Carter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In the State\u2019s contest it attached her affidavit made before the then district attorney as a notary public to the effect that her father \u201ctold me to come out there, and my father cursed at me and told me to come on, and then the next that I heard was the shot, and then Clarence Carter shot.\u201d In contradiction of her affidavit attached by appellant to his motion, the State three days later procured her affidavit to this effect, \u201cthat she can not say which one shot first, Clarence Carter or her father,\"Ben Jackson\u201d; that the said affidavit she made which was attached to appellant\u2019s motion \u201cwas not explained to her and that she did not understand the contents of same; that it was not explained to her and that her mother, Tishie Jackson, told me to sign same and showed me where to sign my name.\u201d Appellant claims that this affidavit from her was obtained by the special prosecuting attorney, and criticises his manner of getting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The affidavits and record clearly show that when this latter affidavit of Effie was procured it was written by the said special prosecuting attorney, and that he and the deputy sheriff went to where the witness was, and the deputy sheriff\u2019s affidavit shows that when this attorney was talking to her she stated twice that her husband shot first; \u201cthat she finally told him that she didn\u2019t know which shot first\u201d; that he then sent the deputy sheriff two and a half miles away for the justice of the peace; and that he went and got the justice of the peace and brought him back; and that Effie swore to said affidavit before the justice of the peace. The attorney\u2019s affidavits are to the effect that before the trial Effie was in attendance but that she then stated to them that appellant shot first and she would not say that her husband, Clarence, shot first. They do show in their affidavits, however, that Effie\u2019s mother had told them before that, that Effie had told her that Carter shot before appellant did. The affidavit of Mr. Brent, the deputy sheriff, further shows that he had been subpoenaed and attended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>as a witness at the instance of appellant; that he was present and sworn in with the other witnesses when the case went to trial; that he heard a part of the testimony but that while the trial was going on he went out of the courthouse and before he returned the testimony was concluded. He was not called for as a witness by appellant after the trial began. They claimed that they had had him subpoenaed for the purpose of proving that Clarence Carter had stated to him that he had a gun in the house at the time of the shooting; that they were informed that Clarence would deny that on the trial and that when he swore that he had the gun and that he had shot appellant, as shown above, they did not introduce the deputy sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Appellant made a motion to strike out the State\u2019s contest of his motion and the alleged affidavits of Effie Carter attached by the State to its contest. The court correctly overruled this. The State had the right to file a contest and the court, should not have struck it out. A different question might be presented if appellant had made a motion to strike out the said affidavit of Effie sworn to before the district attorney as a notary public. For aught that appears, the' court may have in passing on the matter excluded that affidavit from his consideration. Even if he did not, Effie in the affidavit attached by the appellant swore that she had made a statement (doubtless this one) the next day after the killing to the same effect. Hence, no injury could have occurred to appellant on that score.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">This court has at all times and in all cases held, as stated by Judge White in his Ann. C. C. P., sec. 1149, that an application for a new trial on the ground of claimed newly discovered testimony \"is closely scrutinized and is largely confided to the discretion of the trial court; and the disposition there made of it will not be disturbed on appeal unless it be apparent that the trial court abused its discretion to the prejudice of appellant. Burnes v. State, 12 Texas Crim. App., 270; Bell v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 598; Templeton v. State, 5 Texas Crim. App., 398; Shaw v. State, 27 Texas Crim. App., 750; West v. State, 2 Texas Crim. App., 209; Terry v. State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 236.\u201d This principle and these cases have been cited and approved in many later cases. One only need be cited. Gray v. State, 65 Texas Crim. Rep., 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The claimed testimony of neither Brent nor Effie Carter could have been newly discovered under the terms of the law. The record clearly shows that the appellant\u2019s attorneys before the trial knew that Effie Carter had stated to her mother that her husband shot first. The appellant knew that she was present on the night of the killing and, must have seen and heard all that occurred. The law is, as stated by Judge White in said section, that \"Where the testimony is of such a character as that it must have been known to the counsel for the defendant before the trial, it is in no sense newly discovered evidence. Burton v. State, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 138. Where the witness was interviewed by defendant\u2019s counsel upon one phase of the case only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>and was not put upon the stand, his testimony upon another phase is not newly discovered. Williams v. State, 45 S. W. Rep., 572. Where it appeared that the proposed witness had, been subpoenaed in the case but was not put upon-the stand to testify, the testimony was not newly discovered. Powell v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 377; Halliburton v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 410.\u201d This statement of the law by Judge White, and said decisions, have all the time been cited, approved and adhered to. It is needless to collate the later cases. But see Stewart v. State, 76 Texas Crim. Rep., 54; Henson v. State, 74 Texas Crim. Rep.; 282; Black v. State, 71 Texas Crim. Rep., 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The court\u2019s action in refusing appellant a new trial was correct under the law and record in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">June 29, 1917.</p>\n<author id=\"b634-10\">PRENDERGAST, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AIN\">As stated in the original opinion, the sole question in this case is whether or not the court erred in refusing to grant the appellant a new trial on what he claimed was newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">What the record showed on this subject was fully and accurately stated in the original opinion. It is unnecessary to here again repeat all that.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">The statute (art. 841, O. C. P.) provides: \u201cThe State may take issue with the defendant upon the truth of the causes set forth in the motion for a new trial; and, in such case, the judge shall hear evidence, by affidavit or otherwise, and determine the issue.\u201d This statute, without any doubt, expressly, as it stated, authorized the State to take issue with defendant upon the truth of his claimed newly discovered testimony. The State did this in literal compliance with the statute. The State\u2019s answer to the appellant\u2019s claim of newly discovered testimony contesting this was as follows: \u201cHow comes the State by her district attorney and takes issue with the defendant upon the truth of the causes set forth in his motion for a new trial in the above entitled and numbered cause, and says the causes therein alleged are not true, and this ho is ready to verify. A. L. Robbins, District Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">\u201cThe State hereto attaches exhibits \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB\u201d and \u201c0,\u201d affidavits of Effie Carter and Ed Brent, which is made a part hereof. A. L. Robbins, Dist. Attorney, J. M. Baldwin, Attorney for State.\u201d The contents of these affidavits is accurately given in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\">The appellant made this motion: \u201cHow comes the defendant in' the above cause and files this contest and moves the court to strike out the private prosecutor\u2019s contest of defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, and the alleged affidavits of Effie Garter.\u201d Then follows certain alleged reasons for striking out the State\u2019s contest and the affidavits attached thereto as said exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The court upon hearing and considering this motion made this order: \u201cThis day came on to be heard the defendant\u2019s motion to strike out and not consider the contest of State' and affidavits attached thereto filed in this cause in contest to defendant\u2019s amended motion for new trial, and the court after hearing said motion is of the opinion that same should be overruled and the said motion is hereby overruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">There can be no question but that the State had the right, and it was its duty to have, as it did, contested appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial and the causes claimed therefor; and the - court could not have legally done otherwise than it did, \u2014 overrule his motion to strike out that contest. Then when the court heard the motion for new trial and the State\u2019s contest,.if the State had then offered in evidence the affidavit of Effie Carter, sworn to before the' district attorney as a notary public, he should have objected thereto and shown that he did by proper bill of exceptions. He did not do this. The record does not disclose that he then objected to the introduction of that affidavit in evidence if it was offered, nor to the court considering it; but even if he had, as shown in the original opinion, he could not have been injured thereby because Effie Carter, in her affidavit which appellant attached to his motion for a new trial, expressly shows that wherein she then stated that her husband, Clarence, shot first, \u201cthat she made a contrary statement the morning after the killing.\u201d This could have referred solely to the affidavit that she had made before the district attorney that appellant shot deceased first.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">But in addition to all of this, the record clearly and distinctly shows that neither the claimed testimony of Effie nor of Hr. Brent was, or could have been, newly discovered. The record distinctly shows that appellant positively knew that his daughter Effie was present at the time he killed deceased and when Clarence Carter shot him. It shows that the State had not subpoenaed Effie as its witness and that when he fcftmd that out he, himself, had her subpoenaed and in attendance on the court on the trial of the case. It also positively shows that Effie had told her mother, appellant\u2019s wife, prior to that time that Clarence Carter shot first. Appellant\u2019s attorneys, hy their affidavits, show that they knew this. Appellant himself is bound to have known it. The record also clearly and distinctly shows that the location and extent of the wound on the deceased, inflicted by appellant and which killed deceased, could not have been newly discovered testimony. There can be no doubt but that many witnesses could have been obtained by the slightest diligence to show the location and extent of this wound.. So far as the testimony of Deputy Sheriff Brent on the subject is concerned, the record positively shows that the appellant had Brent subpoenaed as his witness; that that he attended the trial as such; was sworn as a witness for him at the time the trial began, and that the appellant knew all of this. He did not call him as a witness, and even if he was temporarily absent out of the courtroom when the trial was concluded he says that he made no motion for a continuance or postponement to get him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>and made no attempt whatever to then get him or introduce him as a witness. We here repeat what we quoted from Judge White in the original opinion: \u201cWhere the testimony is of such a character as that it must have been known to the counsel for the defendant before the trial, it is in no sense newly discovered evidence. Burton v. State, 33 Texas Crim. Rep., 138. Where the witness was interviewed by defendant\u2019s counsel upon one phase of the case only and was not put upon the stand, his testimony upon another phase is not newly discovered. Williams v. State, 5 S. W. Rep., 572. Where it appeared that the proposed .witness had been subpoenaed in the case but was not put upon the stand to testify, the testimony was not newly discovered. Powell v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 377; Halliburton v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 410.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADMn\">Mr. Branch, in his Ann. P. C., page 137, correctly states the law thus: \u201cWhere it appears that defendant of his counsel knew of the alleged new testimony at or before the trial, or that defendant knew that the proposed new witness was present when the transaction occurred, or where the alleged new testimony is of such a character as that defendant must necessarily have known of its existence prior to the trial, and the trial court in the exercise of its sound discretion has refused a new trial, the judgment will not be reversed to permit him to take advantage of his own negligence and obtain a new trial to get testimony which he should and could have had at the trial.\u201d He cites in support of this text some forty-two cases, all of which are in point. See also Waggoner v. State, 190 S. W. Rep., 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">There can be no question but that under the law, and what is plainly disclosed by this record, the court\u2019s action in refusing a new trial was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
