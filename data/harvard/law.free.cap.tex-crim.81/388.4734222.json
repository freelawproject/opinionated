On a previous day the court ordered the application filed and the cause set down for hearing to determine whether the court would issue the writ and what disposition it would make thereof. It was duly submitted on the day set for its hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-22\">Appellant was indicted for burglary. He was shown to be under seventeen years of age upon an investigation on an affidavit filed to that effect and the indictment dismissed. Ho information or complaint was filed against him thereafter, but by virtue of the same indictment he was in the juvenile court adjudged a delinquent child and his punishment assessed at confinement for not less than two years in the State School for the Training of Juveniles at Gatesville, Texas. The matter is discussed in more detail in Ex parte Ramseur, this day decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-23\">Article 1195, C. C.
