The Assistant Attorney General concedes that it is not. The evidence is not materially different from that introduced in the case of Manuel v. State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>45 Texas Crim. Rep., 96. In fact, the evidence in the last named case was stronger against the appellant than that shown here. See also Cohen v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 337; Hilton v. State, 41 Texas Crim. Rep., 190, 53 S. W. Rep., 113; Collins v. State, 46 Texas Crim. Rep., 550, 80 S. W. Rep., 372; Boswell v.

Rep., 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Complaint is made of the admission of proof that fourteen or fifteen years prior to the date of the alleged offense appellant had given birth to a child as the result of an illicit relation. As a general rule evidence so remote as this is not admissible, but under the peculiar facts of this case, appellant having put her reputation for virtue and chastity in evidence, it was not error for the State to develop on cross-examination that her daughter was illegitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Because the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction, the judgment of the lower court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
