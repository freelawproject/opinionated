E. Moffitt, a person doing business under the name of A. E. Moffitt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>&amp; Company in Cleburne, Johnson County, Texas, 200 sacks of cotton seed\" meal and hulls, each bag containing said meal and hulls had a label thereon stating that said feeding stuff contained substantially a larger percentage of protein than was actually then and there contained therein, towit: the said label contained the statement that said feeding stuff contained not less than 42 per cent of protein, whereas, in truth and in fact, not more than 35.50 per cent of protein was actually then and there in said feeding stuff, and said label thereon further stated that there was a smaller quantity of crude fiber than was then and there actually contained therein, towit: the said label stated that said feeding stuff in said bags contained not more than 12 per'cent of crude fiber, whereas, in truth and in fact, said feeding stuff in said bags contained more than 14 per cent of crude fiber and some of said bags or sacks contained 14.98 per cent of crude fiber and no less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Appellant attacks said law, claiming that wherein it prescribes that the label stating that said feeding stuff contains \u201csubstantially\u201d a larger per cent of protein, etc., than is contained therein, is so indefinite and of such doubtful construction, that it can not be understood, and that, under article 6, Penal Code, it is, therefore, wholly inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">This question is not free of difficulty. It seems if we should follow our Supreme Court in the case of the State v. Railway Co., 179 S. W. Rep., 867, holding that \u2018Hight repairs,\u201d in our car shed statute, is not too-indefinite or uncertain, and the case of the State v. Railway Co., 106 Texas, 18, 154 S. W. Rep., 1159, under our \u201cwater closet\u201d statute, holding that statute valid, and Bradford v. State, 78 Texas Crim. Rep., 285, 180 S. W. Rep., 702, and the authorities cited in those eases, appellant\u2019s attack should not be sustained. However, under the provisions of our Penal Code, and under the authorities in point cited in State v. I. &amp; G. N. Ry. Co., 165 S. W. Rep., 892, by the Court pf Civil Appeals at Galveston, this court has reached the conclusion that that part of said article 735, Penal Code, which attempts to make it an offense, if the label on the article of feeding stuff states that it contains \u201csubstantially\u201d a larger percentage, etc., than is therein, is too indefinite and too uncertain to prescribe an offense. There is a difference between what certainty must be prescribed to make an offense from that which exempts from an offense, and said eases in 179 S. W. Rep., and 180 S. W. Rep., could be distinguished from this case, but the case in 154 S. W. Rep., might not be. Evidently different persons might differ as to what would be \u201csubstantially\u201d such larger percentage. For instance, one court or jury might hold that 1 per cent less, or even if a less per cent than that is stated would be a violation of the law, while another might hold that 10 or more per cent less would not be. We are aware that the Supreme Court in 179 S. W. Rep., supra, overruled the Galveston Court of Civil Appeals, that \u201clight repairs\u201d was not too indefinite. So that this court holds that that part of the said article attempting to prescribe an offense is inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">It will be noticed, however, that said article 735 prescribes another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>offense from that attempted to be prescribed, discussed above, and. that is, it makes it an offense for any agent, etc., to sell, etc., said feed stuff when \u201ca smaller quantity of crude fiber than is contained therein\u201d is stated to be therein on' the label. The complaint and information charge this offense as well as the other. Therefore, we can not reverse and dismiss this prosecution because of the invalidity of the first charge, but appellant can be held for trial under the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Another contention, by appellant is that there is a fatal variance between the allegation and the proof, in that the information avers that appellant was the agent, etc., of said oil and gin company, \u201can incorporated company,\u201d and that having alleged this, it was necessary to prove it, and that instead of the proof showing that said oil and gin company was a corporation, that it was proven a partnership and not an incorporated company.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In the opinion of the writer this does not present reversible error, for it was immaterial whether the concern for which appellant was agent was an incorporated company or a partnership, and that that line of authorities which holds that where it is necessary to allege that the injured person is a corporation it is necessary to prove it, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Appellant also complains that the evidence is wholly insufficient to show that appellant made the alleged sale to Moffitt. We think his contention on this point is correct. The evidence does not show that appellant made the alleged sale to Moffitt. It does not show who made the sale, but tends rather to show that the' firm itself made the sale. Ho other question need be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\">ON BEHEADING.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">March 21, 1917.</p>\n<author id=\"b100-12\">PRENDERGAST, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Akh\">The contention now made by appellant in his motion for rehearing is that the true construction of article 735, Penal Code, is that the word \u201csubstantially\u201d applies as well to \u201ca smaller quantity of crude fiber\u201d as it does to \u201ca larger percentage of protein,\u201d etc., and that the intention of the Legislature was that said word \"substantially\u201d should apply to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">In the original opinion it was held that said word applied to the latter. If appellant\u2019s contention now is correct, it must result in a reversal and dismissal of this cause. This question now presented was not made on the submission on this point as it now is and hence escaped that careful attention and consideration which should have been given to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">In .order to try to make clear the question said article 735 as it applies in this case will be here succinctly stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">Any agent selling any concentrated commercial feeding stuff with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>label- stating that said feeding stuff contains substantially a larger percentage of protein, or a smaller quantity of crude fiber, than is contained herein, shall be fined, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">Upon a careful and thorough consideration of the statute and the question, we have concluded that\" appellant\u2019s contention is correct and that the true construction is, and the probable intention of the Legislature was, that the word \u201csubstantially\u201d should apply to \u201ca smaller quantity of crude fiber\u201d as it does to \u201ca larger percentage of protein,\u201d etc.; in other words, that the said article in this respect properly construed and as intended by the Legislature was as if it read this way: Any agent selling any concentrated commercial feeding stuff with a label stating that said feeding stuff contains substantially a larger percentage of protein, or (substantially) a smaller quantity of crude fiber, than is contained therein, shall be fined, etc. By this it will be seen that the statute should be interpreted as if the word \u201csubstantially\u201d was contained therein before the words \u201ca smaller quantity of crude fiber.\u201d It is deemed unnecessary to enter' into a discussion and citation of the rules of construction whereby this conclusion is reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The result is that a rehearing must be granted, the original order reversing and remanding the cause set aside, and the cause reversed and dismissed, which is accordingly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
