We think this testimony should have been excluded under the rule of evidence which declares hearsay inadmissible. Cases listed in Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., p. 65. Without this testimony there is very little in the record to establish the truth of the allegations in the complaint. Its admission was material and hurtful error requiring a reversal of the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\n<em>Beversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
