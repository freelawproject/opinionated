The only way he could have legally been discharged at the time he was, was by entering into a recognizance instead of giving an appeal bond. His giving the appeal bond and obtaining his liberty thereby deprives this court of jurisdiction. Hence, the Assistant Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss must be granted. (Laird v. State, 79 Texas Crim. Rep., 129, 184 S. W. Rep., 810,. and .several cases following this decided by this court since then.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
