It contains a judgment nisi forfeiting appellant\u2019s bond; it contains a bill of exceptions not approved by the judge, but attempted to be proved by bystanders. The affidavit of the bystanders is taken by the attorney in the case, and, of course, can not be considered. Then we have the jailer\u2019s certificate of commitment. This is the record. It is somewhat difficult to understand just what character of proceeding this was intended to be. The bill of exceptions being out of consideration, there is nothing for the court to consider. There is no notice of appeal, and no action of the court below except the judgment nisi on the forfeited hail bond. In this condition of the record there is nothing for this court to consider, and the appeal is dismissed from the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
