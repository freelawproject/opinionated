The papers if in a condition to be considered would show that on March 12, 1917, the grand jury of Rockwall County indicted appellant for gaming and that by the proper orders the indictment was transferred and duly filed in the County Court on March 15. On April 16th there appears a judgment nisi against appellant and his sureties on a forfeiture of his bail bond. The sheriff certifies that he holds appellant in jail under the authority of an alias capias. The only other matter shown in the papers is a purported bystanders\u2019 bill, signed by three persons and sworn to before appellant\u2019s attorney as a notary public. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>no certificate by the clerk of the County Court, or other court, attesting the validity of any of the papers filed herein. It is unnecessary to state appellant\u2019s pretended bill of exceptions. It being sworn to before appellant\u2019s attorney, under no circumstances could it be considered if everything else was regular. There is no final judgment and nothing in this proceeding that can be reviewed by this court. The Assistant Attorney General\u2019s motion, therefore, to dismiss the proceedings is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Proceedings dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
