The State\u2019s evidence tends to show, an assassination and express malice; that of the appellant, self-defense. The homicide took place at night at a dance in a restaurant kept by a negro woman by the name of Exine Matthews. Deceased and a woman called Ethel Anderson were living together. Appellant stepped on this woman\u2019s foot. She reported this to Adams, deceased, and a quarrel ensued. Appellant claimed to have apologized to the woman, and in this he was corroborated, though there was a conflict of evidence. There were a great many negroes at the dance, some of them in the house and many of them on the porch or gallery in front of it. During the quarrel appellant remarked: \u201cYou negroes are crazy to fool with me.\u201d Deceased replied: \u201cYou ain\u2019t no more to fool with than anybody else.\u201d Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>lanx said: \u201cI will show you,\u201d and stepped out of the house and disappeared. Deceased walked out on the porch, according to the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses and, while standing there engaged in conversation with his hands in his pocket, appellant approached him unawares, coming within a very short distance, near enough to touch him with the pistol, as testified to by the State\u2019s witnesses, and fired several shots, Some of them hit the post by which deceased was standing, some the house, and one entered deceased\u2019s stomach, striking him in front but not going entirely through his body. Deceased, when shot, stepped off the gallery and followed appellant a few steps, appellant backing off and continuing to fire. After the homicide appellant fled and in passing a house where there was a light he ordered the door closed. 'He was arrested at Smithville some time after the homicide. Four witnesses testified that they were eyewitnesses to the shooting. Another testified to res gestae statements of the deceased that the appellant shot him. Appellant claimed to have met the woman Ethel Anderson in a rooming house upon her solicitation and to have been threatened by1 deceased on account of this meeting, there being evidence and threats both direct to appellant and communicated by others. There was evidence aside from that of appellant from which the jury would have been justified in concluding that the deceased had on his person a pistol at the time of the homicide and that he had gone to his house and gotten it after the quarrel began. There was no evidence except that of appellant of any effort on the part of deceased to use his pistol, nor of any indication that at the time he shot him, deceased knew of appellant\u2019s presence. Appellant claimed that when he left the premises deceased was standing on the gallery with a. pistol in his hand; that he went to a toilet and returned and found deceased still standing on the gallery and had a conversation with him; that deceased pulled out his pistol and apparently tried to shoot and that on this account appellant fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The issues of murder and self-defense were submitted to the jury in a charge which was not complained of and which fairly submitted these issues to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">There are two bills of exceptions, one to the evidence of Exine Matthews, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\u201cWhile the witness Exine Matthews, for the State of. Texas, was-upon the stand, the prosecuting attorney asked the witness if she knew the defendant, John Barrett. Witness answered that she did, and then the prosecuting attorney asked the witness if she knew what the defendant said about his name being \u2018Gyp-the-Blood,\u2019 to which the defendant objected because the character of the defendant was not an issue in the cause, and such being the case the testimony would be-prejudicial to the defendant, John Barrett, and further because it would he immaterial and irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">\u201cBut over the objection of the defendant, the witness was permitted to answer as follows: ^Defendant said that there was hut three bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>men, Jesse James, Harry Tracy and \u201cGyp-the-Blood,\u201d and that he, defendant, was \u201cGyp-the-Blood.\u201d\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u201cTo which testimony the defendant then and there in open court excepted and saved his bill of exception, and here now tenders his bill of exception thereto, and asks that the same be allowed and made a part of the record in this cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">This bill hardly measures up to the rule laid down in Vernon s Ann. 0. C. P., p. 537, requiring a sufficient statement to enable the court to determine from the bill the relation of the matter complained of to the case and its probable effect thereon. In view of the gravity of the case, however, it will be considered in connection with the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Appellant was described in the indictment as John Barrett, alias Blood. Exine Matthews on the subject mentioned in the bill of exceptions is shown by the statement of facts to' have testified, in response to questions asked by the prosecuting attorney, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">\u201cI heard the shooting but didn\u2019t see it. I thought it was a firecracker. Yes, sir; I seen Blood inside my house just before the shooting occurred. Yes, sir; I heard'him say.something about who he was; he said he was Harry Tracy or something \u2014 Harry Tracy and Jesse\u2014 Q. Jesse James? A. Yes, sir; Jesse James, and Blood-the-something. Q. And Blood-the-Gyp or Gyp-the-Blood ? A. Yes, sir; something like that. Q. What did he say about it; who was he? A. He said I am John, I am Jesse Something, and John-the-something; I can\u2019t get that thing fixed in my mind; I want to talk right. Ho, sir; I didn\u2019t hear Blood say that there are only three bad men \u2014 Jesse James, Harry Tracy and Gyp-the-Blood, and that he was Gyp-the-Blood. Ho, sir; I didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Another witness, Shed Gaddison, testified that about a half hour before the homicide he heard a conversation between appellant and a girl at the dance, which he \u201cdetailed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">\u201cHe asked this girl to dance with him, and she told him she didn\u2019t want to dance, and he replied to her, he said: \u2018You are scared of Fish, the reason you don\u2019t want to dance with me, but this is \u2014 \u2019 I'heard the three men\u2019s names he called but I cant think of but one he called; he called the other two names, and he said: \u2018This is Gyp-the-Blood; I am sufficient to protect you if you dance with me; I ain\u2019t scared of Fish if you is.\u2019 That is all he said on that line. Fish is that fellow Will Dennis, is all I know; he used to run a cleaning shop down there somewhere. Yes, sir; Blood said he was Gyp-the-Blood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">There is no bill of exceptions to this testimony of Gaddison.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">We are unable to say that the testimony of the witness Matthews as disclosed by the record, it being apparent that the witness Gaddison testified to the same fact as that which the bill shows the witness Matthews to have related, was inadmissible; and the rule is well settled in this State that the admission of testimony is not cause for reversal if the same fact is proved by other testimony not objected to. Rogers v. State, 26 Texas Crim. App., 404; Walker v. State, 17 Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Crim. App., 16; Johnson v. State, 26 S. W. Rep., 504; Stephens v. State, 26 S. W. Rep., 728; Carlisle v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 108; Wagner v. State, 53 Texas Crim. Rep., 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\">Another bill complains that the county attorney in his closing argument used the. following language: \u201cI will ask the jury to look at the class of witnesses the defendant has placed on the stand \u2014 Willis Hawkins, brought from the jail where he had been placed for pistol toting to testify on his behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQY\">The bill shows that the court sustained appellant\u2019s objection to this argument and that the prosecuting attorney withdrew and retracted the remarks. Ho request was made of the court to charge the jury to disregard this argument. The witness Willis Hawkins was shown by the statement of facts to have testified to details of the altercation which occurred in the house prior to the homicide. His testimony was cumulative in its nature of other testimony which, showed that when appellant stepped on the negro woman\u2019s foot he begged her pardon and also of the fact that in the quarrel that ensued between the appellant and deceased both of them used rather bantering or braggadozio language. While not in the same language, the same fact in substance was testified to by several witnesses. This witness was not an eyewitness to the shooting but only to the conversation and transactions which preceded it. The argument was improper but not, we think, of such a harmful character as to require a reversal of the case, in view of the fact that the court sustained an objection to it and the prosecuting attorney promptly withdrew it. Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., p. 204, sec. 362, and cases listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">There is a well defined conflict in the evidence as to the occurrences at the immediate time of the shooting, and the evidence developed some discrepancies as to the location of the various witnesses and as to the number of people on the porch at the time of the shooting, but in the development of the State\u2019s case several witnesses were produced whose testimony justified the jury in finding that the deceased was making no demonstration against appellant and was not aware of his presence at the time he was shot. With this testimony in connection with the evidence of malice and that of .flight on the part of appellant we would not feel authorized to disturb the verdict. Schwartz v. State, 47 Texas Crim. Rep., 213, 83 S. W. Rep., 195; Eddy v. State, 82 S. W. Rep., 513; Black v. State, 46 Texas Crim. Rep., 590; Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., p. 1178, sec. 2096, and cases listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b532-10\">ON REHEARING. -</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">June 29, 1917.</p>\n<author id=\"b532-12\">MORROW, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AEt\">The rehearing in this cause is sought upon the ground that the conflicting evidence as to the provocation, leading up to the homicide, does not warrant the extreme penalty. It can not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>be denied that the ease is one in which there is a sharp conflict in the evidence. It is one, however, in which the respective theories of the State and the defendant are supported by testimony of a definite and positive\u2019 character.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">After a careful review of the record, with full consciousness of the serious nature of the case, we have found no departure from the rules of procedure laid down by our law for bringing before the jury the facts, and advising them of the law to the end that they might perform the duty imposed upon them of solving the controversy. They had the privilege of measuring the punishment to be assessed. This court has no such authority. Though its members might feel that if they were sitting as jurors they would render a judgment less harsh, they could not upon this account alone set aside the verdict without doing violence to the duty, painful at times, to order an affirmance of judgments where the evidence is sufficient, the rules of law followed, and nothing to indicate that the jury was not impartial, nor that the trial was unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
