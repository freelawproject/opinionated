This is presented in several ways. We can not agree with appellant\u2019s contention on this proposition. The prosecuting officers had all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>facts before them and took the affidavit as a basis for the information charging aggravated assault. The evidence doubtless would justify a verdict for assault to murder had appellant been tried upon that theory, hut it occurs - to us under the authorities and law as understood that, while the facts might have justified a higher conviction, it would not he reversible error for the State to carve out an 'inferior degree of an offense, if it was included within the possible higher offense, and that the conviction for the offense carved could be pleaded in bar of a prosecution for the higher offense, if the higher offense was complete at the time. The authorities sustain .this proposition. Among other cases we refer to Butler v. State, 48 Texas Crim. Rep., 529. This is practically the only question in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
