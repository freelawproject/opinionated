It was proved on the trial that' the appellant took fish by means of a seine without the consent of the owner and that the fish were taken from the \u201chole of water in the creek. Paint Creek has water in it in holes and ponds most of the time, but it sometimes runs in wet seasons and after rains. Paint Creek does not run all the time. It runs in wet seasons. It stands in holes and ponds most of the time.\u201d There is another statute with reference to fishing in streams. It will be noted that the evidence shows that this is a creek which runs at times and fails to show whether it was running at the time of the alleged offense. A pool is defined in Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, page 2631, as a small lake or standing water. A pond is defined in the same book as a body of stagnant water. A pond, as defined by Webster, is a confined or stagnant body of fresh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>water. \u201cA water course consists of bed, banks, and water. Yet the water need not flow continually. There are many water courses which are sometimes dry. To maintain the right to a water course it must be made to appear that the water usually flows in a certain direction, and by a regular channel, with banks and sides. Chamberlain v.

Jeffers, 107 N. Y., 650, 14 N. E. Rep., 316.\u201d Words &amp; Phrases (O. S.), p. 7411. In our opinion, the evidence in this case'shows that the fish were taken out of a part of a stream or water course and not out of a pool or pond within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The judgment of the lower court is, therefore, reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b210-7\">PRENDERGAST, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A-m\">(dissenting). \u2014 Webster defines a \u201cpool\u201d to be: \u201cA small and rather deep collection of (usually) fresh water, as one supplied by a spring, or occurring in the course of a stream.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The Century Dictionary defines a \u201cpool\u201d to. be: \u201cA part of a small stream where the bed suddenly deepens and broadens, forming a relatively still, deep and wide stretch of water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">The statute (art. 780, P. C.) is: \u201cAny person who shall take or catch . . . any fish by means of seines ... in any lake, pool or pond . . . without the consent of the -owner of such lake, pool or pond, shall he\u201d punished, etc. There can be no question but that the Legislature meant' and intended by \u201cpool\u201d in this statute just exactly the body of water defined by the lexicographers above quoted. In fact, every one in this country knows that a pool means a body of water occurring in a creek or stream whether the water be running-or not. The uncontradicted evidence shows appellant caught fish with a seine out of a hole of water \u2014 pool\u2014in Paint Creek, without the owner\u2019s consent. This was exactly what the law said should be punished. The law was intended to protect the owner of the fish on his own premises. The evidence does not show the fish were taken out of a stream, or water course, as contradistinguished from a pool therein, but out of a pool in a creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The judgment should be affirmed, not reversed. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
