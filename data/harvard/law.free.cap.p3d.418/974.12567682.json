For the reasons explained, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Shah and Vakharwala have one child in common, a son. In 2015 the couple obtained a divorce in Georgia. Shah later moved to Arizona with the child. On November 24, 2015, she obtained an Arizona order of protection against Vakharwala, who remained in Georgia. The 2015 order of protection included the following restriction: \"[Vakharwala] shall have no contact with [Shah] except through attorneys, legal process, court hearings, and as follows: ... in writing by U.S. Mail only to discuss the parties' son. [He] [a]lso may contact [Shah's] attorney.\" Based on the 2015 order, the Georgia court amended the decree to include the no contact terms but also to allow Vakharwala some parenting time, including permitting him to contact their son through a video chat service with specified restrictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On November 18, 2016, in anticipation of the expiration of the 2015 order, Shah petitioned for an ex parte order of protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 13-3602(K) (an order of protection expires one year after service). In her verified petition, Shah listed three separate incidents evidencing acts of domestic violence. First, in a November 21, 2015 domestic violence incident, he physically removed the child from Shah and attempted to take him out of the state of Arizona. He was subsequently charged with assault. Second, between June 2, 2016 and June 16, 2016, he violated the 2015 order when he contacted her through video chat. Third, Vakharwala contacted Arizona law enforcement on 15 separate occasions in the preceding 12 months with allegations against Shah ranging from custodial interference to violations of court orders. Each contact resulted in law enforcement contact with Shah and the child and law enforcement finding Vakharwala's allegations to be unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 In late November 2016, based on the claims contained in Shah's verified petition, the court granted another ex parte protective order and included the same contact restrictions contained in the 2015 order. Vakharwala then requested an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(I). Following the hearing, based on the court finding that at least one of the contacts (a June 7 video chat) was an act of domestic violence because it violated the communication restriction in the 2015 protective order, the superior court continued the 2016 protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 We review the superior court's continuance of an order of protection following an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion, but review questions of law de novo.\n   <em>\n    Michaelson v. Garr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323753\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/542/#p544\">\n    234 Ariz. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544, \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323753\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/542/#p544\">\n    323 P.3d 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1195 (App. 2014). Upon the filing of a verified petition, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(A)-(B), a court has jurisdiction to issue an order of protection if it finds there is reasonable cause to believe a \"defendant may commit an act of domestic violence\" or \"has committed an act of domestic violence within the past year\" or longer if the court finds\n   good cause. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(E) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(P). When the court issues an ex parte protective order, upon the defendant's request it shall hold a hearing, after which it may continue the order. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 The term \"domestic violence\" is defined by statute. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3601(A). \"In the context of a past or current romantic relationship, the term domestic violence is broadly defined in \u00a7 13-3601(A) and includes a wide array of criminal acts as well as harassment by verbal, electronic, mechanical, telegraphic, telephonic or written communication.\"\n   <em>\n    Michaelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323753\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/542/#p544\">\n    234 Ariz. at 544, \u00b6 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323753\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/542/#p544\">\n    323 P.3d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). As relevant here, Shah alleged that Vakharwala committed a domestic violence offense by engaging in online contact in violation of the order of protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3601(A) (domestic violence includes offense prescribed in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2810(A)(2) ); A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2810(A)(2) (disobeying a lawful court order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Vakharwala argues the superior court lacked both subject matter and personal jurisdiction to issue the 2016 protective order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He bases this claim on the notion that Arizona courts lack jurisdiction to prohibit conduct outside of Arizona. In that vein, Vakharwala posits that when he initiated the June 7 video chat, he was in Georgia and Shah was in Amsterdam. He reasons, even assuming the contact constituted an act of domestic violence, the court lacked jurisdiction because the \"domestic violence\"-the violation of the 2015 order-was not committed \"in Arizona.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 First, Vakharwala waived any personal jurisdictional challenge. Vakharwala appeared and submitted to the court process; he was served with the 2016 ex parte protective order as required by statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(K) ( \"An order is effective on the defendant on service of a copy of the order and petition\"), and requested a hearing pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(I) without raising any objections as to the court's jurisdiction to grant the ex parte protective order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190277\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/694/#p703\">\n    456 U.S. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 703-04,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190277\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/694/#p703\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190277\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/694/#p703\">\n    72 L.Ed.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) (party may waive jurisdiction by either expressly or impliedly consenting to a court's personal jurisdiction);\n   <em>\n    Tarr v. Super. Ct. In and For Pima Cty.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"743398\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/142/349/#p351\">\n    142 Ariz. 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"743398\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/142/349/#p351\">\n    690 P.2d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 70 (1984) (any act by which the defendant comes before the court and recognizes the case as pending, with the exception of a special appearance to contest jurisdiction over his or her person, will constitute a general appearance and subject him or her to the jurisdiction of the court). Accordingly, Vakharwala waived any objection to the exercise of personal jurisdiction by entering a general appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Next, Vakharwala argues that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the June 7 video chat occurred outside of Arizona. Once the court has jurisdiction over the parties, the authority to issue an order of protection is derived from statute. Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(A), the Superior Court of Arizona is granted jurisdiction to hear orders of protection upon the filing of a verified petition. An order entered pursuant to that section has the force of a court order. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(J). To violate that order is to disobey a court order under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2810(A)(2). There is no requirement that the acts that give rise to this violation occur within the state boundaries and, thus, a court has subject matter jurisdiction to enforce its own orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Here, the superior court found the June 7 video chat violated the 2015 protective order's restrictions on his contact with Shah.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b64.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Vakharwala argues that a communication must either originate\n   or be received in Arizona for the court to have subject matter jurisdiction, \"[i]t is a settled principle of law that an order issued by a court with jurisdiction over the subject matter must be obeyed by the parties until that order is reversed by orderly and proper proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Chavez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"731153\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/123/538/#p540\">\n    123 Ariz. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"731153\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/123/538/#p540\">\n    601 P.2d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 303 (App. 1979) (citation omitted). Any violation of the court's order, regardless of where it occurred, is still a violation of a court order. Interference with a judicial proceeding is specifically included as one of the acts that qualifies as an act of domestic violence for this very purpose. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(N). The court therefore had subject matter jurisdiction to issue the 2016 order based on Vakharwala's violation of the 2015 order regardless of where the violation took place.\n   <em>\n    State v. Chacon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4045487\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/221/523/#p525\">\n    221 Ariz. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525, \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4045487\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/221/523/#p525\">\n    212 P.3d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 863 (App. 2009) (\"Subject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine a controversy.\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Sufficiency of Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Vakharwala argues there was insufficient evidence to support the court's finding that at least one of the video chats constituted an act of domestic violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to upholding the superior court's ruling, his argument fails.\n   <em>\n    Michaelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323753\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/542/#p544\">\n    234 Ariz. 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323753\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/542/#p544\">\n    323 P.3d 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1195 n.1 (App. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 At the hearing, Shah presented screen shots of her video chat account containing calls and chats from Vakharwala on June 7, 2016. She testified that on June 7, she was in Amsterdam for business and her son was in Arizona with his grandparents. She further testified the video chats were directed at her, in violation of the 2015 order that was still in place. The court concluded Vakharwala directed the June 7 video chat at Shah, based on the verbiage contained in the message. Specifically, \"[y]ou also left the [ ] child alone without any notification and possibly have left the country without [ ] notice.\" The superior court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Vakharwala's argument that the chat was not directed at Shah. Contact directly with Shah was strictly prohibited by the 2015 order. Based on the verbiage of the communication, there can be no mistake: Vakharwala's transmission was directed at Shah. The court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Vakharwala violated the 2015 order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cardoso v.

Rule 38(h)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Vakharwala argues the superior court violated Arizona Rule of Protective Order Procedure 38(h), which requires that \"[a]t the conclusion of the hearing, the judicial officer must state the basis for continuing, modifying, or revoking the protective order.\" Because the court stated on the record its basis for continuing the order, we reject Vakharwala's argument that, because the hearing minute entry did not specify the basis, the court violated Rule 38(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Court Advisement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Finally, Vakharwala argues the superior court should not have advised him at the start of the hearing of potential firearm restrictions in the event the court affirmed the protective order,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3602(G)(4), and of potential immigration consequences, if he were to testify, and that in doing so, the court \"intimidated\" Vakharwala to \"[e]nsure\" he did not testify. Vakharwala did not raise these arguments in the superior court, and therefore he has waived them here.\n   <em>\n    Hahn v. Pima Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"666948\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/200/167/#p172\">\n    200 Ariz. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172, \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"666948\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/200/167/#p172\">\n    24 P.3d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619 (App. 2001) (\"[T]he failure to raise an issue [ ] at the trial level ... constitutes a waiver of the issue.\") (citation omitted). Even had he challenged the court's admonition, these arguments are without merit. Vakharwala does not argue that the information the court gave him was incorrect, but simply that he was subjectively intimidated by the advisement and therefore did not testify. To testify or not was Vakharwala's choice. He\n   chose not to testify and his retrospective challenge is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the superior court's continuance of the 2016 protective order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    For example, the decree stated Vakharwala may use video chat to contact their son, but \"[s]hall not initiate multiple communications in the event the first attempt is unsuccessful, but instead shall be free to make one follow up call, thereafter awaiting the child's return call.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Although Shah did not file an answering brief, in our discretion, we decline to consider her failure to do so as a confession of error.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cardoso v.
