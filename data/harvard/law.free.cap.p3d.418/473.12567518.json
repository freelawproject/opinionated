In April 2012, an officer with the Tucson Police Department was investigating an incident involving Pina-Barajas when he looked into the cab of Pina-Barajas's truck and saw the handle of a gun. The officer obtained a search warrant and found three handguns, a pistol magazine, and ammunition. After first denying that he owned the items, Pina-Barajas later admitted to owning the guns, to having been convicted of a felony, and that \"he wasn't supposed to have guns.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 At trial, Pina-Barajas sought to admit additional statements he had made to detectives explaining he had obtained the guns after a certain man threatened him and shot at him approximately two weeks earlier. Pina-Barajas also sought to admit the statements pursuant to the rule of completeness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Evid. 106. The court precluded the statements on both grounds, and the jury found Pina-Barajas guilty of possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. The court sentenced him to an enhanced, minimum term of three years. Pina-Barajas appealed; we have jurisdiction.

Specifically, he argues he was entitled to introduce certain statements he made to detectives establishing that defense and to have the jury instructed accordingly.

Ct. App. Mar. 20, 2018). To warrant an instruction a defendant need only produce \"slightest evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201403818\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To establish necessity, a defendant must show that he \"was compelled to engage in the proscribed conduct and ... had no reasonable alternative to avoid imminent ... injury greater than the injury that might reasonably result from the person's own conduct.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-417(A). An imminent injury is one that is immediate, \"about to occur,\" or \"impending.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Dominguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032264\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/226/\">\n    236 Ariz. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 4-6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032264\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/226/\">\n    338 P.3d 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 969 (App. 2014),\n   <em>\n    quoting The American Heritage Dictionary\n   </em>\n   879 (5th ed. 2011). A threat of imminent injury is necessarily distinct from one of \"eventual harm,\" which \"would functionally erase the imminence element from our statute's definition of the necessity defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   , --- Ariz. ----, --- P.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201403818\">\n    2018 WL 1403818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00b6 9. In\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   , this court determined a threat occurring almost \"a month\" before the defendant was found in possession of a weapon was too remote in time to establish \"slightest evidence\" of a threat of imminent injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Further, in addressing other justification defenses, Arizona courts have determined that justification based on imminent or immediate threats dissipates rapidly or is\n   confined within a particular transaction.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-404 to 13-421. In\n   <em>\n    In re Roy L.\n   </em>\n   , this court concluded that a juvenile carrying a firearm was properly precluded from arguing self-defense because, on the day he was arrested, he had not seen the rival gang member who had threatened him.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"216949\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/197/441/\">\n    197 Ariz. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"216949\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/197/441/\">\n    4 P.3d 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 990 (App. 2000). In\n   <em>\n    State v. Almeida\n   </em>\n   , we stated that a justification instruction for crime prevention is not warranted once a crime has been \"fully completed, leaving nothing to prevent.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041662\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/77/\">\n    238 Ariz. 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041662\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/77/\">\n    356 P.3d at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But we determined the defendant was entitled to a crime-prevention instruction because \"[t]he evidence supported an ongoing episode of road rage ... rather than a discrete aggravated assault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 In addition to imminence, the necessity defense requires that the defendant have had no reasonable alternative. \u00a7 13-417(A). Thus, the risk of injury must be both imminent and the person at risk must have no reasonable alternative to avoid that injury short of violating the law. We read these two core requirements of a necessity defense together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Gaynor-Fonte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57567\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/211/516/\">\n    211 Ariz. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"57567\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/211/516/\">\n    123 P.3d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1155 (App. 2005) (we interpret individual provisions in context of entire statute). Specifically, a threat of injury must be sufficiently imminent that reasonable persons would have lacked the time to pursue reasonable lawful alternatives. Ordinarily, as time elapses, other reasonable, legal courses of action become increasingly available to such persons, lessening their need to violate the law to avoid an imminent injury. By this standard, few potential harms are so imminent that they must be addressed with urgent unlawful action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Here, the statements Pina-Barajas sought to admit could have established that he had obtained and kept the guns in response to incidents that had taken place two weeks earlier. Nothing in Pina-Barajas's statements indicates that he had been subjected to any threat in the intervening period. Nor has Pina-Barajas made any showing that he lacked any legal alternatives during those two weeks, or that those alternatives-such as alerting law enforcement to his predicament-were unreasonable. Accordingly, by the time officers found the guns in his truck, the original threat of harm could not reasonably be characterized as imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Relying on\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   , Pina-Barajas argues he was facing an ongoing and continuing threat, which is \"always imminent\" and \"could materialize at any moment.\" In\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   , however, the defendant's duress defense hinged on the ongoing threat of physical harm she faced over many months because her husband \"set the rules of the house,\" abused her if she challenged his authority, and constantly supervised her.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=243%20Ariz.%20131\">\n    243 Ariz. 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 22-26, 402 P.3d at 1023-24. Nothing in the instant case suggests the person who had threatened Pina-Barajas had any presence, much less such a continuing proximity, in the two weeks between the incident and the time officers discovered the guns. Indeed, that Pina-Barajas kept the guns locked in the cab of his truck, where they were not readily available to him while in his home, undercuts any argument based on an imminent threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Relying on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Panter\n   </em>\n   , Pina-Barajas insists the legislature could not have intended to make prohibited possessors \"helpless targets for assassins,\" divested of the right to defend themselves.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1465468\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/688/268/#p271\">\n    688 F.2d 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271 (5th Cir. 1982). But in\n   <em>\n    Panter\n   </em>\n   , the defendant, who had been stabbed and wrestled to the ground, grabbed a co-worker's gun and shot his assailant as he continued to attack him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1465468\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/688/268/#p271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1465468\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/688/268/#p271\">\n    at 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Panter\n   </em>\n   serves as a concrete illustration of imminent harm. Similarly, although nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 13-417 or 13-3102 prevents a prohibited possessor from threatening force by means of a firearm, that justification is narrowly circumscribed by the tandem requirements that the threat of harm be imminent and that no reasonable alternative exists. Because Pina-Barajas cannot establish by \"slightest evidence\" that he had been facing an imminent injury when found in possession of the guns, he cannot establish a legal basis for a necessity instruction and, therefore, the court properly precluded both the defense and his statements in support thereof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   , --- Ariz. ----, --- P.3d at ----\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201403818\">\n    2018 WL 1403818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Completeness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 Pina-Barajas also argues he should have been permitted to introduce the\n   same statements under the rule of completeness because they supplied the necessary context to understand his admissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

Concerning these issues, Pina-Barajas's relevant statements were that he owned the guns and that he was a convicted felon who \"wasn't supposed to have guns.\" Because the trial court properly precluded Pina-Barajas from arguing justification by necessity, his reasons for possessing the guns were irrelevant and devoid of any probative value on the issues before the jury.
