Employers agreed to pay personal injury claims that were not compensable under common law. In exchange, workers agreed to forfeit common law tort remedies. The IIA gives the worker the right to appeal the decision of the Department of Labor and Industries to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals. Either party may appeal the decision of the Board to superior court. In 2013, Brandon Afoa filed a claim for 24-hour-a-day in-home attendant care services. Based on an independent assessment, the Department agreed to 16 hours a day for in-home attendant care services. The Board affirmed the decision. Afoa appealed to superior court and filed a jury demand. The jury found the Board correctly decided that Afoa needed only 16 hours a day for attendant care services. Afoa seeks reversal of the jury verdict. Afoa claims limiting the record in an IIA appeal to the evidence presented at the Board violates his right to a jury trial under article I, section 21 of the Washington Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine. We reject the argument that the IIA violates the right to a jury trial under article I, section 21 or separation of powers. The legislature had the authority to abolish the common law cause of action for negligence for workers and in its place enact workers' compensation under the IIA. The IIA limits the appeal to superior court to the certified record of the evidence presented to the Board, and under the civil rules the superior court IIA appeal is a special proceeding. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Industrial Injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Brandon Afoa worked at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for Evergreen\n   Aviation Ground Logistics Enterprises Incorporated. On December 26, 2007, Afoa was severely injured at work. Afoa is a paraplegic with nerve damage to his right arm and hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 After release from the hospital, the Department of Labor and Industries (Department) paid for 24-hour-a-day in-home attendant care services. When Afoa was stable, the Department reduced in-home attendant care services to 16 hours a day. Afoa's father Mataala Te'o and Afoa's sister Hannah Mulifai provided in-home care services through Maxim Healthcare Services. Te'o provided care for Afoa during the day and Mulifai was available to provide care later in the day and at night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Denial of Request for Additional In-Home Care Services\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2013, Afoa filed a claim to increase the amount the Department paid for In-home attendant care services from 16 to 24 hours a day. At the request of the Department, registered nurse consultant Elaine Baker conducted an assessment to determine necessary in-home attendant care services for Afoa. Baker recommended 16 hours a day for in-home attendant care services. The Department issued a notice of decision on January 30, 2014. The Department denied the request to increase in-home attendant care services to 24 hours a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Appeal to the Board\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Afoa appealed the decision to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (Board). An industrial appeals judge (IAJ) conducted a hearing on the appeal. A number of witnesses testified, including Afoa, Te'o, Mulifai, occupational therapist Christiane Buhl, occupational nurse consultant Kimberly Skoropinski, and registered nurse Baker. The IAJ admitted into evidence the videotaped deposition testimony of Afoa's expert Dr. Paul Nutter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Occupational therapist Buhl worked with Afoa before his discharge from the hospital to skilled nursing care. Buhl focused on \"strengthening his upper extremities, using his right arm, and increasing his time out of bed.\" Buhl testified that with assistance, Afoa could dress, groom, and feed himself. According to Buhl, Afoa \"needed maximum assistance\" for 50 to 75 percent of the tasks needed to bathe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Afoa testified about his injuries and the in-home care services Te'o and Mulifai provide for him. Te'o and Mulifai testified about caring for Afoa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Occupational nurse consultant Skoropinski testified that initially, Afoa received 24-hour attendant care, but when he \"became more stable, care hours were reduced to 16.\" Skoropinski testified the Department pays \"for actual care provided and not for hours that the caregiver is sleeping.\" Skoropinski described the tasks necessary for the care of Afoa and testified Afoa \"needed only 6 hours of attendant care per day, but the Department continues to pay for 16.\" Skoropinski testified that \"care services are not paid for on a per shift basis and the 16 hours per day payment is intended to be spread throughout a 24-hour day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Registered nurse consultant Baker testified about her assessment of the number of hours Afoa needed for in-home attendant care services. Baker testified the Washington Administrative Code \"allow[s] for attendant care to take care of the worker[']s activities of daily living and not chore services.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After reviewing the caregiver records, Baker recommended the Department provide 16 hours of attendant care each day. Baker testified that \"even ... if each task were accounted for it would not add up to that amount.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Afoa's expert Dr. Nutter testified that in his opinion, \"optimal care would be for [Afoa] to have 24-hour aide services.\" However, Dr. Nutter admitted he told the Department that \"continuously after January 1, 2013 ... 16 hours of care would be appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 The IAJ affirmed the decision of the Department to deny the request for 24-hour-a-day in-home attendant care services. The IAJ found, \"The time necessary to perform these tasks, along with other daily needs, do not come close to a need for the caregivers to\n   be compensated for 24 hours.\" The IAJ concluded that while Te'o and Mulifai are available throughout a 24-hour period, \"their services are not needed constantly through the day.\" Based on \"the present tasks of daily living\" and other necessary attendant care, the IAJ concluded the Department \"is adequately compensating Mr. Afoa's caregivers with its determination of 16 hours per day\" and affirmed the January 30, 2014 Department decision to deny the claim for 24-hour care services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The proposed decision and order states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   2.
