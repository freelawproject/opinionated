Kemmish, Jr. We hold that under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 36-2804.03(C), a physician's recommendation letter issued pursuant to California's Compassionate Use Act is equivalent to a registry identification card issued to an Arizona resident under Arizona's Medical Marijuana Act (\"Act\") and a visiting qualifying patient, as defined by the Act, is entitled to possess and use medical marijuana in Arizona. Accordingly, we affirm the superior court's dismissal of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 On August 24, 2016, two Arizona Department of Public Safety officers stopped Kemmish, a California resident, for failing to\n   have required headlamps. During the traffic stop, the officers noticed a marijuana odor emanating from the vehicle and observed a white pipe with black residue in plain view. The officers conducted a search of Kemmish's vehicle, and he admitted the pipe was his. He also told the officers he had medical-grade marijuana in the vehicle that he purchased in California. The officers found the marijuana and marijuana/THC wax in the vehicle. The officers asked Kemmish whether he had a medical marijuana card. Kemmish told the officers he had a document permitting him to purchase medical marijuana in California, and showed the officers a physician's recommendation letter obtained pursuant to California's Compassionate Use Act. The physician's recommendation letter stated that in the physician's \"professional opinion, [Kemmish] would significantly benefit from the use of medical marijuana,\" and \"approve[d] the use of cannabis as medicine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The State indicted Kemmish on one count of possession of narcotic drugs (THC wax), one count of possession of marijuana, and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia. Kemmish moved to dismiss the indictment with prejudice, arguing that under the Act his physician's recommendation letter allowed him to possess the THC wax and marijuana in Arizona. After oral argument, the superior court granted the motion and dismissed the charges against Kemmish. The State timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4032(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 We review a superior court's decision to grant a motion to dismiss for an abuse of discretion,\n   <em>\n    State v.

The statute's language provides all that is required for a visiting qualifying patient to possess or use medical marijuana in Arizona is to have a \"registry identification card, or its equivalent.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2804.03(C). \"Equivalent\" means: \"(1) Equal in value, force, amount, effect, or significance; (2) Corresponding in effect or function; nearly equal; virtually identical.\"\n   <em>\n    Equivalent\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore, \u00a7 36-2804.03(C) allows a visiting qualifying patient to possess or use medical marijuana in Arizona if the patient has documentation that would entitle him to do so under the medical marijuana laws of another state. Whether another state's medical marijuana law requires an identification card, a physician's letter, or some other documentation is immaterial, so long as the documentation is sufficient under the law of the issuing state. If the qualifying visiting patient is authorized by a medical marijuana law in another state \"to possess or use marijuana for medical purposes in the jurisdiction of issuance,\" the patient may possess and use medical marijuana in Arizona.

The parties further agreed the letter permitted Kemmish to possess and use medical marijuana in California. In its order dismissing the indictment, the superior court found Kemmish's physician's recommendation letter was the equivalent of an Arizona registry identification card. Based on these stipulated facts, and our interpretation of \u00a7 36-2804.03(C), the superior court did not err by dismissing the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13 The State argues that treating a physician's recommendation letter as equivalent to a registry identification card puts \u00a7 36-2804.03(C) into conflict with the rest of the Act because the Act \"adopted a clear policy requiring state oversight,\" and a physician's recommendation letter is not issued by a state agency. The State contends an identification card issued pursuant to California's Medical Marijuana Program would be the equivalent of a registry identification card, as the process for obtaining an identification card through both programs is \"nearly identical\" and both include applying for and receiving a card through a state agency. The State maintains that the Compassionate Use Act is broader than the Act, \"does not involve any of the same oversight,\" and there \"are no safeguards to prevent abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14 To support its argument that the Act requires state oversight, the State relies on the Act's provisions requiring a registry identification card to be issued by the State and on the publicity pamphlet circulated with the proposition. Specifically, the State points to an argument \"for\" the proposition by the Arizona Medical Marijuana Policy Project's campaign manager saying, \"[u]nlike California, where it's possible to get a doctor's recommendation to use marijuana for almost any condition, only patients with a limited number of serious and debilitating conditions ... will be able to acquire medical marijuana in Arizona.

Stockwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"716101\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/137/416/#p420\">\n    137 Ariz. 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"716101\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/137/416/#p420\">\n    671 P.2d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (1983) (we \"will not read into a statute something that is not within the manifest intent of the Legislature as gathered from the statute itself\"). Under the Act, visitors, and Arizona residents here less than 30 days, may possess and use marijuana purchased under the medical marijuana laws of another state. The superior court did not err by finding Kemmish's physician's recommendation letter is \"equal in force, effect or significance to an Arizona registry card in Arizona.\"\n   <em>\n    See Equivalent\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 The State further argues its interpretation of \u00a7 36-2804.03(C) is supported by this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Abdi\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Abdi\n   </em>\n   , we stated \"[t]he Act gives a qualifying patient issued a registry identification card by another state the same presumptions and immunities when she visits Arizona.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031716\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/609/#p611\">\n    236 Ariz. at 611, \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031716\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/609/#p611\">\n    343 P.3d at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because we referred in\n   <em>\n    Abdi\n   </em>\n   to the Act's definitions, the State argues we were \"presumably familiar with the definition of registry identification card\" and the above statement \"indicates that the\n   <em>\n    Abdi\n   </em>\n   court operated under the assumption that A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2804.03(C) only applied if a visiting qualifying patient possessed a state issued medical marijuana card.\" However, the issue in\n   <em>\n    Abdi\n   </em>\n   was whether the Act provides a defense against a charge of marijuana possession to an out-of-state caregiver.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031716\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/609/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031716\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/609/#p611\">\n    at 612, \u00b6 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031716\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/609/#p611\">\n    343 P.3d at 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because \u00a7 36-2804.03(C)\"expressly applies only to visiting patients ... [and] makes no reference to a 'visiting designated caregiver,' \" the court held it did not provide a defense to out-of-state caregivers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031716\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/609/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031716\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/609/#p611\">\n    at 611, \u00b6 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4031716\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/609/#p611\">\n    343 P.3d at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court did not consider the meaning of \"equivalent\" as used in \u00a7 36-2804.03(C), or whether a\n   <em>\n    patient\n   </em>\n   who possessed a physician's recommendation letter is entitled to the defense. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Abdi\n   </em>\n   does not \"implicitly reject\" the superior court's ruling or make it \"clear that to be the equivalent of an [Arizona] registry identification card, the documentation relied upon by a visiting qualifying patient must be issued by a state agency,\" as the State contends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 The State also argues holding a physician's recommendation letter to be equivalent to a registry identification would afford non-residents greater rights than Arizona residents, and therefore the superior court's ruling \"works an absurd result.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bussanich v. Douglas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1475921\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/152/447/#p450\">\n    152 Ariz. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1475921\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/152/447/#p450\">\n    733 P.2d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647 (App. 1986) (a result is absurd \"if it is so irrational, unnatural, or inconvenient that it cannot be supposed to have been within the intention of [persons] with ordinary intelligence and discretion\"). The State argues, \"it is illogical to hold that Arizona residents in enacting the [Act] ... would have voted to afford residents of California greater protections than what they were voting to grant themselves.\" Although Kemmish's physician's recommendation letter was not issued by a state agency, the parties agreed Kemmish would have been able to obtain a registry identification card under the Medical Marijuana Program had he applied and paid a fee. Further, Kemmish is only entitled to the limited immunities to possession and use of medical marijuana afforded by the Act, and not to any other defenses he may be entitled to under California's Compassionate Use Act or Medical Marijuana Program. Kemmish is also only permitted to possess, in Arizona, the amount of marijuana authorized by the Act, and is not permitted to purchase medical marijuana in Arizona.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2804.03(C) (\"[A] visiting qualifying patient is not authorized to obtain marijuana from a nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary.\"). Accordingly, we are not convinced interpreting a physician's recommendation letter as the equivalent of a registry identification card affords non-residents greater rights than Arizona residents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 We emphasize the parties stipulated that Kemmish meets the definition of a \"visiting qualifying patient\" and that his physician recommendation letter was issued pursuant to California's Compassionate Use Act and allowed him to possess and use medical marijuana in California. Thus, Kemmish's physician's recommendation letter is equivalent to an Arizona registry identification card\n   for the purposes of \u00a7 36-2804.03(C). We recognize, however, the State's concerns that the Compassionate Use Act does not involve the same oversight as the Act because it permits medical marijuana use and possession with an oral recommendation from a physician,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2011362.5\">\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11362.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), and because it allows California residents to obtain medical marijuana to treat more conditions than the Act allows Arizona residents to obtain medical marijuana to treat.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2011362.5\">\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11362.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) (a physician may recommend medical marijuana for the treatment of delineated illnesses \"\n   <em>\n    or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801(3) (the Department must approve the addition of a debilitating medical condition or treatment to the Act's limited definition). However, Kemmish had a written physician's recommendation and the parties agreed he would qualify for an Arizona registry identification card. Thus, we leave for another day whether an oral recommendation is sufficient documentation under \u00a7 36-2804.03(C). We similarly express no opinion on whether a visiting patient diagnosed with a medical condition that is not defined as a \"debilitating medical condition\" under the Act, but permits him to possess and use medical marijuana in another state, is permitted to possess and use medical marijuana in Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19 The superior court did not abuse its discretion by finding Kemmish's physician's recommendation letter equivalent to a registry identification card and dismissing the indictment. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    A \"registry identification card\" is a \"document issued by the department that identifies a person as a registered qualifying patient,\" A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2801(14), and contains the cardholder's photograph, name, address, and birth date; the card's issuance and expiration dates; and a unique identification number, A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2804.04(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    \"Debilitating medical condition\" is defined by the Act and is limited to listed medical conditions or their treatments, unless the Department approves an additional condition or treatment after receiving a petition from the public.
