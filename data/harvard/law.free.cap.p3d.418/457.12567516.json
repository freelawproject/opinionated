For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 The following facts are not in dispute. In 2012, BHP began rebuilding and refurbishing certain facilities at the Pinto Valley Mine in Globe-facilities that had been inoperable for several years. BHP hired an independent contractor, Tetra Tech Construction Services, Inc. to refurbish the ore chute system in the secondary crusher building. BHP contractually required Tetra Tech to abide by a comprehensive safety program with specific procedures and training for all workers. BHP separately contracted with Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. to provide general construction and safety management for the project, and it hired Atwell Anderson, LLC as the project's general contractor. On September 22, 2012, Tetra Tech employee Jon Pierre Vanoss, who had been assigned to \"fire watch\" duty on the fourth floor of the secondary crusher building, did not return from lunch. Following a search, Vanoss was found on a conveyor belt at the bottom of the number eight chute, having died from an apparent fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In cases later consolidated, the Family brought this action alleging negligence and negligence per se and seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of BHP and the court entered judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b), Ariz. R. Civ. P. After the court denied the Family's motion for new trial, this appeal followed. We have jurisdiction. A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1), 12-2101(A)(1), (5)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Non-Delegable Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 The Family contends the trial court erroneously granted partial summary judgment in favor of BHP, alleging that, as a mine operator, BHP owed a non-delegable duty to Vanoss pursuant to certain mine-safety statutes and regulations. Accordingly, the Family urges that BHP is vicariously liable under the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 424 (1965), for Tetra Tech's failure to abide by required safeguards. We disagree with both contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Whether one party owes another a duty of care is a question of law this court reviews de novo.\n   <em>\n    Stanley v.

Further, although Arizona's mine-safety statutes and regulations impose numerous requirements for the protection of miners, nothing in them indicates\n   the legislature intended to create a right of action by imposing a non-delegable duty that supersedes the well-established rule in Arizona: a landowner is not liable to the employee of an independent contractor for the negligence of that contractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 27-301 to 27-318 ; Ariz.

Sess. Laws, ch. 111, \u00a7 5. But we can find no language therein that indicates any intent to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27-304.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 The Family specifically maintains that \u00a7 27-304(B) imposes a non-delegable statutory duty on BHP. Part of that subsection reads: \"[The operator] shall be responsible for the safe performance of all work under him and for the safety of all employees.\" But the Family overlooks that the preceding sentence appears to contemplate delegation of specific safety responsibilities: \"The operator,\n   <em>\n    or some responsible person with authority appointed by him\n   </em>\n   , shall be on duty at all times when employees are working.\" \u00a7 27-304(B) (emphasis added). In context, then, this section imposes a duty on BHP to operate a safe mine. But it does not expressly prohibit the operator from delegating that responsibility to an independent contractor. Nor does that language necessarily impose vicarious liability on the operator for the negligence of the independent contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 In the absence of such language, the Family emphasizes the relative dates of\n   <em>\n    Welker\n   </em>\n   (1965), our jurisprudence applying the independent-contractor rule in the mining context, and the statutes, which it claims modify that rule (1968). But none of the duties imposed by the later-enacted statutes conflict with the independent-contractor rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carrow Co. v.

Thus, we conclude summary judgment on the issue of vicarious liability was appropriate because Arizona law does not impose non-delegable duties on landowners to the employees of independent contractors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"728699\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/124/114/#p117\">\n    124 Ariz. at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"728699\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/124/114/#p117\">\n    602 P.2d at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rule 702, Ariz. R. Evid., provides that a properly qualified expert \"may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if,\" among other requirements, \"the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data\" and \"the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\" We review a trial court's determinations on the admissibility of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Escamilla v.

Because the court had correctly granted summary judgment in favor of BHP on vicarious liability and non-delegable duty,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-12, it precluded Spadaro from testifying about the statutes and regulations. Our review of Spadaro's disclosure leads us to the same conclusion. His opinions regarding any failure to comply with mine-safety statutes and regulations depended on vicarious liability based on a non-delegable-duty theory of liability rather than BHP's independently tortious conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 The Family asserts the statutes and regulations were relevant as a measure of BHP's duty to provide adequate safety supervision. Although the court permitted Spadaro to testify about BHP's safety-oversight obligation, it correctly precluded any opinion based on mine-safety statutes and regulations because the opinions Spadaro disclosed \"depend[ed] on ... non-delegable duty and ... strict liability.\" Indeed, the statutes and regulations at issue do not prescribe how a mine owner must oversee the work of its independent contractors; rather they either impose general safety obligations or require the use of certain equipment and procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 27-301 to 27-318 ; Ariz. Admin. Code R11-1-101 to R1-11-152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The Family frames the issue as whether statutes and regulations, generally, may operate as the standard of care in a negligence action. But the trial court did not preclude Spadaro's testimony on this ground. Rather, the court's implicit reasoning was that any opinion based on the statutes and regulations at issue was only minimally probative of whether BHP failed to supervise Tetra Tech and risked confusing or misleading the jury by introducing the theory that BHP may be vicariously liable for the failures of Tetra Tech. Therefore, we cannot say the court abused its discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Admissibility of Deposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Family also complains the trial court improperly sustained BHP's untimely objections to \"critical\" portions of the deposition of Stantec employee Tracy Fischer, a former field-safety representative at the Pinto Valley Mine. Relying on Rule 32, Ariz. R. Civ. P., the Family insists BHP waived any objections not made during the deposition and, therefore, the court erred in excluding certain portions of it.

Undoubtedly, this defect reasonably could have been cured had BHP noted its objection at the deposition. However, from a cold record we cannot determine how Fischer might have answered questions establishing whether she had warned BHP about Tetra Tech's dangerous practices\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Vanoss's fall; and we do not see how the trial court could have done so either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 21 The Family insists \"the timeline was clear when considered in context\" of the deposition, but our independent review of the deposition and associated exhibits indicates Fischer does not clearly differentiate incidents and conversations that took place before Vanoss's fall from those that took place after. In particular, the Family argues the trial court's ruling on this point is inconsistent with its earlier ruling granting summary judgment in favor of Stantec, in which the court noted that prior to Vanoss's death, \"Stantec ... had repeatedly communicated to BHP and others the propensity for Tetra Tech's employees to violate safety protocols.\" But the court did not specify that the evidence upon which it relied included Fischer's statements. Rather, the court placed greater emphasis on Stantec's limited role in the days leading up to the fall and, in particular, on the fact that on the day of the fall, \"Stantec had no role in training Vanoss or others, providing safety supervision at the worksite,\" or ensuring compliance with specific safety statutes and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 22 We agree with the trial court that any resolution as to when Fischer's warnings came in the overall timeline is too speculative. Although\n   <em>\n    Finn\n   </em>\n   provides that \" Rule 32 appears to be designed to avoid an unfair l[ ]ying in wait by which another party is prejudiced,\" 1 Ariz.

After asserting she complained to certain Stantec and Atwell Anderson employees, Fischer made the following statements, excluded by the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. And what was each of their responses to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A.

But even assuming these employees made their statements as \"agent[s] or employee[s] on a matter within the scope of [their respective companies'] relationship\" with BHP \"while it existed,\" Ariz. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D), it is not at all apparent whether the purported admissions related to the actions and motivations of BHP rather than Stantec or Atwell Anderson. Although the defects in these statements possibly could have been cured by a timely objection, we will not speculate whether or how Fischer might have testified. Because no theory of admissibility clearly applies to these statements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648632\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/79/199/#p207\">\n    79 Ariz. at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648632\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/79/199/#p207\">\n    286 P.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we cannot say the trial court erred in excluding them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 24 The trial court also excluded the following statements, rejecting the Family's contention that they constituted party admissions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Q.

The Family does not argue BHP is liable to Vanoss as a third party injured by the negligence of a different independent contractor.\n    <em>\n     Ft.

Spadaro's disclosure indicates a regulatory citation may be appropriate based on \"overlapping\" responsibility arising from a mine operator's own acts, omissions, or retained control. But as the trial court stated, \"[it] didn't hear any testimony or see any exhibit\" establishing such a theory.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Accordingly, we also reject the Family's contention that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on both the mine-safety statutes and regulations, themselves, and negligence per se. None of these instructions distinguished between those safety duties retained by BHP and those it had delegated to its independent contractors. Thus, in the absence of any accompanying instruction distinguishing direct and vicarious liability, such instructions risked confusing the jurors as to the appropriate grounds for finding BHP liable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
