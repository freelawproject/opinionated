Appellants entered into two agreements with the City of Middleton (the \"City\") regarding impact fees and public access space for the West Highlands Ranch Subdivision (the \"Project\") located in Middleton, Idaho. Soon thereafter, Appellants asserted the agreements were invalid and unenforceable. In response, the City sought a judgment from the district court declaring the agreements valid and enforceable. The parties eventually stipulated to the validity of the agreements. Both sides filed motions for summary judgment asking the district court to interpret the agreements. The district court ultimately ordered Appellants to designate 12.8 acres of land within the Project as public access space and ruled that Appellants were obligated to provide a financial guarantee, if necessary. Based on the summary judgment order, the district court found the City to be the prevailing party and awarded the City attorney fees under Idaho Code section 12-120(3). Appellants appeal the district court's prevailing party determination. The City cross-appeals the district court's fee award and ruling that Appellants are obligated to provide a financial guarantee, if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2006, the City approved the Project's annexation, zoning, and preliminary plat. Appellants are four entities involved with the Project. Coleman Homes, LLC (\"Coleman\") is the developer who constructs and markets new homes within the Project. West Highlands, LLC (\"West Highlands\") is part owner of the land within the Project. West Highlands Subdivision Homeowner's Association, Inc. (\"West Highlands Association\") is the active homeowners' association charged with maintaining and managing the Project. West\n   Highlands Land Development, LLC (\"West Highlands Land\") is also part owner of the land within the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Due to economic conditions in January 2009, progress on the Project slowed, and Thomas Coleman, owner of Coleman, sent a subsequent application to the City requesting modifications to the Project. In this correspondence, Mr. Coleman proposed that Coleman make certain park improvements, including \"approximately 15.1 acres of individual parks with amenities\" that would remain open for public use but be owned and maintained by West Highlands Association. The City approved the subsequent application in May of 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When the City originally approved the Project in 2006, the City did not have an impact fee ordinance. When the City approved the modifications to the Project in May of 2009, the City still did not have an impact fee ordinance. The City first adopted an impact fee ordinance in July of 2009-Ordinance 447. However, Ordinance 447 was repealed in July 2012. In the years between Ordinance 447's adoption and repeal, the City and Appellants worked toward a resolution regarding impact fees. These negotiations eventually led to the executing and recording of two agreements: the West Highlands Impact Fee Agreement and the Parks Dedication Agreement (collectively, \"Agreements\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The West Highlands Impact Fee Agreement (\"IFA\") was executed between the City, West Highlands, and Coleman. For purposes of this appeal, the relevant language of the IFA states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    4.3\n   </strong>\n   Notwithstanding the above, in accordance with Idaho Code Section 67-8215(2), Developer [Coleman] shall not be subject to development impact fees or credits thereof subsequently adopted by the City for portions of the development where construction has commenced and is pursued according to the terms of the permit or development approval.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Financial Guarantee.\n   </strong>\n   In the event that Developer applies for building permits before completion of the equivalent service level of Parks and Streets, Developer shall provide one or more financial guarantees, the form of which shall be approved by the City, for Parks and Streets yet to be completed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Attorneys' Fees and Costs.\n   </strong>\n   ... In the event a suit or action is filed by either party against the other to interpret or enforce this Agreement, the unsuccessful party to such litigation agrees to pay to the prevailing party all costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees incurred therein, including the same with respect to an appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In sum, the IFA was an agreement that the City would not impose impact fees adopted in the future against Coleman and West Highlands for the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Parks Dedication Agreement (\"PDA\") was executed between the City and West Highlands Association. The PDA ensured that areas within the Project would remain open to the public but were to be maintained and managed by West Highlands Association. For purposes of this appeal, the relevant language of the PDA states: \"[t]he park lands in the Community subject to this Agreement shall be those park lands, constituting approximately 12.80 acres ....\" The PDA, like the IFA, also mentions attorney fees. In that regard, paragraph nine of the PDA states: \"Any dispute pertaining to the performance, interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement shall be subject to mediation. ... The Parties shall share the mediator's fee and other costs of the mediation fees equally; provided, however, each Party shall bear its own legal fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After repealing Ordinance 447, the City adopted a new impact fee ordinance in 2015-Ordinance 541.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The validity of the Agreements came into question at that time and the City sought declaratory relief that\n   the Agreements were, in fact, valid and enforceable. The City began collecting impact fees from Appellants after Appellants repeatedly denied the enforceability of the Agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 1, 2016, Appellants amended their original answer and conceded the validity of the Agreements. The district court entered an order on April 21, 2016, declaring the Agreements were valid and enforceable. The City returned all fees collected during the course of this initial litigation to Appellants on April 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment asking the district court to interpret the Agreements. Appellants argued the Project was responsible for 6.92 acres of public access space under the PDA. Conversely, the City argued the Project was responsible for 15.1 acres of public access space under the PDA. The district court found the terms of the PDA were plain and unambiguous; the Project was responsible for 12.8 acres of public access space. The district court ordered Coleman to develop and designate 12.8 acres of land within the Project as open space available to the public and such space was to be owned, maintained, and operated by West Highlands Association. Additionally, the court ordered that \"Coleman must provide one or more financial guarantees if Coleman applie[d] for building permits before completi [ng] the equivalent service level of parks and streets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The judgment was signed by the district court judge on November 2, 2016, and filed by the clerk on November 7, 2016. Both sides filed petitions for attorney fees and costs. The City and Appellants both sought to enforce the IFA in regards to attorney fees, but neither cited the PDA. The City's attorney fees amounted to $37,397.55. Appellants' attorney fees amounted to $120,847.50. Appellants moved to strike the City's petition for attorney fees and costs alleging the petition was untimely filed and served, but that motion was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court ultimately found the City to be the prevailing party and awarded attorney fees, in the amount of $28,048.17, under Idaho Code section 12-120(3). Appellants timely appealed the district court's prevailing party determination and the district court's finding that the City's petition for attorney fees was timely served and filed. The City cross-appealed the district court's attorney fees award and a purported clerical error in the second amended judgment listing West Highlands as the party obligated to provide a financial guarantee, as opposed to Coleman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES ON APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   1. Whether the district court abused its discretion in declaring the City the prevailing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2. Whether the district court's finding that the City's petition for attorney fees and costs was timely filed and served is based on substantial and competent evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   3. Whether the district court abused its discretion in awarding the City attorney fees in the amount of $28,048.17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   4. Whether the district court erred in the second amended judgment by ruling that West Highlands, LLC was obligated to provide the City a \"financial guarantee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   5.

Middleton also avoided liability on Coleman's breach of contract claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Appellants argue the district court's decision was in error. According to Appellants, the district court erred in its prevailing party analysis by: (1) considering the declaratory judgment; (2) not considering the impact fees the City returned to the Appellants; and (3) not considering that Appellants were four separate entities. For the reasons to be discussed, the district court did not abuse its discretion.

This argument is based on the notion that Appellants admitted early in the case, before summary judgment proceedings, that the Agreements were valid and enforceable. This argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The City sought declaratory relief after Appellants repeatedly asserted that the Agreements they voluntarily entered into were void and unenforceable. Appellants first asserted that the Agreements were void and unenforceable at a public hearing on April 20, 2015. Appellants then sent two letters to the City asserting the Agreements were void and unenforceable on the respective dates of May\n   18, 2015, and May 20, 2015. And again on August 13, 2015, Appellants reaffirmed their stance that the Agreements were void and unenforceable. After Appellants' repeated assertions that the Agreements were void and unenforceable, the City petitioned the district court to declare that the Agreements were, in fact, valid and enforceable. Appellants, in accordance with their prior assertions, initially answered that the Agreements were void and unenforceable. Months later, with leave of court, Appellants amended their answer where they then agreed that the Agreements were valid. In the declaratory ruling the district court stated, \"[c]onsistent with the agreement of the parties ... the [IFA] ... and the [PDA] ... are valid and enforceable.\" Later, in its decision and order awarding attorney fees, the district court considered the declaratory relief granted to the City in its prevailing party analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A district court does not abuse its discretion when the court considers settlements reached by the respective parties in its prevailing party analysis.\n   <em>\n    Hobson Fabricating Corp. v.

Further, although the agreement was eventually reached by all parties, we acknowledge that the City had requested the Agreements be declared valid and enforceable from the beginning of and throughout the litigation. Indeed, it was Appellants' conduct denying the enforceability of the Agreements that finally prompted the City to sue. Thus, the City substantially obtained the relief it sought. Because the City obtained the relief it sought, the district court found the declaratory judgment was entered in the City's favor and the City prevailed in that regard.

In addition to the declaratory judgment, the district court considered the acreage amount awarded. The district court found the City prevailed on the acreage amount because the 12.8 acres awarded under the PDA was closer to the amount requested by the City than the amount requested by Appellants. The district court also considered the dismissed counterclaim in its determination. The counterclaim arose in Appellants' amended answer where Appellants, contrary to their original position, asked the court to find the Agreements valid and enforceable. According to Appellants, the City breached the Agreements by collecting impact fees in the amount of $1,485 in accordance with Ordinance 541. The district court ultimately dismissed the counterclaim because the City returned all collected fees to Appellants after the Agreements were declared valid and enforceable, and thus, the City did not breach the terms of\n   the IFA. The district court, finding that the City avoided all liability on Appellants' counterclaim, found the City prevailed in this regard. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in considering the declaratory judgment, in addition to the acreage award and the dismissed counterclaim, in its prevailing party analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to consider the impact fees the City returned to Appellants in its prevailing party analysis.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Appellants argue the district court abused its discretion because the district court did not consider the impact fees returned by the City in its prevailing party analysis.

In\n   <em>\n    Maslen\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs who had title to a historical airplane brought an action against defendants who refused to surrender possession of the airplane and subsequently placed a lien on the airplane.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

This date is significant because Appellants first argued that the Agreements were void and unenforceable at a public hearing on April 20, 2015. On May 18, 2015, the City received Appellants' first letter declaring the Agreements void and unenforceable. On May 20, 2015, the City received another letter from Appellants declaring the Agreements void and unenforceable. And again on August 13, 2015, Appellants reaffirmed their stance that the Agreements were void and unenforceable. The above-discussed correspondence illustrates it was only after Appellants repeatedly claimed the Agreements to be void and unenforceable that the City began collecting impact fees pursuant to Ordinance 541 and not in accordance with the Agreements. After the Agreements were found to be valid and enforceable, the City returned all fees collected while the litigation was pending.

Appellant filed a motion to disallow attorney fees asserting respondent had failed to timely serve the memorandum of costs.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

According to Appellants, the petition was served on November 28, 2017. However, Appellants only provided a single Affidavit from counsel that did not contradict the service date listed in the record of November 17, 2016. That affidavit stated \"[a]fter a review of my files and a search of documents our office received by fax, it became evident that my office did not receive service copies of the Memorandum of Affidavit.\" Only after serving the motion to strike the City's petition for attorney fees and costs did Appellants contact opposing counsel to obtain a copy of the petition. A copy was provided to Appellants the same day with a certificate of service dated November 17, 2016. That date matches the clerk's filing stamp. The affidavit goes on to state that the Appellants' firm \"utilizes a centralized electronic facsimile receipt and delivery system ... [that] creates a log of all incoming facsimiles.\" However, no log was provided to the district court. Nor is any log included in the record on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The district court, unclear of the actual service date and unpersuaded by Appellants' evidence, found\n   <em>\n    Allstate\n   </em>\n   to be controlling. The Court stated \"[d]efendant's objection to costs and fees was deemed timely where the court was unable to determine from the record when the memorandum of costs was filed.\" Here, the district court could not determine from the record the actual service date and, thus, found the City's petition timely in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Allstate\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, as was held in\n   <em>\n    Gier\n   </em>\n   , even if the City failed to serve its memorandum of costs within the fourteen day period specified by Rule 54(d)(4), such failure does not constitute waiver of the right of attorney fees. Therefore, it cannot be said that the district court's decision was clear error because it is supported by the certificate of service, the filing stamp, and service of a memorandum of costs within fourteen days is not required under Rule 54(d)(4). The district court's finding that the City timely filed and served its petition for attorney fees and costs is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The City alleges the district court erred in only awarding part, but not all, attorney fees incurred because the IFA states \"the unsuccessful party to such litigation agrees to pay to the prevailing party all costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees incurred.\" According to the City, the district court should have awarded all attorney fees incurred and should not have assessed the reasonableness of requested fees under Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(e)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"The calculation of reasonable attorney fees [under Idaho Code section 12-120(3) ] is within the discretion of the trial court[,]\" and this Court will not disturb such calculations absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Farrell v.

The district court recognized its discretion in awarding reasonable attorney fees, applied governing legal standards and exercised reason by examining all the factors of Rule 54(e)(3).

The relevant language for purposes of this illustration is identical; a party objecting to costs must object \"within 14 days of service of a memorandum of costs[.]\" I.R.C.P. 54(d)(5) ;\n    <em>\n     Allstate\n    </em>\n    , 133 Idaho at 600,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"882702\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/133/593/\">\n     990 P.2d at 1211\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Gier\n    </em>\n    , a memorandum of costs was then governed by Rule 54(d)(5).\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173391\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/160/422/#p425\">\n     160 Idaho at 425\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173391\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/160/422/#p425\">\n     374 P.3d at 588\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . A memorandum of costs is now governed by Rule 54(d)(4). However, the relevant language is substantially identical. In\n    <em>\n     Gier\n    </em>\n    , the language of the rule stated: \"[\n    <em>\n     f\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     ailure to file\n    </em>\n    such memorandum of costs within the period prescribed by this rule\n    <em>\n     shall be a waiver of the right of costs\n    </em>\n    .\" 160 Idaho at 425,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173391\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/160/422/#p425\">\n     374 P.3d at 588\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting I.R.C.P. 54(d)(5) (2015) (emphases added) ). The language of Rule 54(d)(4) states: \"[\n    <em>\n     f\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     ailure to timely file\n    </em>\n    a memorandum of costs\n    <em>\n     is a waiver of the right to costs\n    </em>\n    .\" I.R.C.P. 54(d)(4) (emphases added). Thus, both the rule in\n    <em>\n     Gier\n    </em>\n    and Rule 54(d)(4) state that waiver only occurs if the memorandum is not\n    <em>\n     filed\n    </em>\n    within the fourteen-day time period; timeliness of\n    <em>\n     service\n    </em>\n    is irrelevant in the waiver analysis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
