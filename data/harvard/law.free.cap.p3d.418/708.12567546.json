(\"Kemp Stone\") appeals an Order denying its request that attorney fees and costs be assessed against the plaintiffs, The State of Oklahoma ex rel. Jaycee Calan, Lucille Calan, Kace Calan, John E. Kendall, Jr., Jacquelyne Kendall, David F. Hiebert, Jr., Edwina C. Hiebert, Kathryn Weatherby, Jaime Mills, and Travis Mills (collectively \"Taxpayers\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 This appeal arises from a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action brought by Taxpayers and their inclusion of Kemp Stone in their lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kemp Stone claimed that the lawsuit was frivolous as to Kemp Stone, thereby entitling it to attorney fees and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 On September 26, 2011, the City of Miami, Oklahoma (\"City\") received a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   notice signed by ten persons (a sufficient number then) including Taxpayers. The notice complained that a City street project (\"Project\") funded by a sales tax was being unlawfully carried out. The basis of the claim was that the City took bids, used the bids as contracts, and paid out more than $50,000.00 to contractors. All of this was claimed to be in violation of the law concerning municipal contracts and competitive bidding statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 On November 23, 2011, the City filed a declaratory judgment action. Taxpayers intervened and added the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action against City and named entities including Kemp Stone. The intervention petition contained detailed allegations regarding City's actions pertaining to the Project and the claimed unlawful acts by City's officials. The intervention petition alleged that the named entities received unspecified amounts of money from City for the Project and that such money should be repaid to City. The entities were not immediately served because City and Taxpayers engaged in mediation. The mediation was unsuccessful and City dismissed its declaratory judgment action before intervention was granted. Subsequent proceedings not relevant here culminated with Taxpayers filing this\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 The\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   petition recited the history of the intervention petition and alleged City's violations regarding the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petition named the entities, including Kemp Stone, and alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In furtherance of the Street Project it [Kemp Stone] submitted and was awarded a construction bid in excess of $50,000. However, it failed to enter into [a] public construction contract with the City prior to performing working and/or providing materials. Despite this Kemp Stone, Inc. received at least $50,000 for performing work and/or providing materials\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   City filed its Answer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Answer admitted that Kemp Stone submitted a bid and performed work. City's Answer denied the remainder of the allegations about Kemp Stone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Kemp Stone's Amended Answer\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied all allegations against it. Kemp Stone alleged that it did have a contract for all of its work and materials. However, Kemp Stone denied submitting a bid or being paid any money on the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Kemp Stone submitted request for admission to City. In response, City admitted that Kemp Stone neither submitted a bid nor had a bid approved regarding the Project and that Kemp Stone did not have a contract pertaining to the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel for Kemp Stone wrote to counsel for Taxpayers a letter dated May 8, 2015, in which he advised of the receipt of City's discovery request submitted by Kemp Stone and enclosed a copy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel described the discovery response as establishing that Kemp Stone had nothing to do with the Project. He also advised that City's attorney stated that City would amend its Answer to conform to its discovery response about Kemp Stone. City did not file the amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Kemp Stone filed a motion for summary judgment based upon its position that it was not a bidder/contractor on the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Prior to the hearing on Kemp Stone's summary judgment motion, Taxpayers dismissed the action as to Kemp Stone. Kemp Stone then sought attorney fees and costs on the ground that Taxpayers brought a frivolous lawsuit against Kemp Stone because Kemp Stone never had anything to do with\n   the Project that could be considered actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Taxpayers defended on the basis that a reasonable investigation preceded the filing and that the investigation revealed the existence of a claim against Kemp Stone. The investigation included an interview with City's chief financial officer (\"CFO\"). Taxpayers' claims about City's acts were confirmed in an audit performed by the State of Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector. Taxpayers further argued that events following the filing served to confirm the existence of a claim, citing such as the City's Answer and its failure to amend the Answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 In summary, the trial court had the following sequence of events to consider when making its ruling regarding whether the action against Kemp Stone was frivolous.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Taxpayers' Demand, Record p. 1123. Dated September 26, 2011.

Auditor's findings were addressed to Taxpayers and to City. The Auditor found several improper actions relating to the Project consistent with Taxpayers' demands served on City, including \"multiple examples of noncompliance with the Public Competitive Bid Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Prior to filing the petition, counsel for Taxpayers interviewed CFO.

In this case, two statutes provide for\n   fees in case of a frivolous claim. The general statute is 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2011, and the specific statute is part of the\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   statute, 62 O.S.2011, \u00a7 373. The latter, being the specific statute controls.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. State ex rel.

Therefore, as an exception, the Court strictly construes its provision for attorney fees. In\n   <em>\n    Beard v. Richards,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20OK%20117\">\n    1991 OK 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10368449\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/820/812/\">\n    820 P.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court defined the fees for a bad faith injury claim or defense statute, 23 O.S.2011, \u00a7 103, to be an exception to the American Rule and, therefore, strictly construed.\n   <em>\n    Eagle Bluff, L.L.C. v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989379\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/237/173/\">\n    2010 OK 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6989379\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/237/173/\">\n    237 P.3d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179, is an example of strict construction. There, the Court distinguished discretionary transfers from Small Claims Court from mandatory transfers from Small Claims court. Under the statutes only the former had provision for attorney fees. Therefore, attorney fees were not allowed for a mandatory transfer. Another example is\n   <em>\n    Borst v. Bright Mortgage Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1991%20OK%20121\">\n    1991 OK 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10376945\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/824/1102/\">\n    824 P.2d 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.5. There, the Court distinguished recovery on a promissory note from cancellation of a promissory note. Only the former action included attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17 Thus, Kemp Stone must show here that \"\n   <em>\n    all claims\n   </em>\n   stated by the resident taxpayers in the written demand are determined in a court of competent jurisdiction to be frivolous.\" Kemp Stone has not shown that \"all claims\" are frivolous. In fact, the primary basis for the action and Taxpayers' demand appears well grounded in fact and law. When strictly construed, Section 373 does not contemplate separating claims against individual entities for a frivolous determination. Therefore, just as in\n   <em>\n    Eagle Bluff, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Borst\n   </em>\n   , Kemp Stone is not entitled to attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 18 Although the foregoing strict construction of Section 373 resolves the appeal, Kemp Stone maintains that the Taxpayers' lawsuit was frivolous\n   <em>\n    as to Kemp Stone\n   </em>\n   when brought and that inquiry would have revealed that it had nothing to do with their claims about the Project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   A plaintiff's attorney has a duty to investigate prior to filing the action.\n   <em>\n    Navarro v.
