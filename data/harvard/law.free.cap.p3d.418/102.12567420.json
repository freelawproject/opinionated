We must decide whether records containing trade secrets are categorically excluded from public disclosure under the Public Records Act (PRA), ch. 42.56 RCW. We hold that they are not. Applying the injunction standard set forth in RCW 42.56.540, such records may be enjoined from disclosure only if disclosure would clearly not be in the public interest, and would substantially and irreparably damage a person or a vital government interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 The superior court erred by applying the general injunction standard of Civil Rule (CR) 65 articulated in\n   <em>\n    Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Department of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157765\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/96/785/#p792\">\n    96 Wash.2d 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 792,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=638%20P.2d%201213\">\n    638 P.2d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982), and by not adequately considering the PRA's more stringent standard. We therefore reverse the decision below and remand for the trial court to apply the proper standard under RCW 42.56.540.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Respondents Lyft Inc. and Rasier LLC\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   operate car-hailing or \"transportation networking companies\" (TNC) in\n   several locations, including the city of Seattle (City). TNC mobile and Internet-based technology enables consumers to use their smartphones to retain drivers for trips. Drivers connected to the network can access real-time information to respond to consumer requests for rides and carpools. Rasier, in a dominant position with 14,000 drivers in Seattle, competes with Lyft for local market share.\n   \u00b6 4 After the City passed a 2014 ordinance that limited the number of TNC drivers active at any given time, respondents Lyft and Rasier (collectively L/R) organized a coalition to overturn the ordinance through a voter referendum. In response to mediation among the City, L/R, and taxi and for-hire stakeholders in the ground transportation industry, the referendum proposal was withdrawn. The parties agreed that L/R would submit quarterly standardized reports to the City that include the total number of rides, the percentage of rides completed in each zip code, pick-up and drop-off zip codes, the percentage of rides requested but unfulfilled, collision data, and the number of requested rides for accessible vehicles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In response to L/R concerns regarding data confidentiality, a mediation provision stated that \" '[t]he city will work to achieve the highest possible level of confidentiality for information provided\n   <em>\n    within the confines of state law.\n   </em>\n   ' \" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 2703-04 (emphasis added) (alteration in original) (quoting Ex. 101). The mediation terms, including acknowledgement that their ultimate adoption was subject to city council approval, were subsequently enacted as Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 6.310.540. The for-hire vehicle regulatory ordinance provides that \"[i]f a public records request is made of the City for documents that have been designated by the providing party as confidential or proprietary, the City shall provide third party\n   notice to the providing party prior to disclosure.\" SMC 6.310.540(D). Likewise, under a confidentiality agreement between the City and Rasier subject to the requirements of the PRA, the City notifies Rasier upon receipt of a PRA request implicating disclosure of Rasier-designated confidential records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 L/R's zip code reports to the City are extracted through queries from L/R's databases containing driver and passenger records collected using L/R's software programs. In consultation with L/R, the City established a secure, encrypted file transfer protocol (FTP) website for L/R submissions of required quarterly reports. Access to this FTP site is controlled using log-in credentials, both externally and within city government. The City limits access to L/R quarterly reports and derivative public records to persons with a need to know this information within its departments of transportation, and financial and administrative services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 Besides using the L/R zip code reports for regulatory enforcement, the City considers the records to analyze overall TNC impact on transportation systems and infrastructure; enforcement staffing needs and allocation; vehicle-miles traveled and traffic congestion; service levels for all sections of the city; and service disparities such as redlining and discrimination based on impermissible factors, including race and religion. The for-hire vehicle ordinance requires that City staff prepare an annual report for the chair of the Taxi, For-hire, and Limousine Regulations Committee of the city council, summarizing TNC-reported public records. SMC 6.310.100(B). Although this city reporting requirement was not included in the mediation terms, neither Lyft nor Rasier objected to this language in the proposed ordinance. The City delayed circulation or release of the draft 2015 report to the committee and city council, after L/R objected and threatened litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 L/R insist that their quarterly zip code reports to the City consist of trade secrets protected under the UTSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp't Lyft's Answering Br. at 16; Resp't Rasier LLC's Answering Br. at 1. L/R can consider data compilations and extracts to assess demand for their services, new product launch targets, marketing and pricing strategies, and market competition. While each L/R driver possesses knowledge contained in the records corresponding to individual trips driven, L/R limit employee access to the quarterly zip code reports submitted to the City. L/R\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   do not share their quarterly zip code reports with each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 In January 2016, appellant Jeff Kirk, a resident of Texas, submitted a PRA request to the City seeking L/R reports for the final two quarters of 2015. Kirk obtains this information from Seattle taxi companies, and researchers examine this information to detect evidence of redlining in the provision of ground transportation to the detriment of persons or communities of color. Specifically, Kirk seeks release of records submitted by L/R to the City as required by SMC 6.310.540, including the percentage and number of rides picked up in each zip code, and the pick-up and drop-off zip codes of each ride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 In response to his PRA request, the City advised Kirk that the subject reports were labeled by L/R as confidential. The City provided notice of the request to L/R, which then sought an injunction under the PRA to prevent disclosure of the requested reports to Kirk. The King County Superior Court issued a temporary injunction granting partial relief as to zip code records but denying injunctive relief as to data indicating L/R's total number of rides, total number of rides requesting an accessible vehicle, and crime reports. Following an evidentiary hearing in which the court considered live and deposition testimony, the court granted L/R's request for a permanent injunction preventing disclosure of the records, concluding that the zip code reports are trade secrets under the UTSA and, therefore, exempt from disclosure\n   under the PRA. Kirk and the City sought direct review of the injunction by this court, and we granted review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Under the PRA, public records\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   may be withheld only \" 'in accordance with a statute that exempts or prohibits disclosure in whole or in part of specific information or records.' \"\n   <em>\n    Progressive Animal Welfare Soc'y v.

To determine whether the records at issue in this case may be withheld from disclosure, we consider the relevant provisions of both the PRA and the UTSA. While we conclude that L/R's zip code records likely meet the definition of \"trade secrets\" under the UTSA, L/R are not entitled to an injunction under the applicable PRA standard, RCW 42.56.540, unless they can establish on remand\n   that disclosure is clearly not in the public interest and in fact poses substantial and irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A. The PRA and \"Other Statute\" Exemptions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The PRA \"begins with a mandate of full disclosure of public records; that mandate is then limited only by the precise, specific, and limited exemptions which the\n   Act provides.\"\n   <em>\n    PAWS,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"437224\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/125/243/#p251\">\n    125 Wash.2d at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=884%20P.2d%20592\">\n    884 P.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When the PRA injunction statute is invoked, this court has described the analysis as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [W]e start with the proposition that the [PRA] establishes an affirmative duty to disclose public records unless the records fall within specific statutory exemptions or prohibitions. It follows that in an action brought pursuant to the injunction statute ( [former] RCW 42.17.330 [ (1975),] [\n   <em>\n    recodified as\n   </em>\n   RCW 42.56.540 ] ), the initial determination will ordinarily be whether the information involved is in fact within one of the act's exemptions or within some other statute which exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. If it is not so exempted or prohibited, then the records are to be released subject to the agency's right in certain situations to delete identifying details from the record, in accordance with another specific provision of the act. If it is exempted or prohibited,\n   <em>\n    then the judicial inquiry commences.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Spokane Police Guild v.

In sum, when a PRA request is made and a third party asserts an \"other statute\" exemption, the court first looks at whether the other statute exempts disclosure in the particular context. If the court finds the information is exempt under the \"other statute,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   then \"judicial inquiry commences\" with the court applying the PRA injunction standard.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=769%20P.2d%20283\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B. L/R Zip Code Reports Qualify as Trade Secrets under the UTSA, Which Is Incorporated as an \"Other Statute\" under the PRA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 14 It is undisputed that no provision of the PRA exempts trade secrets from disclosure, so any exemption would need to be pursuant to an \"other statute.\" Trade secrets are addressed in the UTSA, which was enacted to subsume claims of civil liability for misappropriation of trade secrets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 19.108.900(1) (\"This chapter displaces conflicting tort, restitutionary, and other law of this state pertaining to civil liability for misappropriation of a trade secret.\"). The UTSA contains no specific exemption of trade secrets from public disclosure laws. Recognizing this, Lyft cites several narrowly focused statutes outside the UTSA for the proposition that the protection of trade secrets enjoys broad policy support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, none of these statutes provides a relevant disclosure exemption in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 15 In\n   <em>\n    PAWS\n   </em>\n   , we concluded the UTSA may qualify as a PRA \"other statute\" in some contexts.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"437224\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/125/243/#p251\">\n    125 Wash.2d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=884%20P.2d%20592\">\n    884 P.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Two state statutes [including the UTSA] qualify as 'other statutes' in the present context, although neither justifies withholding the grant proposal in its entirety.\").\n   <em>\n    PAWS\n   </em>\n   requires that courts determine whether the UTSA is an \"other statute\" based on individual review-in this case, in regard to the L/R zip code reports.

L/R argue that trade secrets must be protected from disclosure under the UTSA without regard to the PRA injunction standard. Injunctive relief for trade secrets under the UTSA follows the general standard of CR 65. Specifically, \" 'one who seeks relief by temporary or permanent injunction must show (1) that he has a clear legal or equitable right, (2) that he has a well-grounded fear of immediate invasion of that right, and (3) that the acts complained of are either resulting in or will result in actual and substantial injury to him' \".\n   <em>\n    Tyler Pipe Indus.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157765\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/96/785/#p792\">\n    96 Wash.2d at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=638%20P.2d%201213\">\n    638 P.2d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Port of Seattle v.

As to the public interest, the court below merely referenced statutes cited by L/R that protect specific information in specific contexts, and cited the holding in\n   <em>\n    PAWS\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   CP at 2713-15. But a finding that the protection of certain trade secrets furthers a public interest does not amount to a finding that public disclosure of the specific L/R zip code records collected by the City is \"clearly not in the public interest.\" Nor would such a finding logically follow, given the public interest in analyzing zip code records, including the interest in discerning discriminatory conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 34 L/R emphasize the general policy underlying the UTSA to protect trade secrets and prevent misappropriation. As noted above, however, the UTSA does not itself support an injunction here, and the statutes L/R cite express a policy of protecting specific information in specific contexts, not a categorical legislative declaration that trade secrets should not be subject to public disclosure laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The UTSA addresses misappropriation, threatened misappropriation, and related tort claims and contemplates unfair competition among private actors; it does not address public disclosure laws. Once records that comprise trade secrets are deemed important enough to warrant collection by agencies for public purposes, additional considerations of\n   public interest pertain. Stated differently, the UTSA policy of restraining company X from wrongfully misappropriating company Y's trade secrets does not necessarily translate into a policy of preventing public inspection of records important to government purposes. The more stringent injunction standards of the PRA reflect the importance of public oversight over public records, in contrast to the lesser UTSA standard that applies in disputes involving misappropriation of trade secrets by private parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 35 The records at issue in this case arguably involve matters of public interest, and there is no trial court finding to the contrary. The City collects zip code data from taxi companies, and it uses the data from those companies and the TNCs to evaluate traffic and infrastructure concerns, determine future needs, and assess claims of discriminatory redlining. Appellant Kirk notes that TNC redlining in Seattle has been detected through academic research studies. Kirk's Statement of Grounds for Direct Review at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the superior court acknowledged the public interest in data that might evidence redlining, it erroneously concluded that the public could trust the City to adequately police redlining using the zip code reports, obviating the need for public disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CP at 2719 (\"But the City is able to analyze the data to ensure no red-lining is occurring and city witnesses testified at trial that they had no evidence of any such practice\n   occurring at either [Lyft or Rasier].\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   This conclusion ignores the core policy underlying the PRA, under which \"[t]he people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them.\"\n   RCW 42.56.030. Further consideration of the public interest element is required, and we remand to the trial court to evaluate all of the facts in light of the PRA's requirement that disclosure \"may be enjoined\" when \"clearly not ... in the public interest.\" RCW 42.56.540.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 36 As to the harm element, the City insists that L/R have not established \"that disclosure would cause actual and substantial injury [under the CR 65 test], let alone 'irreparable and substantial damage' under the PRA.\" Opening Br. of Appellant City at 33.

However, based apparently on its legal error that trade secrets are categorically exempt from disclosure, the court reached the circular conclusion that \"public disclosure of trade secrets under the Public Records Act constitutes irreparable harm because such disclosure 'destroys the information's status as a trade secret.' \" CP at 2718. The trial court's additional findings relating to harm failed to consider\n   the heightened PRA standard. In its injunction analysis under\n   <em>\n    Tyler Pipe Industries\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that disclosure will cause actual and substantial injury because L/R \"will be able to gain an unfair competitive advantage against each other with the disclosure of this data.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513500\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/991/511/#p521\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And, albeit without attribution to the record, the court accepted the assertion that \"disclosure of Lyft's trade secret Zip Code Data presents the company with an existential threat.\" CP at 2720.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   If true, then disclosure might result in substantial and irreparable damage, but the trial court never considered the facts in light of this standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 38 We remand for the court to consider its findings reached under the CR 65 standard in light of the \"substantial and irreparable\" harm standard of the PRA.

Meaningful assessment against PRA standards is required in order to grant an injunction preventing disclosure under the PRA. This assessment involves the resolution of disputed facts. We recognize that it might be possible to conclude from the lack of adequate findings under the PRA that the heightened standard for injunctive relief is not met. However, for this court to reach such a conclusion seems heavy-handed considering the proceedings below, which were largely shaped\n   by the trial court's legal error in applying the\n   <em>\n    Tyler Pipe Industries\n   </em>\n   injunction standard. We believe a remand is an appropriate and cautious remedy to ensure that all facts have been fully considered and assessed under the proper injunction standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 39 The PRA injunction standard applies to public records that constitute trade secrets under the UTSA, just as it applies to other records encompassed by any PRA exemption. In line with our prior cases interpreting the PRA injunction standard, we recognize the two-step analysis courts must engage in when considering injunctive relief: (1) whether the public record is subject to an exemption under any PRA provision or an applicable \"other statute,\" and (2) whether the party seeking to enjoin disclosure has shown that disclosure is clearly not in the public interest, and would result in substantial and irreparable harm to any person or vital government interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 40 We reverse the superior court's order granting injunctive relief and reject application of the\n   <em>\n    Tyler Pipe Industries\n   </em>\n   injunction standard for public records constituting trade secrets. Such records are not categorically exempt from disclosure or removed from the purview of RCW 42.56.540 when an injunction is sought. We remand for the superior court to make the fact-based determination of whether L/R are entitled to injunctive relief under the PRA to prevent the City from disclosing the requested L/R zip code records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Johnson, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Madsen, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Owens, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Yu, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 41 Ultimately, this case is about competing interests: our legislature's recognition that trade secrets should not be unnecessarily disclosed versus the robust disclosure mechanism contemplated by the Public Records Act (PRA),\n   ch. 42.56 RCW.

Although the dissent expresses a need to balance disclosure with trade secrets protection, dissent (Gonzalez, J.) at 119-20, it provides no rationale why the PRA injunction standard is inadequate at addressing the required balancing declared by the legislature.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RCW 42.56.030 (\"The people insist on remaining informed so that they may maintain control over the instruments that they have created. This chapter shall be liberally construed and its exemptions narrowly construed to promote this public policy and to assure that the public interest will be fully protected. In the event of conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other act, the provisions of this chapter shall govern.\"). We therefore remand for trial court performance of the required balancing test in RCW 42.56.540.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mark Scott,\n    <em>\n     Study Finds Some Uber and Lyft Drivers Racially Discriminate,\n    </em>\n    N.Y.

It is not enough for the court to proclaim that other available records might serve the public's or a requester's needs. The question under the PRA is whether city compliance with the specific PRA request is clearly not in the public interest.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The superior court found that \"Lyft's market share is a fraction of Uber's market share. Because Uber has such a dominant position in the TNC market, it could use Lyft's data to squeeze Lyft out of the Seattle market, giving Uber a monopoly in the TNC market. Such an occurrence is not in the public's interest.\" CP at 2720. Even if the court's conclusions might be sufficient to prevent disclosure of Lyft's zip code reports, the analysis regarding disclosure of Rasier's zip code records is missing for both elements: whether disclosure (1) \"would clearly not be in the public interest\" and (2) \"would substantially and irreparably damage any person, or ... vital governmental functions.\" RCW 42.56.540. In this regard, because the dissent (Gonzalez, J.) at 116-17 n.3 lumps together Lyft, Uber, and Rasier under the moniker \"Lyft,\" it shields Rasier from any scrutiny under the injunction test and thereby neglects to fully adjudicate the issues before us. The dissent thus repeats a mistake of the trial court by failing to apply the required injunction test independently to each of the respondents.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    CP at 2720.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    There is no dispute that the City of Seattle agreed to treat the zip code data as confidential.
