The superior court concluded that the plaintiffs' claims created waiver of the protections of the attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine with respect to their communications with their litigation defense counsel. Applying the test for implied waiver set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hearn v. Rhay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709548\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/68/574/\">\n    68 F.R.D. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.

The plaintiffs cannot be said to have knowingly and voluntarily waived privilege-the purported waiver resulted not from plaintiffs' own act, but from the defendants' independent decision to defend on a contributory negligence theory. The protected communications have no inherent relevance to the malpractice claims. Further, preservation of the privilege does not deny the defendants access to information vital to their defense. We therefore accept jurisdiction and grant relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. and Hilltop Securities Inc. (collectively, \"Underwriters\") were principal underwriters of a municipal bond offering that financed the construction of an event center in the Town of Prescott Valley. Stinson Leonard Street L.L.P. (\"Stinson\") served as Underwriters' counsel in connection with the offering, and Kutak Rock L.L.P. and its partner Patrick Ray (collectively, \"Kutak\") served as bond counsel. Kutak and Stinson are hereinafter referred to collectively as \"Bond Counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 The bonds were sold in late 2005 pursuant to official statements and related bond documents, which Bond Counsel helped prepare. In 2009, the bondholders brought an action (\"the Bond Litigation\") against Underwriters, Bond Counsel, and others. The bondholders alleged that the official statements misrepresented debt-service funding projections and debt-service security, and that the bond documents were defective with respect to the security interest. Underwriters retained counsel (\"Bond Litigation Counsel\") to defend them in the Bond Litigation. Underwriters expended millions of dollars in defense\n   costs in the Bond Litigation before eventually settling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2014, Underwriters brought a malpractice action (\"the Malpractice Litigation\") against Bond Counsel. Underwriters assert professional negligence claims arising from Bond Counsel's preparation of the official statements and bond documents, and they assert a negligent misrepresentation claim arising from an opinion letter that Kutak provided in connection with the bond offering. On the professional negligence claims, Underwriters seek as damages their cost of defending the Bond Litigation. Bond Counsel assert, as an affirmative defense, that Underwriters' defense costs were not reasonable. Bond Counsel also asserts that Underwriters' damages were caused wholly or partially by Underwriters or others, and Bond Counsel have filed notices of non-parties at fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Underwriters produced Bond Litigation Counsel's billing records to Bond Counsel. Underwriters moved for a protective order, however, with respect to Bond Counsel's discovery requests for information protected by the attorney-client privilege and the work-product doctrine. The superior court denied Underwriters' motion, reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [Underwriters'] affirmative assertion that malpractice by [Bond Counsel] caused them to incur all of their attorney's fees in the bond litigation is an affirmative claim which squarely puts in dispute what their attorneys in the [B]ond [L]itigation were doing and why they were doing it. What those attorneys were doing and why they were doing it is vital information to [Bond Counsel] in mounting a defense to such a claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Applying the privilege to requests for this information would be allowing [Underwriters] to use [Bond Litigation Counsel]'s work as both a sword (as a basis for their damages) and a shield (in prohibiting [Bond Counsel] from inquiry about what [Bond Litigation Counsel] w[as] doing and why....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 The court then stayed the matter to permit this special action by Underwriters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7 We accept special-action jurisdiction because Underwriters have no equally plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal.\n   <em>\n    Twin City Fire Ins.

The substance of Underwriters' communications with defense counsel are not necessary to decide whether Bond Counsel committed malpractice before the bondholders ever sued Underwriters. Further, even if Bond Counsel is correct that tortious conduct by parties other than Bond Counsel led to the Bond Litigation, Underwriters' privileged communications with Bond Litigation Counsel are not inherently relevant to that defense theory. That is not to say that Underwriters' decision to assert the privilege is without risk to Underwriters. Indeed, the decision may well impair Underwriters' claims-to the extent that the disclosed billing records are insufficient to permit an informed assessment of how much of Bond Litigation Counsel's work related to Bond Counsel's alleged negligence, Underwriters ultimately may be unable to recover all or a portion of their damages. Underwriters' privilege, however, remains intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 19 Bond Counsel contend that Underwriters put Bond Litigation Counsel's advice at issue \"by claiming that they could not have settled any of the claims asserted [in the Bond Litigation] until after they incurred [the] fees.\" But Underwriters' bare claim for litigation expenses cannot be equated with assertion of a settlement-timing theory dependent on the advice of counsel. Again, the assertion of the privilege to bar discovery of relevant evidence on that theory could profoundly diminish any potential recovery. But that is not the same as waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 20 Even if Underwriters' claim for damages had raised the settlement issue, that alone would not provide grounds for waiver. \"[T]o waive the attorney-client privilege, a party must make an affirmative claim that its conduct was based on its understanding of the advice of counsel-it is not sufficient that the party consult with counsel and receive advice.\"\n   <em>\n    Everest Indem.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032873\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/503/#p505\">\n    236 Ariz. at 505, \u00b6 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032873\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/503/#p505\">\n    342 P.3d at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no waiver related to a settlement decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III. UNDERWRITERS' ASSERTION OF PRIVILEGE DOES NOT DENY BOND COUNSEL ACCESS TO VITAL DEFENSE INFORMATION.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21 We finally hold that preservation of Underwriters' privilege does not deprive Bond Counsel access to information vital to their defense, as required by the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Hearn\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 22 Bond Counsel overreach when they claim entitlement to Bond Litigation Counsel's \"status reports, litigation budgets, and analyses of liability exposure and the likelihood of settlement,\" and information regarding \"how the underwriters themselves viewed the claims\" and \"why [Bond Litigation Counsel] were doing [what they did].\" The fact that such information might reveal information\n   <em>\n    useful\n   </em>\n   to Bond Counsel (such as Underwriters' and Bond Litigation Counsel's assessment of Bond Counsel's relative culpability) is insufficient to cause waiver. Privileged communications almost always present the spectre of usefulness and relevance, but their allure does not defeat the privilege. The privileged information's potential utility to Bond Counsel does not provide grounds for waiver; it instead illustrates the importance of preserving the privilege when the malpractice plaintiff seeks to use it as a shield only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23 Underwriters did not waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to their communications with Bond Litigation Counsel. They did not assert the privilege in response to their own act, they did not put protected information at issue, and application of the privilege does not deny Bond Counsel access to information vital to their defense. The superior court erred by denying Underwriters' motion for a protective order. We accept jurisdiction and grant relief.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
