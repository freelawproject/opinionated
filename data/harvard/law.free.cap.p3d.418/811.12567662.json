Under RCW 46.64.040, service of process on the secretary of state has the same force and effect as personal service. Elizabeth Cito filed a personal injury lawsuit against Jennifer K. Rios for damages from a rear-end collision. The court dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that Rios was not properly served under RCW 46.64.040. The undisputed record establishes that despite repeated attempts to serve Rios, she avoided and refused to accept service of process. Because the record establishes that after a due and diligent effort to serve Rios, she could not be found for purposes of service of process, we hold RCW 46.64.040 authorized service of process on the secretary of state. We reverse and remand for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Car Accident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The facts are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 28, 2012, Elizabeth Cito was driving to work in her 2008 Subaru, traveling eastbound on the West Seattle Bridge. As Cito slowed to merge onto the Interstate 5 off-ramp, a Honda Civic rear-ended her car. The \"Police Traffic Collision Report\" identifies the driver of the Honda Civic as Jennifer K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rios. The Police Traffic Collision Report states her address is 8817 25th Place Northeast, Seattle, Washington 98115. The police cited Rios for \"[f]ollowing too close.\" The collision report states that when Cito \"slowed and stopped for traffic,\" Rios rear-ended her car. The report notes both Cito and Rios \"complained of neck pain\" and the cars were towed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Personal Injury Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Cito's attorney was in contact with the GEICO claims adjuster for Rios over the course of the next two years. On September 23, 2015, the attorney notified the claims adjuster that Cito planned to file a lawsuit. The attorney said, \"I called him so that he could notify his insured, so that she would not be alarmed when someone knocked on her door to serve papers. The claims adjustor ... requested that I fax him a copy of the complaint once it was filed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 On September 25, 2015, Cito filed a personal injury complaint for damages against Rios in King County Superior Court. On September 28, Cito's attorney faxed a copy of the summons and complaint to the GEICO claims adjuster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 On September 30, an attorney filed a notice of appearance on behalf of Rios. The notice of appearance requests that \"all further pleadings, except service of process, be forwarded\" to the attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Attempts to Serve Rios\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 On September 30, 2015, an ABC Legal Messenger (ABC) process server attempted to serve Rios at the Seattle address in the Police Traffic Collision Report with the summons, the personal injury complaint, and the order setting civil case schedule. The process server learned Rios no longer lived at that address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 After conducting a search of public records, Cito's attorney located an address for Rios at 15704 80th Street East, Puyallup, Washington. On October 2, an ABC process server attempted to serve Rios at the Puyallup address. The current occupant told the process server that Rios lived at that address only temporarily and she did not know her new address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 On October 14, Cito's attorney sent an e-mail to Rios's attorney stating, \"[W]e have not yet served your client, as she has moved from her previous address. We will be using ABC investigation to locate and serve her.\" Cito's attorney asked, \"Please let me know if you are able to accept service for her or if you have obtained her permission to share her address.\" The attorney responded, \"Let me know when you have service.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 ABC conducted \"a full investigation to locate Ms. Rios' current address.\" ABC located an address for Rios at an apartment complex in Des Moines-2701 South 224th Street, apartment H304. On October 14, a process server attempted service at the Des Moines address at 4:30 p.m. Although no one answered the door, the ABC process server heard \"movement inside.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The process server left several telephone messages. After \"neighbors confirmed\" that Rios lived in apartment H304, the process server waited in the parking lot. Approximately a half-hour later, the process server tried to serve Rios with the pleadings. Rios \"refused to accept\" service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 The ABC process server attempted to serve Rios again the next day on October 15. The apartment manager confirmed Rios lived in apartment H304. The woman in apartment H304 refused to open the door and accept service or identify herself. The process server left a number of telephone messages. Rios did not respond.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   10/15/2015 2:32 PM: Per JANE DOE, WHO REFUSED TO GIVE NAME, RESIDENT, a female contact. Occupant is believed to be subject by server.

When there was \"[n]o answer,\" he left his card. The deputy left voice messages and sent text messages on October 28, 29, and 30. Rios did not respond. On November 2, the deputy went to the apartment and left his card. The deputy returned on November 9 but there was \"[n]o response at door.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12 On November 14, ABC made one last attempt to serve Rios at the Des Moines address with the summons, personal injury complaint, and order setting civil case schedule. After Rios \"absolutely refuse[d] to accept legal documents,\" the process server returned with the apartment manager and tried a second time to serve Rios. A woman from inside the apartment spoke to the process server but did not open the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Service on the Secretary of State\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 13 On December 3, Cito filed a \"Notice of Service on the Secretary of State\" and a \"Declaration of Compliance.\" The Declaration of Compliance describes the numerous unsuccessful attempts to personally serve Rios.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 14 I have with due diligence determined that the defendant cannot be served.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ...

Rios listed several previous addresses, including the address in the Police Traffic Collision Report. Rios states, \"I live in the State of Washington and have lived at the following Washington address since June 11, 2015: 2701 S. 224th Street, Apt. H304, Des Moines, WA 98198.\" Rios asserted that because she has lived at the Des Moines address since 2015, service was improper and the lawsuit was barred by the three-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 In response to the motion to dismiss, Cito pointed out that the legislature amended the statute after the Washington Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Huff\n   </em>\n   in 2000. In 2003, the legislature deleted the language \"departs from this state.\" LAWS OF 2003, ch. 223, \u00a7 1. The legislature amended the statute to state that if within three years following the collision the resident motorist \"\n   <em>\n    cannot, after a due and diligent search, be found in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   .\" the motorist \"appoints the secretary of state\" to accept service of process. LAWS OF 2003, ch. 223, \u00a7 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cito argued the statute authorized service on the secretary of state because after a due and diligent search and repeated attempts at service, Rios could not be \"found\" for purposes of service of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 The court requested additional briefing on the meaning of the word \"found.\" Before Cito filed her supplemental response brief, the court granted the motion to dismiss. On May 20, 2016, the court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to Vacate and January 23, 2017 Order of Dismissal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 On May 31, 2016, Cito filed a CR 60(b)(1) motion to vacate the May 20, 2016 order of dismissal in superior court. The case was transferred to a different superior court judge. On June 20, Cito filed a notice of appeal of the May 20, 2016 order of dismissal. On January 12, the court granted Cito's CR 60 motion to vacate the May 20, 2016 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21 The court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss and considered the supplemental briefs. In her supplemental brief, Rios argued the language \"cannot ... be found\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   means \"a plaintiff is unable to locate a defendant's address.\" Rios claimed service on the secretary of state was improper because Cito \"had actual knowledge\" of her address. In her supplemental brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss, Cito argued that as amended, \"found\" as used in RCW 46.64.040 means that a defendant \"cannot ... be found\" if the defendant is intentionally avoiding service and cannot be served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 The court granted the motion to dismiss. The January 23, 2017 order states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [T]he Court concludes that the Defendant was not properly served with the summons and complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Service through the Secretary of State pursuant to RCW 46.64.040 was not appropriate in this case because [Cito]'s process server in fact \"found\" [Rios] at her last known Washington address. The process server's affidavit states that the server actually spoke to a person inside the home whom he believed to be [Rios] and the neighbors confirmed she lived in this location. Under these unique facts, [Cito] found [Rios] in-state and substitute service through the Secretary of State was not permissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23 Cito appealed the January 23, 2017 order granting the motion to dismiss. We consolidated the appeal of the January 23, 2017 order with the previous appeal of the May 20, 2016 order dismissing the lawsuit. Because the trial court vacated the May 20, 2016 order of dismissal, we address only the order of dismissal entered on January 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    RCW 46.64.040\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 24 Cito contends the court erred in dismissing her personal injury complaint on the grounds that she did not properly serve Rios as authorized by RCW 46.64.040.
