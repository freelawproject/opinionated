In December 2015, during a traffic stop in Pinal County, an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer seized cash totaling $40,160 and a 2010 Chevrolet Camaro from Silva, and $6,363 in cash from Rangel. On the date of the seizure, the state personally served claimants with notice of its intent to proceed with forfeiture of the property. Claimants timely filed claims for the seized property, representing they would \"accept future mailings from the court or attorney for the [s]tate\" at one address, which was the office of their attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On February 1, 2016, the state filed a complaint against the seized property. On the same day, the state sent two copies of a summons and the complaint in one envelope by certified mail to the address claimants had provided. On February 29, the envelope was returned to the state marked \"unclaimed.\" The following day, the state sent a facsimile to claimants' attorney, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Complaint filed on February 1, 2016. Mailed to you on February 1, 2016. Certified mail returned as \"Unclaimed\" (see face of envelope, page two of this fax).

I will be filing an application for forfeiture pursuant to A.R.S. [\u00a7] 13-4311(G).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Claimants filed their answers the next day, on March 2. The state filed an application for\n   order of forfeiture on March 3, averring it had served claimants by certified mail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Claimants objected to the state's application, arguing it had failed to properly serve claimants with the complaint. Claimants' attorney asserted he only became aware of the complaint when he received the March 1 facsimile from the state. Claimants also moved to dismiss the complaint for insufficient process and service of process pursuant to Rule 12(b)(4), (5), Ariz. R. Civ. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The trial court set the matter for oral argument. Prior to oral argument, claimants obtained new counsel, who submitted a pre-hearing brief arguing the state's service of the complaint failed to satisfy the requirements of due process. In a ruling issued after oral argument, the court entered factual findings and concluded the state's service was complete upon mailing and claimants' answers were untimely, granting the state's application for forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Claimants timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 \"We review the trial court's application of the forfeiture statutes de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    $2,390 U.S. Currency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755841\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/229/514/\">\n    229 Ariz. 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755841\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/229/514/\">\n    277 P.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The state filed the forfeiture complaints on February 1, 2016, and served copies of them on the claimants the same day by certified mail as required by A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4307, and as allowed by A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4311(A) and\n   <em>\n    Dusenbery\n   </em>\n   . The complaints were sent by certified mail to the address the claimants themselves provided-that of the office of their attorney of record. Under \u00a7 13-4307, service of copies of a complaint is effective upon mailing; thus, the claimants here are deemed to have received-and thus to have been served with-the complaints on February 1, 2016. Because that is so, under \u00a7 13-4311(G), the claimants' respective answers to the complaint were due on February 26, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaints, however, were unclaimed at the claimants' attorney's office after, apparently, three distinct attempts at delivery.

By the time the claimants' statutory deadline to answer had passed, the state had fulfilled both its statutory obligation and also its constitutional, due process obligation under\n   <em>\n    Dusenbery\n   </em>\n   to provide notice. By the time the state learned that the claimants had not received actual notice of the forfeiture complaint, the claimants were already in default, and\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   notice thereafter sent by the state would make the filing of an answer timely under the statute.
