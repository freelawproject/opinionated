As part of its business, USAR seeks investors to develop various mining projects by promising them profits from those mining investments. From 2005 to 2007, USAR and its subsidiaries received cease and desist orders from Washington, California, and Maryland, based on its conduct in soliciting investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 In September 2005, Washington's Department of Financial Institutions Securities Division issued a \"Statement of Charges and Notice of Intent to Enter Order to Cease and Desist and to Impose Fines.\" The securities administrator that issued the statement found USAR \"failed to provide material information regarding the investment, including ... the risks involved with gold mining.\" The statement further concluded that USAR \"made misstatements of material fact or omitted to state material facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.\" USAR was fined $5000 as part of a consent order related to the statement of charges issued by the State of Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In June 2006, California's Department of Corporations issued a \"Desist and Refrain Order,\" which found USAR was offering securities \"by means of written or oral communications which included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made ... not misleading....\" As part of the stipulation with the California Department of Corporations, USAR acknowledged, without admitting or denying fault, that the California Corporations Commissioner found USAR made three material omissions when soliciting potential investors regarding a mine in Arizona (the \"Chastain\" mine). The omissions listed in the stipulation included failing to tell potential investors that (1) USAR was promising more gold on its properties than had been recovered from the\n   entire state of Arizona since the late 1800s; (2) at that time no gold mines were currently active in Arizona; and (3) no Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") mining plan had been approved and USAR was therefore not yet authorized to mine, despite claims that it was mining tons of ore a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 In September 2007, the Securities Commissioner of Maryland issued to International Energy and Resources, Inc. (\"IER\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of USAR, a \"Final Order to Cease and Desist.\" In the order, the commissioner found IER had made \"materially false and misleading statements regarding the value of [investment] interests and the promised investor profits,\" and had omitted material facts, \"including full representation of the risk associated with an investment in IER.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 From May to December 2016, Doe made a series of posts on a blog hosted on InvestorsHub.com, a website that organizes online debates for investors regarding various companies and prospective investments. Doe's posts concerned the viability of USAR mining investments in Arizona and accused USAR of fraud. Doe is a moderator of the blog on which he posted, which is entitled \"Mining Company Research Board\" and is described as \"a place to bring concerns and questions about penny stock mining companies and their mining claims or to just discuss the merits of individual penny stock mining companies and share/build research on those companies.\" Doe commented on the blog under the username \"gitreal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 In January 2017, USAR filed a defamation complaint against Doe for his posts on the blog. Afterwards, USAR served a subpoena on Cox Communications, Inc., seeking Doe's IP address. Doe filed a motion to quash the subpoena, and after oral argument, the superior court denied the motion and ordered Doe's identity revealed. In its order, the superior court did not evaluate all the statements challenged by USAR, but instead focused on just six of the defamatory statements alleged by USAR. The court found that at least one of the statements, if proven true, could render USAR's claim of defamation capable of surviving summary judgment under the test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Mobilisa\n   </em>\n   . Doe filed this petition for special action seeking review of the superior court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Special action jurisdiction is discretionary and appropriate when no \"equally plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal\" exists.

Doe maintained that a discrepancy in the amounts of money USAR sought to raise, or did raise, did not establish the falsity of his statements because the amount of money to be raised is not the \"substantial sting\" of the statement, which was that USAR fraudulently raised funds. Because the original statement-that \"USAR 'bilked' investors out of $30 million\"-would be no less derogatory if it stated \"$10 million,\" we agree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Read\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548016\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/169/353/#p355\">\n    169 Ariz. at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548016\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/169/353/#p355\">\n    819 P.2d at 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determination of substantial truth looks at whether the literal truth would have made a material difference).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 18 USAR contends the difference in the amount of money is large enough to alter the defamatory sting.

Doe's \"bilked\" statement was not wholly based on the two Maryland investors included in the Maryland cease and desist order. While some of Doe's statements referred to the Maryland order, he did not identify the Maryland order as the exclusive basis for the $30 million claim. As stated above, the \"substantial sting\" of Doe's statements was the fraudulent practices of USAR, not the specific amounts of money any one investor lost by investing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fendler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710956\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/130/475/#p480\">\n    130 Ariz. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710956\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/130/475/#p480\">\n    636 P.2d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (damage to reputation of the plaintiff came from conviction of crime, not his presence in a prison).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 USAR further contends that any reference to the Maryland cease and desist order was false because the order was against IER and not USAR, and specifically points to Doe's statement that, \"Three different state securities commissions found the securities offered by USAR to be illegal.\" Doe claims IER and USAR are not distinct entities because IER is a wholly owned subsidiary of USAR, has the same business address, and has the same CEO and founder (Owen). Therefore, Doe asserts it is irrelevant that the Maryland Cease and Desist Order named IER and not USAR. Additionally, Doe maintains \"[t]he sting of violating anti-fraud provisions of securities law in\n   <em>\n    three\n   </em>\n   states rather than\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   is inconsequential.\" We agree. That the Maryland cease and desist order did not specifically identify USAR does not render Doe's statement substantially false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 A reasonable person reading Doe's statement would not distinguish the actions of IER and USAR based on the corporate structure or their operation. As Doe identified in his petition, USAR and IER have the same CEO and founder, same address, and often the same ventures. USAR's response acknowledges its ownership and operation of the Chastain Mine. The management of the \"Chastain Mine Joint Venture\" was the subject of the Maryland cease and desist order identified by Doe, and as such, a person reading Doe's statements regarding the two companies could reasonably interpret the two corporations to be equally liable for the management of the Chastain Mine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yetman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459071\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/71/#p79\">\n    168 Ariz. at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1459071\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/168/71/#p79\">\n    811 P.2d at 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (when considering whether alleged defamatory statements are actionable assertions of fact, courts review whether a statement \"stated or implied an assertion of objective fact 'from the point of view of the reasonable person' \").

The affidavit provides no facts supporting the legitimacy of the Chastain Mine. While the geologist describes extensive studies and testing done on the Congress Mine, and declares he has personally processed mine tailings at the Congress Mine, he makes no such claim regarding the Chastain Mine. USAR's response is equally conclusory when attempting to rebut Doe's argument. USAR simply quotes the geologist's statement from his affidavit and then asserts: \"Thus, the [affidavit] created a genuine issue of material fact.\" The conclusory statements by the geologist are insufficient to establish the falsity of Doe's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

While USAR and Vast Mountain Development may be separate entities, the defamatory thrust of Doe's statement is again the fraudulent actions of USAR, which are not proven substantially untrue by USAR's assertion that it is a separate entity than Vast Mountain Development.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 We accept special action jurisdiction and grant relief because the superior court erred by finding USAR's claims could survive a motion for summary judgment based on the six statements reviewed in the superior court's order.
