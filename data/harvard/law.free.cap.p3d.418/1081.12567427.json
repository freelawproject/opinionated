The City argues the superior court erred when it found that the anti-marital fact privilege applied to Craig's driving under the influence charges and when it granted Craig's motion to sever those charges from a criminal damage charge. We hold that the anti-marital fact privilege precludes testimony by one spouse against another regarding DUI charges and that severance of the criminal damage charge from the DUI charges was proper. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Craig was charged with three counts of driving under the influence of alcohol (\"DUI\"), Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7\u00a7 28-1381(A)(1) (impaired to slightest degree), -1381(A)(2) (blood alcohol of .08 or more), -1382(A)(1) (extreme DUI), and one count of criminal damage, a domestic violence offense, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-1602, -2601(A). Before trial in the municipal court, Craig moved to preclude testimony and statements by her husband regarding the three DUI charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4062(A)(1) (anti-marital fact privilege). Craig also moved to sever the three DUI charges from the criminal damage charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The City responded that Craig's husband had called the police to say he was concerned that Craig had been drinking and might attempt to drive. The City claimed he parked one of the couple's vehicles behind the couple's van to prevent Craig from driving away in the van. It alleged that, Craig, intoxicated and undeterred by the car blocking her way, backed the van out, shoving the other car fifteen feet down the driveway. When the police arrived, Craig was not in a vehicle. An officer noted property damage to the van consisting of a small dent and some scratches on the rear bumper and a large dent on the front bumper of the other vehicle. The City argued that the exception to the anti-marital fact privilege for crimes committed by a wife against her husband found in A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4062(1) applied to the DUI charges as well as the criminal damage charge. The municipal court disagreed, severed the criminal damage count from the DUI counts and precluded Craig's husband from testifying in the DUI trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The City filed a petition for special action. The superior court accepted jurisdiction but denied relief to the City. The City appealed to this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Craig argues that this court has jurisdiction under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1). Section 12-2101(A)(1) confers \"appellate jurisdiction\n   over the superior court's final judgment in a special action.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The anti-marital fact privilege provides, in part, that a wife may prevent her spouse from testifying for or against her regarding any \"events occurring during marriage.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4062(1). The anti-marital fact privilege does not apply, however, in \"a criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by the husband against the wife, or by a wife against the husband.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-4062(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Craig does not dispute that her husband can testify about the criminal damage claim because he is a co-owner of the car, and the crime therefore, allegedly was committed \"against\" him. Craig, however, argues that the criminal damage charge is the only charge to which the exception to the anti-marital fact privilege applies and such testimony should be precluded for the other charged offenses pursuant to the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 The legislative purpose of the privilege is \"to support the peace and tranquility of families and to protect the marital relation[ship].\"\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"584677\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/112/537/#p542\">\n    112 Ariz. at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"584677\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/112/537/#p542\">\n    544 P.2d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nothing in the VBR suggests that the voters or the legislature intended the VBR to apply to the exception to the privilege for crimes committed by one spouse against the other.

The \"victim\" in\n   <em>\n    Romley\n   </em>\n   was at risk because he was the driver of the car hit by the defendant.

Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 13.4(a) directs the court to sever counts \"if necessary to promote a fair determination of any defendant's guilt or innocence of any offense.\" Here the court, exercising its discretion, severed the single count to which the exception applied from counts to which it did not. Allowing a jury to hear otherwise privileged testimony from the defendant's husband might well prejudice the jury on the DUI counts. Because we conclude that the municipal court did not abuse its discretion in finding the anti-marital fact privilege applied to the DUI charges, we find that the court\n   did not abuse its discretion in granting Craig's motion to sever.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"629912\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/104/579/#p585\">\n    104 Ariz. at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"629912\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/104/579/#p585\">\n    457 P.2d at 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 We affirm the superior court's decision and lift the stay previously entered by this court on April 7, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The City filed a transcript of the hearing as an appendix to its opening brief, but did not file it as part of the record on appeal.
