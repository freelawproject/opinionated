She contends the court \"abused its discretion by granting\" the state's motion requesting the change \"in violation of the placement preferences established by A.R.S. \u00a7 8-514(B).\" She further asserts the court made \"numerous findings ... without credible bases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In its answering brief, the Department of Child Safety (DCS) contends as a threshold matter that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. It asserts, \"Jewel is not an aggrieved party and the order is not final and appealable.\" Our jurisdiction in juvenile matters is provided by A.R.S. \u00a7 8-235, which provides that \"[a]ny aggrieved party in any juvenile court proceeding under this title may appeal from a final order of the juvenile court to the court of appeals.\" Both factors must be present-the person must be an aggrieved party and the court's order must be final.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, we must determine whether Jewel is an \"aggrieved party\" and whether the juvenile court's order changing the children's placement is a \"final order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 \"To qualify as an aggrieved party, the judgment must operate to deny the party some personal or property right or to impose a substantial burden on the party.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Pima Cty.

And, in evaluating our jurisdiction, we do not employ a \"narrow, technical conception\" of a final order, but rather, \"examine the practical effect of the juvenile court's order\" on the appealing party's purported rights.\n   <em>\n    In re Maricopa Cty.

Jewel filed a motion to intervene in the dependency proceeding in June 2016, and the court granted permissive intervention. Arizona courts have long allowed grandparents, as well as other relatives, to be granted permissive intervention in dependency proceedings so long as the requirements of Rule 24, Ariz. R. Civ.

And in\n   <em>\n    Bechtel\n   </em>\n   , our supreme court, although accepting special action jurisdiction, suggested that grandparents are entitled to appeal a juvenile court's ruling denying their motion to intervene.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473689\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/150/68/#p73\">\n    150 Ariz. at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473689\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/150/68/#p73\">\n    722 P.2d at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In allowing permissive intervention in\n   <em>\n    Bechtel\n   </em>\n   , however, our supreme court cautioned that \"intervention merely allows the [relative] to be heard; it does not confer any right to custody upon them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473689\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/150/68/#p73\">\n    150 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   73 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473689\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/150/68/#p73\">\n    722 P.2d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Jewel also asserts that she is \"an aggrieved party\" because she has \"a\n   statutory interest in placement pursuant to\" A.R.S. \u00a7 8-514(B)(2) and (3), \"as a member of the extended family.\" That statute sets forth the preferences for placement and lists \"kinship care\" above placement in other foster care situations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473689\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/150/68/#p73\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But, as we have previously pointed out, \"the order of placement is a preference, not a mandate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Antonio P. v.

More importantly, we have likewise made clear that \"the intent [of the statutory scheme for placement] is to protect dependent children, not the interests of potential foster or adoptive placements.\"\n   <em>\n    Lorenz v.

Furthermore, under A.R.S. \u00a7 8-517, DCS may withdraw a child from a foster home when it \"determines that withdrawal is according to written, specific standards and is clearly necessary for the child's interests and welfare\" and may withdraw a child placed pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 8-514.02, including a placement with a relative, \"if the change is necessary for the child's best interests and welfare.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 A great-grandparent, or other third party, may, however, petition for placement under certain circumstances, pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409. The legislature having provided a means by which a third party may independently obtain rights to placement of a child, we have no basis to read such a right into \u00a7 8-514, as Jewel suggests we should.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, we conclude that because a great-grandparent has no right to placement of a child in the absence of an order granting third-party rights pursuant to \u00a7 25-409, under the circumstances in this case, Jewel has no right that is aggrieved by a ruling changing placement of the children, and she therefore cannot appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-235 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antonio M. v.

Employing a broad conception of a final order in view of a parent's fundamental rights, our supreme court has determined that \"orders declaring children dependent and orders reaffirming findings that children are dependent are final orders subject to appeal by aggrieved parties.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Yavapai Cty. Juv.

But, \"juvenile court orders which merely relate to a change of placement of a foster child from one foster home to another and which do not constitute a reaffirmation of dependency status vis-a-vis the parent are not 'final orders' appealable pursuant to Rule 24, Arizona Rules of Procedure for the Juvenile Court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Maricopa Cty. Juv. Action No. J-57445\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745073\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/143/88/#p92\">\n    143 Ariz. 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 92,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745073\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/143/88/#p92\">\n    691 P.2d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1120 (App. 1984). In contrast, change of placement orders affecting the rights of parents are viewed differently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, when a natural\n   father appealed from an order that changed placement of the child to another state, the order was appealable because it had \"a substantial impact on [his] practical ability to have any contact with his child.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Maricopa Cty.

We concluded in\n   <em>\n    Maricopa County Juvenile Action No. J-57445\n   </em>\n   that placement orders, when challenged by foster parents, are not final as they \"do not constitute a reaffirmation of dependency status vis-a-vis the parent.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745073\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/143/88/#p92\">\n    143 Ariz. at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"745073\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/143/88/#p92\">\n    691 P.2d at 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
