In August 2015, early in the morning, Casa Grande police officers responded to an apartment complex following reports that an individual had been \"loud and disturbing.\" An officer approached Weaver and saw he was holding an aluminum can with burn marks and a depression in the middle, something the officer recognized as a crude marijuana pipe. In response to the officer's request, Weaver dropped the can but then took a \"boxer's stance\" and began jabbing at the air, asking the officer if he \"wanted to go for it.\" Two other officers approached Weaver from behind, and he assumed the same stance toward one of them. The first officer warned Weaver to \"calm down or he would be Tased.\" Weaver nevertheless maintained his stance, and the officer deployed a Taser and arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On the morning of trial, before calling the first panel of jurors, Weaver stated he wanted to represent himself. When the trial court asked if he was prepared to begin trial that morning, Weaver said he was not and requested a continuance. After a brief recess during which the court reviewed the case file and certain reports pertaining to Weaver's competency, the court denied the request finding it \"untimely and that it would cause a disruption or delay to the trial.\" A few minutes later, Weaver, through counsel, asked whether he would be able to participate in his case, and the court told him he would be able to testify if he so chose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 After a recess, but before the first potential jurors entered the courtroom, Weaver indicated \"he still want[ed] to represent himself and [was] ready to go\" without continuing the trial. The court stated it had \"already ruled on that motion\" and the trial was \"moving forward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Following lunch recess, the prosecutor notified the court that the denial might be an \"appellate issue.\" The court reiterated that Weaver's request was not timely because, although his case had been pending for a year, he only raised the issue \"literally five minutes before we brought the jury up.\" In the alternative, the court determined granting the request \"would disrupt or delay the proceedings\" because it believed Weaver's earlier statements that he was not prepared to proceed to trial over his later assertion that he was ready. On the second and final day of trial, the court made an additional\n   record based on its reading of Arizona case law that a motion for self-representation is not necessarily timely if made before jury selection begins, but depends on \"all the other factors\" of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 After trial, the jury found Weaver guilty of all three counts as described above. The court suspended imposition of his sentence and placed Weaver on supervised probation for two years. Weaver appealed; we have jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-4031, 13-4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Right to Represent Oneself\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Weaver argues the trial court committed structural error by summarily denying his motion to represent himself.

In this context, the state observes that Weaver initially articulated an intention to assert a \"clearly frivolous\" religious defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 But Weaver responded that he still wished to represent himself even after the trial court alerted him that no such defense would be allowed. In context, that response suggests that Weaver accepted the trial court's limitation. Furthermore, the court made no finding that Weaver was asserting his right in order to make his religious argument, and nothing in the record suggests otherwise. Although the court repeatedly expressed concerns about \"disrupt [ing]\" trial, the record does not support that those concerns arose from an expectation that Weaver would persist in attempting to present a frivolous defense. Rather, the court failed to specify the cause for its concerns. We therefore understand the court's concerns about disruption as those typically arising in the context of any pro se litigant untrained in the law and courtroom procedure. Accordingly, we cannot say this concern justified denying Weaver's motion to represent himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060893\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/230/571/\">\n    230 Ariz. 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060893\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/230/571/\">\n    288 P.3d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Disposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 Although trial courts retain considerable discretion over last-minute requests for self-representation, the court here did not sufficiently identify an adequate basis to deny Weaver's request and sufficient facts are not apparent from this record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060893\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/230/571/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, we determine the trial court committed structural error by denying Weaver's request to represent himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.

Weaver underwent a competency evaluation before trial pursuant to Rule 11, Ariz. R. Crim. P., and the trial court reviewed the resulting report in response to his request to represent himself. The state suggests the denial \"clearly reflect[ed] the court's finding that [Weaver] was not 'competent' \" based on its unique position to observe his \"demeanor and emotional presentation.\" The court, however, did not mention any concern with Weaver's competency or behavior at trial, much less make an express determination concerning either.
