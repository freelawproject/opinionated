In\n   <em>\n    State v. Murray\n   </em>\n   , we held that a trial court must engage a defendant in an on-the-record colloquy to ensure that the defendant is intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily relinquishing this fundamental right before the court may accept the defendant's admission of an element of a crime.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258532\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/116/3/#p12\">\n    116 Hawai'i 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258532\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/116/3/#p12\">\n    169 P.3d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 964 (2007). We now reiterate our holding in\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   and decline to establish an exception to the colloquy requirement when a stipulation is based on trial strategy or time constraints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In April 2011, Rachel Viamoana Ui and Jacob Wong, Ui's co-worker, were involved in a traffic collision in Kona on the island of Hawai'i. The two were traveling in Wong's vehicle, which \"rolled\" after it collided with a concrete construction barrier on Kamakaeha Avenue, eventually coming to a stop on its roof. When an ambulance arrived, the responding emergency medical technician found Ui unconscious a few feet from the driver-side door of the vehicle. Ui was transported to Kona Hospital, where an emergency room physician informed the responding police officer that he smelled alcohol on her person. Acting pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 291E-21 (Supp. 2006), the officer requested that the hospital obtain a blood sample from Ui in order to determine her blood alcohol content (BAC). Ronald Luga, a medical technician employed by the hospital, proceeded to draw two vials of blood from Ui while she remained unconscious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. District Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State of Hawai'i filed a complaint in the District Court of the Third Circuit (district court) charging Ui with operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a) (Supp. 2011)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and driving without a license in violation of HRS \u00a7 286-102(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ui pleaded not guilty to both charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the bench trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the parties offered conflicting testimony as to whether Ui was driving at the time of the accident. Ui and Wong both acknowledged that they drank heavily on the night in question and testified\n   that Wong had driven the two to a local store prior to the collision. Wong claimed that Ui insisted upon driving his truck when they left the store and was in control of the vehicle when it collided with the concrete barrier. In contrast, Ui asserted that she had \"passed out\" in Wong's passenger seat while still at the store and was sleeping when the collision occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State called Luga to testify regarding the blood draw he performed on Ui. Before Luga's testimony could begin, Ui's defense counsel interrupted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   I was speaking with Ms. Ui, and we may be willing to stipulate to certain things to save time with these witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Ui's asking me, was asking me if these witnesses are necessary, and I explained to her not if we're willing to stipulate to certain things. And I know that we're trying to get a lot done today. So if I could just briefly speak with her, and maybe the prosecution, about what we'd be willing to stipulate to, to save ... the need of these witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [Tr 4/13/12, 43:67] The court granted a recess to allow defense counsel to confer with Ui and the prosecuting attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the recess, defense counsel orally stipulated to the following: (1) Ui's blood was drawn within three hours of the report of the accident; (2) Ui's blood was drawn in accordance with the Hawaii Administrative Rules; and (3) the blood samples were properly secured and transported to the laboratory. Additionally, defense counsel stipulated that Ui's blood test results showed a BAC of 0.156 grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood. Defense counsel indicated that he had \"reviewed those stipulations\" with Ui and \"we're not challenging any of those facts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court did not engage Ui in a colloquy regarding the stipulation to the blood test results, and a written copy of the stipulation was not provided to the court. Neither the court nor counsel acknowledged that the stipulated facts constituted proof of one of the two elements of a HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(4) offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hawai'i Standard Jury Instructions Criminal 16.05 (2004) (providing that the two elements of a violation are 1) operating a vehicle and 2) having 0.8 or more grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the conclusion of evidence, the district court found Ui guilty of OVUII and of driving without a license. The court sentenced Ui to pay a $1,000 fine and other monetary fees, attend a fourteen-hour driver's education course, and obtain a substance abuse assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Proceedings Before the Intermediate Court of Appeals\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Approximately twenty-eight months later, Ui, represented by new counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ui argued that the State had failed to allege in its initial complaint that she had acted with the state of mind required to commit both offenses. With regard to the OVUII conviction, Ui argued it should be vacated because the language of the district court's ruling left it unclear whether the conviction was premised on HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(1) -which includes a state of mind requirement not alleged in the complaint-or HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(4) -which does not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In a Summary Disposition Order (SDO), the ICA vacated Ui's conviction for driving without a license in violation of HRS \u00a7 286-102.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ICA reasoned that, because\n   HRS \u00a7 286-102 does not in itself specify a requisite state of mind with respect to the conduct it prohibits, HRS \u00a7 702-204 (2014)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   requires that a defendant must have undertaken each element of the offense intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly in order to be convicted. The ICA held that, because the State had not alleged a mens rea in its complaint, dismissal of the driving without a license charge without prejudice was warranted under this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Apollonio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312895\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/353/#p359\">\n    130 Hawai'i 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 359,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312895\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/130/353/#p359\">\n    311 P.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The ICA also determined that Ui's OVUII conviction was based on violations of both HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(1) (impairment of ability to care for oneself) and HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(4) (BAC over .08). Because HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(4) is a strict liability method of proof that does not require the State to allege a mens rea under our precedents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Nesmith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312275\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/127/48/#p58\">\n    127 Hawai'i 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312275\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/127/48/#p58\">\n    276 P.3d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627-30 (2012), the ICA affirmed Ui's OVUII conviction under HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following issuance of the SDO, Ui filed a motion for reconsideration. Ui argued that this court's then-recent decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Won\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    137 Hawai'i 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313888\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/137/330/\">\n    372 P.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), in which we held that the State may not use the threat of criminal sanctions to coerce a driver into consenting to a breath or blood test, rendered her blood test results inadmissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ICA should therefore vacate her HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(4) conviction, Ui contended, and remand the case to permit her to move to suppress the blood test results. The ICA denied the motion, determining that Ui had waived the issue of admissibility by failing to move for suppression of the test results prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The evaluation would invariably need to be made by the trial court because whether a particular stipulation is strategic is a fact-laden determination. In assessing whether a colloquy is required, a trial court would need to inquire of counsel whether the stipulation was based on strategy or some other consideration. The response by defense counsel to this question in itself poses a risk of invading the attorney-client privilege and may also be potentially damaging to the defense. The follow-up questions necessary to determine the accuracy of a counsel's assessment would compound and heighten these concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The present case amply demonstrates that reviewing courts are not well positioned to ascertain the reasons underlying a stipulation when such a judicial inquiry does not take place at the trial level. Ui's counsel stated the stipulation was intended simply to \"save time\" because they were \"trying to get a lot done today.\" Despite this indication that the stipulation was driven by administrative time constraints, the State argues that Ui \"had clear strategic and tactical reasons for stipulating to the blood alcohol results.\" As would likely be true in any appellate case in which judicial inquiry was not done at the trial level, an accurate evaluation of the issue would require remand for a hearing at which counsel and the defendant would have to testify or respond to inquiries regarding potentially privileged communications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, as\n   the State appears to concede [SB at 9], remand for an evidentiary hearing may be required even when its proposed trial strategy exception to the colloquy requirement would apply because the strategic advantages of a stipulation are only one aspect to be considered in evaluating whether a defendant's waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary under the totality of the circumstances. Thus, the cost to judicial resources of determining whether a colloquy was excused under a trial strategy exception would negate the efficiency benefits the colloquy requirement affords.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258532\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/116/3/#p12\">\n    116 Hawai'i at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12258532\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/116/3/#p12\">\n    169 P.3d at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, the stipulation in\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   itself was clearly a strategic decision that would fall squarely within the State's argued exception.

Thus, the court also erred in accepting the stipulation as evidence proving that Ui's BAC was .08 or more grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters or cubic centimeters of blood. The district court's error was not harmless, and the stipulation regarding Ui's blood test must be set aside. Accordingly, the ICA's June 30, 2016 Judgment on Appeal is affirmed in part and vacated in part. We affirm the ICA's Judgment on Appeal to the extent that it vacated Ui's conviction under HRS \u00a7 286-102(b) and remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the HRS \u00a7 286-102(b) charge without prejudice. We vacate the ICA's Judgment on Appeal to the extent that it affirmed Ui's conviction under HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(4) and also vacate Ui's district court conviction for this offense, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   DISSENTING OPINION BY NAKAYAMA, J., IN WHICH RECKTENWALD, C.J., JOINS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   I agree with the Majority's conclusion that\n   <em>\n    State v.

I further believe that the facts of this case do not rise to that level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For this reason, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   On October 11, 2011, the State filed a complaint against Ui, alleging that on April 13, 2011, Ui: 1) operated a vehicle on a public highway while under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 291E-61(a) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 2) operated a vehicle without a license in violation of HRS \u00a7 286-102(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At the bench trial in the district court, several witnesses for the State testified to the events that occurred on April 13, 2011. The State first called Jacob Wong (Wong) to testify that he picked Ui up in his truck on the night of the accident and that they spent the next few hours drinking at a bar and then at a harbor. Wong testified that he then drove Ui to Safeway, and that when they were ready to leave, Ui \"insisted that she would drive\" and that Wong should let her have the keys to his truck. Wong further testified that Ui was driving his truck and that he was a passenger when it hit concrete barriers and flipped over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Next, the State called a first responder to testify that when he arrived at the accident scene he found Ui \"laying on her back next to the driver's side door, unresponsive.\" Then, the State called a police officer to testify that Ui was transported to Kona Hospital and that the emergency room physician \"contacted [him] and stated that he smelled alcohol on the female party.\" Based on this information, the officer testified that he then initiated the procedure for a mandatory blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As the State was calling its next witness, the medical technician who performed the blood draw, Ui's counsel interrupted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Your Honor, I'm sorry to interrupt. I was speaking with Ms. Ui, and we may be willing to stipulate to certain things to save time with these witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Ms. Ui's asking me, was asking me if these witnesses are necessary, and I explained to her not if we're willing to stipulate to certain things. And I know that we're trying to get a lot done today. So if I could just briefly speak with her, and maybe the prosecution, about what we'd be willing to stipulate to, to save-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   THE COURT: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The State noted that it would rather proceed with its witnesses and try to lay the appropriate foundation, but the court ordered a recess to try to \"get such a stipulation in place.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   After the recess, Ui's counsel explained to the court that \"we have reached an agreement, and I have gone over all the stipulations with Ms. Ui.\" Ui's counsel then proceeded to stipulate that Ui's blood test was properly drawn and that the results showed a blood alcohol content of 0.156. After stipulating to these facts, Ui's counsel noted: \"And I have reviewed those stipulations as well as the exhibits with Ms. Ui, and she understands that they're going to be-that we're not challenging any of those facts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   At this point, Ui testified on her behalf. Ui testified that she does not drive and that she does not have a license. Ui testified that Wong was driving on the night of the accident, that she \"passed out\" in the passenger seat of his truck before the accident took place, and that the next thing she remembered was waking up in a hospital on O'ahu after the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   On cross-examination by the State, Ui testified that she had numerous alcoholic drinks on the night of the accident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [THE STATE:] So how much had you had to drink with Jacob [Wong] on April 13?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [UI:] I had four bottles of Budweiser.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [THE STATE:] And that's all?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [UI:] No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [THE STATE:] What else did you have?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [UI:] And then we had about four to five shots that was bought by him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   [THE STATE:] And this is at the bar?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [UI:] Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [THE STATE:] Okay.

So you were really drunk?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   [UI:] Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In his closing argument, Ui's counsel explained that \"Ms. Ui is really not contesting that she was drinking. She's not contesting that she was involved in the accident. But she certainly is adamant about the fact that she wasn't driving.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The district court found Ui guilty of both the OVUII and driving without a license offenses. Ui appealed to the ICA, which affirmed her OVUII conviction under HRS \u00a7 291E-61(a)(4). In her application for writ of certiorari challenging the ICA's decision to affirm her OVUII conviction, Ui did not raise any error with respect to the blood test stipulation. However, this court directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing on whether the district court erred in failing to engage Ui in a colloquy regarding the blood test stipulation pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record evinces that, contrary to the facts in\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   , this was not a unilateral decision made by Ui's counsel. On the contrary, Ui's counsel interrupted the State's calling of the medical technician to state, \"Ms. Ui's asking me, was asking me if these witnesses are necessary, and I explained to her not if we're willing to stipulate to certain things.\" Ui's counsel then requested and was granted a recess to speak with Ui about the stipulation. Upon returning from the recess, Ui's counsel explained to the court that \"we have reached an agreement, and I have gone over all the stipulations with Ms. Ui.\" After the stipulations were read, Ui's counsel noted again that he \"reviewed those stipulations as well as the exhibits with Ms. Ui, and she understands that they're going to be-that we're not challenging any of those facts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Although there is no written stipulation signed by Ui, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   , the record reflects that Ui wanted to stipulate, initiated the stipulation, discussed the stipulation and its effects with her attorney, and ultimately agreed to it. Ui made this decision after hearing testimony from Wong, in which he recounted drinking with Ui on the night of the accident, and from the police officer, in which he testified that he ordered a mandatory blood draw of Ui after receiving a report from the ER physician that Ui smelled of alcohol. On the basis of these facts, I cannot see how the district court's \"error\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   affected\n   <em>\n    the defendant's\n   </em>\n   substantial rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313068\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/92/#p100\">\n    122 Hawai'i at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12313068\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/122/92/#p100\">\n    223 P.3d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Nakayama, J., dissenting) (emphases in original).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Finally, I continue to maintain my concern that the Majority's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   in this case further erodes the relationship between an attorney and her client, imposes unreasonable duties upon the court, and intrudes upon the adversarial nature of the trial process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   A court is not obligated to engage in a mandatory colloquy with every defendant to ensure that he, notwithstanding his counsel's silence or conduct, knowingly and intelligently waived each and every one of his constitutional rights.
