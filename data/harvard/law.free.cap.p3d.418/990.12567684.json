On appeal, she argues the superior court breached the physician-patient privilege by admitting her medical records and allowing her physicians to testify against her. We hold the privilege is abrogated by statute in cases of suspected AHCCCS fraud and affirm Zeitner's convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Zeitner went to a Phoenix obstetrician for an abortion in March 2010. She told him she just had discovered she was pregnant after recently undergoing extensive radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer. Zeitner said she wanted an abortion because she thought the radiation and chemotherapy likely had harmed her fetus. After examining Zeitner, however, the obstetrician concluded she was well-nourished and healthy, about 20 weeks' pregnant and in no acute distress. Accordingly, he proposed a course of care designed to avoid an abortion. He told Zeitner to obtain information from her cancer physicians about her treatments and referred her to a specialist in high-risk pregnancies in the hope that she could deliver a viable baby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Zeitner met with the specialist a few days later. Examining Zeitner, the specialist grew suspicious. He thought it unusual that, although Zeitner told him she had a diagnosed malignant uterine tumor, the physicians treating her cancer had not removed her uterus. Zeitner told the specialist her main chemotherapy drug was acetaminophen-an over-the-counter pain reliever, not a chemotherapy drug. And Zeitner was unable to relate details of her cancer diagnosis or treatment, other than that she had been diagnosed at a hospital in Boston. From an ultrasound, the specialist saw no abnormalities that compelled an abortion. He reported his concerns about Zeitner's veracity to the obstetrician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 A few days later, Zeitner successfully applied for AHCCCS benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   AHCCCS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   had turned down an application Zeitner had submitted just a month before, citing insufficient documentation. Although Zeitner's earlier application had said she had no serious or chronic illnesses, on the application she submitted in late March, Zeitner stated she had a serious chronic illness and said her pregnancy was high-risk and life-threatening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 On March 31, the obstetrician received an email signed \"Al Zeitner\" that seemed to be following up on behalf of Chalice Zeitner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Referencing Chalice in the third person, the email stated the author was waiting to hear back from the obstetrician about a \"procedure\" that he purportedly had proposed. The email suggested the procedure was urgent, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Chalice is scheduled to resume chemo and radiotherapy on April 9th. She must have the tumors removed in the next 4 weeks. She is on bedrest and supervised care in her home until notice from [the Phoenix obstetrician] of this procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 Shortly thereafter, Zeitner brought the obstetrician a letter dated April 1, purportedly written by a \"Dr. McMahon\" at the Boston hospital Zeitner claimed had treated her for cancer. The letter recommended that Zeitner \"receive an urgent [abortion] ... to relieve third term life-threatening certainties to the patient.\" Attached to the letter was a list of chemotherapy and radiotherapy medications purportedly prescribed to Zeitner. (Although a physician named McMahon actually practiced at the Boston hospital at the time, he had never treated Zeitner and had not written the letter or created the list of medications Zeitner gave to him.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 7 Accepting the letter as authentic, the obstetrician concluded Zeitner urgently needed an abortion. Based on his opinion that an abortion was necessary to protect Zeitner's health, AHCCCS authorized payment, and the obstetrician aborted Zeitner's fetus on April 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 Meanwhile, Zeitner launched a scheme to garner donations from friends and others to fund her purported cancer treatments. Using the name \"Trinity McLaughlin,\" Zeitner sent a social media message to her boyfriend, informing him that \"Trinity\" and a few others had created a webpage to raise funds for Zeitner's cancer treatments and suggesting the boyfriend take over the fundraising effort. The next week, \"Trinity\" emailed the boyfriend fundraising materials for him to use, including a heartrending plea for donations detailing Zeitner's cancer, her costly painful treatments and her resulting financial hardships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Acting on \"Trinity's\" request, the boyfriend posted on a fundraising website the story \"Trinity\" had sent him, forwarded \"Dr. McMahon's\" letter to the website to satisfy its request for proof that Zeitner actually had a medical condition, opened a bank account for donations, and solicited more than 600 social media friends to help pay for the purported cancer treatments. In response, more than 20 people donated a cumulative total of more than $2,000 to Zeitner's cancer fund via the website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Several months later, Zeitner became pregnant again, and the Phoenix obstetrician delivered her child by caesarean section. During the procedure, the obstetrician saw no evidence that tumors had been removed from Zeitner's uterus or that she had undergone chemotherapy or radiation. By then highly suspicious about Zeitner's claimed cancer, the obstetrician contacted Dr. McMahon at the Boston hospital, who said he had not treated Zeitner nor authored the letter Zeitner had given him. The obstetrician reported his suspicions about Zeitner to her health plan, which forwarded the matter to AHCCCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 A grand jury eventually indicted Zeitner on 11 charges. AHCCCS generally does not cover abortions; the indictment alleged\n   Zeitner defrauded AHCCCS and stole public health benefits by lying about having cancer so that her abortion would fall within an exception to that rule. The State also alleged Zeitner defrauded the donors to her cancer fund, attempted to steal donations and committed identity theft and forgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 After pleading not guilty to each of the charges, Zeitner moved to preclude all information her physicians obtained from her, including records relating to her communications with the physicians and their examinations of her, arguing they were protected under Arizona's physician-patient privilege, Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 13-4062(A)(4) (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State opposed the motions, arguing the privilege was abrogated by statute and, in any event, Zeitner had waived it. The court denied the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 After an 11-day trial in which the court admitted Zeitner's medical records and allowed her physicians to testify, the jury found Zeitner guilty of all charges. The court sentenced her to concurrent prison terms, the longest of which was ten years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Zeitner timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9 of the Arizona Constitution, and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) (2018), 13-4031 (2018) and -4033(A)(1) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. General Principles.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 On appeal, the only argument Zeitner raises is that the superior court erred by admitting her medical records and allowing her physicians to testify against her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   whether a privilege applies.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We agree with the State that the legislature likewise has created a statutory exception to the physician-patient privilege that applies when a patient lies to a physician in seeking treatment for which AHCCCS otherwise would not provide reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 By law, health-care providers must report \"suspected fraud\" to AHCCCS, and if the agency's resulting \"preliminary investigation\" gives rise to a belief that a fraud has occurred, AHCCCS \"shall\" refer the claim for prosecution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   All contractors, subcontracted providers of care and noncontracting providers shall notify the [AHCCCS] director or the director's designee immediately in a written report of any cases of suspected fraud or abuse.

Although the cited provisions do not explicitly constrain the physician-patient privilege, they abrogate the privilege by implication when fraud is suspected by imposing disclosure obligations on physicians that are entirely inconsistent with the privilege. In the normal case, the physician-patient privilege does not permit compelled disclosure of the physician's records concerning a patient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mincey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"722485\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/141/425/#p439\">\n    141 Ariz. at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"722485\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/141/425/#p439\">\n    687 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1194 ;\n   <em>\n    Rowles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1251017\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/21/424/#p427\">\n    21 Ariz.App. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1251017\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/21/424/#p427\">\n    520 P.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But when fraud against AHCCCS is suspected, A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-2903(I) and -2918(G) require physicians to release a patient's medical records without the patient's consent. Indeed, \u00a7 36-2903(I) explicitly trumps the physician-patient privilege in such cases by compelling a physician to release patient records to investigators \"[n]otwithstanding any law to the contrary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 25 Zeitner argues that even though the cited statutes may compel physicians to report suspected fraud and release patient records in such cases, it does not follow that the State may\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   that information to prosecute a patient suspected of fraud. We are not persuaded. Under \u00a7 36-2918.01(A), when a preliminary investigation by AHCCCS \"give[s] the director reason to believe that an incident of fraud or abuse has occurred,\" the director \"shall\" refer the matter to the attorney general. The purpose of such a referral, of course, would be for consideration of prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Admin. Code R9-22-512(A)(2) (AHCCCS may \"release safeguarded information ... without the [patient's] consent, for the purpose of conducting ... prosecution ... related to the administration of the AHCCCS program.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 26 Zeitner also argues that no statute or regulation allows a physician to be compelled\n   to testify about a patient's medical care. But under \u00a7 36-2903(I), medical records relating to a suspected fraud must be disclosed; that abrogation of the privilege necessarily implies that a physician may be called to testify about statements the patient made relevant to the suspected fraud.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rowles,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1251017\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/21/424/#p427\">\n    21 Ariz.App. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1251017\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/21/424/#p427\">\n    520 P.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (although nominally a testimonial privilege, physician-patient privilege also shields records a physician maintains for his or her patients). It would serve little purpose, and would make little sense, for a patient to retain the power to prevent her physician from testifying when the physician can be legally compelled to release the patient's medical records-the confidences the privilege is designed to protect already will have been disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27 In construing statutes, we \"apply constructions that make practical sense\" rather than those that \"frustrate legislative intent.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Hasson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715651\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/217/559/#p562\">\n    217 Ariz. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562, \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715651\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/217/559/#p562\">\n    177 P.3d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304 (App. 2008). Construing the AHCCCS anti-fraud statutes to abrogate the privilege for records in which a physician recounts a patient's statements but not for the physician's testimony about those statements would frustrate the legislature's intent by impeding fraud prosecutions while failing to meaningfully protect a patient's privacy. Construing the reporting and disclosure requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 36-2918.01(A) and -2903(I) to serve the purpose of investigating and prosecuting fraud, we hold that in cases of suspected fraud against AHCCCS, a physician may be required to testify about communications with a patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 28 In sum, as in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , we decline to apply a common-law crime-fraud exception to the statutory physician-patient privilege. The reporting and disclosure requirements that AHCCCS imposes on physicians, however, distinguish a prosecution of suspected AHCCCS fraud from the workers' compensation fraud in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . The reporting requirements that AHCCCS imposes on physicians and the requirement to disclose confidential patient information in cases of suspected fraud abrogate the privilege insofar as it otherwise might shield a patient's records and statements to a physician in such a case. Accordingly, the superior court did not err in declining to enforce the privilege and by admitting Zeitner's medical records and allowing the State to call her physicians to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore affirm Zeitner's convictions and the resulting sentences.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    AHCCCS administers Arizona's Medicaid program.\n    <em>\n     Southwest Fiduciary, Inc. v.
