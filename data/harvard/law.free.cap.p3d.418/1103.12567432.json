PMG also appeals from the court's denial of its counterclaims against Maricopa Citizens and cross-claims against the Clerk. On September 6, 2017, we reversed the trial court and directed it to enter judgment in favor of PMG, the Clerk, and the City, indicating a written opinion would follow. This is that opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 The controversy in this case centers on a large parcel of land located in Pinal County. In 1963, it was zoned \"CI-2-Industrial Zone.\" The City annexed the property in 2007, but retained its zoning designation under the then-existing zoning code (\"the Old Code\"). The City adopted a new zoning code (\"the New Code\") in 2015. Subsequently, PMG sought a permit to build a motorsports facility on the site and, pursuant to the City's instructions, submitted in February 2017 a \"Conditional Use Permit Application\" (a designation that existed only in the New Code) upon which someone had handwritten \"Industrial Use Permit\" (a designation that existed only under the Old Code). The Old Code expressly identified a \"[r]acetrack or sports stadium\" as a possible use under the property's existing CI-2-Industrial Zone designation. In April 2017, the City's Zoning and Planning Commission unanimously approved PMG's application, as did the City Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 Maricopa Citizens then filed a referendum application and, in June 2017, submitted eighty-six petition sheets containing approximately 1,000 signatures. The Clerk determined\n   the subject matter of the referendum was \"an administrative act, rather than a legislative act and, therefore, not subject to referendum.\" The Clerk also disqualified thirty signatures for statutory reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Maricopa Citizens filed a complaint naming PMG,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Clerk, and the City as defendants. Maricopa Citizens first argued the City had violated the New Code by issuing the permit, claiming the property had to first be rezoned and then approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission instead of the City Council. Thus, Maricopa Citizens reasoned, the City's action was \"akin to a zoning decision and therefore referable\" because a conditional use permit did not exist under the old zoning designation. According to Maricopa Citizens, the City had \"made policy\" by deciding \"a property owner that was in a district under the Old Code in which he was eligible to apply for an industrial use permit [was] now eligible for a conditional use permit\" and by determining \"the decision whether to grant [a conditional use permit] should be governed by the Old Code.\" Maricopa Citizens further argued that, under the Old Code, the City's determination to award PMG a permit constituted a legislative decision. Finally, Maricopa Citizens contended the Clerk lacked authority to invalidate twelve of the signatures pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 19-121.01 because only the city or zip code was missing, and not the residence address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 PMG counterclaimed against Maricopa Citizens and cross-claimed against the City and the Clerk for declaratory, injunctive, and special-action relief, asserting the petition sheets \"invert[ed] the placement of the designation of the 'Maricopa City Council' as the body enacting the matter to be referred\" and thus did not comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 19-101(A). PMG further asserted the sheets violated A.R.S. \u00a7 19-121(A)(5)\"by having a top margin of less than one-half inch.\" Thus, PMG concluded, the petition sheets were invalid because they did not strictly comply with applicable statutory requirements for referendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 After briefing and oral argument, the trial court ruled in favor of Maricopa Citizens, concluding the grant of the use permit was legislative action and thus subject to referendum irrespective whether \"the new code preserved the right to apply for an industrial use permit, or if the City Council made a policy decision to restore that right.\" It further concluded the Clerk's decision to disqualify twelve signatures \"exceeds the permitted scope of the initial review\" allowed by statute. Finally, the court determined the petitions were not \"fatally defective,\" finding the \"petition strictly complies with A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 19-101(A) and 19-121(A) as reasonably construed to supplement its constitutional purpose.\" Accordingly, the court ordered the Clerk \"to include the twelve signatures in the count of eligible signatures, include those signatures in the pool of eligible signatures for random selection, and promptly forward the legally required random sample of the subject referendum petition to the County Recorder.\" This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-2101(A)(1) and 19-122(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 We address first the question whether the trial court erred by concluding the City's decision to grant the use permit was a legislative rather than administrative act and therefore subject to referendum.

The lack of specificity in a bond proposal grants the City much more leeway in deciding when and where to administer the bond funds. This lack of specificity may well be a valid reason to oppose a bond proposal. It does not change, however, the nature of the council's action from administrative to legislative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548000\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/169/485/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548000\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/169/485/#p488\">\n    at 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548000\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/169/485/#p488\">\n    821 P.2d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 As noted, under\n   <em>\n    Wennerstrom\n   </em>\n   , the test of what is legislative and what is administrative \"has further been said to be whether the proposition is one to make new law or\n   to execute law already in existence,\" and an act is administrative \"if it merely pursues a plan already adopted by the legislative body itself, or some power superior to it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548000\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/169/485/#p488\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548000\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/169/485/#p488\">\n    at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548000\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/169/485/#p488\">\n    821 P.2d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   5 E.

In this instance, the City created policy and acted in a legislative capacity when it initially adopted the Old Code and then, upon later adopting the New Code, retained the Old Code's designations and regulations concerning the PMG property. However, when it approved PMG's use permit, thereby allowing a use of the property that had been expressly identified in the Old Code, the City merely executed already existing policy and, therefore, acted in an administrative capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 We are unpersuaded by Maricopa Citizens' reliance upon\n   <em>\n    State v.
