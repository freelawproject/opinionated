Jacobson argues the trial court erred when it precluded two experts from testifying she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a \"cold\" expert from testifying about the general hormonal effects of pregnancy. We hold the PTSD diagnoses and \"cold\" expert testimony were properly excluded and affirm the trial court's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Late in the night of February 25, 2015, Jacobson fatally shot her live-in boyfriend, Marvin J., in the head while he was lying in bed. Jacobson then tried to clean up the scene, wrapped Marvin's body in a tarp, and moved it to a nearby window. Jacobson disposed of the bloody bed sheets and buried the gun before reporting the shooting to the police two days later. At the time, Jacobson was nine months' pregnant with Marvin's child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 When a deputy sheriff later interviewed Jacobson, she claimed she killed Marvin in self-defense. Jacobson said Marvin had been angry with her for a few days and, on the night of the shooting, he woke her up by kicking her in the stomach. Jacobson said Marvin yelled he was \"sick of [her],\" and did not want the baby. Jacobson said she left the bed, grabbed the gun, and shot Marvin believing \"whoever [got] to the gun first [was] going to be saved.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jacobson said Marvin had kicked her in the stomach during her prior pregnancy as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 The State charged Jacobson with one count of first-degree murder and three counts of tampering with physical evidence. A few days after her arrest, Jacobson gave birth to her second child. The children were then taken into State custody and the State sought to sever her parental rights. A psychiatrist, Dr. Chris Linskey, and a psychologist, Dr. Patricia Rose, evaluated Jacobson for purposes of the severance hearing and diagnosed her with PTSD. Both doctors then testified at the severance hearing and made clear that their opinions, consistent with the severance proceedings, related solely to Jacobson's ability to parent the two children. Throughout that process, and upon advice of counsel, Jacobson did not answer questions related to the shooting, and the doctors said they intentionally avoided discussing the events surrounding the shooting when evaluating Jacobson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Before trial, the court granted the State's motion to preclude testimony about Jacobson's PTSD diagnoses. The trial court also granted the State's motion to preclude testimony about the general hormonal effects associated with third-trimester pregnancies that Jacobson sought to introduce through a\n   \"cold\" expert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jacobson was subsequently convicted on all counts, and sentenced to life in prison. Jacobson timely appealed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and we have jurisdiction pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   13-4031, and -4033(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

At issue is: (1) whether the PTSD diagnoses were admissible to show past acts of domestic abuse, and (2) whether the PTSD diagnoses may be used to address the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element of first-degree murder.

There, a psychiatrist diagnosed a defendant with PTSD and testified he believed the defendant was a victim of domestic violence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"75370\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/207/280/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"75370\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/207/280/\">\n    at 282, \u00b6 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"75370\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/207/280/\">\n    85 P.3d at 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the propriety of the admission of the PTSD diagnosis was never questioned or addressed by the Court of Appeals. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Vogel\n   </em>\n   does not support the introduction of a PTSD diagnosis as proof of prior acts of domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

To apply this modified reasonable person standard, the jury must first determine whether the victim perpetrated past acts of domestic violence against the defendant, and, if so, then determine whether a reasonable person who had been subjected to those past acts of domestic violence would have used physical force in self-defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 Toward that end, a defendant may present evidence of the victim's past acts of domestic violence against the defendant to illustrate the application of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-415.

In this case, the PTSD diagnoses only served to vouch for Jacobson's credibility and should thus be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 As previously addressed, Drs. Rose and Linskey evaluated Jacobson solely for issues attendant to a severance case initiated following her arrest. Dr. Rose's evaluation of Jacobson was conducted over two days and was based primarily upon Jacobson's own statements that she was a victim of domestic violence. Parts of Dr. Rose's evaluation were self-administered, meaning Jacobson sat alone to answer the questions and had significant time to contemplate her answers before returning the questionnaire to Dr. Rose. Dr. Rose did not consider any physical evidence or third-party statements regarding Jacobson's otherwise unsubstantiated claims of having suffered domestic abuse. Based upon this information, Dr. Rose concluded in her report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Jacobson] experiences PTSD, panic disorder, and an unspecified depressive disorder. Additionally, she has been the victim of psychological and physical spousal abuse, and has been exposed to extreme marital distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Dr. Linskey's evaluation lasted approximately an hour and a half, and his determinations were based solely upon Jacobson's own statements to him and the information contained within Dr. Rose's report. Limited to the identical information obtained and evaluated by Dr. Rose, Dr. Linskey diagnosed Jacobson with PTSD. As the State notes, both doctors took Jacobson at her word when she alleged to have been subjected to abuse from Marvin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the severance hearing, Dr. Linskey testified Jacobson \"seemed to be honest in her answers\" and seemed \"sincere.\" Dr. Rose testified Jacobson was \"cooperative,\" took the evaluation \"seriously,\" was \"forthcoming,\" and \"wanted to answer the questions accurately.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15 No Arizona case law discusses the admissibility of a diagnosis based solely upon a defendant's statements. However, we find the analysis in\n   <em>\n    State v. Lupoli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671650\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/348/346/\">\n    348 Or. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671650\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/348/346/\">\n    234 P.3d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), to be highly persuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Lupoli\n   </em>\n   , the state sought to introduce an expert's diagnosis that a child was the victim of sexual abuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123-24. The expert reviewed no physical evidence and relied solely upon the child's statements to the expert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124-25. The Oregon Supreme Court held the diagnosis inadmissible because it was solely based upon the expert's \"assessment of the child's believability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125. The court recognized that portions of the expert's testimony may have been admissible, but because those portions were \"inextricably bound up with portions that constituted clear 'vouching,' \" the entire diagnosis was inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16 In this case, both doctors based their PTSD diagnoses solely upon Jacobson's post-arrest statements. The doctors did not consider any physical evidence of, or conflicting evidence regarding, abuse by the victim; nor did they interview any other witnesses. Accordingly, we find the PTSD diagnoses in this case inherently vouch for Jacobson's credibility. As such, their admission would allow expert testimony to usurp the jury's role as factfinder. Jacobson's PTSD diagnoses are therefore inadmissible as evidence of past acts of domestic abuse having been perpetrated against Jacobson by Marvin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 Not only did the doctors rely solely upon Jacobson's statements, but Jacobson omitted key information in providing those statements relevant to the eventual PTSD diagnoses. An expert's testimony is not admissible if the testimony is based upon insufficient facts or data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Evid. 702(b). During interviews with detectives, Jacobson reported having been sexually assaulted by her mother's boyfriend. When Jacobson reported the assaults to her mother, her mother did not believe her. Jacobson did not disclose anything having to do with this information to Drs. Rose and Linskey throughout the course of their evaluations, even when specifically asked to disclose any prior traumatic events. Thereafter, at the pretrial hearing, the State asked Dr. Linskey whether a PTSD diagnosis was necessarily associated with abuse stemming from a single relationship. Dr. Linskey, testified that unresolved prior traumatic events,\n   <em>\n    such as sexual assault\n   </em>\n   , could also cause PTSD. Given Dr. Linskey's testimony, and Jacobson's significant omission of clearly relevant traumatic history during the doctors' evaluations, the PTSD diagnoses were based upon insufficient facts or data to specifically attribute any PTSD Jacobson might suffer to the asserted abuse from Marvin. Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it precluded the PTSD diagnoses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Pregnancy Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Jacobson argues the trial court erred when it precluded Dr. Hibbert's \"cold\" expert testimony regarding the effect of increased cortisol levels in the late stages of pregnancy. The State contends Dr. Hibbert's testimony was merely an additional attempt to introduce inadmissible diminished-capacity evidence. In its ruling, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   I do believe this would be improper expert testimony regarding the issues of hormonal changes when given that the defendant was about to give birth. ... Dr. Hibbert testified that there are hormonal changes during pregnancy that can affect cognition. And when she was asked to explain what she meant by that, that she said it could affect planning, thinking, mental state, judgment, insight, perception and memory. The Court believes that this ... would be improper evidence of potential diminished capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We agree with the trial court's assessment; the proposed testimony amounted to diminished-capacity evidence. Dr. Hibbert's remarks about cognition illustrate that the only purpose of introducing the testimony was to suggest to the jury that Jacobson acted with cortisol-driven diminished capacity at the time of the murder, prohibited by\n   <em>\n    Mott. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 Not only was the \"cold\" expert testimony inadmissible as diminished-capacity evidence, it was also not relevant to the self-defense claim. Self-defense claims, other than those arising under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-415, are evaluated on a \"reasonable person\" standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Jacobson's pregnancy is not relevant to either the reasonable person standard, or the reasonable victim of domestic violence, but instead is an individual characteristic entitled to no special consideration. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it precluded Dr. Hibbert's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 Finally, Jacobson argues that by precluding the PTSD diagnoses, the trial court \"left [her] with no vehicle to bolster her abuse claims,\" and thereby deprived her of a complete defense. It needs first be noted that it is not within the purview of the court to allow otherwise inadmissible evidence to \"bolster\" a defense. Further, the doctors, evaluating Jacobson solely for issues attendant to a severance proceeding, admitted having premised their diagnoses solely upon Jacobson's statements. Because Jacobson failed to provide essential, requested information to the doctors, she left them in the position of only being able to assess the incomplete history she provided, and such testimony would impermissibly vouch for Jacobson's credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. Moreover, beyond anything the doctors were competent to contribute, Jacobson had sufficient opportunity to present further evidence of Marvin's past acts of domestic abuse. Jacobson presented testimony from her obstetrician and her family physician, who both testified Jacobson had reported physical abuse from Marvin before the shooting. Jacobson called both of Marvin's ex-wives, who testified he was emotionally abusive during their respective relationships with him. Finally, Jacobson called Dr. Geffner, to testify regarding the general attributes of domestic violence victims. Indeed, within her reply brief, Jacobson admits that she presented evidence to the jury that she was a victim of domestic abuse and that Marvin was the perpetrator of the abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 Jacobson had sufficient opportunity to prove Marvin committed acts of domestic violence against her, and the trial court gave the jury a detailed instruction related to the \"reasonable victim of domestic violence\" standard, including a list of what constituted past acts of domestic violence. Accordingly, we find no violation of Jacobson's due process rights to a complete defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 Jacobson's conviction and sentence for first-degree murder are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \"We view the facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the jury's verdict.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.
