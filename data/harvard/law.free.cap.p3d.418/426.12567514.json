Appellants filed a pre-enforcement action against the City of Phoenix (\"Phoenix\") challenging the constitutionality of Phoenix City Code 18-4(B) (\"Section 18-4(B)\") and seeking a preliminary injunction to bar enforcement of the ordinance. Appellants appeal the superior court's denial of their preliminary injunction and grant of summary judgment in favor of Phoenix. For the following reasons, we affirm as modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 2 Brush &amp; Nib is a for-profit limited liability company, which sells pre-fabricated and design artwork for home d\u00e9cor, weddings, and special events. Appellants provide retail goods and services to the public and acknowledge they operate a place of public accommodation as defined in Phoenix City Code \u00a7 18.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 3 Appellants are devout Christians and believe their work is inextricably related to their religious beliefs. Appellants' goods and services include both customer-directed projects (work created through a consultation between Appellants and their customer) and pre-fabricated merchandise (work created without Appellants' knowledge of how the items will be used or who will use those products).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants believe their customer-directed\n   and designed wedding products \"convey messages about a particular engaged couple, their upcoming marriage, their upcoming marriage ceremony, and the celebration of that marriage.\" Appellants also strongly believe in an ordained marriage between one man and one woman, and argue that they cannot separate their religious beliefs from their work. As such, they believe being required to create customer-specific merchandise for same-sex weddings will violate their religious beliefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 4 Appellants want to be able to legally refuse to create custom-made merchandise for all same-sex weddings. Additionally, Appellants desire to post a public statement explaining their religious beliefs. Appellants' proposed statement, in part, would notify potential customers that \"Brush &amp; Nib Studio won't create any artwork that violates [their] vision as defined by [their] religious and artistic beliefs and identity,\" which includes \"artwork that demeans others, endorses racism, incites violence, contradicts [their] Christian faith, or promotes any marriage except marriage between one man and one woman.\" Appellants have not posted this statement because they believe it would violate Section 18-4(B). Instead, Appellants sought a preliminary injunction to bar Phoenix from enforcing Section 18-4(B) and a declaration that Section 18-4(B) violates the Arizona Constitution's free speech clause, religious toleration clause, equal protection clause, due process clause, and the Arizona Free Exercise of Religion Act (\"FERA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 5 Phoenix filed a motion to dismiss and the case proceeded to a bench trial before the superior court. The superior court denied Phoenix's motion to dismiss, finding Appellants had standing and the case was justiciable. The court then denied Appellants' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding Section 18-4(B) did not violate Appellants' freedom of speech nor substantially burden their exercise of religion. Appellants timely appealed the denial of the preliminary injunction to this court and moved to stay proceedings before the superior court. The court denied Appellants' request. Appellants then moved, and Phoenix cross-moved, for summary judgment. The court granted Phoenix's motion for summary judgment on all claims. Appellants filed a timely appeal from the court's summary judgment ruling and moved to consolidate that appeal with the appeal from the denial of the preliminary injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We granted Appellants' request, and have jurisdiction over this consolidated appeal pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution, and Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") sections 12-120.21(A)(1) (2016) and 12-2101(A)(1) (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 6 Arizona courts have long upheld the public's right to participate in society without fear of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See Phillips v. Phoenix Union High Schs.\n   </em>\n   , Maricopa Cty. Super. Ct. No. 72909 (1953) (enjoining Phoenix Union High Schools from segregating pupils based on race);\n   <em>\n    accord, Heard v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , Maricopa Cty. Super. Ct. No. 77497 (1954). The\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   court expressly found that \"democracy rejects any theory of second-class citizenship\" and that \"[a] half century of intolerance is enough.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.; see also\n   </em>\n   Paul Rees,\n   <em>\n    A Civil Rights Victory, Pre-Loving\n   </em>\n   , 53 Ariz. Att'y 84 (Aug. 2017) (noting that Arizona repealed its anti-miscegenation law before the United States Supreme Court found such laws unconstitutional).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 7 In 2014, however, the Arizona legislature sought to amend FERA to expand the definition of a protected person from \"a religious assembly or institution\" to \"any individual, association, partnership, corporation, church, religious assembly or institution, estate, trust, foundation or other legal entity.\" S.B. 1062, 2014 Leg., 51st 2d. Reg. Sess. (Ariz. 2014). Although S.B. 1062 was ultimately vetoed, it was viewed by some as a reaction to the development of antidiscrimination ordinances, which included sexual orientation as a protected class, and the national trend in favor of granting broader rights to same-sex couples. Dinita L. James,\n   <em>\n    Amid SB 1062 Frenzy, Tempe Becomes 4th AZ City to Protect LGBT Status\n   </em>\n   , 20 No. 11 Ariz. Emp. L. Letter 1 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 8 Currently, nineteen states have enacted public accommodation antidiscrimination laws which include sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes.\n   <em>\n    See Equality Maps/Non-Discrimination Laws\n   </em>\n   , Movement Advancement Project (2018), http://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws. Arizona's public accommodation antidiscrimination statute, however, does not specifically include sexual orientation as a protected class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 41-1442(A) (2017). Accordingly, several Arizona cities have enacted broader ordinances to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in places of public accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEMPE CODE CH. 2 Art. VIII \u00a7 2-601 (2014); FLAGSTAFF CODE CH. 14 \u00a7 14-02-001-0001 (2013); TUCSON CODE Art. II \u00a7 17-1 (1999). Like Tempe, Flagstaff, and Tucson, Phoenix's Code, Section 18-4(B), as amended in 2013, prohibits discrimination in places of public accommodation based on sexual orientation. Section 18-4(B) provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   No person shall, directly or indirectly, refuse, withhold from, or deny to any person, or aid in or incite such refusal, denial or withholding of, accommodations, advantages, facilities or privileges thereof because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or disability nor shall distinction be made with respect to any person based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or disability in connection with the price or quality of any item, goods or services offered by or at any place of public accommodation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   It is unlawful for any owner, operator, lessee, manager, agent or employee of any place of public accommodation to directly or indirectly display, circulate, publicize or mail any advertisement, notice or communication which states or implies that any facility or service shall be refused or restricted because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or disability or that any person, because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or disability would be unwelcome, objectionable, unacceptable, undesirable or not solicited.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Phoenix City Code \u00a7 18-4(B)(2)-(3) (2013).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 9 On appeal, Appellants raise a myriad of constitutional issues, arguing that Section 18-4(B) is unconstitutional, both on its face and as-applied, and that any enforcement of Section 18-4(B) would violate their First Amendment right to free speech and free exercise of religion under state law. Appellants are not the first to attempt to use their religious beliefs to justify practices others consider overtly discriminatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bob Jones Univ. v.

When faced with similar contentions, other jurisdictions have overwhelmingly concluded that the government has a compelling interest in eradicating discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arlene's Flowers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20P.3d%20543\">\n    389 P.3d at 565-66, \u00b6\u00b6 74-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (compiling cases where the state's compelling interest in eradicating discrimination survived strict scrutiny).

Appellants, however, argue that Phoenix does not suffer from pervasive sexual orientation discrimination, as evident from the historic lack of lawsuits to date, and that Phoenix could have used other means to achieve its goal, such as posting lists of businesses that will provide services for same-sex weddings.

Even assuming this to be true, it does not render Section 18-4(B) unconstitutional. Section 18-4(B) applies to all places of public accommodation and all business owners equally, regardless of their beliefs. Contrary to Appellants assertions, Section 18-4(B) does not infringe their fundamental rights by requiring that they provide equal goods and services to all customers regardless of sexual orientation. As such, the provisions of Section 18-4(B) must only be rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. As previously demonstrated, Phoenix has a legitimate governmental purpose in curtailing discriminatory practices, and prohibiting businesses from sexual orientation discrimination is rationally related to that purpose. Thus, Section 18-4(B) does not violate Appellants' equal protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    VIII.
