Mr. Young lived with FH's maternal grandmother in Gillette, Wyoming. During the winter of 2014-15 and spring of 2015, FH and her brother often spent the night with their grandmother and Mr. Young.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] In April 2015, FH reported to her teachers she had been sexually abused by Mr. Young. FH said that, on two occasions the previous winter, Mr. Young awoke her in the living room where she had been sleeping, undressed her, took her to a bathroom, and licked her breast area and genitals. FH also reported that Mr. Young made her kiss his penis while they were working on a \"monster truck\" in a carport located near Mr. Young's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] The State charged Mr. Young with two counts of first degree sexual abuse of a minor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-314\">\n    Wyo.

Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-2-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017). Because\n   Mr. Young had previously been convicted of a similar crime, the State asserted the penalties for his crimes should be enhanced under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-306\">\n    Wyo.

Mr. Young pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] Prior to trial, the defense requested a hearing on FH's competence as a witness. The district court held a hearing, where it asked FH about various topics, including general questions about her memory of the abuse. After FH stated that she did not remember the abuse, the district judge took a break and expressed concern to counsel about FH's memory. When the hearing recommenced, the judge questioned her about movies and other events that would have happened around the same time as the charged events and she was able to recall them. The district court found her competent to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] The district court held a three-day jury trial beginning February 27, 2017. FH testified at the trial, describing the abuse in detail, and the jury returned guilty verdicts on all charges. Mr. Young stipulated that he had previously been convicted of a similar crime, so the penalties for his convictions in this case were enhanced. The district court ordered him to serve five consecutive sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Mr. Young timely filed a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b69] We believe it is worthwhile to refine our standard of review for determinations of child witness competency.

The district court specifically found that FH's testimony at the competency hearing demonstrated she had a sufficient memory of the time-period, but was generally reluctant to talk about the abuse.

However, the\n   <em>\n    Larsen\n   </em>\n   test \"focuses on the mental abilities of the witness rather than the witness's recollection of specific events.\"\n   <em>\n    Gruwell,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986864\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/254/223/\">\n    254 P.3d at 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Many witnesses (both children and adults) do not remember certain events or facts. The inability to remember specific matters does not mean a witness is not competent to testify, although it may affect her credibility as a witness. As the district court in this case recognized, competence is not the same as credibility.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Griggs,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822731\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/367/1108/\">\n    367 P.3d at 1121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (child witness competent to testify even though she said she \"forget[s] sometimes\");\n   <em>\n    Sisneros v.

We daresay any person asked a general question about whether he or she could remember things that happened two years ago may give a negative, or at the least equivocal, answer. When asked more specifically whether she understood what she would be testifying about in court, she responded that she did.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: ...

So when you're asked questions in the trial, you're not going to be able to answer them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   FH: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   THE COURT: How come?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   FH: Because I'm probably going to be scared.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   THE COURT: Well, yeah, I can understand you being scared; I'm more concerned about whether you can even remember.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   FH: I don't want to talk about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   THE COURT: Okay.

Had she truly not remembered, she would not\n   have stated she was scared to talk about it. Additionally, as the colloquy continued, FH stated she remembered the abuse but did not want to discuss it. Anyone with experience with children knows \"not remembering\" is a common tactic they use to avoid talking about unpleasant or uncomfortable matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b622] The final exchange offered by Mr. Young as showing FH did not have a sufficient memory to testify is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   THE COURT: ... Now, the thing that happened that you're uncomfortable talking about, and I don't want to ask you about it, other than in your own mind, do you remember what happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   FH: No. Not really.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Right after this exchange, the district judge had FH leave the courtroom so he could consult with the attorneys. When FH returned, the judge switched tactics and, instead of asking her about the abuse, he asked her about movies she had seen a couple of years ago. On that topic, she was very forthcoming and demonstrated she could remember events from that time-frame in great detail. The court then returned to asking about her memory of the events in question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   THE COURT: ... I got the sense that maybe you might remember, but you didn't really want to talk about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   FH: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   THE COURT: Is that a fair statement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   FH: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   THE COURT: It's not a question of you not remembering it-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   FH: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   THE COURT: -it's just that you don't feel comfortable talking about it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   FH: It's kind of both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   THE COURT: A little of both, okay.

The abuse happened two years before the competency hearing, when FH was in the second grade at Rozet Elementary. The district court asked her about the gifts she received for Christmas two years before, and she said she had gotten boots from her mother, which she described in detail. Although she could not remember her second grade classroom teacher's name, she recalled her friends' names and that she had gotten to go \"glow bowling\" as a reward for good attendance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   [\u00b624] Considering the entirety of FH's testimony at the competency hearing, we conclude the district court acted reasonably and did not abuse its discretion by finding FH competent to testify.
