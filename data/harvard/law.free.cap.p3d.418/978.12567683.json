(CCD) appeals entry of summary judgment in favor of the Arizona Department of Health Services (the Department) on CCD's complaint for declaratory judgment and mandamus relief. The Department cross-appeals the denial of its motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 CCD argues the evidence establishes that the Department acted arbitrarily and capriciously in interpreting the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (AMMA) and corresponding regulations in a manner that permitted a competitor to participate in a lottery for a medical marijuana dispensary registration certificate without first obtaining a conditional use permit (CUP). The interpretation and application of these provisions present a question of first impression. We hold that neither the statutes and regulations, nor the applicable municipal code, require applicants to obtain a CUP before applying for a dispensary registration certificate, and the Department did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in its application of the law. We further hold that the \"sworn statement\" required to accompany a dispensary registration application need not take any particular form so long as it impresses upon the signatory the importance of telling the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Because we find no error in the trial court's resolution of the issues presented on summary judgment and in the Department's motion for sanctions, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2010, Arizona voters passed Proposition 203, now codified as the AMMA, Ariz.

The AMMA requires non-profit medical marijuana dispensaries to register with the Department-the agency tasked with implementing and administering the AMMA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 36-2803, -2804(A). A prospective dispensary's application for a registration certificate must contain, among other things, documentation that the proposed dispensary location complies with local zoning restrictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2804(B)(1)(d) ; Ariz. Admin. Code (A.A.C.) R9-17-304(C)(5)-(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Initially, the A.A.C. authorized the Department allocate only one dispensary registration certificate for each Community Healthcare Analysis Area (CHAA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.A.C. R9-17-302 (2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the Department received more than one application for a single CHAA, it would randomly select a qualifying applicant according to the priority set forth in A.A.C. R9-17-302(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 In May 2012, CCD applied to operate a dispensary at 1600 East Second Street in the City of Winslow (the City), within the Winslow CHAA. CCD established its compliance with applicable zoning restrictions by providing: (1) a \"Sworn Statement of Compliance with Local Zoning Restrictions,\" executed by an officer and board member of CCD; (2) a\n   copy of a CUP for the Second Street location issued by the City; and (3) a Department form entitled \"Documentation of Compliance with Local Jurisdiction Zoning\" executed by the City's Principal Planner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Two other entities, Green Cross Medical, Inc. (GCM) and The Medicine Room, L.L.C. (TMR), also submitted applications for the Winslow CHAA. Each application was accompanied by the same type of Department form, again executed by the City's Principal Planner, and a statement of compliance executed by the companies' principal officers. The Department determined all three applications were substantively complete in June 2012 and scheduled a lottery in August 2012 to determine which entity would be awarded the certificate for the Winslow CHAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 In the meantime, CCD notified the Department it believed GCM's and TMR's applications had been errantly accepted because the proposed locations were not in compliance with City zoning ordinances. At the same time, the City Attorney notified the Department, GCM, and TMR that City ordinances require applicants to obtain a CUP before the City could certify a proposed dispensary location as compliant with zoning restrictions. The City Attorney explained the City's Principal Planner had issued letters of compliance for GCM and TMR by mistake, the Planner believing only that he was affirming the proposed dispensary locations were, generally, in the proper zone. The City Attorney confirmed the proposed locations were in fact \"in the commercial zone, and would be ... appropriate location[s] for a medical marijuana dispensary.\" However, neither GCM nor TMR had yet applied for, let alone received, a CUP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 In July 2012, the Department notified GCM and TMR their applications were not substantively complete because they had not obtained a CUP from the City and therefore were not in compliance with local zoning ordinances. After further discussion with the City Attorney, the Department advised it did not require a CUP at the application stage. The Department explained: \"DHS has formulated a two-step process for applicants and does permit them a period of time from when they are awarded a dispensary registration certificate to receive actual documentation (such as certificates of occupancy or conditional use permits) authorizing their occupancy as a dispensary.\" The Department assured the City that, after a certificate was issued, \"DHS will require the applicant to be in full compliance [with the City's zoning and business requirements] before [a dispensary] is allowed to open.\" The City Attorney admitted he had been unaware of the two-step process but maintained his position that the City independently required \"both commercial zoning and a conditional use permit be granted for a marijuana dispensary to be located in the city limits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Based upon its \"two-step process\" analysis, the Department accepted the City's prior assurances that the proposed locations would be appropriate for a medical marijuana dispensary and re-designated GCM's and TMR's applications as substantively complete. However, GCM was unable to demonstrate it had the requisite financial backing and lost its preference for selection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.A.C. R9-17-302(B). The Department conducted the lottery as between TMR and CCD, and, as the randomly chosen applicant, TMR was awarded a dispensary registration certificate for the Winslow CHAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 In December 2012, CCD filed a complaint alleging the Department acted arbitrarily and capriciously in permitting TMR to participate in the lottery and sought: (1) a declaration that the Department improperly accepted the application of TMR; (2) a writ of mandamus ordering the Department to void the lottery results and award a dispensary registration certificate to CCD; and (3) an award of damages, attorneys' fees, and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After discovery, both parties moved for summary judgment, and the Department sought sanctions against CCD for maintaining a frivolous claim. After briefing and oral argument, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the Department but denied its\n   motion for sanctions. CCD timely appealed, and the Department timely cross-appealed. We have jurisdiction over both appeals pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Department Did Not Violate Rule 56(c)(3).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 CCD argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Department because, it contends, the Department did not submit a separate statement of facts in the form prescribed by Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(3). That rule requires a party filing or opposing a motion for summary judgment to file \"a statement separate from the supporting memorandum, [setting forth] the specific facts relied on in support of the motion.\" Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). We have reviewed the Department's statement of facts and find it contains concise, numbered paragraphs identifying specific relevant events, in chronological order, and referencing supporting portions of the record and exhibits, and therefore find no merit in CCD's contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 CCD's suggestion that the format of the Department's separate statement of facts made it difficult for CCD to identify the factual issues in dispute is likewise unsupported by the record. CCD's objections to the Department's statement of facts total 593 pages and reflect it had adequate opportunity and ability to address the statements contained therein and to act to protect its interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 Moreover, the trial court has broad discretion in granting judgment regardless of the form of a party's response. Although the court may enter summary judgment against a party who does not properly oppose a motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56(e), so may the court \"grant summary judgment for a nonmoving party; ... grant summary judgment on grounds not raised by a party; or ... consider summary judgment on its own after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute,\" Ariz. R. Civ. P. 56(f). In determining the appropriate disposition, the court is required to consider the portions of the record brought to its attention by the parties, regardless of their technical compliance with Rule 56(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunt v.

As relevant here, a dispensary is eligible for a dispensary registration certificate if it submits \"a sworn statement\" certifying that it is in compliance with local zoning restrictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2804(B)(1)(d).

A document authorizing occupancy, such as a CUP, is not\n   required until the dispensary seeks operational approval following its selection. The statutes and regulations do not require the Department to reject the initial application for a dispensary registration certificate because it lacks a CUP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White Mountain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310284\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/230/#p233\">\n    241 Ariz. at 234, \u00b6 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310284\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/230/#p233\">\n    386 P.3d at 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Only upon [the Department's] allocation and issuance of a registration certificate may a proposed [medical marijuana dispensary then] apply to operate.\") (citing A.A.C.

Requiring multiple applicants to undergo the arduous process of obtaining a CUP before selection of the recipient of a dispensary registration certificate, simply as a matter of course and knowing that only one applicant will ultimately be awarded the certificate, would result in a waste of both the unsuccessful applicants' and the municipalities' resources.

The undisputed evidence indicates the City Attorney and Principal Planner both confirmed the location proposed in TMR's application was \"in the commercial zone, and would be an appropriate location for a medical marijuana dispensary.\" Based upon this information, the City submitted a fully executed form documenting the compliance necessary to complete TMR's application. Although the City Attorney later advised the Department that TMR had not obtained a CUP, the Winslow Municipal Code does not require a dispensary to obtain a CUP before applying for a dispensary registration certificate. Further, CCD did not submit any proof supporting the notion that the Department\n   did not take a reasoned approach to its decision to accept TMR's application over the City Attorney's objection or that the Department applied the two-step process inconsistently among the applicants. Therefore, the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in the Department's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

[\u00a7] 12-349,\" and \"d[id] not find that [CCD's motion for summary judgment] was filed with the intent to harass the Department, increase the cost of litigation in this matter or with the intent of unreasonabl[y] expanding or delaying these proceedings.\" The Department argues these findings are erroneous, and sanctions were warranted, because the record reflects: (1) the City Attorney eventually accepted the Department's interpretation; (2) CCD filed its complaint knowing the Department did not require a CUP be submitted with the application for a dispensary registration certificate; (3) CCD maintained its claims against the Department even after learning GCM's application was not included in the lottery for reasons unrelated to zoning; and (4) CCD opposed the Department's efforts to obtain permission to release confidential information regarding GCM's, TMR's, and CCD's applications in an attempt to \"keep CCD's lies and deception concealed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 39 In advancing this position as to the first three points, the Department misconstrues CCD's argument. CCD's claims, though perhaps inartfully presented, center around its understanding that a municipality may require something more from applicants than what is minimally required by state statutes and regulations before issuing a statement of zoning compliance. CCD asserted the City is a municipality that requires\n   \"something more\" and supported that claim with a sworn statement of the City Attorney. Although its position that the Department acted arbitrarily in determining otherwise was ultimately unsuccessful, we cannot say the claim was entirely frivolous where resolution of the issue involved interpretation of a newly enacted and previously unchallenged law. Nor can we say CCD acted in a wholly unreasonable fashion in adopting the opinion of the City Attorney, a licensed professional tasked with representing the City's interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 40 The Department's fourth point is likewise unsupported by the record. The Department indeed filed a motion for leave to disclose certain documents relating to GCM's, TMR's, and CCD's applications for a dispensary registration certificate, otherwise protected from disclosure pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2810(A). But CCD did not make any \"strenuous objections\" to the disclosure; rather, CCD argued the trial court should order disclosure of all relevant and discoverable documents, rather than \"cherry pick[ ] documents that they think will benefit their case.\" In doing so, CCD presented valid concerns regarding the fairness and utility of releasing the information and did not act unreasonably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 41 The trial court's factual findings are supported by the record and support the conclusion that sanctions were not warranted. On this record, we find no error in the order denying sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 42 The trial court's orders are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 43 Both parties request attorneys' fees and costs be awarded against the other as a sanction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-349 and ARCAP 25. Neither party has proved the other's filings were frivolous or filed for an improper purpose, and we deny both requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 44 CCD also requests its attorneys' fees and costs incurred on appeal pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-348 (authorizing an award of fees and expenses to a party who prevails in certain actions against the state). Because we conclude neither party prevailed on appeal, CCD's request is denied, and we decline to award either party costs pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-341.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    \"On appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we view all facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment was entered.\"\n    <em>\n     City of Tempe v.
