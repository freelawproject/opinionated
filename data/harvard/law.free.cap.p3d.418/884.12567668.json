In making that discretionary determination, the court \"shall give special weight to the legal parents' opinion of what serves their child's best interests.\" \u00a7 25-409(E). We hold that when two legal parents disagree about whether visitation is in their child's best interests, both parents' opinions are entitled to special weight under \u00a7 25-409(E). We further hold that under those circumstances, neither parent is entitled to a presumption in his or her favor and the parents' conflicting opinions must give way to the court's finding on whether visitation is in the child's best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 We view the record in the light most favorable to supporting the family court's visitation order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739640\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/131/38/#p44\">\n    131 Ariz. 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739640\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/131/38/#p44\">\n    638 P.2d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 711 (1981). Lisa Friedman (\"Mother\") and David Roels, Jr. (\"Father\") married in 2001, had two children together (M., born in 2003, and R., born in 2005), informally separated in 2010, and divorced in 2011. Under the dissolution decree, Mother obtained sole custody of, and legal decision-making for, the children, but Father was entitled to supervised parenting time for two four-hour periods every week. The supervision requirement was partly based on Father's hospitalization for psychiatric issues and his abusive behavior toward the children, which included kicking M. at least once. After Mother and Father separated, the children began seeing various therapists for post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety-related issues. Father attended some of the children's therapy sessions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Before Mother and Father's divorce, Father's parents, David Roels, Sr. and Claudia Roels (\"Grandparents\"), were involved in the children's lives, attended their sports practices and other special events, and provided child care. After Mother and Father separated, however, Grandparents had almost no contact with the children for nearly four years, largely because Mother obstructed Grandparents' attempted interaction by, for example, withholding gifts and cards they sent the children, refusing to accept Grandparents' certified mail, and not responding to their emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 In April 2014, Grandparents sought to re-establish their relationship with the children by filing a petition for visitation pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 25-409(C). In December, the family court entered a temporary order allowing Grandparents to participate in Father's supervised visits for one hour per month. Pursuant to that order, Grandparents saw the children monthly for eight one-hour sessions between January and August 2015. Supervisory staff who documented those visits described Grandparents as being \"well received\" by the children and their interaction as warm and affectionate, and noted Grandparents' remarkable preparation for their visits. The children were more engaged in the visits when Grandparents were present, which also seemed to improve the children's interactions with Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The trial on Grandparents' visitation petition occurred over two days in August 2015. On the morning of the trial's first day, Mother and Father stipulated to a parenting plan (the \"Parenting Plan\") that gave each parent joint legal decision-making authority, with Mother having \"final legal decision making\" authority if they disagreed. When Mother and Father presented the Parenting Plan to the family court for approval, Father stated, without objection by Mother, that the Parenting Plan did not contain \"an agreement on ... whether or not his parents can be present at his parenting time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 At trial, Mother, Father, and Grandparents testified and presented testimony from other witnesses. Two therapists whom Mother called-Beth Winters and Karen Morse-testified that visitation with Grandparents exacerbated the children's PTSD and anxiety. Both therapists acknowledged, however, that their opinions were partly based on \"selected\" visitation reports Mother provided, and they had difficulty explaining why visitation would harm the children. Mother\n   also testified that she believed visitation would be harmful to her children's mental health and would compromise their relationship with Father. But Mother later conceded that the children struggled with anxiety before Grandparents' visitation began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Father and Grandparents presented testimony from staff who supervised Grandparents' visitation with the children. Those witnesses described the visits as positive and warm. Father testified about having been diagnosed with severe depression and explained his treatment for that condition. Father also expressed his belief that visitation would benefit the children and that \"it's important [for them] to have their own relationship\" with Grandparents. Grandparents testified about their efforts to resume their relationship with the children, characterized the court's preliminary visitation order as \"a miracle,\" and explained that their primary focus was \"just to keep spending time with the children\" because they \"love them very much.\" As for any impact visitation would have on the children's relationship with Father, Grandparents explained that they would be willing to \"work that out with him\" because \"his time with [the] children is most important.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The family court granted Grandparents' visitation petition. In its ruling, the court made extensive findings of fact, explained its reasoning in detail, and specified the nature and amount of Grandparents' visitation. After stating that it gave \"deference to Mother's position\" and \"accept[ed] and ... applie[d] the [rebuttable] presumption that Mother has and shall continue to make decisions that are in the children's best interests,\" the court found that \"it is in the children's best interests that grandparents have visitation with the children.\" The court also found that Mother was \"motivated by a desire to exclude the grandparents in part because of her relationship with them\" and that Mother's witnesses based their opinions on limited information and did not clearly explain how they arrived at certain conclusions. Finally, the court found that Grandparents had a warm, bonding relationship with the children and were motivated to seek visitation \"by a desire to influence the children in a positive way [and to] love, nurture and care for the children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 In a split decision, the court of appeals affirmed, reasoning that Father's opinion on visitation, not only Mother's, was entitled to \"special weight\" under\n   <em>\n    Troxel v.

Relevant here is \u00a7 25-409, which addresses, among other things, third-party visitation rights. That statute allows \"a person other than a legal parent\" to \"petition the superior court for visitation with a child,\" and generally authorizes the court to \"grant visitation rights during the child's minority on a finding that the visitation is in the child's best interests.\" \u00a7 25-409(C). As amended in 2013, the statute also provides that \"[i]n deciding whether to grant visitation to a third party, the court shall give special weight to the legal parents' opinion of what serves their child's best interests\" and prescribes a non-exhaustive list of \"relevant factors\" the court shall consider. \u00a7 25-409(E). For \u00a7 25-409 purposes, \" '[l]egal parent' means a biological or adoptive parent whose parental rights have not been terminated.\" \u00a7 25-401(4). Mother and Father both meet that definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Because \u00a7 25-409(C) is framed in permissive terms, it generally does not require the court to grant third-party visitation upon a finding that it would be in the child's best interests; subsection (C) merely vests the court with discretionary authority to do so. But that is not the case with certain grandparents. Subsection (F), which Mother does not address, provides that \"[i]f logistically possible and appropriate, the court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   order visitation by a grandparent or great-grandparent if the child is residing or spending time with the parent through whom the grandparent or great-grandparent claims a right of access to the child.\" \u00a7 25-409(F) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Although \u00a7 25-409 does not define \"special weight,\" the legislature's use of that phrase is significant because of identical wording in\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    530 U.S. at 69-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We therefore reject\n   <em>\n    Goodman\n   </em>\n   's broader interpretation of \"special weight\" and disavow that case insofar as it purports to subject a nonparent to a heightened burden of proof beyond that required under\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McGovern\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20 We have no reason to believe that the legislature intended \"special weight\" for \u00a7 25-409 purposes to be any different than in\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    McGovern\n   </em>\n   .

Nor do we read\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   as imposing a higher constitutional standard for\n   \"special weight\" than does \u00a7 25-409.

That provision does not contain any varying gradations of \"special weight,\" nor is it qualified by any requirement other than \"legal parent\" status. Furthermore, the legislature's use in \u00a7 25-409(E) of \"legal parents\" in the plural possessive form is significant because it contemplates scenarios in which two legal parents' visitation opinions are entitled to \"special weight.\" Notably, the legislature did not qualify that directive by adding, for example, \"to the extent the legal parents agree\" (or similar language).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 Attempting to follow \u00a7 25-409 and\n   <em>\n    McGovern\n   </em>\n   , the family court here gave \"deference to Mother's position\" and applied \"the presumption that Mother has and shall continue to make decisions that are in the children's best interests.\" (Because no court had found him to be \"an unfit parent,\" however, Father was also entitled to \"a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.\"\n   <em>\n    Troxel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    530 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413198\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/57/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)

In contrast, in this case both Father and Mother are legal parents, \u00a7 25-401(4), and therefore each of their opinions on visitation is entitled to \"special weight,\" \u00a7 25-409(E).

Given Mother and Father's conflicting visitation opinions, the family court, after considering \"all relevant factors,\" \u00a7 25-409(E), was statutorily permitted to grant visitation rights \"on a finding that the visitation is in the [children's] best interests.\" \u00a7 25-409(C).

App. Mar. 1, 2018), Mother contends that because she had \"final say\" on \"all [disputed] issues,\" her decision on third-party visitation governs absent proof \"that the child's best interests will be substantially harmed [without] judicial intervention.\" Mother further asserts that, as the parent with sole legal decision-making power \"in the event of an impasse,\" she had exclusive statutory authority to \"determine the child's upbringing, including the child's education, care, health care and religious training.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 25-410(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 26 We are not persuaded.\n   <em>\n    Nicaise\n   </em>\n   is inapposite as it did not address visitation issues. And the statutes relating to legal decision-making and parenting plans do not override \u00a7 25-409, which specifically addresses third-party rights and grandparent visitation. Furthermore, Mother's argument is based on the mistaken premise that a parenting plan that is silent on visitation matters nonetheless controls the outcome of a visitation dispute. But whether a parent's opinion is entitled to \"special weight\" under \u00a7 25-409 turns on whether he or she is a \"legal parent\" as defined in \u00a7 25-401(4), not whether that parent has legal decision-making authority under a parenting plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-409(E) ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 25-401(3) (defining \"[l]egal decision-making\"), -403.02 (addressing parenting plans).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 27 Other provisions of \u00a7 25-409 support this interpretation. For example, subsection (D) of that statute differentiates between a child's \"legal parents,\" \"[a] third party who possesses legal decision-making authority over the child or visitation rights,\" and \"[a] person or agency that ... claims legal decision-making authority or visitation rights concerning the child.\" \u00a7 25-409(D)(1), (2), (4). By making those distinctions and separately defining \"[l]egal decision-making\" and \"[l]egal parent,\" \u00a7 25-401(3), (4), the legislature indicated that a legal parent may not necessarily have legal decision-making authority and nonetheless required courts to \"give special weight to the legal parents' opinion of what serves their child's best interests,\" \u00a7 25-409(E). This plainly demonstrates that \"special weight\" for visitation purposes is independent from a grant of legal decision-making authority under a preexisting parenting plan.

When Mother and Father presented the Parenting Plan to the family court for approval, Father, without objection from Mother, stated that the parties had \"not made an agreement on ... whether or not his parents can be present at his parenting time.\" This brings the Parenting Plan, insofar as it relates to Grandparents' visitation rights, squarely within the bounds of \u00a7 25-403.02(D), which directs the court to determine \"any element to be included in a parenting plan\" about which \"the parents are unable to agree.\" Thus, because Mother and Father were unable to agree on Grandparents' visitation rights, the Parenting Plan does not control and the family court did not err by basing its determination on \u00a7 25-409.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 29 Mother next argues that the court of appeals erroneously concluded that Father is entitled to the same \"special weight\" under \u00a7 25-409(E) as Mother.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310480\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/463/\">\n    242 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   468 \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310480\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/242/463/\">\n    397 P.3d at 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mother further argues that the record does not support the court's finding that Grandparents \"had [a] significant relationship [that] was very positive with the children until the time of [Mother and Father's] separation.\" According to Mother, the record does not support the court's best-interests finding because there is \"significant evidence of harm to the children emotionally\" and \"no evidence that the children received anything but a fleeting benefit\" from visiting with Grandparents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 39 Mother's arguments seriously mischaracterize the record. The family court implicitly, but understandably, questioned Mother's evidence that visitation with Grandparents negatively impacted the children's mental wellbeing. One of the therapists Mother called acknowledged that her testimony was based on \"selected\" visitation reports that Mother provided and that she had never met Grandparents or evaluated the children's reaction to them. The other therapist could not clearly explain the basis for her conclusions and inexplicably said that she would oppose visitation even if the visitation reports were \"extremely positive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 40 The family court similarly had reason to question Mother's own testimony. Although Mother viewed Grandparents' visitation as harmful because M. \"stopped being able to go to school\" and R. \"started having panic attacks\" after visitation began, she later conceded that M. \"had a lot of difficulty attending school ... when the grandparents were not involved,\" and that R. had trouble with anxiety before visitation began. Mother's anti-visitation opinion was also contradicted by her acknowledging in closing argument that her opposition to visitation was based upon \"a false knowledge\" of Grandparents and that \"these are not the grandparents [to whom] you would deny visits.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 41 Viewed in the light most favorable to supporting the family court's ruling, the record\n   suggests that the children suffered little, if any, harm from visitation with Grandparents. Staff who supervised the visitation sessions described the children as \"enjoying themselves and engaged\" and observed \"a lot of laughing and joking around, kidding, [and] having fun\" during visits. Some evidence showed that the children were (at least initially) uncomfortable and anxious about visitation with Grandparents, but the record also reflects that the children ultimately deemed these fears unfounded. Most telling on this point is M.'s statement to R. after the first visit with Grandparents that he was \"[p]retty nervous about nothing.\" Equally notable is R.'s response: \"You would be fine if they came again. Are you with me? I like them coming.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 42 The record also contradicts Mother's suggestion that the children received only fleeting benefit from visitation with Grandparents. To the contrary, the record establishes that Grandparents fostered a loving, structured environment in which the children were better able to interact with Father-a relationship Mother concedes is important to the children's wellbeing. If anything, the evidence suggests that Grandparents facilitated the children's relationship with Father, which is undeniably more than a \"fleeting\" benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 43 Also meritless is Mother's assertion that the record does not support the family court's finding that the children have a significant and positive historical relationship with Grandparents. Indeed, despite the distance between Mother and Father's marital residence in Tucson and Grandparents' home in Avondale, Grandparents were present during or shortly after the children's births and attended the children's martial arts and ballet lessons, baseball games, birthdays, and other special occasions. Grandparents' visits were frequent enough that they shared a special saying with the children-\"go up and make a hook\"-describing the route Grandparents' vehicle took to enter the Tucson-area hotel where Grandparents stayed during their visits. The fact that both M. and R. recalled this saying during their visitation with Grandparents further buttresses the family court's finding that before Mother and Father's separation and divorce, the children had a significant, positive relationship with Grandparents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 44 In sum, far from being devoid of credible evidence to support the family court's best-interests finding as Mother asserts, the record plainly supports the court's finding that visitation is in the children's best interests. Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Grandparents visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 45 For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the family court's visitation order and vacate the court of appeals' opinion. In our discretion, we deny both sides' requests for an award of attorney fees under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-324.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Mother's characterization of Father as a \"noncustodial parent\" is obsolete; the legislature abolished the principle of \"child custody\" in 2012 and replaced it with \"parenting time\" and \"legal decision making.\" 2012 Ariz.
