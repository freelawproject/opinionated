Lunney appeal the superior court's judgment in favor of the State. We hold the attorney general's office's involvement in responding to the Lunneys' public records requests did not violate Arizona's Public Records Law because it did not unnecessarily delay the process of promptly providing the requested information. We also hold under Arizona's Public Records Law: (1) when responding to public records requests, state agencies are required to query and search their electronic databases and produce responsive public records; (2) a public employee's private cell phone records pertaining to the conduct of public business may become public records subject to disclosure if a public records requestor establishes the employee used the cell phone for a public purpose; (3) without justification for the delay, a 135-day response time to a request is not prompt; and (4) under these facts, the State's responses to the Lunneys' other requests were otherwise prompt and complete. Accordingly, we affirm in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Following the death of their son in December 2012, the Lunneys made numerous requests under Arizona's Public Records Law to the Arizona Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\") and the Arizona Department of Transportation (\"ADOT\"). Initially, the agencies sent the responses directly to the Lunneys. However, in July 2014, Assistant Attorney General Fred Zeder asked the agencies to forward all requests and responses to the attorney general's office. The attorney general's office would then forward the responses to the Lunneys in \"Supplemental Disclosures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 In 2015, the Lunneys filed a statutory special action under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 39-121 against the State, ADOT, DPS, and Zeder in his official capacity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleged the defendants violated Arizona's Public Records Law by failing to provide access to public records, and applied for an order to show cause why the Lunneys' requested relief should not be\n   granted. Zeder moved to dismiss the claim against him, which the court granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Following a four-day hearing and additional briefing, the court found the State did not violate Arizona's Public Records Law by routing requests through the attorney general's office, and the State was not required to consult multiple databases to obtain information and create responsive documents. The superior court also made findings on each request at issue. The Lunneys had specifically claimed they were entitled to the private cell phone records of the officers at the scene of the accident, so the court ordered the parties to meet and prepare a joint report for the court on the cell phone issue. Following additional briefing, the superior court entered a final judgment finding for the State on all issues. The Lunneys timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Lunneys raise four issues on appeal: (1) whether the agencies violated Arizona's Public Records Law by routing requests and responses through the attorney general's office instead of responding to the Lunneys directly; (2) when responding to requests, were the agencies required to query and search their electronic databases and produce records subject to disclosure from those databases; (3) does Arizona's Public Records Law require disclosure of police officers' private cell phone records, \"where the officers use their private cellular phones in the ordinary course of their employment on agency business;\" and (4) did the agencies violate Arizona's Public Records Law by failing to respond timely and completely to the Lunneys' requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Whether a document is a public record and whether a denial of access to public records was wrongful are issues of law we review\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffis v.

If the attorney general's office overstepped its authority with respect to an agency here, any objection is for the agency to raise, not the Lunneys.

Here, the Lunneys did not request information\n   <em>\n    about\n   </em>\n   information, they simply wanted the\n   names and related information about the officers on duty during a specified period. The State informed the Lunneys the information may be \"available within various databases maintained within separate departments of DPS.\" DPS's records manager Fuentes testified, \"if structured in a proper request for the same information, that is a public records' request, but as a request for that information relative to [officers],\" DPS could \"possibly\" go to various sources and find the information. The State is not required to create a single comprehensive document responding to the Lunneys' request. But to the extent the information requested is a public record, the State is required to \"query and search\" its electronic databases and produce any responsive documents that result from those searches. This is true even if the search would require the agency to search various databases. Therefore, we reverse the superior court's findings on this issue, and remand for the court to order the production of the information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

None of the requests specifically stated the Lunneys were seeking \"cell phone\" or \"personal\" records. Rather, the requests were for the \"phone records\" of two DPS officers. After the evidentiary hearing, the superior court found, \"[a]s written, the [requests] did not put DPS on notice that Lunney sought [personal cell phone] records.\" The superior court then ordered the parties to meet and prepare a Joint Report that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (1) delineate[s] specifically which records Plaintiffs seek from the cell phones at issue; (2) an explanation from the State Defendants as to whether the records sought exist; and (3) if the records no longer exist, include an explanation of what investigation was conducted to determine the status of the documents.

The State reported to the superior court the officers informed counsel that \"the cell phone records do not exist in the possession of either officer.\" The superior court then issued its final judgment, finding in favor of the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 26 The Lunneys argue records of officers' cell phone use while on duty fit within one of Arizona's three definitions of public records. Further, even if cell phone records do not meet the definition of public records, the Lunneys contend \"Arizonans have a right to access records that may not be required by law to be kept as public records, but which relate to the public's general welfare,\" and \"it hardly could be doubted that records pertaining to the use of a device so fundamental to police business as a cellular telephone by an officer on duty ... qualify as public records because they have a substantial nexus to the police agency's activities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bradford v.

Because the State did not provide a legally sufficient reason for the delay, we hold the State's response to this request was not prompt. We remand for the superior court to determine an appropriate sanction addressing the State's failure to timely respond to this request in accordance with A.R.S. \u00a7 39-121.02.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

DPS responded to the request on March 27, 2015, and the Lunneys received the response on April 1, 2015, as part of the State's 13th Supplemental Disclosure Statement. There is no record of a request dated December 16, 2014, and Fuentes testified the date of the request was March 13, 2015, and the two-week response time was \"reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 38 The superior court found the evidence did not support the Lunneys' claim they first made the request on December 16, 2014, and found DPS timely responded to this request. We affirm the superior court's finding the State's response to this request was prompt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Lunneys' Request for Information about Vehicle Collisions in Maricopa County.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 39 On December 25, 2014, the Lunneys submitted a request for Information about Vehicle Collisions in Maricopa County, and\n   the State responded to the request on April 16, 2015, as part of the State's 15th Supplemental Disclosure Statement. The State's response was over 2000 pages. The superior court found, \"Given the extent of the documentation that was responsive to this [request] ... the response was timely made.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 40 In their opening brief, the Lunneys do not challenge the superior court's finding. Rather, the Lunneys argue the superior court \"seemed not to take into account evidence that the response was non-responsive.\" However, below, the Lunneys stated the only issue with this request was the timeliness of the State's response. Issues not raised before the superior court are waived on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romero v. SW.

Therefore, we decline to address the Lunneys' argument that the State's response to this request was not responsive. Because the Lunneys do not challenge the superior court's finding regarding the promptness of the response, we do not address the issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Ritchie v.

The Lunneys' Request for Information about Employees on Leave.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 41 On November 6, 2014, the Lunneys requested information, including name, rank, badge numbers, and call signs, for all DPS employees on duty December 7 or 8, 2012, who took or were required to take leave or vacation between December 6, 2012, and January 31, 2013. On April 1, 2015, an attorney representing DPS and ADOT informed the Lunneys that responding to this request would take one employee, working full-time on this request alone, approximately six to eight weeks to respond. Due to the burdensome nature of the request, DPS did not respond to the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 42 The superior court found this request was \"unduly burdensome,\" that requiring DPS to respond would \"substantially impair its ability to respond to public records requests in other cases,\" and that DPS was not required to respond. The Lunneys argue the superior court failed to weigh the burden imposed on the agency against the public's interest in disclosure, and the superior court \"did not specify that the requested records would be difficult to identify.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cong.
