In ice hockey, the term \"check\" or \"checking\" refers to a defensive move whereby the defenseman moves his body into an opposing player in order to disrupt the opponent's possession of the puck. This lawsuit gives rise to a new meaning to the expression \"door check\" or \"door-check,\" an import presumably derived from hockey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In this appeal, we address the tort liability of a law enforcement officer, to an injured motorcyclist, when the officer purposely opens his patrol car door so that the door strikes and stops the speeding cyclist. Law enforcement refers to the officer's tactic as door-checking. The defendant officer and other officers pursued the motorcyclist because of his speeding. In resolving the appeal, we ask whether some facts support a ruling that the law enforcement officer seized the motorcyclist within the meaning of the United States Constitution's Fourth Amendment, and, if so, whether the officer warrants qualified immunity from civil liability. We also ask whether the officer and his employer gain immunity from state law claims under Washington's felony bar statute. The trial court granted the officer and his employer summary judgment. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The statement of facts arises from deposition testimony and from affidavits in support of and in opposition to summary judgment motions filed by defendants State of Washington and Washington State Patrol Trooper Bart Olson. Because the trial court granted the motions and dismissed plaintiff and motorcyclist Thomas Sluman's claims, we view the facts in a light favorable to Sluman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 On the sunny morning of Wednesday, July 21, 2010, Thomas Sluman, a Port Angeles denizen, rode his motorcycle eastbound on Interstate 90 in lower Kittitas County ten miles west of Ellensburg. On that same\n   morning, Washington State Patrol Trooper John Montemayor piloted the aircraft \"Smokey 6\" and patrolled traffic from the craft. An aerial patrol officer employs a series of white stains, known as aerial traffic surveillance marks, painted on the road at half-mile intervals to measure the speed of vehicles. The officer gauges the speed of a vehicle with a stopwatch as the vehicle travels between marks. Trooper Montemayor, by using the surveillance marks, measured Sluman as traveling between seventy-six and eighty-nine miles per hour on the seventy miles per hour interstate. Montemayor radioed Trooper David Hinchliff, who patrolled on the ground, to stop and cite Sluman. Trooper Hinchliff's patrol car parked facing northbound on Thorp Highway near Interstate 90 exit 101, the location of Thorp Fruit and Antique Mall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Thomas Sluman left Interstate 90 at exit 101. Sluman stopped at the stop sign at the end of the off-ramp, activated his motorcycle's right turn signal, and turned right onto South Thorp Highway. According to Trooper David Hinchliff, Sluman did not turn his head to the left to see Trooper David Hinchliff's patrol car before Sluman turned right. According to Sluman, he looked to the left and saw the patrol car, but the car faced the opposite direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 South Thorp Highway mainly travels east and west, but south of Interstate 90. Trooper Hinchliff performed a U-turn on Thorp Highway, activated his overhead lights, and radioed dispatch to notify it that he would pursue Sluman. After radioing dispatch, Hinchliff activated his siren and chased Sluman on South Thorp Highway. Sluman never saw Hinchliff reverse directions in order to pursue him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Trooper David Hinchliff soon lost sight of Thomas Sluman because the two-lane South Thorp Highway frequently curves. From Interstate 90 exit 101, the highway runs five miles before it again crosses the interstate at exit 106, the western exit for Ellensburg. Trooper John Montemayor eyed Sluman from the air while maintaining contact with Hinchliff. From his vantage point, Trooper Montemayor estimated Sluman reached a speed over one hundred and twenty miles per hour. Sluman disputes this speed approximation because South Thorp Highway lacks aerial traffic surveillance marks, but Sluman does not testify as to his speed. While riding on Thorp Highway, Sluman obeyed all traffic laws except the speed limit. Sluman never looked behind him to see Trooper Hinchliff in pursuit. Hinchliff concluded that he did not need to pursue Sluman at a high rate of speed, since the air patrolman followed Sluman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Washington State Trooper Bart Olson also patrolled, in a Dodge Charger, along Interstate 90 near exit 101 on the morning of July 21, 2010. Trooper Olson had just completed a traffic stop, when he overheard Trooper David Hinchliff notify dispatch about Hinchliff's pursuit of Thomas Sluman. Olson unilaterally joined the pursuit by traveling eastbound on Interstate 90, not on South Thorp Highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 A Washington State Patrol regulation prohibits a trooper from unilaterally joining a suspect's pursuit. Troopers may join a pursuit only when requested by the first officer in pursuit or when directed by a supervising officer. The State Patrol adopted this regulation because pursuits pose as one of the riskiest actions that a law enforcement officer undertakes. Trooper Bart Olson denies that he pursued Thomas Sluman since Olson did not chase Sluman on South Thorp Highway. Nevertheless, State Patrol rules consider an officer as pursuing the suspect, even if the trooper does not chase the suspect from behind, if the trooper acts to intercept or stop the pursued driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 In his haste, Trooper Bart Olson passed another patrol officer, Trooper Paul Blume, on Interstate 90. Blume drove a sports utility vehicle (SUV). Trooper Olson then received instruction to end his pursuit since Trooper John Montemayor followed Thomas Sluman from the air. Olson ignored the instruction and proceeded to Interstate 90 exit 106 where Olson anticipated he could intercept Sluman on South Thorp Highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 After Olson exited Interstate 90, he turned right on South Thorp Highway and journeyed in the opposite direction of Sluman and Trooper David Hinchliff. Olson then saw\n   Sluman's motorcycle rounding a corner in the oncoming lane. According to Olson, \"nobody was in the area.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 535. Trooper Olson drove his patrol car across the centerline of the road, quickly braked, and parked his car, while straddling the center line, on a bridge across the Yakima River, with the car's emergency lights activated. Trooper Olson explained his intent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   And, anyway, the motorcyclist was coming at me. And I could see the speed of the motorcycle, which was at a high rate, rapidly slowing. ... I'm going to place this person in custody or worst [sic]-you know, I'm going to place him in custody, do a felony-style stop, or they're going to be going slow enough that if it comes down to it I'm going to basically horse collar this person off the motorcycle and end this pursuit, so that they don't end up with serious injuries, kill themselves, kill an innocent party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   CP at 532. After Trooper Olson parked, Trooper Paul Blume pulled behind Trooper Olson's patrol car and blocked more of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Washington State Patrol does not authorize a state trooper to tackle, horse collar, or otherwise physically remove a driver from a motorcycle. State Patrol personnel deem such a maneuver to be unwise and unsafe. State Patrol regulations do not permit a trooper to drive patrol cars into the lane of oncoming traffic or to park in the middle of the road. Under a State Patrol regulation, a roadblock occurs when officers position one or more vehicles or other obstructions across a roadway in order to prevent the escape of a fleeing vehicle. The regulation requires any roadblock to afford an \"escape route\" for the suspect. CP at 246, 662. State Patrol rules allow a roadblock only with supervisory approval and only when law enforcement seeks to apprehend the suspect for homicide, assault with intent to kill, rape, robbery in the first degree, or prison escape. Trooper Olson lacked supervisory approval for blocking the road and law enforcement did not pursue Thomas Sluman for any of the requisite crimes. Olson insists that he allowed space for Sluman to steer around his patrol car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 According to Thomas Sluman, he traveled sixty miles an hour as he rounded a curve on South Thorp Highway into the straightaway across the Yakima River Bridge. Sluman applied his brakes because he saw lights and vehicles on the bridge. He did not know that one or more of the cars were police cars. He intended to stop near the cars. After he rounded the curve, he did not accelerate. Suddenly a sports utility vehicle entered his lane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 As Trooper Bart Olson remained parked in the middle of South Thorp Highway, he observed Thomas Sluman's motorcycle rapidly slow. Sluman probably then traveled between thirty-one and thirty-seven miles per hour. As Sluman slowed, he steered his motorcycle to the right and away from the highway's centerline in order to pass Trooper Olson's vehicle. According to Trooper Paul Blume, Sluman appeared to be stopping his motorcycle. As Sluman attempted to pass, Olson opened his patrol car door into the oncoming lane where Sluman traveled. The parties refer to Olson's maneuver as \"door-checking.\" In his investigation report, Olson did not volunteer that he purposely opened the door to cause the door to strike Sluman. Trooper Olson's open door struck Sluman's motorcycle and propelled Sluman over the Yakima River Bridge to the ground thirty feet below and into a campground. A video captured Sluman crossing the Yakima River Bridge, Olson opening his patrol car door, and Sluman driving by the side of the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 During a deposition, Thomas Sluman testified that he only remembered encountering a sports utility vehicle. According to Sluman, the SUV drove toward him in his lane and struck him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 Washington State Patrol regulations consider intentional intervention to be the act of ramming or hitting another vehicle with a patrol car in order to damage or force another vehicle off the road. During discovery in this suit, State Patrol personnel confirmed that a trooper driving his car into the oncoming lane of traffic on a two-lane road with a suspect approaching constitutes the use of intentional intervention. The State Patrol equates intentional intervention with lethal\n   force. Intentional intervention should only be used as a last resort to apprehend a suspect. Intentional intervention should also be used only when the officer knows or has reasonable grounds to believe the suspect committed or is attempting to commit a crime that poses a threat of death or serious bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 A State Patrol regulation declares that intentional intervention \"shall not be used to apprehend a traffic offender, misdemeanant, or fleeing felon whose only felony is attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle.\" CP at 662. The regulation further reads that an officer \"attempting intentional intervention with a vehicle shall be held to the same standards as are applied to any other use of lethal force.\" CP at 662.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 18 When Thomas Sluman hit the ground, he lost consciousness. After Sluman regained cognizance, but before receiving treatment for his injuries, Trooper Bart Olson asked Sluman why he fled from the police. Sluman answered that he had outstanding arrest warrants. An audio recording captured Sluman's response. Sluman admits he uttered the response, but he denies his statement to be correct. According to Sluman, he had outstanding warrants but he did not flee the police pursuit particularly since he knew not of the pursuit. When responding to Bart Olson's question, Sluman lay on the ground in severe pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 19 As a result of the collision with the patrol car door and descent into the campground, Thomas Sluman sustained fractures of the tibia and fibula of his right leg, pubic bone, tailbone, and left elbow. The tibia and fibula breaks required multiple surgeries to implant and replace hardware and to graft skin and muscle. Sluman spent one year in a wheelchair while recovering. He suffered permanent physical impairments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20 Thomas Sluman later entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea to charges of attempting to elude a police vehicle. According to Sluman, he entered the plea because he wanted to end the prosecution because he still recovered from injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21 Thomas Sluman filed suit against Washington State Patrol Trooper Bart Olson and the State of Washington. Sluman asserted a federal cause of action for a civil rights violation and state law causes of action for false arrest, false imprisonment, negligence, gross negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent training and supervision. He asserted the latter claim only against the State. Sluman alleged that Trooper Olson at all times relevant to the suit acted within the scope of his employment with the State of Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22 In response to the civil rights cause of action, the State of Washington pled the defense of Eleventh Amendment immunity and Olson pled the defense of qualified immunity. Both the State and Olson raised the felony bar statute in defense of Thomas Sluman's state law claims. The State agreed in its answer that Trooper Bart Olson acted within the scope of his employment at all times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 23 The State of Washington and Bart Olson moved for summary judgment. In response, Thomas Sluman agreed to dismissal of claims for false arrest and false imprisonment. The trial court granted summary judgment and dismissed all remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Civil Rights Cause of Action\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24 Thomas Sluman asserts a civil rights claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the State of Washington and Trooper Bart Olson, and the trial court dismissed the claim against each defendant. Sluman only appeals the dismissal of the claim against Olson. Therefore, we do not address the merits of a civil rights claim against the State. The appeal of this dismissal centers on whether Trooper Olson seized Sluman and imposed excessive force within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and whether Olson qualifies for qualified immunity under the federal civil rights statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 25\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , an often employed, but rarely quoted, statute reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Section 1983 is not itself a source of substantive rights.\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

County of Inyo\n   </em>\n   informs our decision. William Brower died after the stolen car he drove at high speeds in an effort to elude pursuing police crashed into a police roadblock. The United States Supreme Court held that law enforcement seized Brower, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, by placement of the roadblock. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' holding, the high Court explained that Brower's opportunities to stop the vehicle prior to impact did not preclude violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Court explicated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [A] roadblock is not just a significant show of authority to induce a voluntary stop, but is designed to produce a stop by physical impact if voluntary compliance does not occur. It may well be that respondents here [law enforcement officers] preferred, and indeed earnestly hoped, that Brower would stop on his own, without striking the barrier, but we do not think it practicable to conduct such an inquiry into subjective intent. Nor do we think it possible, in determining whether there has been a seizure in a case such as this, to distinguish between a roadblock that is designed to give the oncoming driver the option of a voluntary stop (e.g., one at the end of a\n   long straightaway), and a roadblock that is designed precisely to produce a collision (e.g., one located just around a bend). In determining whether the means that terminates the freedom of movement is the very means that the government intended we cannot draw too fine a line, or we will be driven to saying that one is not seized who has been stopped by the accidental discharge of a gun with which he was meant only to be bludgeoned, or by a bullet in the heart that was meant only for the leg. We think it enough for a seizure that a person be stopped by the very instrumentality set in motion or put in place in order to achieve that result. It was enough here, therefore, that, according to the allegations of the complaint, Brower was meant to be stopped by the physical obstacle of the roadblock-and that he was so stopped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Brower v.

But he presents no argument or case law to the contrary. Looking at the facts in the light most favorable to Thomas Sluman and accepting his version of the facts, we conclude Trooper Olson orchestrated a roadblock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 32 Trooper Bart Olson's own deposition testimony suggests he implemented a roadblock. Olson explained his intent for driving across the centerline of the road and parking in the middle of the bridge as placing Sluman in custody by stopping him or horse collaring him. Trooper Olson stationed his patrol car to achieve the result of stopping Sluman's travel. Olson's supervisor testified that Trooper Olson created a roadblock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 33 Trooper Bart Olson highlights that a semi-tractor trailer could have squeezed on either side of his patrol car parked on the Yakima River Bridge. But this emphasis ignores important facts, including his own testimony that he opened his car door at the last moment in order to impede Thomas Sluman's progress. He intended a roadblock and effectuated this intent. Any opportunity by Sluman to steer clear of the door does not preclude application of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 34 We also do not consider the question of whether Trooper Bart Olson erected a roadblock as controlling. A Fourth Amendment seizure does not require use of a roadblock.

A passenger rode in Rickard's automobile. When the officer asked Rickard to exit the vehicle, he sped away. A chase ensued that took Rickard and the pursuing officers to an interstate. The vehicles swerved through traffic at speeds over one hundred miles per hour. During the chase, Rickard and officers passed more than two dozen vehicles. Eventually Rickard exited the interstate and executed a quick turn that caused contact with a police cruiser. As a result of the contact, Rickard's car spun into a parking lot and collided with Officer Plumhoff's\n   vehicle. Two officers exited their vehicles to approach Rickard's car and pound on the passenger's window. At this point, Rickard's car struck another police vehicle, causing his car to temporarily intertwine with the bumper of the police car. Officer Plumhoff exited his patrol car and fired three shots into the car, but an undeterred Rickard unstuck and reversed his car. Rickard maneuvered onto the street, while forcing an officer to step to the side in order to avoid being hit by Rickard's vehicle. As Rickard fled down the street, two other officers fired twelve shots. Rickard lost control of his car, which crashed into a building. A combination of bullets and the impact with the structure killed Rickard and his passenger. The high Court held that the Fourth Amendment allowed deadly force in this instance because of the high speed, the passing of many vehicles by Rickard, Rickard forcing other motorists off the road, the collision with a patrol car, the acceleration and escape after the interlocking of Rickard's car with the patrol car, and Rickard's continued flight after the first shots. Thomas Sluman's suit possesses none of these critical circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 50 In\n   <em>\n    Brosseau v.

Thereafter a neighbor of Kenneth Haugen's mother notified police that Haugen and another man fought on the mother's yard. Officer Rochelle Brosseau responded to the call. When Officer Brosseau arrived, Haugen escaped. Brosseau called for assistance and officers arrived at the scene and spread through the neighborhood to locate a hiding Haugen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 51 Officer Rochelle Brosseau eventually found Kenneth Haugen, who ran from her toward his mother's home's driveway, jumped into the driver's seat of a Jeep, and closed and locked the door. Brosseau ran to the Jeep, pointed her weapon at Haugen inside the vehicle, and ordered Haugen to exit the Jeep. Brosseau repeated the command while hitting the window several times with her handgun. The window shattered. Brosseau unsuccessfully attempted to grab the Jeep's keys from Haugen, and she struck Haugen in the head with the barrel and butt of her gun. A persistent Haugen started the Jeep. Officer Brosseau fired a shot through the rear driver's side window, which shot struck Haugen's back. An undeterred Haugen left the driveway, swerved across the neighbor's lawn, and drove down the street. A half block later, Haugen noticed his gunshot wound and stopped the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 52\n   <em>\n    Brosseau\n   </em>\n   's facts differ from the facts of this appeal. Kenneth Haugen posed an immediate threat to law enforcement officers. He fought with another man, which evidenced his violent nature before officers even arrived at the scene. The violence and escape occurred in a neighborhood with other officers in the streets of the neighborhood looking for Haugen after Brosseau already located him. People occupied two cars on both sides of the Jeep when Haugen maneuvered the car out of the driveway. Haugen persisted in escaping after multiple commands to exit the car, after being hit in the head with a gun, and after being shot in the back. These actions led the United States Supreme Court to find Haugen a threat thereby making Brosseau's actions reasonable. The Court explained that Haugen proved he would take extreme measures to avoid capture and he posed a major threat to, among others, the officers at the end of the street. Thomas Sluman's appeal bears none of these critical facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 53 Trooper Bart Olson also mentions\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

The speeding motorist also initiated a chase on a two-lane highway. But, unlike in Thomas Sluman's case, the motorist exited the road and entered a parking lot of a shopping center because of a crowded roadway. Police vehicles nearly trapped the motorist's car inside the lot. In order to evade the trap, the motorist executed a sharp turn, collided with an officer's police car, exited the parking lot, and again sped away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 54 The facts viewed in the light most favorable to Thomas Sluman distinguish this appeal from\n   <em>\n    Brosseau, Scott, Mullenix,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rickard.\n   </em>\n   Thomas Sluman drove on a two-lane highway, not in a residential neighborhood. An unpopulated South Thorp Highway\n   lacked turns into business parking lots. Sluman did not endanger the public by driving erratically through a parking lot. Officers formed the intent to stop Sluman after witnessing him speeding on the highway. Sluman bore no arms, did not appear armed, and communicated no threats to police officers or anyone else. Sluman did not weave through traffic and did not aggressively pass cars in an attempt to elude the police. Sluman also did not act as a threat by hitting police cars in an attempt to escape. Sluman only struck Trooper Olson's car when Olson door-checked Sluman and sent him careening over the edge of the bridge to the ground below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 55 Thomas Sluman obeyed all traffic laws except the speed limit. The one hundred miles per hour speed reached in\n   <em>\n    Plumhoff\n   </em>\n   was not disputed. Sluman disputes Bart Olson's claim that Sluman exceeded one hundred miles per hour, and Sluman provides a sound reason to discount the plane operator's estimate of the speed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 56 In his argument, Trooper Bart Olson erroneously claims that Thomas Sluman does not dispute Olson's version of the facts. Bart Olson also repeatedly pictures the facts in a light favorable to him, while ignoring his own testimony and the testimony of other Washington State Patrol troopers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 57 Trooper Olson repetitively writes of the safety of pedestrians and other motorists imperiled by Thomas Sluman's flight on a motorcycle. Nevertheless, facts support the conclusion that Sluman endangered no pedestrians or other motorists as he drove on South Thorp Highway. Olson asserts that he acted, as part of a team, to protect citizens at a well-traveled intersection from a motorcyclist traveling at speeds over 120 miles per hour. Olson did not act as a team. Instead, the undisputed facts show he performed as a rogue officer who violated numerous Washington State Patrol regulations. Olson forwards no evidence of the number of travelers, if any, near the point of impact on South Thorp Highway. Sluman traveled between 30 and 40 m.p.h. when Trooper Bart Olson door-checked him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 58 Trooper Bart Olson writes that South Thorp Highway runs through a high density residential farm area. We doubt that any farm area, regardless of the presence of some residences, to be of high density. Regardless, no facts show the area to be high density. The video filed as evidence contradicts this assertion. A photograph cited for this proposition shows police cars parked on a bridge, not a high-density farm area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 59 Bart Olson contends that Thomas Sluman's speed on South Thorp Highway endangered others. Nevertheless, in his deposition, Trooper Olson testified that \"nobody was in the area.\" CP at 535. The State also mentions the presence of innocent parties at the nearby campground. No evidence shows any persons then present in the campground to be endangered. No decision has held that the theoretical possibility that people may be in the area qualifies as the type of immediate threat that justifies the use of lethal force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 60 Based on the United States Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

After the officer spoke, Leija sped toward a Texas interstate highway as other officers joined the pursuit. Twice during the chase, Leija called police dispatch and claimed to hold a gun while threatening to shoot police officers if they did not abandon their pursuit. The dispatcher relayed Leija's threats, together with the report that Leija might be intoxicated, to all concerned officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 76 While the chase of Israel Leija continued, other officers laid spike strips at three locations, the first of which was located beneath an overpass. Trooper Chadrin Mullenix was one of the responding officers. He journeyed to the overpass initially intending to help lay the spike strip, but upon arrival at the overpass, he switched to a different tactic: shooting at Leija's car in order to disable it. Trooper Mullenix radioed the idea to another officer who agreed with the plan so Mullenix asked the dispatcher to inform his supervisor in order to gain his approval. Before receiving a response, Mullenix stood on top of the overpass and twenty feet above the interstate with his rifle aimed below. Mullenix knew that another officer manned the spike strip on the roadway beneath the overpass. Three minutes after taking his sniper's position, Trooper Mullenix spotted Leija's vehicle approaching the overpass and fired six shots, one or more which killed Leija.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 77 The United States Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Mullenix v.

During that chase, Rickard passed more than two dozen other vehicles, several of which were forced to alter course. Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk. When Rickard's car eventually collided with a police car and came temporarily to a standstill that did not end the chase. Less than three seconds later, Rickard resumed maneuvering his car.

Olson knew that an aircraft followed Sluman and could continue to follow Sluman. Olson, as he testified in his deposition, knew no one else was in the area where he parked his patrol car and Thomas Sluman rode his motorcycle. Therefore, Olson knew that Sluman did not endanger the public or officers. Olson had no knowledge that Sluman knew he was being pursued. Olson knew that Sluman had made no threats to law enforcement officers. Olson had no knowledge of Sluman being armed.

To shorten a lengthy decision, we outline all decisions in Appendix B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 85 Trooper Bart Olson phrases the issue in Thomas Sluman's appeal as: assuming all facts in the light most favorable to Sluman, was the law clearly established in July 2010 that the Fourth Amendment prohibited a law enforcement officer, making a split-second decision concerning the safety of pedestrians and other motorists imperiled by a suspect fleeing on a motorcycle, from opening the door of his patrol car into the motorcycle's path, even when the suspect had done no more than elude police? In so framing the issue, Trooper Olson assumes facts in the\n   light most favorable to him, not Thomas Sluman. Thomas Sluman did not endanger pedestrians or other motorists when Sluman drove on South Thorp Highway. Some facts show that Sluman did not elude law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 86 Trooper Bart Olson also frames the issue as: does the law afford Olson qualified immunity when he performed a traffic stop to prevent Sluman from entering a high traffic density highway interchange when Sluman sped over one hundred twenty miles per hour to elude law enforcement? Again, Olson views the facts in a glow beneficial to him. No facts support a finding that Sluman entered a high traffic density interchange. Olson averred that no one else was present. Inferences from facts suggest Sluman did not travel even over one hundred miles per hour. Again, some facts question whether Sluman sought to elude police. Assuming Sluman knew of the pursuit, his only felony was eluding an officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 87 Trooper Bart Olson also emphasizes that he made a split-second judgment when parking his car on the Yakima River Bridge and when opening his car door. We recognize that the United States Supreme Court wishes police officers leniency when rendering split second decisions. Nevertheless, the Court has never held that all quick decisions carry qualified immunity. We also question whether Bart Olson engaged in a split-second decision. Inference from other facts suggest that, from the time of his notice that Trooper David Hinchliff pursued Thomas Sluman, Olson intended to take extraordinary steps to end the travel of Sluman. Olson reflected before parking his car in the middle of the road in an attempt to horse collar Sluman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 88 Trooper Bart Olson presents no testimony relating his knowledge of the law of search and seizure. Olson presents no testimony that he relied on any particular court decisions or deemed himself compliant with constitutional principles when door-checking Thomas Sluman. Under the facts as presented by Thomas Sluman, Trooper Bart Olson's conduct breached clearly established constitutional rights. Federal case law interpreting similar claims would have placed a reasonable officer on notice that using unauthorized deadly force against a fleeing suspect that is only wanted for traffic violations breaches the Fourth Amendment. The only risk posed in this case was the risk of an accident which Trooper Olson, not Thomas Sluman, turned into a reality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 89 Washington State Trooper Bart Olson emphasizes recent United States Supreme Court decisions that reverse lower court decisions denying a law enforcement officer qualified immunity.\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

Nevertheless, the decisions do not bestow absolute immunity on the officers. In short, Thomas Sluman presents many cases that establish that Trooper Bart Olson violated his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights. Bart Olson forwards no decision that helps him under these circumstances. All of Olson's promoted decisions involve the speeding person to have endangered the lives of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Felony Bar Statute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 91 We now begin our review of Thomas Sluman's state law claims. Since Sluman seeks to reverse dismissal of state law claims asserted against both Trooper Bart Olson and the State of Washington and since the two defendants' interests coincide, we hereafter refer to both defendants in the aggregate as the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 92 Thomas Sluman pled state causes of action of false arrest, false imprisonment, negligence, gross negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent training and supervision. Sluman agreed to dismissal of false arrest and false imprisonment. The trial court dismissed on summary judgment the remaining claims over the objection of Sluman. We will later briefly analyze each of these remaining claims but must first address a defense common to all state law claims, the felony bar rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 93 In his brief, Thomas Sluman argued against application of the public duty doctrine. The State does not contend, in its brief, that the public duty doctrine bars Sluman's state law causes of action. Therefore, we proceed on the assumption the State has abandoned any defense, for purposes of a summary judgment motion, based on the doctrine. The State may still assert the doctrine before the trial court since Sluman has not asked for the dismissal of the defense as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 94 On appeal, the State asks us to affirm summary judgment dismissal of all state claims based on Washington's felony bar statute. RCW 4.24.420 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   It is a complete defense to any action for damages for personal injury or wrongful death that the person injured or killed was engaged in the commission of a felony at the time of the occurrence causing the injury or death and the\n   <em>\n    felony was a proximate cause of the injury\n   </em>\n   or death. However, nothing in this section shall affect a right of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 95 Thomas Sluman resists application of the felony bar statute on two grounds. First, he did not commit a felony. Second, any crime he committed was not a proximate cause of his injuries. We could base our reversal of the application of the statute as a matter of law in favor of the State solely on proximate cause, but because the question of Sluman's purported commission of a felony may arise again on remand, we also address this second ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <em>\n    Issue 4: Whether collateral estoppel bars Thomas Sluman from denying he committed felony eluding a police officer?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    Answer 4: No.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b6 96 RCW 46.61.024 declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   (1) Any driver of a motor vehicle who willfully fails or refuses to immediately bring his or her vehicle to a stop and who drives his or her vehicle in a reckless manner while attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle, after being given a visual or audible signal to bring the vehicle to a stop, shall be guilty of a\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   class C felony. The signal given by the police officer may be by hand, voice, emergency light, or siren. The officer giving such a signal shall be in uniform and the vehicle shall be equipped with lights and sirens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The State relies on RCW 46.61.024 when asserting that Thomas Sluman committed a felony. In turn, the State contends that collateral estoppel bars Thomas Sluman from\n   denying application of the felony bar statute because Sluman pled guilty to felony eluding.

First, Sluman did not utter his comment to Trooper Bart Olson under oath. All cases applying the rule entail earlier deposition testimony or statements under oath, not statements outside the context of litigation. When rendering his concession, Thomas Sluman underwent excruciating pain from disabling injuries, including numerous broken bones. Sluman had just regained consciousness and the inferences suggest Olson confronted Sluman immediately after the latter regained cognizance. No decision addresses statements uttered, while under debilitating pain, because deponents generally avoid questioning immediately after regaining consciousness from having been door-checked and after having broken bones without any treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 106 My dissenting brother emphasizes\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

They present no case law that states a witness may not contradict himself for purposes of a summary judgment motion, when the claimant did not render the earlier statement under oath or when the claimant uttered the earlier statement under extreme circumstances faced by Thomas Sluman. Even in trial, a witness may present contradictory testimony and the jury may believe that testimony favorable to him or her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6 112 The dissent may believe that, if a hearsay exception allows a contemporary statement to be admitted, that the testimony controls the outcome of the case.

Neither recognizes that the crime requires the further element of driving in a manner indicating a wanton and willful disregard for the lives or property of others. The record lacks facts of such wanton and willful disregard for the lives of others.

Finally, the State conceded in its answer that Trooper Bart Olson acted within the scope of his employment when pursuing\n   and door-checking Sluman.

Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098743\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/1323/\">\n    343 F.3d 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2003), a Georgia County's Sheriff's Department received a report that a red pickup truck with a silver tool box in its bed had been stolen from a service station along Interstate 85 south of Atlanta. The report included the information that the suspect, a white male wearing a white t-shirt, was heading north on Interstate 85. In response to the report, Deputy Fred Lawrence Cox and Deputy Jeff Looney headed to the northbound lanes of Interstate 85 in separate vehicles. Deputy Looney pulled onto the grass median to observe passing traffic. Deputy Cox continued farther north and stopped at the site of a recent accident. Deputy Looney soon spotted a truck traveling northward that matched the description of the stolen vehicle but, contrary to the report, it towed a trailer loaded with two personal watercraft. Looney reported his sighting on his radio and began to follow the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \u00b6 126 After hearing Looney's report, Deputy Lawrence Cox radioed Deputy Jeff Looney to inform him of an accident north of Looney's position and that he should not attempt to stop the vehicle until it had passed the accident. As the red pickup and Deputy Looney passed him, Deputy Cox joined the pursuit. While tracking the truck, the deputies made efforts to determine whether the vehicle was indeed the stolen truck. To this end, Deputy Cox passed the truck, which proceeded at or near the speed limit of seventy miles per hour. He observed two men in the cab. The man in the passenger's seat, Jerry Vaughan, matched the description of the suspect. Cox relayed his suspicion to Looney, and the two deputies performed a \"rolling roadblock\" to stop the vehicle. The rolling roadblock entails officers blocking a suspect vehicle with their police cruisers and reducing their speed, in the hope that the suspect car will slow as well. Deputy Looney positioned his cruiser directly behind the pickup. The officers thereby signaled their desire to stop the pickup. As soon as he had positioned his vehicle in front of the truck, Cox applied his brakes. According to Vaughan and the pickup's driver, Freddy Rayson, the impact was both accidental and insufficient to cause Cox to lose control of his patrol car. After the collision, Rayson accelerated while staying in the same lane of traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \u00b6 127 Deputy Lawrence Cox decided to reposition his vehicle behind the truck. He unholstered his sidearm and rolled down the passenger side window. Cox then shifted his cruiser one lane to the left and slowed to allow the truck to pass him. As soon as his cruiser was even with the pickup, Deputy Cox turned on his rooftop lights. Rayson\n   responded by accelerating to eighty to eighty-five miles per hour in a seventy-mile-per-hour zone. Cox fired three rounds into the truck without warning. Deputy Cox sought to disable either the truck or Rayson so that he could force the truck off the road. Nevertheless, his volley disabled neither the truck nor Rayson. The third bullet instead punctured Vaughan's spine, instantly paralyzing him below the chest. Rayson's only reaction to the shooting was to drive faster and more recklessly. Rayson began a desperate break for freedom that involved weaving in and out of lanes, driving at high speeds through exit ramps, and dragging at least one of the watercraft, which had fallen off the trailer, along the ground. As the chase continued into more heavily congested sections of the highway, Cox fired his weapon again and repositioned his cruiser in front of the truck. The truck struck Cox's cruiser, causing the cruiser to spin out of control and ram into a steel guard rail. Cox was injured and his cruiser was badly damaged, but the truck continued while dragging the trailer and watercraft behind. Finally, when Rayson tried to force the truck between two vehicles, he lost control of the pickup, the trailer jack-knifed, and the truck hit the cement median. Both Vaughan and Rayson were taken to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b6 128 Jeffrey Vaughan sued Lawrence Cox. The trial court granted Deputy Cox summary judgment on the basis that, since Cox aimed his shots at the driver, he did not seize Vaughan. The trial court also concluded that Cox was entitled to qualified immunity. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. Since Cox sought to stop Rayson and Vaughan, the deputy seized both when firing his weapon. The appellate court also held that a reasonable jury, based on Vaughan's version of the facts, could conclude that Deputy Cox exerted unreasonable force. Neither Vaughan nor his driver had threatened the lives of others or committed a violent felony before the shots. Evidence showed that Rayson's truck was easily identifiable and could have been tracked, and that the officers could have sought assistance from other jurisdictions to follow the suspects. Also, a jury could have reasonably concluded that Cox had the feasibility to warn Vaughan and Rayson of the potential use of deadly force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b6 129 In\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5714996\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/502/#p503\">\n    649 F.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2011), shortly after midnight in rural Kentucky, a police officer clocked Thomas Germany riding his motorcycle at seventy miles per hour in a fifty-five mile per hour zone. That officer attempted to pull over Germany for speeding, but Germany refused to stop. Deputy Danny Davis heard about the pursuit over the radio. As Germany approached Davis' location, Davis blocked the road with his cruiser. Germany maneuvered around him, and Davis gave chase. The pursuit lasted five minutes and transpired on empty stretches of highway. Germany never went above sixty miles per hour during the chase. He ran one red light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b6 130 Thomas Germany eventually turned off the rural road and journeyed across a muddy field. Officer Danny Davis followed in his cruiser. According to a reconstruction expert, who analyzed the location of paint transfers between the two vehicles, Davis then intentionally rammed Germany's motorcycle. The ramming threw Germany from the motorcycle and dragged him underneath the cruiser, crushing him to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   \u00b6 131 The Sixth Circuit, in\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , focused on whether Officer Danny Davis should receive qualified immunity. The court noted, however, that settled law for a generation held that, under the Fourth Amendment, when a suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force. The court added that ramming a motorcycle with a police cruiser involves the application of deadly force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   APPENDIX B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   \u00b6 132 In\n   <em>\n    Hawkins v.

County of Inyo\n   </em>\n   , decided in 1989, held that a roadblock breached the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   \u00b6 133 While conversing with a senior ranking police sergeant in the Farmington High School parking lot, Walters' dispatcher notified him that the Highway Patrol was in pursuit of a motorcycle and that the Highway Patrol requested assistance. Without receiving any information as to the description of either the motorcycle or its operator, Walters left the high school parking lot and drove to the area of the Bray Road/Maple Road intersection with Highway 67. The police sergeant, with whom Walters had been conversing, received the same radio transmissions and did not comment on them to Walters, nor did he accompany Walters as Walters left the parking lot. Upon arriving at Highway 67, Walters positioned his vehicle in the median and waited for any southbound motorcycle to appear, during which time Walters overheard another Missouri State Patrol radio report stating that a motorcycle was being pursued along southbound Highway 67. After Walters idled for two minutes, a southbound motorcycle operated by Donald Hawkins traveled in the left hand lane, closest to the median, emerged from around the bend and appeared for the first time in Walters' line of sight. No other vehicles were in the vicinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6 134 Donald Hawkins testified that at no point during his journey along Highway 67 did he hear police sirens or exceed the posted speed limit, nor had he, prior to coming upon Walters' police car, seen activated emergency police lights. As Hawkins traveled in the left passing lane along southbound Highway 67, he came around the bend and proceeded toward the Bray Road intersection with Highway 67. Hawkins first became aware of the police car when the car was thirty yards away. When Hawkins saw the police car, it sat in the cut-through median between southbound and northbound Highway 67 facing west in the direction of, and perpendicular to, the southbound lanes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6 135 Very shortly thereafter, Hawkins noticed that the police car activated its emergency lights and moved. Hawkins thought the vehicle would turn onto the left lane and travel southbound on Highway 67, so Hawkins changed lanes to the right lane. The police car, however, moved across southbound Highway 67, into Hawkins' lane and hit Hawkins' motorcycle and Hawkins' person on the left side. Hawkins, who was wearing a helmet, landed head-first on the concrete, lost consciousness, and came to a stop in a ditch over 165 feet away from the point of collision. Walters testified that it was his intention to stop the motorcycle. Walters also testified that he did not intentionally attempt to ram the motorcycle with his police car. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a summary judgment ruling in favor of the officer on the basis of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6 136 In\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Speers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2537180\" index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/989/\">\n    473 F.3d at 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2007) an officer observed Alan Adams run several stop signs so the officer signaled Adams to stop. Adams did not pull to the side, and at least three more officers entered a chase. The court characterized Adams' driving during the pursuit as nonchalant because Adams drove within the speed limit, stopped for some stop signs, and rolled slowly through others. Officer Paul Speers learned over the radio of the police chase of Adams and joined the pursuit. As he associated with the expedition, Speers retrieved as a passenger a county probation officer who occasionally partnered in apprehending probation violators. Speers parked at a spot he guessed Adams would pass if he continued with his route. When Adams' vehicle reached Speers' location, Speers, without advising other pursuing law enforcement officers of his identity or intentions, tried to ram Adams' vehicle. Speers missed Adams' car so Speers continued at the head of the chase now aided by a police helicopter. Adams exited on an off-ramp, turned left over the freeway, and entered the on-ramp to travel in the opposite direction. Speers successfully rammed Adams with the two cars entangling. A sheriff's department manual characterized the intertwining as a \"significant hazard.\" Adams continued to drive his car and dragged Speers' patrol car for some distance before the cars separated and the chase continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   \u00b6 137 Paul Speers again butted his patrol car into Alan Adams' vehicle, which action sent Adams' car into a ditch. Despite patrol cars completely surrounding him, Adams reversed\n   his car toward Speers' patrol car. Another officer approached Adams' vehicle, struck the window with his baton, and reached in the car to pepper spray Adams. Before the officer sprayed, Speers exited his patrol car, stood in front of Adams' vehicle, and without warning fired six shots and killed Adams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \u00b6 138 An investigation by the sheriff's department found that Paul Speers violated department regulations. Speers lacked permission for the probation officer to ride as a passenger. Speers did not request or receive permission to enter the pursuit. He did not communicate with other officers involved in the chase and did not garner permission to ram Adams' vehicle or to discharge his weapon. The appeals court denied Speers qualified immunity while writing he was an officer \"on a mission of his own creation,\" who abandoned his assignment, retrieved a friend for no apparent reason, barged ahead of officers already engaged in the pursuit, and used force against Adams that created a hazard for both Adams and Speers. The court noted that\n   <em>\n    Tennessee v. Garner\n   </em>\n   had decades earlier established a shooting under these circumstances to violate the Fourth Amendment. No officer reasonably acting could have believed he could employ deadly force. Because an officer may not shoot an unarmed, nondangerous suspect to prevent flight, the court denied Paul Speers qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   \u00b6 139 We previously outlined the facts in\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5714996\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/502/#p503\">\n    649 F.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2011). The court denied qualified immunity to Officer Danny Davis because it had been settled law for a generation that, under the Fourth Amendment, when a suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.\n   <em>\n    Tennessee v.

Thomas Germany posed no immediate threat to anyone as he rode his motorcycle across an empty field in the middle of the night in rural Kentucky. The circuit court did not find relevant the fact that, at the time of Davis' actions, there were few, if any, reported cases in which police cruisers intentionally rammed motorcycles. It was only common sense-and obviously so-that intentionally ramming a motorcycle with a police cruiser involves the application of potentially deadly force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   \u00b6 140 We previously reported the facts in\n   <em>\n    Vaughan v. Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098743\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/1323/\">\n    343 F.3d 1323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2003). Despite some of these facts being disputed, the court accepted the passenger's version of the facts. The immediacy of threat caused by the driver's flight was a disputed material fact that defeated summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity in favor of the officer. The court ruled that the passenger's Fourth Amendment right was clearly established such that an objectively reasonable officer in Deputy Cox's position would not have believed he was entitled to use deadly force. The court reasoned that the danger presented in this case by the driver's flight was the risk of an accident during the pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Lawrence-Berrey, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   \u00b6 141 I concur in the lead opinion on all issues except issues 5 and 6.

The fact that a \"door check\" might not have been the subject to a prior \u00a7 1983\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   action is not a basis for immunity merely because it was the first time such an action was predicated on that particular use of force.

First among them are those principles involving responses to a motion for summary judgment.

In such circumstances, the later (\"sham\") affidavit is insufficient to overcome the earlier evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   \u00b6 149 Here, the State established its defense. The troopers described the felony flight\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (aided by the car video that captured\n   the final moments) and Mr. Sluman confirmed that he was committing a felony by his recorded admission at the scene and by his guilty plea. The only contradiction offered in response was Mr. Sluman's deposition testimony that he did not know the officer was chasing him. That is belied by his statement at the time of the accident and his guilty plea. Under\n   <em>\n    Overton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   , the belated change of view is insufficient. However, the lead opinion dismisses his admission on the basis that he was injured, in pain, and not under oath when he made it. The lead opinion also rejects use of his guilty plea due to reading too much into the decision in\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Baines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9195956\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/150/905/\">\n    150 Wash.2d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20245\">\n    84 P.3d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Neither justification has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   \u00b6 150 As the lead opinion properly noted, RCW 4.24.420 provides that it is \"a complete defense\" to a damages action that the injured party was engaged in the commission of a felony and that the felony was the proximate cause of the injury. This is a legislative policy determination that a person injured in the course of committing a felony is solely responsible for his injury. As the trial court correctly recognized, it applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \u00b6 151 There should be no question that the injury occurred at the conclusion of the incident and resulted from his crime. The causation element is thus easily satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining question is whether Mr. Sluman was committing a felony at the time of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   \u00b6 152 The lead opinion dismisses Mr. Sluman's statement at the scene on the basis that it was not made under oath. While many previous cases have involved prior statements made under oath that subsequently were contradicted by a more self-serving version of the facts, the majority cites no authority requiring that a prior oath is a requirement. Indeed, the seminal case on this topic appears to be\n   <em>\n    Marshall.\n   </em>\n   There, the defendant's affidavit contradicted two official records and was deemed unreasonable and, therefore, insufficient.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1759964\" index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/56/181/#p185\">\n    56 Wash.

While\n   <em>\n    Marshall\n   </em>\n   itself invalidates the lead opinion's position, there are additional reasons for disregarding the deposition testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   \u00b6 153 A contemporaneous statement typically is considered so reliable that multiple hearsay exceptions exist to allow consideration of that type of evidence.\n   <em>\n    E.g\n   </em>\n   ., ER 803(a)(1)-(3) (present sense impressions, excited utterance, then existing condition).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For purposes of the \"sham affidavit\" argument, I do not see why the defendant's contemporaneous nonhearsay statement against his own interest is not considered at least as truthful as one given under oath at some later time. In either circumstance, it should defeat a self-serving version of events given years after the fact. If an earlier statement under oath is sufficient to defeat a later affidavit under the sham affidavit rule, an uncontested and contemporaneous admission against interest should do the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \u00b6 154 That is particularly the case where the earlier statement is clearly reliable. The statement was captured on video. The statement accurately reported that Mr. Sluman had outstanding warrants. He also followed up on that statement by pleading guilty and admitting that he had fled from the troopers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   \u00b6 155 The lead opinion disregards this evidence due to its reading of\n   <em>\n    Clark.\n   </em>\n   That decision does not really aid resolution of this problem. Recognizing the ambiguous nature of an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea, the court was very straight-forward in stating its holding: \"We hold an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea cannot be used as the basis for\n   <em>\n    collateral estoppel\n   </em>\n   in a subsequent civil action.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9195956\" index=\"311\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/150/905/\">\n    150 Wash.2d at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20P.3d%20245\">\n    84 P.3d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).
