Respondent Samuel P. Krone was admitted to the Wyoming State Bar in 2001. From 2003 until his termination in 2016, Respondent was employed as a deputy in the Park County Prosecuting Attorney's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2. On July 29, 2016, a Felony Information was filed in the Circuit Court, Fifth Judicial District, Park County, Wyoming, against Respondent, alleging seven counts of felony and misdemeanor violations by Respondent in the conversion of $9,633.71 in Park County Bar Association dues between 2011 and 2013, when Respondent was serving as the Treasurer of the Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   3. On August 1, 2016, Bar Counsel for the Wyoming State Bar filed a \"Petition for Immediate Suspension of Attorney\" with the Wyoming Supreme Court pursuant to Rule 17 of\n   the Wyoming Rules of Disciplinary Procedure. Respondent did not file a response, choosing to properly resolve the criminal case, rather than potentially have the ability to practice law while the matter was pending. On August 24, 2016, the Court entered an Order of Immediate Suspension of Respondent, effective immediately. Respondent has remained under suspension since that date. On August 25, 2016, Bar Counsel filed a Formal Charge in the above-captioned proceeding pursuant to Rule 13, Wyo.R.Disc.Proc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   4. On October 12, 2017, in the District Court, Fifth Judicial District, Park County, Wyoming, pursuant to a written plea agreement which had previously been presented to the court, Respondent pleaded guilty to one count of violation of W.S. 6-3-402(b) and -(c)(i) and W.S. 6-3-410, a felony, and one count of violation of W.S. 6-3-402(a) and -(c)(iii), a misdemeanor, both of which arose from Respondent's wrongful conversion of funds belonging to the Park County Bar Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   5. On October 26, 2017, a \"Judgment, Sentence, and Order of Probation on Deferred Prosecution under Wyo.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 7-13-301\" was entered against Respondent in which the court essentially accepted the written plea agreement. As to the felony count, the court deferred its finding of guilt and placed Respondent on three years' supervised probation pursuant to Wyoming Statute \u00a7 7-13-301. In the event Respondent does not successfully complete the probation for the felony count, the Court will accept the guilty plea on said count and proceed to sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   6. As to the misdemeanor count, Respondent was sentenced to 180 days in jail (165 days suspended) and six months of probation to run concurrently with the probation ordered on the felony count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   7. Respondent was also ordered to pay fees, surcharges and assessments in the amount of $845.00, and to pay restitution to the Park County Bar Association in the amount of $9,633.77. The remaining counts of the Felony Information were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   8. Respondent acknowledges that the Wyoming Rules of Professional Conduct provide, \"A lawyer's conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer's business and personal affairs.\" Preamble, note [5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   9. Respondent conditionally admits that in committing the foregoing crime, Respondent violated Rule 8.4(b) (commission of a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty) and Rule 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or mis-representation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    The Appropriate Sanction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   10. The Wyoming Rules of Disciplinary Procedure require that disciplinary sanctions be determined by applying the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions using the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (i) Whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the profession;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (ii) Whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (iii) The amount of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's mis-conduct; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (iv) The existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Rule 15(b)(3)(D), Wyo.R.Disc.Proc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   11. ABA Standard 3.0 lists the factors to be considered in imposing a sanction after a finding of lawyer misconduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (a) the duty violated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) the lawyer's mental state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and\n   (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   12. Respondent's misconduct falls within the heading \"Violation of Duties Owed to the Public,\" more specifically, \"Failure to Maintain Personal Integrity\" (Standard 5.1) for which Respondent conditionally admits disbarment is the presumptive sanction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Absent aggravating or mitigating circumstances, upon application of the factors set out in Standard 3.0, the following sanctions are generally appropriate in cases involving commission of a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, or in cases with conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   5.11 Disbarment is generally appropriate when:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (a) a lawyer engages in serious criminal conduct, a necessary element of which includes intentional interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, extortion, misappropriation, or theft; or the sale distribution or importation of controlled substances; or the intentional killing of another; or an attempt or conspiracy or solicitation of any other commit any of these offenses; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (b) a lawyer engages in any other intentional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   5.12 Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in criminal conduct which does not contain the elements listed in Standard 5.11 and that seriously reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   5.13 Reprimand [in Wyoming, public censure] is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in any other conduct that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation and that adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   5.14 Admonition [in Wyoming, private reprimand] is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in any other conduct that reflects adversely on the lawyer's fitness to practice law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   13. Respondent conditionally admits that in committing the crime of which he was convicted, Respondent acted intentionally; that is, with the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   14. Under the ABA Standards, \"injury\" is defined as \"harm to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession which results from a lawyer's misconduct. The level of injury can range from `serious' injury to `little or no' injury; a reference to `injury' alone indicates any\n   level of injury greater than `little or no' injury.\" \"Potential injury\" is defined as \"harm to a client, the public, the legal system or the profession that is reasonably foreseeable at the time of the lawyer's misconduct, and which, but for some intervening factor or event, would probably have resulted from the lawyer's misconduct.\" Respondent conditionally admits that in committing the crime of which he was convicted, Respondent caused injury to the legal profession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   15. ABA Standard 9.0, entitled \"Aggravation and Mitigation,\" provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   9.1 Generally\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   After misconduct has been established, aggravating and mitigating circumstances may be considered in deciding what sanction to impose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   9.2 Aggravation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   9.21 Definition. Aggravation or aggravating circumstances are any considerations or factors that may justify an increase in the degree of discipline to be imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   9.22 Factors which may be considered in aggravation. Aggravating factors include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (a) prior disciplinary offenses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (b) dishonest or selfish motive;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (c) a pattern of misconduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (d) multiple offenses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (h) vulnerability of the victim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (i) substantial experience in the practice of law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (j) indifference in making restitution; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (k) illegal conduct, including that involving the use of controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   9.3 Mitigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   9.31 Definition. Mitigation or mitigating circumstances are any considerations or factors that may justify a reduction in the degree of discipline to be imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   9.32 Factors which may be considered in mitigation. Mitigating factors include:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (a) absence of a prior disciplinary record;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (b) absence of a dishonest or selfish motive;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (c) personal or emotional problems;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (d) timely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (e) full and free disclosure of disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (f) inexperience in the practice of law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (g) character or reputation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (h) physical disability;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (i) mental disability or chemical dependency including alcoholism or drug abuse when:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (1) there is medical evidence that the respondent is affected by a chemical dependency or mental disability;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (2) the chemical dependency or mental disability caused the misconduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (3) the respondent's recovery from the chemical dependency or mental disability is demonstrated by a meaningful and sustained period of successful rehabilitation; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (4) the recovery arrested the misconduct and recurrence of that misconduct is unlikely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (j) delay in disciplinary proceedings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (k) imposition of other penalties or sanctions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (l) remorse; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (m) remoteness of prior offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   9.4 Factors Which Are Neither Aggravating nor Mitigating.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The following factors should not be considered as either aggravating nor mitigating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (a) forced or compelled restitution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (b) agreeing to the client's demand for certain improper behavior or result;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (c) withdrawal of complaint against the lawyer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (d) resignation prior to completion of disciplinary proceedings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (e) complainant's recommendation as to sanction; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (f) failure of injured client to complain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   16. The parties stipulate that the following aggravating factors are present: (a) dishonest or selfish motive; (b) a pattern of misconduct; (c) multiple offenses; (d) substantial experience in the practice of law; and (e) illegal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   17. The parties stipulate that the following mitigating factors are present: (a) absence of a prior disciplinary record; (b) timely good faith effort to make restitution or rectify consequences of misconduct; (c) full and free disclosure to Bar Counsel and a cooperative attitude toward these disciplinary proceedings; (d) imposition of other penalties or sanctions; and (e) remorse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   18. Respondent and Bar Counsel agree and stipulate that in consideration of the foregoing, an order of disbarment beginning August 24, 2016 (the effective date of the Court's order of immediate suspension), is an appropriate and sanction for Respondent's misconduct, and the Board so finds. If the Court accepts the Board's recommendation and issues an Order of Disbarment in accordance herewith, Bar Counsel and Respondent agree to the following press release:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   The Wyoming Supreme Court has issued an order disbarring Cody attorney Samuel P. Krone from the practice of law. The order of disbarment is effective August 24, 2016, the date the court previously issued an order of immediate suspension of Krone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   The disbarment resulted from Krone's guilty plea to one felony count (deferred pursuant to W.S. \u00a7 7-13-301) and one misdemeanor conviction arising from Krone's wrongful conversion of funds from the Park County Bar Association in 2011 and 2013, when Krone served as the association's treasurer. In criminal proceedings which concluded in October 2017, the district court in Cody approved a plea agreement and sentenced Krone to serve 15 days in jail, three years of supervised probation and ordered him to make restitution to the Park County Bar Association in the amount of $9,633.71, in addition to other terms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Shortly after the criminal charges were brought against Krone, the Wyoming Supreme Court issued an order immediately suspending Krone from the practice of law effective August 24, 2016, pending resolution of formal disciplinary proceedings against Krone. In stipulating to disbarment to be effective on the date of the court's order of immediate suspension, Krone admitted that his conduct violated Rules 8.4(b) (commission of a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty) and Rule 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation) of the Wyoming Rules of Professional Conduct. Among the mitigating factors considered by the Board of Professional Responsibility were Krone's acceptance of responsibility for his conduct and his payment of full restitution to the Park County Bar Association. The board approved the stipulation and recommended it to the court, which accepted the board's recommendation. In addition to being disbarred, Krone was ordered to pay an administrative fee in the amount of $750.00 and costs of $50.00 to the Wyoming State Bar. Under Wyoming's Rules of Disciplinary Procedure for lawyers, Krone will eligible to petition for reinstatement five years after August 24, 2016, the effective date of the order of disbarment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Board of Professional Responsibility recommends that the Court issue an Order of Disbarment in accordance with the terms of this report and recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   DATED this\n   <em>\n    16\n   </em>\n   day of May, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   ______________________________\n   <br/>\n   Jason A.
