A day later, Yancey repeated his misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The State of Washington charged James Yancey with two counts of delivering a controlled substance, each with a sentence enhancement of selling within one thousand feet of a school bus stop. Yancey pled guilty to both counts and the enhancements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 During the sentencing process, James Yancey sought a residential drug offender sentencing alternative. The State registered its opposition and argued that Yancey lacked eligibility for a residential DOSA due to a high standard range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 RCW 9.94A.525(1) states that convictions entered or sentenced on the same date as the conviction, for which the sentencing court computes the offender score, shall be deemed \"other current offenses\" within the meaning of RCW 9.94A.589. Therefore, Yancey accrued an offender score of only one despite pleading guilty to two counts. The standard range for each charge was twelve to twenty months. The school zone enhancement added twenty-four months to the range, raising the total standard range to thirty-six to forty-four months. Under a Washington statute, an offender loses eligibility for a residential DOSA if the midpoint of his standard range exceeds twenty-four months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 James Yancey argued before the sentencing court that a judge may waive imposition of school zone enhancements if the defendant is otherwise eligible for a sentencing alternative. In a declaration submitted with the brief, defense counsel averred that he\n   had attended court sessions where prosecutors removed enhancements on drug delivery cases involving methamphetamine so that the defendant might qualify for a residential DOSA. The State of Washington responded by arguing that Yancey lacked eligibility for the sentencing alternative because the mid-point of Yancey's standard range exceeded twenty-four months. The trial court granted Yancey's request for the residential DOSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   DOSA Sentence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 The State of Washington appeals James Yancey's residential DOSA sentence.

The offender has significant incentive to comply with the conditions of a DOSA sentence, since failure may result in serving the remainder of the sentence in prison.

Nevertheless, the offender cannot serve his or her time in a residence if the midpoint of the standard range exceeds two years. If we exclude James Yancey's sentence enhancements, the midpoint of his standard range is sixteen months. If we include the sentence enhancements, the midpoint rises to forty months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 10 The State impliedly concedes that James Yancey qualifies for a DOSA, but not for a residential DOSA. The State, on appeal, contends the trial court lacked authority to grant the residential DOSA because the court must include the sentence enhancements in the calculation of the midpoint. In turn, Yancey argues that the trial court held authority to waive the sentence enhancements in order to impose a residential DOSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 11 This court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Mohamed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236632\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/187/630/\">\n    187 Wash. App. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=350%20P.3d%20671\">\n    350 P.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), adopted James Yancey's argument. A jury convicted Ali Mohamed of four counts of delivery of a controlled substance. The jury also found the special allegation for three of the counts that the crimes occurred within one thousand feet of a school. Based on the offender score and seriousness level, both parties agreed Mohamed's base standard range for the delivery charges was twenty to sixty months. Both parties also agreed the twenty-four months' school zone enhancement applied to three of the four charges. Mohamed asked the court to ignore a standard sentence and instead sentence him to a DOSA. The State argued the judge may waive the standard range part of the sentence, but that Mohamed must be sentenced to at least seventy-two months' confinement for the three school zone enhancements. The sentencing court deemed it lacked authority to award a DOSA and sentenced Mohamed to concurrent sentences of twenty months for the delivery charges and seventy-two months for the three enhancements for a total sentence of ninety-two months' confinement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 12 This court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Mohamed\n   </em>\n   , held that the trial court mistakenly concluded that it lacked authority to waive the school zone enhancement if it chose to impose a DOSA and that the trial court erred when it failed to consider waiving the school zone enhancements to impose a DOSA. We explained that RCW 9.94A.660 permits waiver of a sentence within the standard sentence range. \"Because standard sentence range means the base sentence range plus enhancement of such range,\n   <em>\n    a sentencing court may waive the enhancements as part of the standard sentence range under a DOSA\n   </em>\n   or [parenting sentencing alternative].\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Mohamed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236632\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/187/630/\">\n    187 Wash.

Despite the fact that Mohamed's midpoint range with the sentence enhancements exceeded twenty-four months, the court remanded the case for resentencing so the trial court could explore a DOSA. We discern no reason to reject the ruling in\n   <em>\n    State v. Mohamed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 13 In James Yancey's appeal, the State relies on\n   <em>\n    In re Post Sentencing Review of Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3973136\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/146/151/\">\n    146 Wash. App. 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20P.3d%20546\">\n    188 P.3d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) for support on how to accurately calculate James Yancey's standard and midpoint range. We find this decision unhelpful because our appeal does not ask how to calculate the standard range.\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez\n   </em>\n   does not address waiving imposition of the enhancement to return the midpoint range to within the twenty-four months' restriction stated in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 14 Unfortunately, this reviewing court lacks a transcript of James Yancey's sentencing hearing. Therefore, we do not know if the trial court expressly waived the requirements of the sentence enhancements in order to grant a DOSA. Therefore, we remand to the sentencing court to either confirm or exercise waiver of the enhancements or to resentence Yancey if the court did not intend to waive the enhancements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Scrivener Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 15 Both parties concede the judgment and sentence contains an error as to the seriousness levels for both convictions. James Yancey pled guilty to delivery of a Schedule III non-narcotic controlled substance under RCW 69.50.401(2)(c). Thus, the seriousness level for each count should be a II, not a I as indicated on the judgment and sentence. RCW 9.94A.518. Despite this error,\n   the sentencing court calculated the correct standard range. Yancey asks this court to remand the judgment and sentence to the trial court for correction of this slight mistake. We grant this request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 16 We remand this appeal to the sentencing court to determine whether to expressly waive sentence enhancements in order to impose a DOSA and to correct the seriousness level of the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   I CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Pennell, A.C.J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-45\">\n   Korsmo, J.

RCW 9.94A.660(1). Upon motion, the court then considers the offender's fitness for the alternative sentence. RCW 9.94A.660(2), (4), (5)(a). The court then\n   determines whether to impose the alternative sentence. RCW 9.94A.660(3). Whether the DOSA will be served in prison or the community is determined by the midpoint of the offender's standard range.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20P.2d%20213\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (last sentence). A midpoint of 24 months or less is served locally in residential treatment. RCW 9.94A.664. A midpoint of greater than 24 months dictates that the sentence is served in prison. RCW 9.94A.662. This approach parallels the jail-prison dichotomy in standard range sentences. Terms of greater than 12 months are served in prison, while terms less than that are served locally. RCW 9.94A.190(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 23 Here, the trial court followed the statutory commands to a point, but then faltered. It determined that Mr. Yancey's current offense was eligible for DOSA and had a sufficiently long standard range to qualify for treatment. The court determined that Mr. Yancey's prior offenses and immigration status did not disqualify him from consideration. Thus, the court correctly determined Mr. Yancey was eligible for a DOSA sentence. RCW 9.94A.660(1). The court then determined Mr. Yancey would be an appropriate person for treatment under DOSA. RCW 9.94A.660(4), (5). The court then exercised its discretion to impose a DOSA sentence. RCW 9.94A.660(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 24 So far, so good. However, the court then failed to follow the statute when it chose to ignore the legislative determination that offenders with long standard range terms, such as Mr. Yancey's, must serve their sentences in prison instead of in the local community: \"The residential chemical dependency treatment-based alternative\n   <em>\n    is only available\n   </em>\n   if the midpoint of the standard range is twenty-four months or less.\" RCW 9.94A.660(3). At this point the court apparently turned to\n   <em>\n    Mohamed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 25 The problem in\n   <em>\n    Mohamed\n   </em>\n   concerned the interplay of the DOSA statute and the stacking of enhancements required by RCW 9.94A.533(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Mohamed\n   </em>\n   involved four sentences, three of which were partly concurrent and partly consecutive due to the stacking of enhancements.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236632\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/187/630/\">\n    187 Wash. App. at 633-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=350%20P.3d%20671\">\n    350 P.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Application of an alternative sentence such as DOSA in this context is problematic because eligibility for alternative sentences typically is concerned primarily with the standard range for a particular offense, while the total sentence range for all charges is dependent on other statutes governing the ordering and enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   No statutory instruction has been given for how, or even whether,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   consecutive sentencing impacts a decision to impose an alternative sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 26 Instead, and without any discussion of legislative purpose, the\n   <em>\n    Mohamed\n   </em>\n   court found in the first sentence of RCW 9.94A.660(3) an ability to alter the standard range in order to make an offender fit within a residential DOSA rather than a prison DOSA. In my opinion, this was error. The statute read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   If the sentencing court determines that the offender is eligible for an alternative sentence under this section and that the alternative sentence is appropriate,\n   <strong>\n    the court shall waive imposition of a sentence within the standard sentence range\n   </strong>\n   and impose a sentence consisting of either a prison-based alternative under RCW 9.94A.662 or a residential chemical dependency treatment-based alternative under RCW 9.94A.664. The residential chemical dependency treatment-based alternative is only available if the midpoint of the standard range is twenty-four months or less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   RCW 9.94A.660(3), with emphasis supplied by\n   <em>\n    Mohamed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4236632\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/187/630/\">\n    187 Wash. App. at 637-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=350%20P.3d%20671\">\n    350 P.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Using this authority, the trial judge here altered the standard range in order to make Mr. Yancey fit in a local treatment program instead of the state prison program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 27 The error is three-fold. First, nothing in the emphasized language above conveys authority to alter a standard range sentence. Instead, it is the standard language used by the legislature in conveying the authority to trial judges to choose an alternative sentence in lieu of a standard range sentence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , RCW 9.94A.650(2) (first offenders: \"may waive the imposition of a sentence within the standard sentence range\"); RCW 9.94A.655(4) (parenting alternative: \"shall waive imposition of a sentence within the standard sentence range\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 28 Second, the interpretation of the emphasized language is inconsistent with both parts of the remainder of the statute. The initial clause of the first sentence recognizes the trial court's role in finding the offender eligible and fit for an alternative sentence under the preceding provisions of the statute; it is incongruous and inconsistent to then read the next clause as empowering the trial judge to ignore and alter the standards governing the eligibility decision. It also is inconsistent to interpret the emphasized language as\n   <em>\n    Mohamed\n   </em>\n   did because the remainder of the statute expressly tells the court how to apply its decision to invoke the alternative sentence-it shall choose a local or a prison DOSA based on the length of the midpoint of the standard range sentence. It does not say \"standard range as altered by the trial court\" or otherwise suggest that the legislative directive is somehow limited by a discretionary choice of the judge to alter the eligibility standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 29 Finally, the\n   <em>\n    Mohamed\n   </em>\n   interpretation is erroneous because it reads in an exceptional sentence authority that is inappropriate. First, our courts have long made clear that the exceptional sentence authority applies only to standard range sentences and does not apply to alternative sentences.\n   <em>\n    Onefrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1370255\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/119/572/#p576\">\n    119 Wash.2d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=835%20P.2d%20213\">\n    835 P.2d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275760\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/128/718/#p725\">\n    128 Wash.

If the legislature was breaking with its longstanding approach, it did so in an oblique manner and in a strange location. Second, allowing the trial judge to change its eligibility criteria also would be a significant change for the legislature that has consistently exercised its power to define crimes and punishments rather than delegate that authority to the court. Third, if it intended to allow trial judges to change the eligibility criteria, the legislature likely would have placed that authority in the eligibility subsection in order to expressly acknowledge the possibility. It also could have greatly simplified the language of the eligibility section, RCW 9.94A.660(1), if it intended its criteria to be advisory rather than mandatory. Fourth, where the legislature has granted courts power to alter the standard range by declaring an exceptional sentence, it has expressly limited that authority to cases where compelling reasons exist. The DOSA statute, as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Mohamed\n   </em>\n   , sets forth no criteria on which its exceptional sentence authority is to be exercised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 30 For all of those reasons, the interpretation given by\n   <em>\n    Mohamed\n   </em>\n   should be rejected. The governing case here is actually\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   . There, this court overturned a similar effort by a trial judge to use the exceptional sentence authority to change the midpoint on which a DOSA sentence was based.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275760\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/128/718/#p725\">\n    128 Wash.
