After Allen sued for negligence, the superior court granted summary judgment to the Town under the recreational-use immunity statute, Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 33-1551 (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold the fee the Town charged Allen's team to play in the league did not deprive the Town of the statute's protection, but remand for a trial on whether the Town acted with gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 The Town charged softball teams $270 each to play in an eight-game league at Mountain Valley Park. The fee partially offset costs the Town incurred in running the league, including field maintenance, lighting and umpires. On the night Allen was hurt, two light standards in the outfield were not functioning, and a fly ball hit Allen in the face after he lost it in the dark. On summary judgment, Allen presented evidence that the umpire the Town hired for the game could have postponed play due to the malfunctioning lights but did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The superior court entered summary judgment for the Town, reasoning that the fee Allen's team paid to play in the league was a \"nominal fee\" within the meaning of \u00a7 33-1551(C)(5) and that Allen had not offered evidence sufficient to show the Town acted with gross negligence. Allen timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Article 6, Section 9, of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) (2018) and -2101(A)(1) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Summary judgment may be granted \"if the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Ariz.

At issue here is the meaning of \"recreational user,\" which the statute defines as one who enters without \"payment of an admission fee.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1551(C)(5). The statute provides that a \"nominal fee that is charged ... to offset the cost of ... [the] premises and associated services does not constitute an admission fee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

We reversed the superior court's dismissal of the claim, reasoning that the $250 fee the city charged each team was an \"admission fee\" that rendered \u00a7 33-1551 inapplicable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488533\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/43/\">\n    185 Ariz. at 45-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488533\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/185/43/\">\n    912 P.2d at 48-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 10 Two years later, the legislature amended \u00a7 33-1551 by adding the provision that a property owner would not lose the protection of the statute by charging a \"nominal fee\" to maintain the premises and associated services. A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1551(C)(1), (5). The Senate fact sheet for the 1998 amendment cited\n   <em>\n    Prince\n   </em>\n   , explaining that decision had called into question whether cities should charge even a \"nominal fee\" for the use of public parks and fields.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The implication of the fact sheet was that the amendment would have applied to the $250 fee the city charged the team in\n   <em>\n    Prince\n   </em>\n   . That being the case, we conclude that the $270 the Town charged Allen's team likewise was a \"nominal fee\" within the meaning of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11 Allen's argument to the contrary is that, apart from the statute's history, the $270 his team paid to play in the league is not a \"nominal\" charge for \"the average person[ ] ... to enter a field to play softball.\" But the \"recreational user\" in this case whose claim might be subject to \u00a7 33-1551(A) is Allen, not his team. For that reason, whether his claim falls within the statute depends on whether the fee effectively charged\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   is \"nominal.\" The $270 the Town charged a team allowed each of the team's players to enter the field for eight games over the course of the league season. The Town calculates that the fee amounted to $2.81 per player per game, an assertion Allen does not question. The Town could have charged each player in the league on a per-game basis; that it chose to more efficiently bill one representative of each team for the entire season does not change the analysis. Nor does it matter for this purpose that Allen himself paid most of the fee the Town charged his team and that most of his teammates did not reimburse him their shares of the total.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 In sum, based on the statute's history, and viewed on a per-player, per-game basis, the fee the Town charged was a \"nominal fee\" within the meaning of A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1551(C)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Gross Negligence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 13 Because the fee the Town charged was nominal, as applied here, the statute bars Allen from recovering unless he can show that the Town \"was guilty of wilful, malicious or grossly negligent conduct.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1551(A). Allen argues the Town acted with gross negligence, which the statute defines as \"knowing or reckless indifference to the health and safety of others.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 33-1551(C)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 14 The superior court ruled Allen failed to offer evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact concerning gross negligence. On appeal, the Town contends Allen waived his right to recover under \u00a7 33-1551 by not expressly pleading \"gross negligence\" in his complaint and by failing to reference \"gross negligence\" in his disclosure statement. As to Allen's complaint, the issue of qualified immunity under \u00a7 33-1551 was not implicated until the Town asserted it in its answer. The Town offers no authority for the proposition that at that point, Allen was obligated to move for leave to amend his complaint to add a claim for \"gross negligence.\" As for Allen's disclosures, the issue is whether the facts he disclosed were sufficient to prove the Town breached a gross negligence standard of care, not whether he disclosed a claim specifically labeled \"gross negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Dobbs, P. Hayden &amp; E. Bublick, The Law of Torts (2d ed.)

He also showed that the umpire the Town hired could have postponed the game due to the lighting issues but did not do so. Viewed in a light most favorable to Allen, a reasonable juror could conclude the Town acted knowingly or with reckless indifference by failing to either timely repair the malfunctioning lights or halt play until the lights were repaired.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noriega v.

We also conclude that Allen offered evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue as to gross negligence. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in favor of the Town and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Absent material revision after the relevant date, we cite the current version of a statute or rule.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The fact sheet stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    A recent Court of Appeals decision (\n    <strong>\n     Prince v.
