Defendant asserts that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to establish that he acted with the \"intent to defraud\" under ORS 165.800(1). According to defendant, \"intent to defraud\" means the intent to interfere with another person's legal right or interest, and he asserts that the evidence established only that he received a social benefit. The state counters that \"intend to defraud\" includes intent to harm another person's reputation and, because defendant used the identity of a teacher to reach out to her former students with sexual and flirtatious messages, the evidence was sufficient to find that he intended to cause reputational harm to the teacher, and, therefore, to convict him under the statute. We conclude that the evidence was legally insufficient to support an inference that defendant acted with the \"intent to defraud\" within the meaning of ORS 165.800(1). Accordingly, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant waived his right to a jury trial and proceeded to a stipulated facts bench trial.

Defendant created a Facebook account under the name of a teacher at Falcon Heights Academy, A. To create the profile, defendant took pictures from A's Facebook page-which was a public profile-as well as her first name. Once the account was set up, defendant began contacting former students of A. The messages were sexual and flirtatious, and one of the former students reported the messages to A, who then reported the incident to local law enforcement. When A learned that defendant might be the culprit, she reported it to the police. An officer interviewed defendant, and he admitted to creating a fake profile using A's images and her name. Defendant claimed that he had created the account in an effort to gain information about a woman he once dated and used A's pictures because it gave him \"greater access.\" Defendant was arrested and charged with identity theft based on intent to defraud under ORS 165.800.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We begin with the text of the relevant statute, which provides necessary context.

Defendant argues on appeal, as he did below, that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that he acted with the \"intent to defraud\" as charged and therefore was insufficient to convict him of identity theft. He argues that, because he only contacted A's former students to get their attention, which he claims was a social benefit, his case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Amador\n   </em>\n   -that is, he did not use A's information to create the fake Facebook profile with the intent to interfere with a legal right or interest, nor did he obtain a benefit that he was legally barred from having had he used his true identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response, the state argues that\n   <em>\n    Mullen\n   </em>\n   expanded our holding in\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Amador\n   </em>\n   and asserts that we established in\n   <em>\n    Mullen\n   </em>\n   that a person's interest in her reputation is a legal right or interest protected under the statute. Accordingly, under the state's view, the evidence was legally sufficient to convict defendant under ORS 165.800(1). The state asserts that defendant admitted to using A's pictures and her name to send inappropriate messages to her former students and, because A was a teacher, the factfinder could infer that defendant intended to cause her reputational harm regardless of whether he succeeded in harming her reputation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The state misreads\n   <em>\n    Mullen\n   </em>\n   . Our conclusion in that case neither addressed nor altered the meaning of intent to defraud that we arrived at in\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Amador\n   </em>\n   . That is, we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Mullen\n   </em>\n   that the elements of identity theft under ORS 165.800 could be established if the defendant\n   had (1) the\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to deceive or defraud (but need not actually deceive or defraud); and that (2) the defendant's misappropriation of another person's personal identification creates a risk of reputational injury or economic loss because of that misappropriation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 679,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4214467\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/245/671/\">\n    263 P.3d 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"legislative history suggests that the identity theft statute is concerned with the misappropriation of persons' identities for the purpose of financial or pecuniary gain and that a person who is subjected to the risk of loss as a result of that misappropriation is a victim of the crime\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state\n   conflates those two elements. Put differently,\n   <em>\n    Mullen\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that one can evince an intent to defraud another person by creating a risk of reputational injury; rather, its reference to the risk of reputational injury spoke to the question of when a misappropriation of identity occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Consequently, the issue here is the one that defendant argues: whether the state presented legally sufficient evidence that defendant had the \"intent to defraud\" as described in\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Amador\n   </em>\n   -that is, \"an intent to cause injury to another's legal rights or interests.\"\n   <sup>\n    3\n   </sup>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203810\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/235/402/#p407\">\n    235 Or.App. at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203810\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/235/402/#p407\">\n    232 P.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So while it is true that the crime is not complete (the \"when\" to which the majority refers) until the person whose identity has been taken is at risk of reputational injury, a person whose identity has been misappropriated is a victim once the risk of reputational injury is extant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4214467\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/245/671/\">\n    263 P.3d 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   I understand that\n   <em>\n    Mullen\n   </em>\n   was not a case about whether a fraud is perpetrated upon\n   an identity owner based on the injury, or potential injury, to that person's reputation.

Defendant acknowledges the teacher did not consent to have her information stolen by him or to allow him to create a fake profile using her identity. That the teacher did not know this theft and misuse was occurring does not vitiate that it was occurring; indeed her lack of knowledge demonstrates that defendant was engaged in a deceit in the taking of it. I think it is fair to infer from the evidence that he knew the person whose identify he was converting was a teacher. He admitted that he hoped to mislead the students into believing he was their teacher by use of her identity (photo, first name, and a Facebook page designed to look like it was hers). He made misrepresentations to the students when he concealed his own identity by attempting to make it appear that it was the teacher contacting to them from the fake Facebook page. It reasonably can be inferred he chose the teacher because the girls trusted her, which is to say that she had a positive reputation with them, so he could gain access to the girls-the corollary being he himself did not possess the prerequisite reputation to enjoy such access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that defendant intentionally (with the conscious objective to impugn the teacher's reputation) converted to his own use the teacher's\n   identity and passed himself off as the teacher in a manner that put her reputation among her students at risk. Because I conclude the state met its burden of proof, I would affirm the trial court, and, therefore, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The dissent's assertion 291 Or.App. at 70-71, 418 P.3d at 34-35 (Allen, J. pro tempore, dissenting) that it arrives at a different meaning of \"defraud\" is incorrect. We define defraud exactly as the dissent does.
