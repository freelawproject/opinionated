(\"Watts\") appeals the denial of its motions to dismiss and compel arbitration. The parties disagree about whether these product liability subrogation claims are subject to mandatory contractual arbitration. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 2 In April 2014, a Watts-made water supply line allegedly failed at the residence of Terry and Lisa McNemar, causing property damage. The McNemars' insurer, Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company (\"Allstate\"), paid $53,149.65 for the McNemars' loss and nearly two years later, in March 2016, filed a subrogation action against Watts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 In June 2014, Russell and Pam Vaughn suffered property damage following the alleged malfunction of a reverse osmosis water filter manufactured by Watts. The Vaughns were insured by State Farm Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, Inc. (\"State Farm\"). State Farm paid $15,675.00 for the Vaughns' loss and filed a subrogation action against Watts in April 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 At the time of the incidents causing property damage, Allstate, State Farm (collectively, \"the Insurers\"), and Watts were parties to a Property Subrogation Arbitration Agreement (\"the Agreement\") promulgated by Arbitration Forums, Inc. (\"AF\"), which required that signatory companies forego litigation and arbitrate property subrogation claims. Article First of the Agreement, signed by Allstate in 1996 and State Farm in 2003, provided in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Signatory companies are bound to forego litigation and in place thereof submit to arbitration any questions or disputes which may arise from ... any fire subrogation or property damage claim not in excess of $100,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Agreement, signed by Watts in 2005, also provided, in Article Fifth, that \"AF, representing the signatory companies, is authorized to ... (a) make appropriate Rules and Regulations for the presentation and determination of controversies under this Agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 5 In November 2014, AF advised its signatory members through an e-bulletin that, effective January 1, 2015, it was adding a \"new exclusion\" to the Agreement that would remove product liability claims arising from allegedly defective products from the claims subject to mandatory arbitration between signatory companies. The November e-bulletin further advised:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   While the use of the Property Program to resolve disputes involving product liability claims arising from an alleged defective product will no longer be compulsory as of January 1, 2015, cases filed prior to January 1, 2015 will remain in arbitration's jurisdiction and will be processed to hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 6 AF did not include the foregoing e-bulletin language regarding claims accrued or \"cases filed prior to January 1, 2015\" within the revised Agreement (\"Amended Agreement\") promulgated by AF in January 2015. Instead, only the following exclusion (i) was added to Article Second:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Article Second\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Exclusions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   No company shall be required, without its\n   <strong>\n    written consent\n   </strong>\n   , to arbitrate any claim or suit if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (i) it is a product liability claim arising from an alleged defective product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Emphasis in original). The Amended Agreement does not include any language specifying whether the new exclusion applied to claims accruing before 2015 but not filed until after January 1, 2015. Neither Watts nor the Insurers signed the Amended Agreement with the new exclusion removing product liability claims from compulsory arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 7 In 2016, the Insurers filed product liability actions against Watts in superior court, based on the losses that occurred in 2014. Watts moved for dismissal of the lawsuits or alternatively for a stay and order compelling arbitration. Watts argued the claims accrued before January 2015 and were therefore subject to mandatory arbitration under the Agreement in effect in 2014. After briefing and oral argument, the superior court in State Farm's case denied Watts's motion, finding the Agreement \"was modified and the matter before the Court is not subject to mandatory arbitration.\" The superior court in Allstate's case concluded that \"as both Plaintiff and Defendant are signatories to the AF Agreement, they are bound by the provisions of the same, including the right of AF to delineate when its services will be provided,\" and, therefore, denied the motion. Watts timely appeals the superior court's orders denying the motions to dismiss and compel arbitration. We have consolidated these appeals. Appellate jurisdiction is based upon Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") sections 12-120.21(A)(1) (2018) and -2101.01(A)(1) (2018).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brumett v.

The Insurers maintain that AF was authorized by the Agreement to exclude product liability claims because of its power to make \"appropriate Rules and Regulations for the presentation and determination of controversies under th[e] Agreement,\" and therefore the superior court correctly determined product liability claims\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   after January 1, 2015 were \"excluded\" from compulsory arbitration.

AF's unilateral addition of a new exclusion of product liability claims from mandatory arbitration was not a mere procedural rule change.

Accordingly, the accrual of these property damage claims in 2014 triggered the application of the Agreement providing mandatory arbitration of these product liability claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 18 Nevertheless, the Insurers rely upon the language of the November 2014 e-bulletin to argue the Amended Agreement specifies the operative date for the exclusion of product liability claims is the date the claim was filed, not the date the claim arose. But the e-bulletin language is not part of any agreement signed by the parties, nor is it part of the Amended Agreement. The Amended Agreement does not contain any new language beyond exclusion (i). The e-bulletin presumably represents the desire of AF, but this record reveals no contractual documents signed by Watts or the Insurers stating that the Amended Agreement would apply to all actions\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   after January 1, 2015, even if the claims\n   <em>\n    accrued\n   </em>\n   prior to that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 19 The Insurers also rely on an opinion of the Illinois Court of Appeals that addressed similar issues,\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Watts Regulator Co.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=407%20Ill.%20Dec.%20380\">\n    407 Ill.Dec. 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20N.E.3d%20304\">\n    63 N.E.3d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ill. App. Ct. 2016). The court in\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   , however, conflated the e-bulletin language with the language of the Amended Agreement. The\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   court twice quoted the Amended Agreement as saying, \"cases\n   <em>\n    filed\n   </em>\n   prior to January 1, 2015, will remain in arbitration's jurisdiction and will be processed to hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20N.E.3d%20304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=407%20Ill.%20Dec.%20380\">\n    407 Ill.Dec. 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20N.E.3d%20304\">\n    63 N.E.3d at 307-08, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, that language is found only in the e-bulletin; the Amended Agreement contains no such language. The\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   opinion is therefore unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 20 The Insurers further rely on an Indiana Court of Appeals case,\n   <em>\n    Watts Water Technologies, Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Lucka )\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143682\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/66/983/\">\n    66 N.E.3d 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. Ct. App. 2016), which relied in part on the\n   <em>\n    Montero\n   </em>\n   case and the e-bulletin language. The\n   <em>\n    Lucka\n   </em>\n   court also decided that AF's authority to make rules and regulations included the authority to add the product liability exclusion at issue here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143682\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/66/983/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12143682\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/66/983/\">\n    at 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We disagree with\n   <em>\n    Lucka's\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 21 Finally, State Farm relies upon Article Sixth, Withdrawals, to support its interpretation of the Agreement. The provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Any signatory company may withdraw from this Agreement by notice in writing to AF. Such withdrawal will become effective sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice except as to cases then pending before arbitration panels. The effective date of withdrawal as to such pending cases shall be upon final compliance with the finding of the arbitration panel on those cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This provision specifically addresses claims pending at the time of withdrawal. In contrast, the Amended Agreement does not address whether the new exclusion of product liability claims applies to pending claims or claims already accrued but not yet filed. The withdrawal provision does not provide the answer to the issue before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 22 The Agreement does not give AF the power to unilaterally impose the product liability exclusion, and Watts and the Insurers never agreed between themselves to apply the Amended Agreement to claims arising before 2015. Accordingly, the Agreement in effect in 2014 applies to these property damage claims and the Amended Agreement does not. We therefore vacate the superior court's orders denying Watts's motions to compel arbitration and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We award taxable costs to Watts upon compliance with Arizona Rule of Civil Appellate Procedure 21(b).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Article Fifth further authorized AF to: \"(b) determine the location, and the means by which, arbitration cases are heard; (c) determine qualification criteria and provide for the selection and appointment of arbitrators; (d) establish fees; (e) invite other insurance carriers,\n    <strong>\n     noninsurers\n    </strong>\n    , or\n    <strong>\n     self-insureds\n    </strong>\n    to participate in this arbitration program, and compel the withdrawal of any signatory for failure to conform to the Agreement or the Rules issued thereunder.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The insured homeowners are not signatories to the AF Agreement. The parties have focused on the dates of the property losses and the dates the subrogation actions were filed in superior court. The parties have not addressed the dates the Insurers paid the claims. Generally, an insurer's right to subrogation does not arise until it has made payment for the property damage and thereby becomes subrogated to the claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Safeway Ins. v.

The record on appeal does not establish when the Insurers made payments and became subrogated to their insureds' claims.

Feb. 24, 2015), constituted res judicata or collateral estoppel preventing Watts from arguing in this appeal that AF did not have the power to unilaterally impose the product liability exclusion. We disagree. In its February 2015 order, the Massachusetts federal district court granted a motion to dismiss Watts's complaint for failure to state a claim because, according to the court, AF was not a party to the Agreement. In dicta, the court expressed the view that the parties had \"implicitly recognize[d] the authority of AF to define the scope of the arbitration services that it will offer.\" We are not bound by that court's ruling, nor its differing interpretation of the Agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
