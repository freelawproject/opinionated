We hold that, in the absence of a written fee agreement, an attorney may not recover the\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   value of his services because unwritten contingent fee agreements are void as against public policy. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 This case arises from Appellant's representation of the Erhardts (the Clients) from 2011 to 2013 in a personal injury matter. The Clients were initially represented by Attorney Jerry Krumwiede, who then sought Appellant's assistance with an understanding that Appellant would ultimately become primary counsel. Appellant and the Clients never executed a written contingent fee agreement, and Appellant and Krumwiede never entered into a written agreement to divide fees. Following a falling out between Appellant and Krumwiede, the Clients dismissed Appellant as their attorney. Appellant asserts that while involved with the Clients' case, he engaged in \"vigorous legal representation of [the Clients]\" and performed 428.5 hours of work on their behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Clients eventually also fired Krumwiede and retained Appellee, Haralson, Miller, Pitt, Feldman &amp; McAnally, P.L.C. (Haralson), to represent them. Haralson ultimately settled the Clients' claims. Appellant, who had previously notified all parties he had placed a charging lien against any recovery obtained as compensation for his work, then demanded payment. When Haralson refused, Appellant sued, alleging unjust enrichment and seeking\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Haralson moved to dismiss Appellant's complaint, arguing Appellant's claims failed as a matter of law because he: (1) did not allege the existence of a written contingent fee agreement with the Clients, in violation of the Arizona Rules of Professional Conduct,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Sup. Ct. 42, ER 1.5(c) (providing that \"[a] contingent fee agreement shall be in a writing signed by the client\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) failed to allege the legal representation had been terminated without justification, which, Haralson asserted, was a prerequisite to recovery in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   . The trial court accepted the parties' stipulation to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In response to the motion to dismiss, Appellant admitted he had no written contingent fee agreement but claimed he \"entered into an oral agreement for a division of contingency fees recovered upon success of [the Clients'] suit.\" Appellant also argued that because his claims \"sound in equity,\" they \"survive irrespective of the validity or enforceability of any oral contract between himself and [the Clients].\" At a hearing on the motion to dismiss, Appellant's counsel explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [W]ell, the [C]lients knew about it and the other attorney obviously knew about it, but ... Mr. Krumwiede and [Appellant] were in the same office, they felt like there was a relationship that-that permitted their-to have a trusting relationship without, you know, without obviously informing the clients they knew that [Appellant] was one of their lawyers and they didn't go through the formality of putting it in writing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Appellant's counsel stated Krumwiede had a written fee agreement with the Clients and asserted Appellant \"would have been operating under that as an associate counsel,\" but, again, \"that part wasn't written, the fee-sharing part wasn't written.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 The trial court dismissed Appellant's complaint, reasoning: (1) Appellant did not allege the existence of a written fee agreement with either the Clients or Krumwiede, and (2) Appellant's failure to comply with ER 1.5 barred recovery in\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   as a matter of public policy. Although Appellant explicitly conceded in his pleadings and at oral argument that he had no written agreements, he then filed a motion for reconsideration alleging discovery would show Appellant \"had Krumwiede's assurance that such written consent had been obtained.\" The trial court denied the motion for reconsideration and entered final judgment in Haralson's favor. Appellant timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 We review an order dismissing a complaint for failure to state a claim\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

A client, dissatisfied with the outcome, may assert he was misled by an unscrupulous legal adviser and refuse to pay the agreed-upon amount, or an attorney may spend more time on a case than anticipated and attempt to increase his recovery to offset those additional expenditures. Such disputes devolve into self-serving recollections of how the agreement was formed and what the parties intended at the litigation's outset.

The Trial Court's Dismissal Was Not Procedurally Deficient.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 17 Appellant argues the trial court's decision \"was tainted by factual findings regarding matters outside the body of the complaint,\" suggesting the court effectively and improperly converted the motion to one for summary judgment before Appellant had time to conduct discovery. This argument is not well-taken. First, Appellant stipulated to the stay of discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss, suggesting he already had within his possession the materials and information necessary to adequately defend the motion. Second, a court may consider matters \"central to the complaint,\" but outside the pleadings, when ruling on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Strategic Dev. &amp; Constr., Inc. v. 7th &amp; Roosevelt Partners, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4053622\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/60/#p64\">\n    224 Ariz. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64, \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4053622\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/60/#p64\">\n    226 P.3d 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1050 (App. 2010) (citing\n   <em>\n    Alt.

Whether a written contingent fee or division of fee agreement existed was a matter central to the complaint. We therefore find no error in the court's handling of the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 18 Appellant also argues the absence of a written fee agreement is an affirmative defense, which he was not required to preemptively deny within his complaint. But because the record shows Appellant admitted he had no written contingent fee agreement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b65, we need not address this contention. With this admission, Appellant foreclosed proof of any set of facts which would entitle him to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 An attorney wishing to be compensated for his professional services on a contingency basis must have a written fee agreement signed by the client. In the absence of a written contingent fee agreement, an attorney should anticipate that work done in violation of ER 1.5(c) is being undertaken without any meaningful expectation of compensation. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    \" 'Quantum meruit' literally means 'as much as he deserves,' \" and contemplates recovery of a reasonable amount to avoid unjust enrichment.\n    <em>\n     Murdock-Bryant Constr., Inc. v.
