The Hopi Tribe (the Tribe), which opposes the use of reclaimed wastewater on the Peaks, appeals the dismissal of its complaint for lack of standing and the award of attorneys' fees to the City of Flagstaff (the City) and Arizona Snowbowl Resort Limited Partnership (Snowbowl).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 At issue is whether the Tribe sufficiently alleged standing to maintain a common law public nuisance claim. For a private party to bring a claim of public nuisance, it must allege both an interference with a right common to the public and a special injury different in kind from that of the public. The\n   parties do not dispute that the Tribe sufficiently alleged that the use of reclaimed wastewater interferes with the public's right to use and enjoy the Peaks. Because we find the Tribe sufficiently alleged the use of reclaimed wastewater causes its members a special injury, different in kind than that suffered by the general public, by interfering with places of special cultural and religious significance to the Tribe, we reverse the trial court's dismissal, vacate the orders denying the Tribe's motion to amend the complaint and awarding Snowbowl and the City attorneys' fees, and remand for further consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Tribe has contested Snowbowl's presence on the Peaks for decades, long before Snowbowl considered using reclaimed wastewater\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to make artificial snow, and this case is the latest iteration of that dispute. In 1981, several plaintiffs, including the Hopi Tribe, challenged the U.S. Forest Service's approval of upgrades to Snowbowl, arguing, among other things, that the approval violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1123234,3642526\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/708/735/\">\n    708 F.2d 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 739 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The plaintiffs argued the approved upgrades would \"seriously impair their ability to pray and conduct ceremonies upon the Peaks, and to gather from the Peaks the sacred objects ... necessary to their religious practices.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1123234,3642526\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/708/735/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1123234,3642526\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/708/735/\">\n    at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although noting the proposed upgrades to Snowbowl were \"inconsistent with the plaintiffs' beliefs, and will cause the plaintiffs spiritual disquiet,\" the D.C. Circuit found the upgrades would not impose a substantial burden on the exercise of any religious practices and denied relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1123234,3642526\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/708/735/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1123234,3642526\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/708/735/\">\n    at 742-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 4 Thereafter, in 2002, the City contracted to sell reclaimed wastewater to Snowbowl for the purpose of making artificial snow. In 2005, the Forest Service approved the use of reclaimed wastewater for snowmaking on the ski runs at Snowbowl.\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation III\n   </em>\n   , 535 F.3d at 1066 (citing\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation I\n   </em>\n   , 408 F.Supp.2d at 886 ). Several tribes, including the Hopi Tribe, challenged the approval under various federal statutes including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Grand Canyon National Park Enlargement Act, the National Forest Management Act, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation I\n   </em>\n   , 408 F.Supp.2d at 871 ). The district court ultimately resolved all claims in favor of the Forest Service.\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation I\n   </em>\n   , 408 F.Supp.2d at 908. The tribes then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which initially reversed the decision on the tribes' RFRA claim and one alleged NEPA violation and affirmed judgment in favor of the Forest Service on the other claims.\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation II\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843160\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/479/1024/#p1060\">\n    479 F.3d 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1060-61 (9th Cir. 2007). But, in an 8-3 decision\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's decision in all respects.\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation III\n   </em>\n   , 535 F.3d at 1063.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 In 2010, as the City prepared to move forward with the sale of reclaimed wastewater to Snowbowl, the Tribe filed its complaint in the present case, alleging, among other claims, public nuisance. As relevant here, the complaint alleged the use of reclaimed wastewater to make artificial snow harmed the environment, and thus the public's use and enjoyment of the Peaks, because the water \"contains recalcitrant chemical components ... including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, legal and illicit drugs, veterinary drugs, hormones, caffeine, cosmetics, food supplements, sunscreen agents, solvents, insecticides,\n   plasticizers, detergent compounds and other chemicals.\" The Tribe asserted Snowbowl would not be able to contain the reclaimed wastewater to the ski area because the runoff would enter the water supply and winds would carry the artificial snow beyond the application area. Therefore, the Tribe alleged the contamination of the Peaks would interfere with its cultural and religious practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 When the Tribe filed its complaint, Snowbowl had not yet purchased reclaimed wastewater. The City successfully moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing it was barred by claim and issue preclusion. On appeal, another panel of this Court reversed the dismissal, finding the\n   <em>\n    Navajo Nation\n   </em>\n   cases did not preclude the Tribe's public nuisance claim, but declined to consider the merits of the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hopi Tribe v. City of Flagstaff\n   </em>\n   , 1 CA-CV 12-0370,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201789859\">\n    2013 WL 1789859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35 (Ariz. App. Apr. 25, 2013) (mem. decision).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Since this Court last reviewed the case, significant procedural developments have occurred. On remand, the City filed a third-party indemnification claim against Snowbowl. Additionally, Snowbowl has now purchased reclaimed wastewater from the City and has made artificial snow on the Peaks. Finally, the Tribe unsuccessfully moved to amend its complaint to add Snowbowl as a defendant and to add a claim for an injunction against Snowbowl's artificial snowmaking, or, in the alternative, damages resulting from that activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8 Snowbowl moved to dismiss the Tribe's complaint, pursuant to Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Tribe failed to sufficiently allege the type of damages necessary to maintain a public nuisance claim. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss and awarded attorneys' fees to Snowbowl and the City pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (A.R.S.) \u00a7 12-341.01(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tribe timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) and -2101(A)(1), (5)(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The purity of the ceremonial objects collected by members of the Hopi Tribe during pilgrimages is of particular importance. These objects cannot be used for ceremonial purposes if they become tainted or impure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   138. ... Natural resources that the Hopi collect, as well as shrines, sacred areas, and springs on the Peaks will come into contact with the blown reclaimed wastewater.... This negatively impacts the Hopi's use of the Snowbowl Resort Area, the Wilderness Area, and surrounding areas, and causes Hopi practitioners to stop using the areas they have traditionally used.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   201. The Hopi Tribe suffers specific injury ... because the prevailing winds will blow the artificial snow outside the boundaries of the application area thus negatively impacting Hopi's use of these areas, including for ceremonial practices....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   202. The Hopi Tribe will suffer specific injury ... because the artificial snow will blow towards, and melting snow will runoff into, springs and water bodies the Hopi Tribe uses for ceremonial and utilitarian purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 14 We are not persuaded by the City's reliance upon\n   <em>\n    Oppen v.

In\n   <em>\n    Exxon\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that a class of Alaska Natives failed to allege a special injury resulting from an oil spill when the class alleged the spill affected their \"subsistence way of life.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641593\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/104/1196/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641593\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/104/1196/\">\n    at 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A careful reading shows the plaintiffs characterized their injuries as economic, arguing the damage to natural resources caused by the oil spill was \"inextricably bound up ... with the exchange, sharing and processing of those resources as the foundation of an established economic, social and religious structure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641593\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/104/1196/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Ninth Circuit found this argument was precluded because all economic claims had been resolved in a prior settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the Ninth Circuit relied upon provisions within the Alaska Constitution reserving the natural resources of the state \"to the people for common use\" in concluding \"the right to lead subsistence lifestyles is not limited to Alaska Natives.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (citing Alaska Const. art. VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 15, 17 ;\n   <em>\n    Gilbert v.

Arizona does not have equivalent constitutional provisions, and all people do not share in the Tribe's religious and cultural interest in the Peaks.

Assuming the truth of all well-pleaded facts, we find the Tribe has alleged a special injury sufficient to survive the motion to dismiss. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's dismissal of the complaint and remand for further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We express no opinion as to the merits of the Tribe's underlying claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
