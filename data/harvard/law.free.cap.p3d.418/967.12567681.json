We vacate, however, the dismissal of Muscat's vulnerable adult claim and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2 Muscat is a \"profoundly disabled person\" whose disabilities make \"impulse control considerably more difficult for him than it is for the typical person.\" Muscat was convicted of child abuse, a sexually motivated offense and class four felony, and placed on lifetime probation for inappropriately touching a child in a restroom stall in June 2008. In 2011, Muscat was placed into a group home owned by Creative Innervisions, LLC, and approved by ADES's Division of Developmental Disabilities (\"Division\"). Representatives from the Division and Creative met and developed an Individual Support Plan (\"ISP\") for Muscat, which required Creative to provide one-on-one supervision of Muscat at all times, whether in the group home or in the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 In December 2012, Akande, the staff member assigned to supervise Muscat, drove Muscat to a local church to attend a theater production. Instead of accompanying him to the event, Akande dropped him off, leaving him unsupervised. Inside the church, Muscat followed a child into the restroom and inappropriately touched the child. Muscat was arrested in November 2013 and charged with aggravated assault and child molestation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 In December 2014, Muscat filed a complaint alleging negligence, negligent supervision/training/hiring, and violation of the Arizona Adult Protective Services Act (\"APSA\"). Muscat alleged that \"as a result of [his] being left unattended and unsupervised\" by Creative, the county attorney's office filed a petition to revoke Muscat's felony probation and charged him with molestation of a child as a repeat felony offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 After filing the complaint, Muscat was declared competent to stand trial in the criminal matter, and later pled guilty to attempted child molestation and attempted kidnapping, each a class three felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In December 2015, Muscat was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for attempted molestation (with 751 days' presentence incarceration credit) and lifetime probation for attempted kidnapping. The sentencing judge found the eight-year sentence was \"clearly excessive,\" thereby allowing Muscat to petition the clemency board for a commutation of sentence pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 13-603(L). The court recognized that Muscat's \"conduct is extremely concerning and warrants a punitive sanction,\" but that given his \"cognitive limitations and disabilities [he] has a diminished level of culpability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 That same month, Creative filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in this case, asserting that Muscat's claims were barred by the \"wrongful conduct rule\" and his complaint failed to state a \"cognizable claim\" upon which relief could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The superior court granted the motion, finding that \"under the wrongful conduct rule and Arizona law, [Muscat] cannot maintain this action or seek the requested damages because it resulted from [his] own illegal conduct and cannot be established absent a showing that he has broken the law.\" This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 \"A motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to [ Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) ] tests the sufficiency of the complaint, and judgment should be entered for the defendant if the complaint fails to state a claim for relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Giles v.

But as the parties acknowledged at oral argument, no court in any jurisdiction has concluded that a custodian may be found liable for negligence based solely on consequences that flow from the ward's commission of a crime. We must therefore determine, as in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , whether the alleged harm constitutes an injury that is recognized by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 In his complaint, Muscat alleges that he suffered,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , loss of freedom, loss of participation in life's activities, pain, suffering, distress, mental and emotional anguish, anxiety, and a decrease in the quality of life. Muscat did not allege that Creative caused him to suffer any physical harm. It is undisputed that Muscat was properly incarcerated, meaning he was sentenced to prison (with presentence incarceration credit) after he was found competent to stand trial and found guilty of the offenses set forth in the plea agreement. Given that his alleged injuries arise only out of a legally imposed incarceration, Muscat alleges no injury that is distinct from the consequences of his prison sentence. Criminal defendants have legally protected interests that may be affected during criminal proceedings, but no properly-convicted criminal has a legally protected interest in being free from the inherent consequences of the resulting sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Levine v.

Similarly, if a plaintiff is unable to allege a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of negligence, a court's decision to grant judgment on the pleadings is not in conflict with the constitutional doctrines of contributory negligence or assumption of risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

Section 12-712(A), like the constitutional provisions discussed above, does not apply unless the plaintiff alleged a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Vulnerable Adult Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 For his APSA claim, Muscat alleges he is a vulnerable adult and was injured by Creative's abuse and neglect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 46-455(B) (\"A vulnerable adult whose life or health is being or has been endangered or injured by neglect, abuse or exploitation may file an action in superior court against any person ... that has assumed a legal duty to provide care or that has been appointed by a court to provide care to such vulnerable adult for having caused or permitted such conduct.\"). Creative did not address the APSA claim in its motion for judgment on the pleadings, and although the claim was briefly addressed in the response and the reply, neither of the parties engaged in any meaningful statutory analysis of the vulnerable adult statutes. Nor did the superior court separately analyze the APSA claim in its detailed ruling. Likewise, on appeal, the parties have not provided any helpful briefing on this issue, which cannot be resolved merely by relying on the analysis we have applied to the negligence claims. Whether Muscat has stated a viable claim under A.R.S. \u00a7 46-455(B) must be considered by the superior court in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 23 We affirm the portion of the superior court's judgment dismissing Berman's claims and Muscat's negligence claims.
