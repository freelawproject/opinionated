We reverse and remand to the superior court, holding that when a written contract provides for obligations that would give rise to both a claim for debt on an open account and a claim for breach of contract, the six-year statute of limitations under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 12-548 applies to the claims that are based on damages arising from the breach of contract. Broadband's breach of contract claim was based on obligations provided for in the written contract between the parties, which were separate from the open account obligations, and therefore the superior court erred by barring Broadband's claim under the three-year statute of limitations under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-543.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 In September 2008, Broadband and SatCom entered a Service Agreement in which Broadband would provide SatCom with dedicated voice and telecommunications services. The term of the Service Agreement was 12 months, with an effective date of October 22, 2008. The agreement provided an automatic 12-month renewal that could be canceled with 90 days' notice prior to the anniversary date. The Service Agreement provided, in relevant part: (1) the parties intended to establish an open account; (2) Broadband would invoice monthly based on usage; and (3) SatCom would pay the amount due by the 21st of the following month. The Service Agreement also provided for liquidated damages as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Termination Charge\n   </em>\n   . If Customer terminates the Agreement without cause, or if Broadband terminates the agreement for cause, Customer will pay their total dollar commitment to Broadband as defined as the term of this agreement or any months remaining in term inclusive of any renewal periods multiplied by the total of\n   <em>\n    the revenue and usage commitments\n   </em>\n   . Customer hereby acknowledges that any termination charges payable under this section are a realistic estimate of the damages Broadband will suffer for the termination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 In January 2016, Broadband sued SatCom for breach of contract and requested\n   the principal sum, calculated per the Termination Charge, of $100,044.93 ($14,334.43 (revenue commitment) plus $85,710.50 (usage commitment) ), plus interest from April 20, 2011. SatCom moved to dismiss, arguing that Broadband's claim was barred by the three-year limitations period governing open accounts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-543(2). In response, Broadband argued the six-year limitations period applied because the claim was premised on SatCom's termination of the Service Agreement, not the balance due on an open account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-548(A)(1). Following supplemental briefing, the superior court agreed with SatCom and dismissed the complaint as time barred, concluding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [T]he Termination Charge is part of an open account agreement between the same parties and constitutes a penalty for failing to comply with the terms of the open account. In addition, the calculation of the Termination Charge is based upon prior usage or service. In short, the Termination Charge is too intertwined with the services required by the Agreement to treat it as a separate contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following entry of a final judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 54(c), Broadband timely appealed.

Civ. App. 1981). We find these cases unpersuasive. In\n   <em>\n    Touro\n   </em>\n   , the claim asserted by the plaintiff was for the balance due on an open account, though the exact amount was in dispute, and there was no written agreement between the parties.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7056397\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/34/878/#p883\">\n    34 So.3d at 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Broadband is seeking relief under the liquidated damages clause as part of the written Service Agreement, and has specifically conceded that it cannot collect any unpaid balance due on the open account. In\n   <em>\n    Dean Vivian\n   </em>\n   , the claim asserted by the plaintiff was also for balance due on an open account, but did include a claim for interest based on a written agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9985820\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/615/921/#p926\">\n    615 S.W.2d at 923-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the application of a statute of limitations under either an open account or a written contract was not at issue, and therefore that case is also not informative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 Finally, we disagree with the superior court's finding that the Termination Charge was \"too intertwined\" with the open account agreement to allow for a breach of contract claim. The superior court explained that (1) the lack of a separately signed agreement, (2) the Termination Charge being enforced as a penalty for failing to comply with the terms of the agreement, and (3) the calculation of the Termination Charge being based on prior usage all supported a finding that Broadband's claim should be barred by the three-year statute of limitations for actions on open accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 The factors cited by the superior court are not determinative of the statute of limitations issue. Instead, when determining whether a plaintiff's claim should be construed as one on an open account or one based on a breach of a written contract, where a written agreement contains mixed obligations, some of which cannot be characterized as an open account, we look to the parties' obligations under the agreement and determine whether they are seeking a remedy for an unpaid balance due on the open account, or for damages because of a breach of the written contract. As previously noted, if \"two constructions are possible, the longer period of limitations is preferred.\"\n   <em>\n    Woodward\n   </em>\n   , 141 Ariz. at 524, 687 P.2d at 1279. Accordingly, Broadband's claim against SatCom for breach of the written Service Agreement should be allowed to proceed under \u00a7 12-548 because the obligations and remedy sought are not based on those of an open account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
