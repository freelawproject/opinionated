The entire board was in attendance. The Wyoming State Bar was represented by Bar Counsel. Mark W. Gifford. Respondent was present in person as was his counsel, Scott E. Ortiz. Bar Counsel's Exhibits BC-1 through BC-30 and BC-32 through BC-61 were received into evidence, as were Respondent's Exhibits 1 and 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based upon the exhibits received into evidence, the testimony of witnesses and with due consideration given to the statements of counsel, the Board unanimously FINDS, CONCLUDES and RECOMMENDS as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1. The Board accepts the parties' pre-hearing stipulation and renders the following findings based upon the stipulation, Respondent's supporting affidavit of factual basis, and the testimony and exhibits received into evidence at the hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a. Respondent is a licensed attorney in the State of Wyoming, Bar #5-1252. Respondent has been licensed to practice in Wyoming since 1972, and maintains an active practice of law in Buffalo, Wyoming.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   b. This case stems from Respondent's representation of Stacey Ridley and her desire to file personal bankruptcy. Respondent's representation of Ms. Ridley originally began in 2011 but, due to a number of personal issues, it was very difficult for Ms. Ridley to follow through with the requirements of filing a bankruptcy petition. After Ms. Ridley stopped coming to Respondent's office for scheduled appointments, and refused to sign necessary paperwork, Respondent ultimately closed the file for a year or more. In 2015, Ms. Ridley renewed her interest in filing a bankruptcy petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   c. Ms. Ridley's bankruptcy petition was ultimately drafted and ready for filing in September 2015. This generally coincided with a partial distribution of assets from the Estate of Charles Evitt. In the Evitt probate proceeding, Respondent was representing Ms. Ridley's mother, Mary Jo Evitt. Ms. Evitt was the surviving spouse, who had elected against the terms of her husband's will. Ms. Ridley was Charles Evitt's stepdaughter. In his will, Mr. Evitt left Ms. Ridley a cash bequest of $25,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   d. When preparing the petition, Respondent knowingly failed to list the $25,000 bequest as a contingent asset on Ms. Ridley's bankruptcy schedule of assets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   e. One of Ms. Ridley's creditors was aware of the $25,000 bequest in the will, and raised the issue with the bankruptcy trustee. Within a couple of months after this notification, the $25,000 was provided to the bankruptcy trustee and ultimately distributed to Ms. Ridley's creditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   f. The Representative of the Office of the United States Trustee, Daniel Morse, had serious concerns about this sequence of events, and as a result, filed a complaint against Ms. Ridley, based on the failure to list the $25,000 bequest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   g. After reviewing the complaint from the bankruptcy trustee, Respondent agreed, via signed stipulation, to a two (2) year suspension from practicing in bankruptcy court. Respondent also agreed to return any fees he received from Ms. Ridley, (or her family members), for the work Respondent performed during the bankruptcy proceeding. Respondent further agreed to provide to the bankruptcy trustee verification of his self-report of his actions to Bar Counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   h. Subsequent to Respondent's suspension in bankruptcy court, Respondent was notified that the U.S. Attorney's Office intended to seek an indictment charging Respondent with a bankruptcy fraud offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   i. After negotiations with the U.S. Attorney's office, a plea agreement was reached wherein Respondent entered a guilty plea to the misdemeanor offense of contempt of court. Part of the plea agreement also required Respondent to spend 45 days in jail as part of a stipulated sentence. This plea agreement was accepted by Magistrate Judge Kelly Rankin and sentence was ordered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   j. Respondent began his jail sentence in early December 2016, until ordered to be released by the Federal Marshal's office in January 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   k. The failure on Respondent's part to list the $25,000 contingent asset initially jeopardized Ms. Ridley's chance to receive a discharge through the bankruptcy court. Respondent obtained and paid for new counsel for Ms. Ridley. After a hearing in bankruptcy court on February 23, 2017, Judge Parker granted Ms. Ridley her discharge of debt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2. Respondent has unconditionally admitted that his conduct in the Ridley bankruptcy matter violated 8.4(b) (criminal conduct reflecting adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects) and 8.4(c) (conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). The parties have stipulated that these admitted violations may be deemed established by clear and convincing evidence, and the Board so finds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   3. Pursuant to the parties' stipulation, the charges of violating Rules 3.3 (candor toward the tribunal), 4.1(a) (false statement of material fact) and 8.4(d) (conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   4. The Board having accepted the parties' stipulation with respect to Respondent's violation of Rules 8.4(b) and 8.4(c), the hearing proceeded with the presentation of testimony and exhibits relevant to the four factors set forth in Rule 15(b)(3)(D), Wyo.R.Disc.Proc., for the purpose of determining the appropriate sanction for Respondent's misconduct. These factors are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (i) Whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the profession;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (ii) Whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (iii) The amount of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (iv) The existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   5. The Board finds that Respondent violated duties owed to the public, to the client and to the legal system, as evidenced specifically by Respondent's guilty plea in the federal criminal case. The Board finds that Respondent's violations of Rules 8.4(b) and (c) are violations of the lawyer's duties owed to the public and call into play ABA Standard 5.1, \"Failure to\n   Maintain Personal Integrity.\" The presumptive sanction for Respondent's misconduct pursuant to Standard 5.1 is a suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   6. The Board finds that Respondent acted knowingly and intentionally in failing to disclose the $25,000 specific bequest in Ms. Ridley's Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   7. The Board finds that Respondent's conduct created the potential for substantial injury to the client and the administration of justice, and that the client suffered actual harm as a result of Respondent's conduct in the form of delay, legal exposure and additional litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   8. The Board finds the following aggravating factors: (i) substantial experience in the practice of law and (k) illegal conduct by Respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   9. The Board finds the following mitigating factors: (a) absence of a prior disciplinary record; (d) timely good faith effort to make restitution or rectify consequences of misconduct; (e) a cooperative attitude toward these proceedings; (g) character and reputation (three district judges attested to Respondent's good character and competence as a lawyer); (k) imposition of other penalties or sanctions (jail time, suspension of practice in the bankruptcy court, adverse publicity and public humiliation); and (l) remorse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   10. The Board finds that the appropriate sanction for Respondent's conduct is a 90 calendar day suspension with credit for 45 days served in the Johnson County Detention Center, for a net suspension of 45 days. The Board finds that suspension for a longer period in this matter would be detrimental to the public at large, particularly those that Respondent has represented at reduced or no cost. The Board finds that there is no likelihood of future damage or risk to the public or administration of justice in general once Respondent has served the net, 45-day suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusions of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   11. Rule 8.4(b), Wyo.R.Prof.Cond., provides, \"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ... (b) commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   12. Rule 8.4(c), Wyo.R.Prof.Cond., provides, \"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ... (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   13. Rule 6(c)(4), Wyo.R.Disc.Proc. provides, \"When misconduct has been proved by clear and convincing evidence at a hearing, or misconduct has been established by default, [the BPR shall] issue a private reprimand or recommend an appropriate public discipline to the Court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   14. Rule 15(b)(3)(D), Wyo.R.Disc.Proc., lists the factors to be considered in determining lawyer sanctions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (D) In imposing a sanction after a finding of misconduct by the respondent, the BPR shall consider the following factors, as enumerated in the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (v) Whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the public, to the legal system, or to the profession;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (vi) Whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or negligently;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (vii) The actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (viii) The existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   15. The American Bar Association's Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (hereinafter referred to as the \"ABA Standards\") state, \"The purpose of lawyer discipline proceedings is to protect the public and the administration of justice from lawyers who have not discharged, will not discharge, or are unlikely properly to discharge their professional duties to clients, the\n   public, the legal system, and the legal profession.\" ABA Standard 3.0 lists the factors to be considered in imposing a sanction after a finding of lawyer misconduct, and mirrors the language of Rule 15(b)(3)(D), Wyo.R.Disc.Proc.:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (a) the duty violated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (b) the lawyer's mental state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   16.\n   <em>\n    The Duty Violated.\n   </em>\n   Respondent's violation of Rules 8.4(b) and (c), which essentially involve violation of a duty owed to the public, is addressed in ABA Standard 5.1, \"Failure to Maintain Personal Integrity.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Absent aggravating or mitigating circumstances, upon application of the factors set out in Standard 3.0, the following sanctions are generally appropriate in cases involving a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects, or in cases with conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   5.11 Disbarment is generally appropriate when:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (a) a lawyer engages in serious criminal conduct, a necessary element of which includes intentional interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, extortion, misappropriation, or theft; or the sale, distribution or importation of controlled substances; or the intentional killing of another; or an attempt or conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit any of these offenses; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (b) a lawyer engages in any other intentional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   5.12 Suspension is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in criminal conduct which does not contain the elements listed in Standard 5.11 and that seriously adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   5.13 Reprimand [i.e., public censure under Rule 9(a)(3) of the Wyoming Rules of Disciplinary Procedure] is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly engages in any other conduct that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation and that adversely reflects on the lawyer's fitness to practice law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   5.14 Admonition [i.e., private reprimand under Rule 9(a)(4) of the Wyoming Rules of Disciplinary Procedure] is generally appropriate when a lawyer engages in any other conduct that reflects adversely on the lawyer's fitness to practice law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   17.\n   <em>\n    The Lawyer's Mental State.\n   </em>\n   The preamble to the ABA Standards includes the following discussion regarding mental state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   The mental states used in this model are defined as follows. The most culpable mental state is that of intent, when the lawyer acts with the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result. The next most culpable mental state is that of knowledge, when the lawyer acts with conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of his or her conduct both without the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result. The least culpable mental state is negligence, when a lawyer fails to be aware of a substantial risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow, which failure is a deviation of a care that a reasonable lawyer would exercise in the situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   18.\n   <em>\n    The Potential or Actual Injury Caused by the Lawyer's Misconduct.\n   </em>\n   Under the ABA Standards, \"injury\" is defined as \"harm to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession which results from a lawyer's misconduct. The level of injury can range from `serious' injury to `little or no' injury; a reference to `injury' alone indicates any level of injury greater than `little or no' injury.\" \"Potential injury\" is defined as \"harm to a client, the public, the legal system or the profession that is reasonably foreseeable at the time of the lawyer's misconduct, and which, but for some intervening factor or event, would probably have resulted from the lawyer's misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   19.\n   <em>\n    Aggravating and Mitigating Factors.\n   </em>\n   ABA Standard 9.0, entitled \"Aggravation and Mitigation,\" provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   9.1 Generally\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   After misconduct has been established, aggravating and mitigating circumstances may be considered in deciding what sanction to impose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   9.2 Aggravation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   9.21 Definition.
