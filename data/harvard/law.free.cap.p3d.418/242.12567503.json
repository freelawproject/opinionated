Appellant filed this appeal to challenge the district court's December 19, 2017, \"Sentence on Probation Revocation and Order of Probation.\" In that order, the district court revoked and reinstated Appellant's probation, which stems from a felony conviction for driving while under the influence of alcohol.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-5-233\">\n    Wyo.

This Court subsequently ordered that, on or before May 18, 2018, Appellant would be permitted to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief specifying the issues he would like the Court to consider in this appeal. This Court further provided notice that, after the time for filing a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief expired, this Court would decide whether counsel should be allowed to withdraw and, if appropriate, make a final decision on this appeal. Appellant did not file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief or other pleading in the time allotted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   [\u00b63] Now, following a careful review of the record, the \"\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief\" submitted by appellate counsel, and the file, this Court finds that appellate counsel's motion to withdraw should be granted and the district court's December 19, 2017, \"Sentence on Probation Revocation and Order of Probation\" should be affirmed.
