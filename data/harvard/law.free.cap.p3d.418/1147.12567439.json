In December 2013, Todd became estranged from her friend, F.O., following a dispute over a \"dolly and pickaxe\" she had loaned him. In January 2014, F.O. telephoned Todd and asked her to come to his home to talk. During the visit, the two struggled over a gun that Todd had brought with her and, at another point, Todd broke the glass door on F.O.'s microwave by punching it. F.O. asked Todd to leave, and less than one minute after she left, a bullet penetrated his wall, shattering the glass of a picture frame. When deputies reviewed video footage captured by surveillance cameras that F.O. had installed on his property, they saw Todd had fired two shots as she rode by on a motorcycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 After leaving F.O.'s house, Todd went to the home of another friend, M.O., where deputies found and arrested her. During the arrest, Todd became argumentative, began hitting the partition and window of a patrol vehicle, and spit in a deputy sheriff's face. Upon release after her arrest, Todd admitted to M.O. that she had fired a gun in the air as she drove by F.O.'s house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Following trial, the jury found Todd guilty of two counts each of knowingly discharging a firearm at a residential structure, intentionally discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle at an occupied structure, and aggravated assault.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court sentenced Todd to a combination of consecutive and concurrent prison terms totaling 35.25 years.

Rule 609(a), Ariz. R. Evid., permits litigants to attack a witness's character for truthfulness with evidence of a criminal conviction. However, \"if more than 10 years have passed since the witness's conviction or release from confinement for it, whichever is later,\" admissibility is more narrowly restricted. Ariz. R. Evid. 609(b). Such evidence is admissible only if its probative value \"substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect,\" admission is \"supported by specific facts and circumstances,\" and the proponent gives the adverse party reasonable written notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"152565\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/205/334/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These requirements are \"consistent with the notion that a criminal conviction's probative value regarding a witness' credibility declines as it becomes more remote in time.\" Joseph M.

First, the offense was of low probative value because it occurred over ten years before M.O. testified and the record does not contain specific facts or circumstances indicating the probative value of that conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

Also, the record does not indicate Todd served the state with written notice of her intent to impeach M.O. with that conviction as required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 On appeal, Todd maintains the trial court abused its discretion because it did not conduct the balancing required by Rule 609(b) and did not set forth on the record the reasons for its ruling. Although the court did not explicitly balance the probative and prejudicial value of the prior conviction, it is apparent that the court considered the age of the offense and whether it was particularly probative of M.O.'s character for untruthfulness. Given the apparently low probative value of M.O.'s fifteen-year-old conviction and the reasonable risk of wasting time and confusing the issues, we cannot say the court abused its discretion by precluding Todd from this line of inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"666969\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/200/496/\">\n    200 Ariz. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 7-9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"666969\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/200/496/\">\n    29 P.3d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Sanitized Conviction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 Todd next complains the trial court erred in sanitizing F.O.'s prior felony convictions.

This is especially so considering emails in the record between the prosecutor and F.O.'s attorney discussing both whether the state would bring additional charges and whether F.O. intended to plead the Fifth Amendment in response to any questions about his pending charge. Although we do not determine the level of detail to which the jurors should have been privy, at a minimum, they were entitled to know not only that F.O. was facing a charge, but also to hear directly from F.O. whether his testimony was animated by a promise, hope, or expectation of leniency in his own case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1603079\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/117/122/#p125\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the court erred by entirely precluding Todd from impeaching F.O. with his potential motivations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 However, because reliable evidence corroborating F.O.'s testimony predated his need for leniency, the probative value of those charges was surely minimal, and any error in precluding this line of cross-examination was therefore harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Although F.O.'s testimony established Todd's charge for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, the record also establishes that F.O.'s statements at trial nearly duplicated statements he made well before charges had been filed against him; that is, before he had any need for leniency. In particular, F.O.'s statements at the time of the incident, captured on the 9-1-1 recordings, predate F.O.'s similar trial testimony that Todd had threatened him with a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 F.O. also testified regarding the charges arising from the shots Todd fired at his house. That testimony was corroborated by other evidence presented by the state: the 9-1-1 recordings confirm the fact and moment that shots were fired-less than a minute after Todd left by motorcycle. Furthermore, the video surveillance shows Todd leaving on a motorcycle and a motorcycle returning a minute later before two flashes are seen. Because F.O. had no motivation to fabricate at the time of his original statements to law enforcement, because his trial testimony closely tracked those statements, and because that testimony was strongly corroborated by direct and reliable evidence, no reasonable fact-finder would have doubted the substance of his testimony merely because he had acquired new charges in the interim for which he might have had a hope of leniency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jay Six Cattle Co.\n   </em>\n   , 88 Ariz. at 106,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"643127\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/88/97/#p106\">\n    353 P.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 The state's other civilian witness in the case was M.O., who testified that Todd had acknowledged firing shots from her motorcycle as she passed F.O.'s house. Todd sought to confront M.O. with the possibility that his testimony was motivated by a hope that the state would not file certain charges against him. Indeed, the record establishes that sheriff's deputies had seized a number of firearms from M.O.'s house after it burned down eight months before trial. And, before testifying and outside the presence of the jury, M.O. admitted he was therefore worried about being charged as a prohibited possessor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Accordingly, Todd argues that because the state could have brought prohibited-possessor charges against M.O., he may have believed he had a \"sword of Damocles\" hanging over his head, \"which could certainly influence his testimony.\" In view of his admission about being worried, M.O. had a potential motive to fabricate. That M.O. denied that his testimony was influenced by the worry of prosecution does not resolve the issue.

Thus, Todd should have been allowed to cross-examine him before the jury about that concern and whether it was motivating M.O.'s testimony.

In particular, as already mentioned, the video surveillance captured Todd\n   leaving F.O.'s house by motorcycle and, less than a minute later, showed the same, or a very similar, motorcycle driving past the house followed by two flashes-events contemporaneously described in the 9-1-1 recording. Furthermore, the caliber of spent bullets found in the home matched the caliber of the gun deputies seized from Todd's home. Finally, Todd admitted to a deputy after her arrest that she had argued with F.O. at his home. These facts all strongly corroborated M.O.'s testimony that Todd had told him she fired her gun as she rode past F.O.'s house, and the jury could not have reasonably doubted that she had done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 Furthermore, even without recourse to the improperly precluded line of questioning, the jury was confronted with issues regarding M.O.'s credibility, which further reduced the importance of the precluded impeachment testimony in the context of the overall case. In particular, M.O. frequently offered elusive answers and could not independently recall Todd's statements, despite having repeated them to the prosecutor less than a week before trial. Rather than suggesting he was cooperating in the hope of obtaining favorable treatment, M.O.'s evasive responses indicated otherwise. In view of the unique facts of this case, we can confidently say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to or affect the verdict.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648475\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/561/\">\n    210 Ariz. 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648475\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/561/\">\n    115 P.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Willits\n    </em>\n    Instruction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 Todd next complains the trial court should have granted her request for a\n   <em>\n    Willits\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   instruction because the state \"[l]ost [r]ecordings\" of her interview with a deputy and did not produce DNA\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   or fingerprint evidence from a gun deputies seized.
