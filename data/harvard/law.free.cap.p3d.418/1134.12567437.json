He approached Medina and detained him. During that process, Medina told the detective that he had a handgun in his waistband. At that time, Medina had been convicted of a felony and \"his right to possess or carry a gun or firearm had not been restored.\" Medina was convicted as described above and sentenced to an enhanced, presumptive prison term of ten years. This appeal followed.

The court disallowed the defense under Rule 15, Ariz. R. Crim.

Medina concedes the disclosure was untimely under this rule, but asserts preclusion was not warranted as a sanction, particularly given that his disclosure was of a newly discovered defense and was provided \"at least 7 days before trial,\" in accordance with Rule 15.6(c).

The use of the word \"imminent\" requires that the threat of injury be one that is immediate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 Here, Medina's fianc\u00e9e, V.D., would have testified that about a month prior to Medina's arrest, \"a man sitting on her car in a parking lot ... said: Tell Taz Guerro says what's up.\" The record before us suggests that Medina would have testified he was fleeing from the Mexican mafia and that he believed the statement to his fianc\u00e9e was a threat to his life. And, the state conceded at oral argument that police reports indicated Medina informed the arresting officer, albeit vaguely, that he felt threatened. But none of this evidence suggests that any such threats posed a risk of immediate injury. To the contrary, Medina was arrested carrying the firearm \"less than a month\" after his girlfriend's encounter with \"Guerro's\" messenger. Although Medina maintained during oral argument that the imminence of any potential injury should be a jury question, his argument necessarily implies that a defendant need only offer evidence suggesting a threat of\n   <em>\n    eventual\n   </em>\n   harm rather than immediate injury to secure an instruction. Because all threats imply a risk of eventual harm, such a conclusion would functionally erase the imminence element from our statute's definition of the necessity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 In the alternative, Medina contends that a defendant does not have to show evidence of \"every element\" of a justification defense to be entitled to an instruction. Even assuming arguendo this dubious proposition is correct, imminence is at the heart of the defense of necessity-without it, a necessity does not exist.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-417(A). Because Medina offered evidence sufficient only to support an inference that he might at some point be harmed and failed to present even the slightest evidence that the threat was immediate, the trial court did not err in precluding him from presenting the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Lastly, Medina contends that because the trial court precluded his proposed defense on the ground that he did not timely disclose it, he had no opportunity to comprehensively present the evidence that would\n   have shown an imminent threat. As Medina has correctly noted, he was not required to make a formal offer of proof because the court had \"ruled broadly that no evidence [was] admissible in support of the theory or fact which [he sought] to establish.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Kaiser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"620266\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/109/244/#p246\">\n    109 Ariz. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 246,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"620266\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/109/244/#p246\">\n    508 P.2d 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 (1973),\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peterson v.

But Medina overlooks that, in advance of trial, the state expressly challenged the factual sufficiency of Medina's necessity defense and sought preclusion for that reason. It did so in the same motion for preclusion based on late disclosure. This triggered a clear procedural opportunity for Medina to articulate those facts that would support the defense in advance of the court's ruling. Yet, in his response to the state's motion, Medina failed to do so. Instead, he stated only that his testimony at trial could \"provide additional details about the origin, specificity, and imminence of the threats on his life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 While we acknowledge that a defendant's testimony is sufficient to raise the issue of self-defense,\n   <em>\n    State v.

But we disagree with Medina that a court should be required to do so. A court properly precludes a defense if the defendant fails to show that there is any evidence to be introduced at trial in support of it.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pedroza-Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178661\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/240/114/\">\n    240 Ariz. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12178661\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/240/114/\">\n    377 P.3d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313 (trial court may limit opening statements \"which will not or cannot be supported by proof\"),\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Even assuming, without deciding, that the lack of such certification left the court without authority to consider precluding the defense as a disclosure sanction, that did not affect the court's subject matter jurisdiction over the case as a whole, and it did not affect the court's authority to preclude the defense on the wholly separate ground that it was not supported by the evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Although\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    concerned preclusion of a witness, rather than a theory of defense, its rationale applies with at least equal force in this context.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
