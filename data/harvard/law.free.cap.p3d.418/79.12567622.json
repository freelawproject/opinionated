We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    The Victim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 In early 2005, a seventeen-year-old girl (Victim) was making her way to a bus stop when Defendant approached her and exclaimed, \"You're perfect.\" After explaining that he represented a talent agency, he asked whether she might be interested in a modeling career. Victim was thrilled by the prospect. Upon Defendant's request, she immediately agreed to enter his car and accompany him to his office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Once they arrived, Defendant sat her down and informed her that there are \"things that models ... and famous people have to do to get where they are today.\" For instance, he told her that she would need to have her picture taken, \"with and without clothing.\" When Victim expressed concern that her parents might not approve, he urged her not to worry, saying he would smooth things over with them. He then asked her to return to his office in two days for her first photo shoot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 When Victim returned two days later, Defendant introduced her to a photographer, who proceeded to take \"some face poses.\" But after a short time, the photographer finished shooting, packed up, and left Victim alone with Defendant. Defendant then informed Victim that \"he needed to take his own pictures\" of her. Growing \"nervous,\" she told Defendant that she needed to leave. Defendant insisted that she stay, telling her that \"it was okay\" and that there were \"things\" that aspiring models \"need to do to get to the places they want to get to.\" He then \"pulled out some pictures of a young girl\" who he claimed had made it as a model with his help, and who he said was now \"in Paris.\" Victim acquiesced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Defendant then laid out a beach towel, turned on music, and retrieved some baby oil. Although he had wanted her \"all the way undressed,\" Victim refused to remove her bra and underwear. Defendant began rubbing the oil on Victim's legs, beginning near her ankles but inching gradually toward her pelvis. Feeling \"nervous and disgusted,\" Victim again stated that she wished to leave, but Defendant \"kept rubbing and ... telling [her] that it's going to be okay.\" After moving his hands \"closer and closer\" to Victim's genitals, he suddenly \"pulled back [her] underwear\" and placed his tongue on her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Victim immediately \"jumped up,\" \"pushed [Defendant] off\" of her, and demanded that she be allowed to leave. Defendant attempted to calm her, reiterating that \"there's things you got to do\" to make it as a model, but Victim remained firm. Seeing that she would go no further, he relented, and Victim headed for the door. As she did, Defendant told her that there was no \"need to talk to anybody\" about their meeting or to \"tell anyone\" what he had done.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Other Bad Acts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Lamentably, Victim's is not the only traumatic story relevant to the proceedings below. Three other women also appeared at Defendant's trial, and each testified that, between late January and early February of 2005, Defendant subjected her to some form of abuse. Because Defendant challenges the propriety of the trial court's decision to allow testimony from these three witnesses, we\n   must explain the substance of their testimony in some detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 R.G. was nineteen years old when Defendant stopped her in a grocery store aisle and began asking her questions about herself. She had observed Defendant \"just kind of wandering\" the aisles, noting that he carried neither a grocery basket nor any items from the store shelves. Then, turning a corner, she found that he was facing her \"head on.\" Defendant began peppering her with questions about her private life, such as whether she was in school and what activities she enjoyed. Upon learning she was involved in a youth-mentoring program, Defendant informed her that he was scouting talent for a \"kids program that was on TV\" and asked whether she would be interested in working with him. Excited at the thought of being on television, R.G. answered that she would be interested, whereupon Defendant insisted that they proceed directly to his office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Upon arriving at Defendant's office, his receptionist handed R.G. an application form, and as she sat down to complete it, she observed \"some posters on the wall of movies.\" Soon after she had sat down to fill out her form, Defendant interrupted her and asked that she join him in his office. Immediately after closing the door, Defendant began making \"inappropriate, strange comments,\" and he asked R.G. to take off her jacket. When she refused, he grabbed onto her hips, pulled her close to him, and then lifted up her top to expose her bra. R.G. left right away, \"in shock.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 On another occasion, Defendant invited R.O. and M.L. to his office for an interview. When they arrived, Defendant began by asking R.O. to follow him into a back room of the office. Once they were alone, Defendant asked R.O. to show him \"how [she] would act in a love scene.\" When she refused and stated she was \"happily married,\" Defendant \"grabbed [her] breasts.\" R.O. quickly pushed him away and, after struggling with the door for a moment, was able to leave the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 M.L. witnessed R.O. emerge from the back room and head \"right out the door\" without saying a word. Defendant appeared a few moments later and asked M.L. to follow him back into the room. Once the door was shut, and apparently locked, Defendant turned to M.L. and, without \"say[ing] anything,\" began \"lifting [her] shirt and grabbing [her] breasts.\" He told her that she \"had two minutes to take him\" or \"prove to him,\" and, taking hold of M.L.'s arm, he \"put [her hand] on his crotch.\" Screaming at Defendant to \"knock it off,\" M.L. then twisted away from Defendant and began \"banging on the door.\" At that point, Defendant opened the door and allowed her to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    The Proceedings Below\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 R.G., R.O., and M.L. immediately reported their encounters with Defendant to the police and, within months, the State charged Defendant with multiple counts of forcible sexual abuse. Victim, however, did not report Defendant's conduct until nearly two years later, in 2007. The prosecutor then lost contact with her, apparently because she changed residences several times. Finally, in 2010, a detective managed to locate Victim, and a few months later, the State charged Defendant with forcible sodomy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the meantime, the prosecution against Defendant for his conduct toward R.G., R.O., and M.L. ended in a plea bargain, with Defendant pleading no contest to three counts of sexual battery. He was placed on probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Soon after the State filed its forcible sodomy charge concerning Victim, the trial court appointed an attorney (Attorney A) to serve as defense counsel. Upon his appointment, Attorney A moved to dismiss the charge against Victim because of the prosecutor's alleged breach of Defendant's plea\n   agreement in the earlier case. The State, he argued, had agreed not to bring the instant charge in exchange for Defendant's no-contest pleas in the previous prosecution. The court denied the motion, observing that no such arrangement was mentioned in either the written plea agreement or the plea colloquy transcript. Defendant refused to accept the court's decision, and he and Attorney A reached an impasse over whether to file an interlocutory appeal of the order. Their disagreement appears to have been the catalyst for Attorney A's withdrawal as defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Upon Attorney A's departure, another attorney (Attorney B) entered an appearance as counsel for Defendant. At his first hearing, the trial court directed Attorney B to consider a motion Attorney A had filed just before withdrawing and decide whether it could be \"renew[ed]\" and argued in \"good faith.\" The motion, which Attorney A had not briefed, accused the State of violating Defendant's due process rights by maliciously delaying the institution of its forcible sodomy charge to gain a tactical advantage in the case. Attorney B did not file a memorandum in support of the motion prior to the court's next scheduled hearing, nor did he attempt to defend it at oral argument. Instead, he devoted his time at the hearing to opposing the State's notice of its intent to introduce rule 404(b) evidence at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court did not address the merits of the unbriefed motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Meanwhile, tensions once again began to rise between Defendant and his counsel. Citing his frustration with Attorney B's refusal to file the motions or advance the legal arguments he thought were best, Defendant began filing his own motions with the court. At a hearing following one such motion-which asserted, among other things, \"Prosecutorial Malfeasants\"-the court cautioned Defendant that it would not consider any pro se motions filed while he was represented by counsel, and it asked whether Defendant wished to represent himself instead. Defendant responded that he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 But Defendant continued to clash with Attorney B over how to proceed with his defense. Attorney B eventually withdrew, as did his replacement, Attorney C, after a \"shouting match\" in which Defendant demanded that Attorney C \"do [his] damn job.\" Attorney D entered an appearance following Attorney C's withdrawal, but she likewise found Defendant too difficult to work with. When Defendant petitioned the court to remove her, Attorney D explained that Defendant had pressured her to file several frivolous motions, including a motion to recuse the judge, and to mount a \"full-scale media campaign\" against the Salt Lake County District Attorney. Attorney D opined that, given his temperament, \"probably no one can work with [Defendant].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Following Attorney D's withdrawal, Defendant resolved to represent himself for the remainder of the case, with the assistance of standby counsel. Attorney E appeared on Defendant's behalf and informed the court of Defendant's decision. After Defendant acknowledged to the court that he understood the dangers inherent in self-representation, the court granted his request, and it further permitted Attorney E to remain on the case as standby counsel. Defendant then reaffirmed his desire to represent himself on several subsequent occasions, saying, for instance, that it would be \"totally unacceptable\" for Attorney E to take control of the case, and later introducing himself to the jury as \"lead counsel.\" Before trial, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss that contained several grounds for dismissal, and he also made an oral motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Significantly, he did not raise the malicious-delay-of-prosecution argument Attorney B had abandoned earlier in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 Defendant's case proceeded to trial. Defendant having been given an opportunity to oppose the use of rule 404(b) evidence at\n   an earlier hearing, the State successfully secured admission of the testimony of R.G., R.O., and M.L. during its case-in-chief. When the State rested, Defendant sought to put on his own witnesses. Although he had provided the prosecutor with a witness list-which included, among others, a judge, the Salt Lake County District Attorney, and the Utah Attorney General-Defendant had failed to provide a summary of his witnesses' proposed testimony or an explanation of why their testimony was relevant. Because Defendant's omissions were in contravention of two separate court orders, the court excluded the witnesses as a discovery sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 At trial, the jury found Defendant guilty of forcible sodomy, a first-degree felony. The court imposed a suspended prison sentence of five years to life and ordered a term of probation, pursuant to which Defendant would be required to serve one year in jail and complete 150 hours of community service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 Defendant raises three issues on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, he argues that his second attorney-Attorney B-deprived him of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. When an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is first raised on appeal, \"there is no lower court ruling to review and we must determine whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Tirado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341027\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/926/\">\n    2017 UT App 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341027\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/926/\">\n    392 P.3d 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 Second, Defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of R.G., R.O., and M.L. \"Appellate courts review a trial court's decision to admit character evidence and prior bad acts under an abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Vu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12345972\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/879/\">\n    2017 UT App 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12345972\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/879/\">\n    405 P.3d 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b622 Finally, Defendant argues that the court deprived him of his constitutional right to due process by excluding the testimony of his proposed witnesses at trial, thus effectively precluding him from presenting a \"meaningful defense.\" Our Supreme Court has recently stated that such issues present an appellate court with a mixed question of fact and law.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Mohamud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339784\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/395/133/\">\n    2017 UT 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339784\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/395/133/\">\n    395 P.3d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (addressing a defendant's claim that loss of potentially exculpatory evidence deprived him of due process). \"We review the legal question involved-whether due process was violated-for correctness. But the underlying factual determinations on which this legal question is based will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339784\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/395/133/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b623 Defendant argues that Attorney B deprived him of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel by \"fail[ing] to ... investigate, brief, or argue\" a motion that Attorney A had filed prior to his withdrawal. In this motion, Defendant contended that the State maliciously \"delayed prosecution\" of the forcible sodomy charge in the present case, violating his due process rights, and should have brought this charge in its first prosecution against him. He insists that the State made its decision \"to gain a strategic advantage.\" Defendant concedes that this issue is unpreserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 Ordinarily, \"to preserve an issue for appeal, the issue must be presented to the trial court in such a way that the trial court has an opportunity to rule on that issue.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Soules\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980344\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/286/25/\">\n    2012 UT App 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980344\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/286/25/\">\n    286 P.3d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). There are several exceptions to this general rule, including claims of ineffective assistance of counsel first raised by criminal defendants on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Allgood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12344800\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/400/1088/\">\n    2017 UT App 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12344800\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/400/1088/\">\n    400 P.3d 1088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This exception is warranted because it would be unreasonable to expect trial counsel to bring his or her own ineffectiveness to the attention of the trial court. We conclude, however, that the exception does not apply to the circumstances presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b625 After Defendant elected to represent himself, he had the opportunity to assert the due process argument that Attorney B had abandoned, but he failed to do so. Indeed, acting pro se, Defendant filed his own motion to dismiss but declined to include the due process argument among the various grounds for dismissal. Because nothing prevented Defendant from asserting this argument when he represented himself, he may not now complain about Attorney B's failure to pursue it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Such was the trial court's reasoning here. Taken alone, Victim's testimony might have been vulnerable to a charge of fabrication.

So while putting three women on the stand to share their accounts might have resulted in the presentation of some cumulative evidence, in this case the evidence was not\n   <em>\n    needlessly\n   </em>\n   cumulative. And the likelihood of the State convincing the jury that Victim was telling the truth increased in direct proportion with the level of similarity exhibited by the other women's narratives. Accordingly, while the three witnesses' accounts admittedly had some potential to create unfair prejudice, the remarkable level of similarity between the four women's narratives rendered their testimony exceedingly probative on the question of fabrication. The trial court scrupulously enumerated these similarities in its order permitting the State to introduce its rule 404(b) evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (1) the victims were all younger women;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (2) each victim had only a slight or casual acquaintance with [Defendant] with no prior romantic involvement;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (3) each of the victims was lured to [Defendant's] office under promises of employment or stardom;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (4) all four of the assaults occurred in settings where [Defendant] was isolated with the victim; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (5) in each instance, the victim verbally and/or physically resisted the assault after becoming aware of what was really happening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Given these compelling points, we would be hard pressed to conclude that the court abused its discretion in determining that the probative value of the women's testimony was substantially outweighed by the danger of\n   <em>\n    unfair\n   </em>\n   prejudice or\n   <em>\n    needless\n   </em>\n   cumulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b634 Finally, we note that the court further mitigated the danger of unfair prejudice by providing a limiting instruction, which cautioned that the three women's testimony was \"not admitted to prove a character trait ... or to show that [Defendant] acted in a manner consistent with such a trait.\" While \"[w]e have no delusion that a limiting instruction can undo serious prejudice, ...

Since we have already concluded that rebutting Defendant's fabrication defense was a permissible purpose under rule 404(b), we need not further address Defendant's probativeness argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Defendant has filed several motions and letters expressing his displeasure with his appellate counsel and asks us \"to remand his appeal to address conflict of appellate counsel.\" This is a bit of a surprise, as Defendant, after initially complaining of a lack of communication with counsel, filed a letter indicating that he had consulted with his appellate counsel and established \"channels of communication.\" Defendant now claims that appellate counsel did not thoroughly address his arguments, but he does not provide any explanation for what counsel should have done differently. We therefore deny his motions and decline to take any action on his letters.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
