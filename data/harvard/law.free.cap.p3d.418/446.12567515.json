But the court discussed\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , stated that the statute required \"actual consent before a warrantless search may be performed,\" discussed whether the statutory scheme was coercive, and yet made no mention of problems with the admonition-noting only that in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , \"other factors,\" including \"the defendant's age, his mental state, and the duration and circumstances of his detention,\" had rendered his consent involuntary.\n   <em>\n    Okken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041157\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/566/\">\n    238 Ariz. 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18-19 &amp; n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041157\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/566/\">\n    364 P.3d 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the court apparently read\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   not as concluding that consent premised on the admonition was insufficient, but as determining that consent pursuant to the admonition could be rendered involuntary by other factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23 Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Pena\n   </em>\n   , our dissenting colleague and another member of this panel rejected a claim that a \"warrantless breath test should have been suppressed under ... the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   No. 2 CA-CR 2013-0241, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 10. Citing\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , the decision identified various factors to determine voluntary consent, noting, as evidence supporting a finding of voluntariness, that Pena had been arrested before and that the officers had not displayed their weapons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. The court then considered that officers had advised Pena of his rights pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and given him the implied consent admonition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.

Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Figueroa\n   </em>\n   , a member of this panel rejected a claim of involuntary consent. No. 2 CA-CR 2012-0458, \u00b6\u00b6 18-21.

Specifically, the state maintained that Arizona's implied consent law, as described in the advisory, either \"constitutes an exception to the warrant requirement or satisfies the Fourth Amendment's requirement that consent be voluntary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 31 Our highest court bluntly characterized these arguments as \"unconvincing\" and clarified how it would view the application of the Fourth Amendment to DUI blood draws in future cases: \"We hold now that,\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   of \u00a7 28-1321, the Fourth Amendment requires an arrestee's consent to be voluntary to justify a warrantless blood draw.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 32 As the court's own language in that holding suggests, this upended prior understandings of blood draw procedure in Arizona DUI cases.

To such agencies, the holding of\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   should have raised a very prominent red flag. Until\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , the implied consent admonition had never been tasked with independently demonstrating a suspect's consent to a warrantless search under traditional Fourth Amendment voluntariness standards. Rather, as its content plainly demonstrates, the admonition had been designed to advise suspects of their legal obligation to submit to blood testing under Arizona's implied consent law-and to secure their acquiescence to that requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 35 After the supreme court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , any agency seeking to comply with evolving constitutional standards should have logically evaluated whether an advisory designed for one purpose (securing compliance with Arizona implied consent law) would coincidentally fulfill another (demonstrating voluntary consent to a search). For the reasons that follow, that inquiry would not have been reassuring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 36 First, in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court's reasoning plainly demonstrated that submission to the admonition would not alone suffice to demonstrate voluntary consent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n    232 Ariz. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064269\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/84/\">\n    302 P.3d 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the suspect, Tyler, had not voluntarily consented to the blood draw.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. It did so notwithstanding its recognition that Tyler had submitted to the admonition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. That admonition, it pointedly observed, had been both read and explained to him.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In short,\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   not only squarely held that state implied consent law did not constructively establish constitutionally valid consent; it unsurprisingly found that the tool designed for advising a defendant of that law, the implied consent admonition, was inadequate alone to secure voluntary consent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 37 Arguably, the court's reasoning went further than that. In a paragraph devoted to itemizing the reasons that \"sufficient evidence supports the juvenile court's finding that [the juvenile] did not voluntarily consent to the blood draw,\" the court apparently listed the officer's reading of the implied consent admonition as a factor showing\n   <em>\n    involuntariness\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In so doing, it chose to quote the sentence of the admonition most incompatible with the notion that its hearer could lawfully refuse consent: \"You are, therefore, required to submit to the specified tests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   I would submit that the implication of this paragraph-in the context of an express holding that plainly stated the implied consent law no longer sufficed to establish consent-should have caused law enforcement agencies some pause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 38 At minimum, the supreme court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   foreshadowed its ultimate holding in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   : that the implied consent admonition, far from establishing voluntary consent, actually constituted an assertion of lawful authority that \"effectively proclaimed that Valenzuela had no right to resist the search.\"\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    239 Ariz. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even assuming arguendo that\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   did not imply any conclusion that the admonition was overtly coercive, that case placed police agencies on plain notice that a defendant's acquiescence to the admonition would not\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   establish voluntary consent under traditional Fourth Amendment standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 39 Yet, the instant case demonstrates the Oro Valley Police Department persisted in using a procedure that relied exclusively on such acquiescence to secure consent to conduct blood draws.

But this intuitively appealing argument overlooks the express holding of\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , provides an incomplete assessment of the subsequent case law, and implicitly assesses good faith under an incorrect standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 45 To be sure, police agencies need not make legal assessments our courts have not made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kjolsrud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311727\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/319/\">\n    239 Ariz. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311727\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/319/\">\n    371 P.3d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (law enforcement agencies not \"expected to anticipate developments in the law\"),\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323217\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/410/\">\n    234 Ariz. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323217\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/410/\">\n    323 P.3d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But law enforcement does have a duty, if it later seeks to claim good faith, to adapt to our state supreme court's express holdings and the clear implications of the court's reasoning. As discussed,\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   unambiguously held that the state's implied consent law did not itself establish voluntariness-and it proceeded to find a lack of voluntariness notwithstanding Butler's acquiescence to the implied consent affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 46 The majority is correct that the\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   opinion did not expressly hold that the admonition was affirmatively coercive.

Subsequent to the holding in\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   , only two courts published opinions, unconstrained by stare decisis, that squarely addressed whether the language of the implied consent admonition was compatible with constitutionally valid consent: this division of the Arizona Court of Appeals (in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela I\n   </em>\n   ) and the Arizona Supreme Court (in\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela II\n   </em>\n   ). This court agreed with the state, in a divided decision, and held that it was compatible. The Arizona Supreme Court held unanimously that it was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 48 In all, five justices and one judge who addressed the issue held that the implied consent affidavit was incompatible with securing voluntary consent.
