Because the option was not sufficiently definite to support specific performance, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Offerman leased a home from Granada from August 2012 through August 2014. Granada's principal Gilbert Houseaux, a licensed real estate agent, acted as the agent for both Offerman and Granada in the transaction. Before the lease began, Offerman expressed an interest in purchasing the property, but Granada declined to sell at that time. The parties, however, added the following language to their lease agreement, which Houseaux drafted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   At the completion of the 24 month lease, the Tenant has the option to purchase [the] property ... for a sales price to be determined at that time by an independent appraiser acceptable to both Tenant and Landlord. (Terms and Conditions to be stipulated by both parties at such time).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   If the Tenant chooses to exercise his right to purchase this property at the end of the 2 year lease agreement, he shall be credited $200.00 of each $1900.00 of monthly rent paid towards purchase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The acceptable condition of the property when Tenant takes occupancy will be considered the condition Tenant agrees to accept at time of closing. All inspections and contingencies to be performed and satisfied prior to initial move-in. Property to be sold AS-IS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3 As the end of the lease term neared, believing this language gave him an option to purchase the property, Offerman told Houseaux he intended to exercise the option and asked Granada to name an independent appraiser. Receiving no response from Houseaux, Offerman retained an appraiser who valued the property at $240,000 and shared the appraisal with Granada. Granada did not name an appraiser or obtain an additional appraisal. Instead, Granada sent Offerman a draft purchase contract with a proposed $350,000 sale price, which Offerman rejected. Granada later notified Offerman it would not renew the lease, but Offerman remained in the house, paying the monthly rent of $1,900 for several months after the original lease term ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Offerman sued Granada for breach of contract, alleging Granada had failed to agree on an independent appraiser, refused to respond to Offerman's efforts to exercise the option by proposing a \"grossly inflated\" cash purchase price, and served him with an eviction notice rather than engaging in the purchase process. Offerman asked the court to (1) order Granada to \"specifically perform pursuant to the terms of the purchase option\"; (2) set the purchase price at $240,000; (3) compel Granada to open escrow at a title company of Offerman's choosing and to \"cooperate in the purchase process, the establishment and completion of escrow and the closing\"; and (4) order all of the $1,900 payments Offerman made after September 1, 2014, be applied toward the purchase price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 After a bench trial, the superior court found that Offerman was entitled to specific performance of the option. The court then held an evidentiary hearing \"on all issues\" relating to the form of judgment. Following that hearing, the court entered judgment ordering Granada to sell the property to Offerman for $240,000. The court also,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , named a title agency to hold escrow, determined the date for close of escrow, divided the various transaction fees between the parties, and ordered Granada to arrange for a property inspection. The court further directed the title agency to use the judgment \"as the escrow instructions\" and ordered Granada to \"convey clear and unencumbered fee simple title to the Property to [Offerman] at close of escrow.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6 Granada moved for a new trial, arguing the option could not be specifically performed because it lacked numerous material terms. The superior court denied Granada's motion, awarded Offerman attorney's fees and costs, and entered final judgment. Granada timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 Granada argues the superior court erred in ordering specific performance because the option did not contain sufficiently definite terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Offerman counters that his timely exercise of the option created an enforceable contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's interpretation of an agreement presents a question of law that we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United Cal.

Accordingly, the narrow issue we decide is whether the superior court properly ordered specific performance as a remedy for Offerman's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 Offerman argues specific performance was proper under Restatement \u00a7 87(2), which states that \"[a]n offer which the offeror should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance of a substantial character on the part of the offeree before acceptance and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding as an option contract to the extent necessary to avoid injustice.\" But Offerman cites no authority suggesting that action or forbearance based on an option whose terms are not definite, even if that action or forbearance is substantial, entitles a party to specific performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement \u00a7 87 cmt. e (explaining that \"[f]ull-scale enforcement of the offered contract is not necessarily appropriate\" in cases falling within the scope of Restatement \u00a7 87(2)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 Offerman also contends, under\n   <em>\n    Holaway v.

Our supreme court affirmed the superior court's order rejecting the plaintiff's claim, concluding the contract \"furnished ample means to identify the particular real property intended to be charged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"639117\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/90/289/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"639117\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/90/289/\">\n    at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"639117\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/90/289/\">\n    367 P.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court explained that although the option failed to describe the parcels of land subject to the option, the parties \"understood and agreed\" that the descriptions were to be determined by a plat prepared by the defendants' agent.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12\n   <em>\n    Holaway\n   </em>\n   does not help Offerman's position. First, nothing indicates that the remedy of specific performance was at issue in that case. Second, the agreed-upon mechanism for establishing a legal description in\n   <em>\n    Holaway\n   </em>\n   is significantly different from this case. Although Offerman and Granada agreed on a mechanism to establish price by selecting an \"independent appraiser,\" the selected appraiser had to be \"acceptable to both Tenant and Landlord.\" The parties failed to provide an alternative method for selecting an appraiser for the impasse that ultimately occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, the parties did not establish a means to determine the many other remaining undefined terms. For example, the option is silent as to the timing of payment or closing, terms of payment (earnest money, down payment, financing, and allocation of closing costs), condition of title upon conveyance, method of conveyance, and whether escrow would be handled by a title agency. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Holaway\n   </em>\n   , the option did not specify a method for determining these terms; instead, the option expressly deferred negotiating the \"Terms and Conditions\" to the end of the lease term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 The present case is more akin to the facts and analysis in\n   <em>\n    Christmas\n   </em>\n   . In that case, a landlord granted the tenant an option to purchase the leased premises for a set price during the first two years of the lease term and agreed to credit a portion of the tenant's rent payments toward the down payment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1471827\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/148/602/#p603\">\n    148 Ariz. at 602-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1471827\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/148/602/#p603\">\n    716 P.2d at 59-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, given the absence of essential terms in the option language agreed to by the parties, an order of specific performance was not a proper remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Power P.E.O., Inc. v.

The court also directed the title agency to use the judgment \"as escrow instructions,\" and ordered Granada to \"convey clear and unencumbered fee simple title\" to Offerman at close of escrow (on or before April 29, 2016). Of particular concern, some of the terms the court added are directly contrary to those specified in the parties' written agreement, including (1) directing Granada to arrange for a property inspection and provide disclosure statements and (2) permitting Offerman to cancel the contract if estimated repairs exceeded $5,000, even though the option stated the property would be sold in \"AS-IS\" condition as of the date Offerman took occupancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 On a claim for specific performance, it is not within the superior court's authority to flesh out an option agreement that lacks certainty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Savoca Masonry Co., Inc. v.
