The car-rental companies argued the surcharge is invalid both under Article IX, Section 14 of the Arizona Constitution and under the Dormant Commerce Clause implied by the United States Constitution. The tax court ruled the surcharge was invalid under the Arizona Constitution (but not under the Dormant Commerce Clause) and ordered a refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 2 For reasons explained below, we reverse the tax court's order granting summary judgment to the car-rental companies under the Arizona Constitution and direct entry of judgment in favor of the Arizona Department of Revenue (\"ADOR\") and AzSTA on that claim. We affirm the judgment in favor of ADOR and AzSTA under the Dormant Commerce Clause. Because we conclude the surcharge is not invalid under either constitutional provision, we reverse the tax court's refund order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 3 AzSTA is a \"corporate and political body\" the legislature created in 2000. Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 5-802 (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   By statute, AzSTA's \"boundaries\" are those \"of any county that has a population of more than two million persons,\" meaning (then and now) Maricopa County. A.R.S. \u00a7 5-802(A). The legislature directed AzSTA to build and operate a \"[m]ultipurpose facility\"-a stadium/events center-that could accommodate a professional football team, a college bowl game, and \"other sporting events and entertainment, cultural, civic, meeting, trade show or convention events [.]\" A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5-801(4) (2018) (defining \"multipurpose facility\"), -804(A) (2018), -807 (2018), -815 (2018) (powers of AzSTA). The legislature also granted AzSTA the power to contract to host the Super Bowl and college football national championship and playoff games and to build Major League Baseball spring-training facilities and youth and amateur sports and recreational facilities. A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5-808 (2018), -809 (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 4 Although AzSTA may charge for use of its facilities, it cannot levy taxes or assessments to build those facilities. A.R.S. \u00a7 5-802(C). Instead, the legislature authorized Maricopa County voters to approve taxes to fund AzSTA's construction projects.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . Among the taxes the legislature authorized voters to impose is the one challenged here: A surcharge on the gross proceeds of car-rental businesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839(B) (2018). Maricopa County voters approved the car-rental surcharge authorized by \u00a7 5-839 in November 2000, just months after the legislature established AzSTA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As authorized,\n   the surcharge is the greater of 3.25 percent \"of the gross proceeds or gross income from the business\" or $2.50 per car rental, payable by the car-rental business, not the customer. A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839(B)(1). If a customer rents a vehicle as a \"temporary replacement\" for another vehicle, the surcharge charged the car-rental company is a flat $2.50.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839(B)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 5 In August 2009, Saban Rent-A-Car, Inc. sought a refund of amounts it had paid under \u00a7 5-839, claiming the surcharge violated Article IX, Section 14 of the Arizona Constitution and the Dormant Commerce Clause implied by the U.S. Constitution. After ADOR denied the refund and that decision was upheld on administrative review, Saban challenged the ruling in the tax court, seeking injunctive relief and a refund on behalf of a class of all similarly situated car-rental companies. The court granted AzSTA leave to intervene as a defendant, then certified a class of all businesses that paid the surcharge from September 2005 through March 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 6 After discovery, the tax court ruled on cross-motions for summary judgment that although the surcharge did not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause, it was invalid under Article IX, Section 14 of the Arizona Constitution. The court ruled that ADOR would have to refund the tax to class members but could recoup the amount of the refund, over time, from AzSTA pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 42-5029(G) (2018). The court granted ADOR's motion for entry of judgment pursuant to Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), leaving the amount of the refund to be determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 7 We have jurisdiction of the parties' various appeals and cross-appeal from the Rule 54(b) judgment pursuant to Article VI, Section 9 of the Arizona Constitution and A.R.S. \u00a7 12-2101(A)(6) (2018).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Empress Beauty Supply, Inc. v.

Article IX, Section 14 of the Arizona Constitution.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 9 In relevant part, Article IX, Section 14 of the Arizona Constitution states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   No moneys derived from fees, excises, or license taxes relating to registration, operation, or use of vehicles on the public highways or streets or to fuels or any other energy source used for the propulsion of vehicles on the public highways or streets, shall be expended for other than highway and street purposes....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under this provision, revenues collected from certain \"fees, excises, or license taxes\" may be spent only for \"highway and street purposes.\" ADOR and AzSTA concede the surcharge\n   authorized by A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839 is an excise tax.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karbal v.

Therefore, if the surcharge is a tax \"relating to registration, operation, or use of vehicles on the public highways or streets,\" it violates Section 14 because its proceeds are spent on sports and recreation facilities, not highways and streets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 10 Relying on dictionary definitions, Saban argues the phrase \"relating to\" in Section 14 broadly sweeps up any tax \"having connection with or reference to the operation or use of vehicles on the public highways.\" To be sure, the phrase \"relating to\" is inherently indeterminate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v.

James,\n   <em>\n    Roderick Hudson\n   </em>\n   xli (New York ed., World's Classics 1980) ) (alteration in original omitted) ). For that reason, as Saban conceded at oral argument, without some limiting principle, Section 14 would encompass not only the car-rental surcharge at issue here but also a broad range of taxes that Arizona does not now funnel to highways-including retail sales or business privilege taxes on car sales, tire sales, car leases and car repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 11 Nevertheless, Saban cites\n   <em>\n    Landon v.

Section 14 expressly applies not only to excise taxes \"relating to registration, operation, or use of vehicles on the public highways or streets\" but also to such levies on \"fuels or any other energy source used for the propulsion of vehicles on the public highways or streets.\" Saban's broad construction of \"relating to\" would render the fuels provision irrelevant because fuel used to propel a vehicle is related to use or operation of a\n   vehicle. The same is true with respect to Section 14's express reference to \"registration.\" A vehicle's registration is related to its use on public streets; one may not legally drive a vehicle that is not registered. Because a broad interpretation of \"relating to\" deprives these other terms of any effect, the text of Section 14 itself reveals that we should not construe \"relating to\" in its broadest possible sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 14 Turning to the purpose of the provision, Section 14 was enacted in response to federal legislation that conditioned grants of federal highway funds on a state's assurance that revenue \"from State motor vehicle registration fees, licenses, gasoline taxes, and other special taxes on motor-vehicle owners and operators of all kinds\" would be used exclusively for highway purposes.

All of the non-fuel revenue sources the pamphlet stated would be encompassed by the constitutional provision-\"registration fees, unladen weight fees on common and contract motor carriers, and motor carrier taxes based on gross receipts\"-are prerequisites to the legal operation or use of a vehicle on a public highway or are triggered by such operation or use of a vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The surcharge authorized by A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839 lacks any such nexus to operation or use of a vehicle. Setting aside the fact that the surcharge is imposed on car-rental businesses, not on car-rental customers, it goes without saying that one need not rent a vehicle to legally operate or use that vehicle on an Arizona street; moreover, the surcharge is not triggered by operation or use of a vehicle, but rather by a rental transaction. Consistent with that conclusion, as stated, we infer that when voters enacted Section 14 in 1952 knowing that Arizona already imposed a statewide car-rental tax, they understood that Section 14 would not constrain the state's use of the proceeds of that existing revenue source.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 24 Our analysis also is informed by the principle that \"statutes must be given a sensible construction which will avoid absurd results.\"\n   <em>\n    Sherman v.

Acknowledging that Section 14's reach is not limitless, Saban asserts we should construe the provision so that it \"reach[es] no further than A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839.\" That contention disregards the duty of a court that is interpreting a legal provision to strive to discern and apply sound principles of general applicability in accordance with the intent of those who enacted the provision. Saban offers no principled rule of textual interpretation that would invalidate the surcharge here without invalidating many other vehicle-related taxes that Arizona never has earmarked for highway purposes-including taxes on motor vehicle sales and leases, auto repairs, sales of automobile-related\n   equipment and parts, and everything else that might be said to be \"related to\" use of motor vehicles. Voters approved Section 14 more than 60 years ago. We cannot ignore that so far as we know, at no time since then have they, the legislature or the executive branch seriously suggested that the provision might be or should be interpreted to sweep so broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 25 In sum, contrary to Saban's contention, Section 14's text, context and history teach that the voters did not intend it to encompass every tax or fee in any way \"relating to\" vehicles. Instead, we conclude Section 14 applies to a tax or fee that is a prerequisite to, or triggered by, the legal operation or use of a vehicle on a public thoroughfare. By that reasoning, we hold it does not apply to the surcharge enacted pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

According to the evidence offered on summary judgment and in the public record, the measure was proposed by a gubernatorial task force based on a report titled, \"Arizona Tourism Retention and Promotion.\" According to the report, although the task force's original mission was to study how to pay for a new stadium to house the Arizona Cardinals and to maintain the Fiesta Bowl's \"status as a 'Top-Tier' bowl,\" after considering \"additional threats to the State's tourism tax base,\" the task force broadened its mission \"to include the protection and promotion of Arizona's tourism industry and Cactus League[,] and directed that any capital finance plan to build a stadium also include resources to promote tourism retention.\" The report asserted that a new stadium would generate $800 million annually and that Arizona would not be allowed to host another Super Bowl without a new stadium. The report also stated that $200 million in annual revenues generated by the Cactus League were at risk because other warm-weather cities were offering new spring-training facilities to lure Major League Baseball teams away from Arizona. Pursuant to the Governor's reported directive \"that the funding package minimize the impact on the average Arizona resident,\" the task force estimated that under the legislation it proposed, 85-90% of the car-rental and hotel assessments would be paid by visitors to Arizona.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 43 At the sole legislative committee hearing on the bill that authorized AzSTA and its funding sources, members of the Governor's\n   task force spoke on behalf of the measure, as did representatives of the Arizona Cardinals, the Fiesta Bowl and the Cactus League. The committee also heard words of support from the Arizona Office of Tourism, the Valley Hotel &amp; Resort Association and from a representative of Enterprise Leasing, a car-rental company that has opted out of the present class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 44 At the urging of a lawmaker who cited a desire to minimize the bill's \"impact to residents,\" a House committee amended the proposed legislation to explicitly exempt vehicle rentals to Arizonans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.B. 1220, 44th Leg., 2d Reg.

The statements in that case were made in support of the challenged law; the comments by the Arizona lawmakers concerned an amendment-an exemption for Arizona residents-that the legislature ultimately rejected. We cannot conclude a statute that is neither discriminatory on its face nor in its effect is rendered unconstitutional simply because lawmakers considered and dismissed a protectionist amendment at some point in the legislative process. Nor is it proper to impute protectionist intent to legislators who correctly inform their peers of the constitutional limits to their power.\n   <em>\n    See also generally\n   </em>\n   Julian Cyril Zebot,\n   <em>\n    Awakening A Sleeping Dog: An Examination of the Confusion in Ascertaining Purposeful Discrimination Against Interstate Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Minn.%20L.%20Rev.%201063\">\n    86 Minn.

In the middle of the second page of the 22-page pamphlet, voters were told that \"the surcharge on car rentals targets visitors to the State (and includes an exemption for 'replacement vehicles' for vehicles undergoing repair or similarly unavailable on a temporary basis).\" We often look to election materials to discern the purpose of a voter-approved law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . But the language Saban cites is only one sentence in a lengthy document that broadly describes the purposes of the surcharge-to promote tourism; to build a \"multipurpose facility\" for professional football, college bowl games and other events, including college basketball tournament games and trade shows and concerts; to build and renovate Cactus League facilities; and to develop youth and amateur sports and recreational facilities. Guided by the Supreme Court's demonstrated reluctance to strike down a law based on isolated statements evidencing protectionist motives, we are not persuaded that the statement Saban cites proves discriminatory intent sufficient to invalidate the surcharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 47 In addition, Saban points to the Governor's task force report and comments by task force and AzSTA members to the effect that the surcharge was created so that visitors to Arizona would pay most of the cost of the new AzSTA-owned facilities. Assuming for purposes of argument that these non-legislative statements may bear on the issue, they merely highlight that the facilities to be built with the surcharge were intended to spur tourism and its resulting positive effects on the Arizona economy. As noted, proponents of AzSTA and the surcharge argued that the new facilities would attract visitors to the state, who would spend large amounts not only on rental cars but on hotels, food and beverage and other recreational activities. Saban cites no authority for the notion that the Dormant Commerce Clause is offended by a tax on tourism activities when the proceeds of the tax are used to build\n   facilities to attract tourists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the car-rental surcharge funds construction of facilities that benefit non-residents who visit Arizona to attend events at those facilities, we are not persuaded that the comments Saban cites are anything other than legitimate discussion about whether services those non-residents purchase should be taxed to fund those facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 48 In sum, A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839 and the resulting car-rental surcharge are not discriminatory on their face; nor do they cause any discriminatory effects on interstate commerce. Finally, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that a state tax that is non-discriminatory on its face and in its effect may be invalid solely based on a discriminatory purpose, Saban has not demonstrated that the challenged surcharge has a discriminatory purpose that violates the Dormant Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 49 We conclude that the car-rental surcharge authorized under A.R.S. \u00a7 5-839 is not invalid under Article IX, Section 14 of the Arizona Constitution, and reverse the tax court's ruling on summary judgment to the contrary, including its award of attorney's fees and costs. We affirm the superior court's ruling that the surcharge is not unconstitutional under the Dormant Commerce Clause. Accordingly, we vacate the superior court's refund order, direct entry of judgment in favor of ADOR and AzSTA and remand for any further required proceedings consistent with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Absent material revision after the relevant date, we cite the current version of a statute or rule.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    This court already has denied two challenges to the tax.
