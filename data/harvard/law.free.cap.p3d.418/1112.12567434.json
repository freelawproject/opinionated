Consequently, the respondent judge did not err in denying petitioner Nikolas Crosby-Garbotz's\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   motion to dismiss the underlying criminal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The following facts are either undisputed or established by the record before us. Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 13-3623(A)(1), Crosby has been charged with abusing his daughter, C. She was born prematurely in February 2016 and remained in the hospital for almost two weeks after her birth. On July 5, 2016, when C. was approximately five months old, Crosby called 9-1-1 and stated she was unresponsive and appeared to be having a seizure. Paramedics transported C. to the hospital, where doctors determined she had a subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhaging in both eyes, and retinoschisis, or splitting of the layers in the eye. C. had no external injuries, skull fractures, or other signs of physical trauma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 The Arizona Department of Child Safety (DCS) took temporary custody of C. and filed a dependency petition, alleging that Crosby had abused her, based on the definition of abuse in A.R.S. \u00a7 8-201(2), and that C. was dependent pursuant to \u00a7 8-201(15)(a)(i) or (iii). The dependency hearing began in November 2016 and concluded in February 2017, after eleven sessions. At the hearing, Crosby testified that since she was about three months old, C. had suffered \"recurrent, but intermittent and persistent bouts of irritability and lethargy\" and periods during which she \"would become inconsolable,\" and that there were \"multiple instances of projectile vomiting.\" He stated that on the morning in July, she had been \"crying\" and \"fussy\" and then had a seizure in his arms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 DCS and Crosby each presented two medical experts during the hearing. DCS's experts opined that C.'s injuries were not accidental and were the result of abuse, most likely \"Shaken Baby Syndrome\" (SBS). Crosby's experts, on the other hand, testified SBS has been discredited as an explanation for the kinds of injuries suffered by C. They opined C. could not have sustained her injuries as a result of shaking. Further, they opined that, other than the hematoma, there were no signs of abuse or trauma, and, in any event, there was no evidence C. had been shaken vigorously, such as bruising or neck trauma. Crosby's experts testified it would have been impossible for C. to have sustained a head injury of the kind alleged without some additional injury. They surmised that given C.'s medical history, which included premature birth and previous symptoms of vomiting and lethargy, the more likely explanation was that she had a dormant or chronic subdural hematoma, perhaps caused by viral encephalitis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In March 2017, the juvenile court issued an under-advisement ruling in the dependency case, concluding DCS had not sustained \"its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that ... Crosby inflicted physical injury, impairment of body function, or disfigurement to\" C. The court found the evidence Crosby had presented \"controverts or sufficiently calls into question the State's medical position that [C.]'s injuries were sustained only as a result of being violently shaken by the Father,\" positing it was more likely C. had a chronic subdural hematoma that was aggravated when she bumped her head on her crib. The court also concluded DCS had not sustained its burden of showing the mother had neglected C. by failing to protect her, \"[a]s the Court has found that it is more likely than not that [Crosby] did not injure\" C. The court therefore dismissed the dependency petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 In December 2016, before the dependency case had concluded, the state charged Crosby with child abuse under \u00a7 13-3623(A)(1). In presenting the charge to the grand jury, a police detective testified Crosby had been caring for then-five-month-old C. while his wife, C.'s mother, was at work, and he had called 9-1-1 to report C. was\n   unresponsive and had shown seizure-like behavior. The detective testified medical tests had revealed C. had a subdural hematoma, \"a type of brain bleed, ... extensive retinal hemorrhaging in both eyes, as well as retinoschisis.\" He stated, \"[P]er doctors, retinoschisis is from a very significant force, such as a high speed motor vehicle accident, multiple skull fractures from a crushing-type injury, a fall from a significant height or abusive head trauma.\" He added that C. did not have any external injuries and did not appear to have a bleeding disorder, but that Crosby had admitted he bounced her up and down on his chest when she became fussy, but denied he had shaken her. The detective informed the grand jury C. was still under the care of a neurologist and an ophthalmologist but it was unknown whether she would suffer permanent vision impairment. The grand jury returned an indictment on the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Crosby filed a motion to remand the case to the grand jury for a new finding of probable cause, pursuant to Rule 12.9, Ariz. R. Crim. P. After a hearing, the respondent judge denied the motion in May 2017. Crosby then filed a motion to dismiss the charge based on collateral estoppel, arguing the state could not relitigate the issue of whether he had abused C. The respondent denied the motion after a hearing in August. In this special action, Crosby challenges the denial of both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Special-Action Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The denial of a motion to dismiss a prosecution is an interlocutory order not subject to direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Nowell v.

Ordinarily, the existence of a remedy by appeal weighs against accepting special-action jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R.P. Spec. Act. 1(a), but, in our discretion, we may nevertheless review the denial of a motion to dismiss in a special action when there are other reasons for accepting jurisdiction, such as when the issue raised is a pure question of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

The question whether Crosby had abused C. by shaking her, and thereby inflicted the injuries she sustained, was litigated in the dependency action. DCS and Crosby presented the testimony of their respective experts and other witnesses, including a DCS investigator, other DCS personnel, and therapists. Both parents testified, and records and reports, including medical records, were admitted. In its under-advisement ruling, the juvenile court not only made clear that DCS had failed to sustain its burden of proving the allegations of the dependency petition by a preponderance of the evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-844(C) ; it also found the evidence showed it was \"more likely than not\" that Crosby did not injure C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 The last element of collateral estoppel requires that the subsequent proceeding be between \"the same parties or their privities.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

Crosby argues that the state was a party to the dependency proceeding, albeit through DCS, represented by the Arizona Attorney General, and that it is also the prosecuting entity in this criminal proceeding brought by the Pima County Attorney. He points to the supervisory relationship between the attorney general and the county attorney, arguing this demonstrates they are not distinct parties. In the criminal proceeding and this special action, however, the state insists it is not the same party as DCS. It argues that the counties independently prosecute criminal proceedings whereas the attorney general represents the various departments and distinct political subdivisions of the state. The state also asserts counties have no authority in dependency proceedings and DCS has no authority in criminal prosecutions. The disposition of this special action, however, does not require us to resolve the question of mutuality or privity of parties. Like the majority of other jurisdictions that have addressed the applicability of collateral estoppel in this context, we find compelling reasons not to preclude Crosby's criminal prosecution on the basis of the ruling in the dependency case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 As previously noted, Crosby relies on the California Court of Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Lockwood\n   </em>\n   in support of his argument that a finding in a dependency proceeding should be given preclusive effect in a subsequent criminal prosecution for the same conduct. We agree with Crosby that\n   <em>\n    Lockwood\n   </em>\n   is not meaningfully distinguishable from the case before us. There, the juvenile court had dismissed a dependency petition against the parents based on the same facts that gave rise to a charge of felony child abuse.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20785\">\n    206 Cal.Rptr. at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We are particularly concerned that permitting the doctrine to apply in this context could cause the state to forego dependency proceedings because of the possibility it would be precluded from relitigating the underlying issues in a criminal proceeding, with the potential effect of further endangering children. Similarly, to avoid application of collateral estoppel, the state might be compelled to present its entire criminal case in the dependency proceeding, which could unnecessarily complicate and delay the adjudication, placing an undue burden on the juvenile court system. In sum, the distinction between juvenile and criminal proceedings would be impermissibly blurred, and the state could be forced to shift its focus from the best interest of the child, which includes efforts to preserve and reunify the family, to establishing that a criminal act was committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 29 Finally, we decline to adopt a case-by-case approach to claims of collateral estoppel arising from decisions in dependency actions.
