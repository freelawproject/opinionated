(\"Zumar\") and (2) denial of its motion to add counterclaims.

In 2013, NPS hired Caymus to provide and install road signs at Grand Canyon National Park. The contract price was $292,300. Caymus was prepared to bond the project, but NPS's representative told Caymus a bond was not required because\n   the contract was a service contract, not a construction contract. Caymus hired Zumar, a supplier of traffic signs and related highway safety products with offices in Arizona, California, and Washington, to supply the sign panels. Zumar quoted $92,793.60 for the job; Caymus accepted the quote and agreed to Zumar's credit application, which provided that Caymus would pay according to the terms of sale stated on Zumar's invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 In March 2014, Zumar delivered sign panels to the job site; NPS raised immediate concerns about defective and missing panels. Thereafter, the parties and NPS had ongoing discussions regarding completion of the sign panels work. On June 30, though, Caymus submitted a pay application to NPS, certifying the sign panels line item was 100% completed. In total, Caymus requested and received $98,800 from NPS for the sign panels scope of work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Zumar invoiced Caymus in full for the sign panels. Caymus paid Zumar $59,278.10, but withheld $35,632.33 pending Zumar's satisfactory performance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To resolve the parties' dispute, in October 2014, Zumar's counsel proposed the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Caymus has not facilitated a discussion with NPS to attempt to resolve this matter, NPS has contacted Zumar, and proposed to release payment through Caymus to Zumar of the principal amount of $30,632.33 now, with the final principal amount of $5,000.00 to be paid by NPS through Caymus to Zumar upon Zumar's completion of the items on the enclosed punch list. This proposed resolution is acceptable to Zumar, and we understand NPS has or will contact you to seek your consent. Of course, both payments need to be by joint check, executed first by Caymus, to ensure that Zumar actually receives payment as intended by NPS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To this end, Bryan Gregory, a contracting officer with NPS, asked Randy Ringleb, Caymus' president:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Can you provide the status of payments to Zumar? Zumar has expressed a desire to perform needed repairs, but had concerns about payment. Understandably, there may be some amount that is withheld until completion. However, I would encourage you to continue to work with Zumar to get things wrapped up, particularly since we are so near. If you have not already made plans for an interim payment, you may consider doing so to keep things moving in a positive direction. The Government has withheld less than 10% of the contract value. Perhaps you could take a similar approach?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Caymus would not agree to the proposal absent agreement by Zumar to warranty the sign panels or assurance from NPS that it would accept them in as-is condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 5 In December 2014, NPS submitted to Zumar and Caymus a punch list of items required to complete the sign panels work. Several months later, NPS sent a Cure Notice, alleging that twenty-two sign panels needed repair and three were missing. Caymus completed the work at a cost of $15,000. NPS withheld final payment to Caymus of $35,367.96 pending resolution of a dispute based in part on the sign panels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 In the meantime, in September 2014, Zumar brought this breach of contract action against Caymus, seeking damages of $35,632.33. The matter proceeded to compulsory arbitration. Zumar prevailed, and Caymus appealed. Zumar moved for summary judgment, arguing Caymus violated state and federal prompt pay laws, which constituted a material breach of the subcontract. The superior court agreed and granted the motion. While the motion was pending, Caymus moved to add counterclaims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, and (in the alternative) unjust enrichment. The court denied\n   that motion and Caymus' subsequent motion for reconsideration. The court entered a final judgment and Caymus timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I.

Caymus is a \"contractor\" under \u00a7 32-1129.02 only in relation to \"a direct contract with\n   <em>\n    an owner\n   </em>\n   to perform work under a construction contract.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 32-1129(A)(2) (emphasis added). Zumar is a \"subcontractor\" under \u00a7 32-1129.02 only in relation to a \"direct contract with a contractor ... to perform a portion of the work under a construction contract.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 32-1129(A)(6). The Act is framed around the central concept of \"owner,\" as defined by the Act, and the flow of payments from owner to contractor and down the line; contractor-subcontractor disputes cannot be solely separated from that framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 12 Section 32-1129(A)(4) lists the entities included in the definition of owner: person; firm; partnership; corporation; association or other organization; or any combination of those previously listed. A.R.S. \u00a7 32-1129(A)(4). Absent from the definition is any form of government, government agency, or political subdivision. Zumar asks this Court to find the Act applies in any context; regardless of the owner. Not only is \"owner\" integral to the statutory definition of \"contractor,\" and therefore to \"construction contract,\" it is integral to the central purpose of the Act. The Act requires progress payments from the owner to contractor, A.R.S. \u00a7 32-1129.01, subjects the contractual rights of the owner regarding withholding payment to the provisions of the Act, A.R.S. \u00a7 32-1129.02(G), and grants to contractors and subcontractors termination rights against an owner, A.R.S. \u00a7 32-1129.04. Contractor and subcontractor rights and responsibilities under the Act depend upon the contractual relationship between the owner and contractor. Section 32-1129(A) not only fails to include any government or governmental unit in the definition of \"owner,\" the Act's subsections placing contractual obligations upon owners and granting rights to contractors and subcontractors against owners cannot be understood to apply to the federal government or any of its agencies.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec.

Reading the provision as Zumar wishes would gut the Act of its central framework and purpose. If we applied Zumar's reading of \"notwithstanding\"-finding the provision allowed subcontractor-contractor suits regardless of the existence of an owner as defined-we would not only divest those defined terms in \u00a7 32-1129.02(A)(1) of their intended meaning prescribed by the legislature, but would necessarily interpret \u00a7 32-1129.02(A)(1) to apply to contracts involving the state government and its political subdivisions, which is expressly prohibited in \u00a7 32-1129.06.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 We find Zumar's proposed reading of \"notwithstanding other provisions\" in contradiction\n   with the Act's own language and its central framework.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 This decision does not leave subcontractors without a remedy, see\n   <em>\n    Stonecreek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5543838\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/216/36/#p39\">\n    216 Ariz. at 40, \u00b6 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5543838\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/216/36/#p39\">\n    162 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   679 ; we simply hold that \"owner\" does not include the federal government or its agencies, and thus hold the Act inapplicable when the contract at issue is a federal work project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B.
