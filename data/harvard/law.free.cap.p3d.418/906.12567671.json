Wulf contends that each factual allegation giving rise to a claim challenging an\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause must be supported by probable cause. Because A.R.S. \u00a7 14-2517 requires only that the beneficiaries' claim-and not each of the underlying factual allegations-be supported by probable cause, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 2 Each of the Trusts contain an\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In October 2013, beneficiaries of\n   the Trusts, Debora Barrow and Kathi Wulf (\"Beneficiaries\"), petitioned to remove Wulf as trustee. Beneficiaries amended the petition in April 2014 to add an alleged violation of APSA. Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 46-456 (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Beneficiaries asserted seven factual allegations of financial exploitation in support of their APSA claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) $200,000 withdrawn from a bank account, which is unaccounted for;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) proceeds from the sale of real property owned by the Trusts amounting to $120,790.64 are unaccounted for;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) $20,000 withdrawn from a bank account, which is unaccounted for;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (4) A $11,351.52 purchase and installation of solar panels;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (5) Wulf opened a bank account and added the vulnerable adult to the account;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (6) A $10,990.14 check was issued from the Trusts to Wulf Urethane, Inc.;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (7) A $7,000 check issued to a law firm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 3 Wulf counterclaimed seeking to enforce the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clauses of the Trusts. Beneficiaries then filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking to invalidate the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause, but the superior court denied the motion, ruling that the Beneficiaries' complaint \"trigger[ed] the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   provisions of the three trusts.\" The superior court also ruled that there were disputed issues of material fact regarding whether Beneficiaries had probable cause, as required by A.R.S. \u00a7 14-2517, for their APSA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 4 The superior court ordered a bifurcated trial to determine whether there was probable cause for the Beneficiaries' APSA claim. Before the bifurcated trial, this court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    In re Shaheen Trust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032941\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/498/\">\n    236 Ariz. 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032941\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/498/\">\n    341 P.3d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (App. 2015). In a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , Wulf contended that under\n   <em>\n    Shaheen\n   </em>\n   , all of Beneficiaries' allegations must be supported by probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 5 After oral argument, the superior court determined that \"the parties and the Court have always treated the Beneficiaries' claim that triggers the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause as one claim[.]\" Therefore, the court ruled that the Beneficiaries \"need only establish 'probable cause' for [the APSA claim as a whole] and not for each and every allegation that may support that claim.\" Alternatively, and in the event\n   <em>\n    Shaheen\n   </em>\n   would bar Beneficiaries' claim, the superior court determined that\n   <em>\n    Shaheen\n   </em>\n   did not retroactively apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 6 After an evidentiary hearing, the court ruled that \"most of the contested allegations ... do not give rise to 'probable cause,' \" but found that Beneficiaries, \"by the thinnest of margins,\" had shown probable cause for their APSA claim. At Wulf's request, the court entered partial final judgment on that decision pursuant to Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 7 Wulf timely appealed the superior court's ruling. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 8 Wulf argues that the superior court erred in its application of\n   <em>\n    Shaheen\n   </em>\n   and finding that it does not apply retroactively. Whether the superior court erred in its interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Shaheen\n   </em>\n   is a question of law, which we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Enter.

The beneficiaries, however, did not appeal the characterization of their allegations as claims.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In\n   response, the trustee filed a counter-petition requesting the beneficiaries' interest in the trust be forfeited pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 499-500, \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032941\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/498/\">\n    341 P.3d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The superior court denied the trustee's counter-petition, holding that the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause was unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . This court reversed, holding that the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause was enforceable, and \"there must have been probable cause for each of the [beneficiaries'] nine claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 500, \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032941\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/236/498/\">\n    341 P.3d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Citing public policy, including the cost of litigation and the donative intent of the transferor, this court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   When a party brings nine claims against a trustee, as the [beneficiaries] have done here, that party litigates nine different challenges, and, accordingly, contests nine separate claims. If these nine claims had been presented in nine separate petitions, there would be no question that probable cause would have to support each claim to avoid forfeiture.

On the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Shaheen\n   </em>\n   held that all claims must be supported by probable cause, but did not apply that same standard to their underlying allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 11 Interpreting\n   <em>\n    Shaheen\n   </em>\n   as requiring parties to support each factual allegation with probable cause is contrary to A.R.S. \u00a7 14-2517. This statute provides that an\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause is unenforceable \"if probable cause exists for\n   <em>\n    that action\n   </em>\n   .\" A.R.S. \u00a7 14-2517 (emphasis added). Ordinarily, an action is \"any matter or proceeding in a court, civil or criminal.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 1-215(1) (2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Semple v.

If the Legislature intended to require probable cause exist for each allegation, rather than the entire suit, it would have explicitly said so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orca Commc'ns Unlimited, LLC v.

However, a plain language interpretation of the word \"claim\" further evidences the fact that Wulf misconstrues\n   <em>\n    Shaheen\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 13 Neither APSA nor Title 46, chapter 4 of the Arizona Revised Statutes defines \"claim.\" Therefore, we turn to the ordinary meaning of the word and look to the dictionary for guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DBT Yuma, L.L.C. v.

On the other hand, an allegation can mean something quite different, such as a \"declaration that something is true; esp., a statement, not yet proved, that someone has done something wrong or illegal.\" Black's Law Dictionary 81 (8th ed. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 14 Here, Beneficiaries asserted as a claim a violation of APSA, and sought financial and equitable remedies. The APSA violation was the claim because it provided the statutory grounds for the relief sought by Beneficiaries. The violation of APSA was based on allegations that Wulf misused or appropriated over $370,000 worth of the Trusts' property. The allegations of financial exploitation were just that-allegations. They were declarations of Wulf's wrongdoing, giving rise to Beneficiaries' APSA claim. And as the superior court noted, the court and the parties \"always treated the Beneficiaries' claim that triggers the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   clause as one claim-an [APSA] claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 15 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the superior court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Two of the\n    <em>\n     in terrorem\n    </em>\n    clauses are identical, and the third has the same effect as the other clauses. An\n    <em>\n     in terrorem\n    </em>\n    clause, or no-contest clause, is a provision that threatens to dispossess any beneficiary who challenges the terms of a trust or will. Black's Law Dictionary 1073 (8th ed. 2004). An\n    <em>\n     in terrorem\n    </em>\n    clause is invalid as a matter of law if probable cause supports the beneficiaries' claim challenging the trust or will.
