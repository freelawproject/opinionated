(\"Mother\") appeals from the severance of her parental rights to I.R. and J.R. We conclude that the record supporting the court's best-interests determination is insubstantial. We therefore vacate the severance order and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 I.R. is the biological child of Mother and Esdras R. (\"Father\"), and J.R. is Mother's biological child from a previous relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 It is undisputed that Mother was away at work and I.R. was in Father's care on May 7, 2015. That day, Father sent Mother a Facebook message that I.R. had scratched his face while rolling around. That night, after Mother discovered the severity of I.R.'s injuries, Mother and Father argued because Father would not allow Mother to take I.R. to the hospital. Father then left the house for a few hours, but Mother failed to take I.R. to the hospital while he was away. The next morning, Mother asked her sister and cousin to take I.R. to the hospital while she was at work. Her sister asked Father if she could take I.R. to Chuck E. Cheese. Father agreed. Mother's sister and cousin then took I.R. to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Hospital staff determined that I.R. had a healing rib fracture, a right-tibia fracture, a possible left-femur fracture (ultimately ruled out), and multiple bruises. The staff also observed bruises on J.R. They contacted the Department of Child Safety (the \"Department\") because they suspected abuse. Police found that though Father had a criminal history, there were no police or criminal records involving Mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Department provided services to Mother and Father, and in early 2016 the parenting plan changed from reunification to severance and adoption. Mother complied with or successfully completed all services provided by the Department throughout this case, but in June 2016, Mother and Father were providing conflicting information about whether they were still dating. In July 2016-fourteen months after I.R.'s hospital admission-Mother completed a psychological evaluation, which diagnosed her with multiple drug dependency and personality disorders and concluded her prospects to successfully parent the children were \"poor\n   at best\" and would continue to be so for \"a prolonged and indeterminate period of time.\" Ordinarily, we would afford great deference to the juvenile court's review of such an evaluation. But the record here reveals that the evaluation was untethered to the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 In November 2016, the court held a two-day evidentiary hearing concerning severance of Mother's and Father's parental rights. Father did not appear and communicated through counsel that he did not contest the severance. The court severed Father's rights to I.R. and E.C. (a child from his previous relationship)\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   and heard testimony on severing Mother's rights. Father's severance is not at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 During her testimony, Mother asserted her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent in response to questions related to her failure to bring I.R. to the hospital immediately, awareness of I.R.'s injuries, and Father's history of domestic violence. From her silence, the juvenile court drew negative inferences that she was aware Father caused I.R.'s injuries but did not report them and that she was aware of Father's domestic-violence history. The Department introduced the psychological evaluation and had the evaluator testify. The juvenile court found clear and convincing evidence that Mother knew or reasonably should have known that Father abused I.R. and that she failed to protect I.R.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Linda V. v.

They will each have parents who are committed to protecting them from harm and who provide loving and nurturing homes. While Mother loves her [children], she chose to continue her own unhealthy, abusive relationship with [Father] rather than ending the relationship to protect herself and her children.\n   <em>\n    The Court cannot find on the evidence presented that Mother won't make similar decisions in the future.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Emphasis added.) In finding grounds for severance based on abuse, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Only recently has Mother said that she is no longer with Father.

Such a fact would weigh heavily in favor of severance. But the court did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find that Mother and Father were still in a relationship, nor did it find that the children would be subject to abuse by him (or anyone else) if they were in Mother's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 18 Only two pieces of evidence could support the juvenile court's findings: the testimony of the Department's case manager and the psychologist's testimony and evaluation of Mother. Both are too fundamentally flawed to support severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 19 In the summer of 2016, a new case manager was assigned. The new case manager testified at the severance hearing that she mistrusts Mother's judgment and ability to protect the children from future abuse. But opinion testimony can only provide the basis for a court's decision if it is based on fact.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

R. Evid. 703 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 20 The case manager testified that in reaching her conclusion she read several but not all of the parent-aide notes (which total 145 pages), never met with Mother outside of court hearings, only consulted with one of the service providers who worked with Mother, never attempted to confirm her suspicions that Mother and Father were still dating, never observed Mother with the children, and never visited or attempted to visit Mother's home to see if it would be safe for the children. Such a casual inquiry into the facts is not sufficient to meet even minimal professional standards, and such testimony is not sufficient to defeat fundamental constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 21 The psychologist's conclusions are equally unfounded. Shortly after the new case manager was assigned, the Department referred Mother for a psychological evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only background information the Department provided the psychologist was a copy of the initial child safety plan and risk assessment saying that drugs and spoiled food were found in the house Mother and Father shared at the start of the case, and a version of the January 2016 progress report to the juvenile court, which included a recitation of the investigation after I.R.'s admission to the hospital, including a description of I.R.'s injuries and a notation about the initial challenges in finding Mother a domestic-violence counseling group.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 22 From this information, an interview with Mother, and several personality tests, the psychologist prognosticated that Mother's ability \"to demonstrate minimally adequate parenting skills [will be] poor at best\" for \"a prolonged, indeterminate period of time.\" The psychologist diagnosed Mother with (1) unspecified mood disorder;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) personality disorder, unspecified (dependent traits) (principal); (3) cannabis use disorder, moderate, in sustained remission (per client's report); (4) cocaine use disorder, moderate, in sustained remission (per client's report); and (5) hallucinogen (ecstasy) use disorder, mild, in sustained remission (per client's report).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The psychologist recommended Mother receive one year of doctoral-level therapy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   family therapy, and group therapy; and further recommended specialized substance-abuse treatment, parenting classes, parent-aide services, and domestic-violence classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 23 If these conclusions were supported by evidence, they would indeed be significant, but the evidence tells a different story. Conspicuously absent from the information the Department gave the psychologist is any reference to the 14 months of services Mother had successfully completed or was currently receiving. Mother had-without exception-tested negative for drug use;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   successfully closed out of her drug-testing service because of the lack of any positive test; closed out of drug rehabilitation because the service provider determined that no drug treatment was necessary; participated in domestic-violence counseling and group meetings; and successfully completed at least eight months of parent-aide services and supervised visitation, where she always came prepared and showed proper parenting skills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 At trial, the expert testified that he never received any information about these services. Nevertheless, he testified that Mother had benefitted \"very little\" from them and that the lack of a positive drug test did not detract from his conclusions on her drug dependence and need for treatment. He explained, \"I was not looking ... [at] her training and as to being a parent, I was looking for a diagnosis.\" Because he neither considered the available information nor attempted to evaluate Mother's parenting skills, his conclusion that she is unable to successfully parent for the foreseeable future is not reasonable evidence of Mother's parenting ability. Indeed, the foundation for his opinion is so lacking that we question (though we do not here decide) its admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Evid. 702 (expert witness's opinion testimony must be \"based on sufficient facts or data\" and reliable principles and methods \"reliably applied ...\n   <em>\n    to the facts of the case\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)). Even assuming the psychologist's evaluation and testimony were admissible as an expert opinion that a parent with these diagnoses would generally not be able to successfully parent a child, it cannot be inferred from this record that Mother is an unfit parent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santosky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p753\">\n    455 U.S. at 767\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307633\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/745/#p753\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Roberto F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064017\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/45/#p54\">\n    232 Ariz. at 54, \u00b6 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064017\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/232/45/#p54\">\n    301 P.3d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 25 The psychologist's conclusions about the risks to the children from domestic abuse are equally unsubstantiated. The evaluation stated that Mother:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   has shown a pattern of being in destructive relationships where she is physically and emotionally abused and she has been unable to leave the situation. Maintaining a relationship, even when destructive, becomes more important than the safety of [her] children. It is noteworthy to mention that [Mother] also has built a pattern of choosing men with significant deficits, which include antisocial behaviors and severe substance use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The evaluation concludes that Mother failed to protect her children from abuse once and \"without appropriate intervention, she may likely behave in this manner again.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 26 These are persuasive words, but the minimal evidence of this pattern of Mother choosing abusive partners does not support an inference that Mother will fail to protect the children in the future. According to the psychologist's notes, J.R.'s father is currently in prison, and during his relationship with Mother he used drugs. Mother \"adamantly denied\" to the psychologist that he was abusive to her. A notation in the hospital notes from I.R.'s hospitalization states that there was \"a history of domestic violence\" between J.R.'s father and Mother. Such a notation, without any elaboration, explanation, attribution, or substantiation of any kind is insufficient to show that Mother habitually selects emotionally or physically abusive romantic partners who would pose a danger to the children. All evidence in the record shows that her relationship with J.R.'s father ended before J.R.'s birth. There were instances of domestic violence by Father against Mother, but the most recent incident of physical abuse was in 2014. And again, Father's rights have been severed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 27 Unless the Department can show that Mother is unable to protect the children from future abuse, severance cannot stand on a record that shows only that she was the\n   <em>\n    victim\n   </em>\n   of domestic violence at the hands of the person who abused the children-a person who is no longer present in the children's lives. To hold otherwise would be to punish the victim for the behavior of the abuser. It is true that Mother failed to take I.R. to the hospital immediately when she discovered his injuries, but her resort to artifice so that her relatives could take him the next day hardly reveals complicity in the abuse. It cannot be inferred from such a record that Mother chooses abusive partners and will be unable to protect the children from a future abuser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 28 To bolster the evidence of a pattern, the Department suggested two events of psychological abuse and emphasized a specific parent-aide note. But descriptions of the domestic-violence incidents were mostly provided by the Department's attorney, and few details were adopted by any witness or confirmed by other evidence. The first was when Mother called the police to their home, about a week before I.R. was taken to the hospital, because Father had taken her keys. The second was in August 2015 when Father took Mother's phone and broke it. The parent-aide note from February 2, 2016, upon which the Department relied, states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [Mother and Father] welcomed me into their home. [Father] seemed a little on edge. [Mother] was a little bit more quiet at this parent meeting. I did notice that [Mother] did not talk as much and was looking down on the floor when [Father] was talking. I asked [Father] how he felt the last few visits went at the DCS office with him. His answer was \"Fine. Good. What is it suppose it be?\" [Father] was getting upset and started telling me that he did not know he was doing a bad job. I told [Father that he] was not doing a bad job and that he was taking what I was saying wrong. I explained that I was just\n   trying to see how he was feeling with the visits and if he was feeling a little disconnected to [I.R.] [Father] told me that he can not be that \"kind\" of dad. I asked him what he meant, he said he would not play paddy cake or sing to him.\n   <em>\n    [Mother] interrupted and told [Father] that she had noticed he was being a little rough with [I.R.], and that he needs to be gentle with [I.R.] that [I.R.] is just a baby, [and] not older like [J.R.]. [Father] became upset and left the meeting.\n   </em>\n   [Mother] told me that she had noticed [Father] become different in the past few visits. [Father] came back into the apartment and told me he was sorry for leaving but is upset with how much is on his plate with DCS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 29 This entry (one of dozens made over the course of eight months) is not proof of Mother's inability to protect the children. To the contrary, it shows that Mother was concerned with Father's treatment of I.R. and confronted him about it. Nor is there a single notation in 145 pages of parent-aide notes to suggest a pattern of selection of abusive partners by Mother, or abuse by Mother. According to the parent-aide provider's records, there was not a single instance of Mother failing to come prepared for a visit nor a single situation involving Mother that required the assistance of the parent aide. Every entry notes the love and affection Mother showed for the children. Parent-aide services ended three weeks after the February 2, 2016 parent meeting because the Department transferred the case to another parent-aide provider. But there is no reference to another service provider anywhere else in the record. It appears the Department never made a referral to a new provider nor attempted to continue the parent-aide service, despite the provider's repeated recommendations that the service continue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 30 The problems with the psychologist's evaluation are exemplified by its conclusions about Mother's drug use, which are not only contrary to the evidence in the record but also to the information in the psychologist's possession when he evaluated Mother. Mother\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   tested positive for drugs, and the service provider concluded that she needed no services to address drug abuse. Yet the psychologist opined that Mother was at a high risk of relapse and was only sober because \"she sees herself in trouble.\" The evaluation said that Mother was evasive regarding using substances, indicated that her self-reporting was the only evidence of sobriety, and concluded that \"[Mother] has shown significant lack of insight into how her psychological issues and substance use affect her functioning and how this places her children at risk.\" The evaluation stated that her behavior was consistent with the pre-contemplation stage of change, that she did not intend to rectify the situation in the foreseeable future, and that this category of person would choose to purchase drugs rather than food for her children and is more likely to act physically towards them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 31 According to the psychologist's own notes, Mother experimented with a variety of drugs before turning 21 and regularly used marijuana thereafter, but she ceased all drug use when J.R. was born (when she was 25) and had not used drugs for at least three years. The Department failed to inform the psychologist of Mother's negative drug tests and the treatment provider's determination that she did not need drug treatment-even the evidence he had did not support his conclusions about drug use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 32 Even if we were to accept the evaluation's diagnoses and make the dubious assumption that they would have been the same had the psychologist had all the available information, there must still be some reasonable evidence that diagnosed psychological traits will manifest themselves to the detriment of the children-their mere existence is not enough.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Maricopa Cty.

At the close of the evidentiary portion of the hearing, the Department conceded Mother's successful compliance with services and the fact that Mother is bonded with the children. There also is evidence of a bond between I.R. and J.R. But no placement could take both children, so severance of Mother's rights permanently separates the siblings. Mother is employed and is living with her sister and niece in an apartment that would be safe for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 38 If a parent's ability to parent the children has been established by parent-aide services, there is a bond between the children and parent, and the parent has attained a safe and stable living situation, then the children's adoptability, household stability, and the ability of their current placements to meet their needs are subordinate to the fundamental rights of the parent in determining best interests, unless severance removes a detriment caused by the parental relationship. But neither Mother nor her current living situation pose any danger to the children. And the speculative finding that she might someday involve herself in a relationship with someone who would abuse the children is not an adequate basis to conclude that severance is now in the children's best interests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 39 A parent's rights should be preserved \"when the parent grasps the opportunity [to reunify with a child] quickly, diligently, and persistently\" and without failure.\n   <em>\n    In re Pima Cty.

Mother did so here. If exemplary\n   compliance with services and a strong parental bond are insufficient to avoid an adverse best-interests finding, then the services themselves serve no purpose except to delay an inevitable severance. Because Mother has a fundamental constitutional right to the \"companionship, care, custody, and management of\" and \"associat[ion] with\" her children, we cannot affirm a severance on such a thin record, even under our deferential standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stanley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723248\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/645/#p651\">\n    405 U.S. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11723248\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/645/#p651\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Maricopa Cty.
