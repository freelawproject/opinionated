And when the defendant to a suit on such note pleads nothing in bar to such suit but a general denial, no evidence to defeat plaintiff\u2019s right to recover on such note is admissible; and the admission of such evidence in such case over objections thereto is error, and in such case this court on appeal should disregard such evidence and reverse and render judgment as if such evidence had not been offered.

C., sec. 1173.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-15\">The court erred in rendering judgment ordering plaintiff to surrender certain bank stock mentioned in its judgment, because there were no pleadings or legal evidence before the court authorizing such judgment or order, and such action on the part of the court was coram non judice. 2 Black on Judg., sec. 794; 1 Bouv.

H; Lessing and Edwin W. Hander, composing -the law firm of Lessing &amp; Hander, filed a petition of intervention, claiming that the Id per cent attorney\u2019s fee stipulated for in the note sued upon had been assigned to and was owned by them, and -they asked for judgment against the defendant for said amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Upon the trial the defendant offered in evidence the following written instrument:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">\u201cThis is to certify that I have this day received from John Baadethe sum of eight hundred and thirty-two dollars and 14-100 dollars in full payment of this note in my favor for the sum of eight hundred dollars and interest at the rate of 10 per cent, payable annually, dated Jan. 1, 1895. This amount is also received in full settlement of the suit now pending in the District Court of McLennan County, 19th Judicial District of the State of Texas, entitled Charles Hander v. John Baade, and it is hereby agreed that said suit may be dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s costs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">\u201cGiven under my hand, this the 26th day of May, 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">\u201cCharles Hander.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">The plaintiff objected to the introduction of this instrument, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>(1) the defendant- had not pleaded any payment; (2) the execution of the instrument was not proved; (3) it was not declared on in any pleading filed by the defendant, so as to dispense with proof of its execution; (4) it had not been filed prior to its introduction in evidence; and (5) the plaintiff was not granted time to prepare and file pleas of non est factum and fraud perpetrated by the defendant in procuring said instrument. All of these objections were overruled, and the instrument admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The note sued on and the instrument above copied constitute all the evidence that was placed before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The judgment recites that all the parties\u2014plaintiff, defendant, and intervenors\u2014appeared and announced ready for trial; that after ruling on the exceptions the cause was heard on its merits, and after hearing the testimony the court was of the opinion that the law was with the defendant, and then the judgment reads: \u201cIt is ordered, adjudged, and decreed by the court, that the plaintiff and the intervenors take nothing by this suit. It is further adjudged and decreed by the court, that this cause be dismissed, and that the defendants do have and recover of the plaintiff, Charles Hander, all costs of suit, for which execution may. issue.\u201d The judgment then proceeds to direct execution to issue in favor of the officers against each party for the costs incurred by such party, and also orders the collateral security mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s petition to be surrendered to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The court could not properly try the case on its merits and at the same time dismiss it; and in view of the terms of the judgment, it is difficult to determine exactly what the court did. But, considering all the provisions of the judgment, the statement of facts, and bills of exception, we are of the opinion that the court tried the case and intended to render a judgment settling the rights of the parties; and, such being the case, we are clearly of the opinion that the court erred in admitting in evidence the instrument of writing above set out. It is true that Lessing &amp; Hander, who were the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, stated in their petition of intervention \u2014 filed in their own behalf, and not as the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys \u2014 that the plaintiff had received the amount of money stated in and had executed said instrument. If this statement could be held to operate as an admission by the plaintiff\u2014which we do not hold \u2014 such admission would not dispense with the necessity of a plea of payment by the defendant when, upon trial of the ease, he offered the instrument as evidence of such payment; in other words, as the defendant failed to plead payment of the note, he had no right to offer any testimony tending to show such payment, even though he might have offered to put the plaintiff gn the stand and prove the fact by him. We therefore hold that, because the defendant\u2019s answer contained no plea of payment, and he failed to prove the execution of the instrument referred to, it was reversible error to admit the same in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The other objections to the instrument are not likely to arise upon another trial, and therefore are not decided hy this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\n<em>Reversed and, remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
