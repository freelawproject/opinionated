The levying of an assessment of $9 against Dr. Smith, when other members holding policies the same as his, difference in age being considered, were assessed in the same call at a lower rate, was such a discrimination against him as would render the call a nullity.

If it was agreed that the $37.50 should be applied on the advance premium, Dr. Smith could not countermand or refuse payment of this sum and at the same time retain the policy of insurance, the validity of the policy depending upon the payment of the premium. By claiming a benefit under the policy, he became bound to pay the consideration. Roberson v. Town, 76 Texas, 535; 2 Rice on Ev., sec. 308; McQuery v. Guillilan, 7 L. R.

The court did not err in submitting to the jury the question whether or not the letter of Dr. Smith to defendant of December 11, 1892, was a countermand of the order to George A. Carden, for its construction depended upon the intent to be gathered from all the facts and circumstances. Taylor v. McNutt, 58 Texas, 75; Moss v. Helsey, 60 Texas, 438; Talliaferro v.

If the appellee in good faith applied the $37.50 belonging to Dr. Smith on his advance premium, and so notified him, and he acquiesced in-such application, he could not after his policy was forfeited for the nonpayment of a mortuary call subseqently levied, repudiate this application and insist upon the application of said money to the said call, so as to impose a liability upon- appellee for more than $5000, in favor of beneficiaries of his policy, but if this was error, it was invited by appellant\u2019s third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>requested charge, aud they can not complain. 3 Pom.

Call Ho. 130 did not require of Dr. Smith a greater sum than was due according to his contract, and was no discrimination against him in favor of those who became members before March, 1890, the difference in rates being justified and explained by the difference in the contracts made with those who became members before March, 1890, and those who became members afterwards.

Smith and wife, Malinda F. Smith, against the Covenant Mutual Benefit Association of Illinois, based upon a certificate of insurance for $5000 issued by the defendant to Dr. Tolbert C. Smith, payable upon his death to his mother, Malinda F. Smith. The defense to the action relied upon by the defendant was a failure to pay a mortuary call or assessment, whereby the certificate of insurance lapsed and became forfeited, under the provisions of the contract of insurance. The case was tried by a jury, and resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the defendant. From this judgment an appeal has been perfected to this court by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The issuance of the certificate of insurance, the death of the assured, and that plaintiff Malinda F. Smith is the beneficiary, are all unquestioned facts. The only question to be determined by the trial upon which there was a contest was whether the certificate had lapsed and become void by reason of a failure to pay a mortuary call or assessment. Upon this issue arose several minor issues of fact, and quite a number of questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The defendant, as indicated by its name, is a mutual benefit association. Its certificate holders are its members. It has a constitution, by-laws, rules, and regulations for its government, and it pays its liabilities, created by death of persons holding its certificates of insurance, through assessments or mortuary calls upon its members. Only one assessment was levied against deceased\u2019s policy, and that was call 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The certificate consists of a printed form furnished by defendant, filled out as is usual in insurance policies. The essential parts of the certificate are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\u201cIn consideration of the receipt of the advance premium, the payment of all bi-monthly premiums hereafter required, and the representations, agreements, and warranties made in the application for membership, * * * a copy of which is hereto annexed, and the agreement upon his (deceased\u2019s) part to accept and comply with all the provisions hereinafter stated, the Covenant Mutual Benefit Association of Illinois does hereby issue this policy and constitute the above named applicant (deceased), hereinafter termed the insured, a member of the said association, and agrees to pay from any funds received or to be collected for mortuary purposes as a benefit to his mother Malinda F. Smith, * * * within ninety days from the receipt by said association of full and satisfactory proofs of a valid claim under this contract, conditioned upon the death of the insured, the sum of five thousand dollars, together with such part of the emergency fund as shall be due under the terms of the contract, any unpaid premiums or other indebtedness being first deducted therefrom. Provided further, that in the event the insured shall become totally and permanently disabled, * * * upon the determination of the medical director and executive board, this policy, if then in force, may, at the option of said executive board, be surrendered properly receipted at one-half its face value. * * * Provided especially, that this policy of insurance and the provisions, requirements, conditions, agreements, representations, and warranties set forth in the succeeding pages (of said policy) or contained in the said application (for said policy) shall be taken together, and in such entirely shall constitute the contract of insurance between the association and the insured. And this certificate or policy of insurance is issued solely upon the statements, representations, and warranties made in the aforesaid application, and shall not <em>go </em>into effect or remain in force or be binding upon the association unless such statements, representations, and warranties are true, and the insured shall fully comply with all the conditions, requirements, and agreements contained in this contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">\u201cIn witness whereof, the said Covenant Mutual Benefit Association of Illinois has this 19th day of December, 1892, by its president and secretary, signed, sealed and delivered this contract, at its office in the city of Galesburg, Illinois.

The rates given in the table provide for the accumulation of the mortuary, reserve-emergency, and general funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Article Y, section 3, Rules and Regulations: \u201cIn case the insured shall become totally and permanently disabled, the executive board, upon the recommendation of the medical director, may, if all the conditions of the contract have been complied with, upon the surrender and cancellation of the policy, pay one-half its face value in cash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Section <em>7: </em>\u201cFor the purpose of preventing unintentional lapsing and for the accommodation of members, the managing directors shall, from time to time, in accordance with the mortality experience, adopt rules of advance deposit, which shall render certificates nonforfeiting for the nonpayment of assessments for the time agreed upon, not exceeding one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">\u201cThe secretary shall at all times accept advance deposits from members, which shall be placed to their credit, and stand chargeable with any assessment that may be due as they occur, and the notice of such assessment shall bear on its face a memorandum of the credit balance due such member after deducting the amount of such assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Section 10: \u201cThe managing directors shall order six regular mortuary calls each year, on which all members having held membership for at least 105 days prior to the date thereof shall be liable. They shall be issued on the first business day of January, March, May, July, September, and November, respectively, and shall close thirty days from date, but the managing directors may at their discretion by affixing a penalty of not less than 10 cents, extend the time to all who can not pay within the thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">\u201cThe mortuary calls shall be in such form and contain such facts as the laws of Illinois may require, shall state when it will close, and what extension of time, if any, is given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Section 11 provides, that \u201cany member may withdraw from the association by notifying the secretary, in writing, returning his or her certificate, and paying whatever may be due the association, but shall thereby forfeit all claims to the funds of the association, as well as any amount he or she may have contributed thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The Illinois statute on the subject of notice was introduced by the appellee, and was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">\u201cAssessment Notices\u2014Application of Fund.\u2014Assessment notices sent to members by any association or corporation doing business in this State, \u25a0 shall state the object or-objects for which the money to be collected is intended, the names, last address, and amount of certificate of deceased members, the amount to which the beneficiary of each is entitled or the amount which would be realized for the beneficiaries of each if all the members who are assessed would pay their assessments; and no part of the funds collected for the payment of death benefits shall-be applied for any other purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The assured was 22 years old when the certificate was issued to him, December 19, 1892, and his bi-monthly assessment under the contract was $9. The certificate was declared lapsed by the association on June 16, 1893, for the alleged nonpayment of call No. 120, for $9. The call bore date Hay 1, 1893, though it was ordered on the 4th day of April, 1893. The resolution .of the board of managing directors by which, it was ordered was: .\u201cThat the following proofs of death.having been reported complete and sufficient by the medical director, attorney, and actuary, and reviewed and approved by the executive, be approved and assessed upon as mortuary call No. 180. The call on all policies issued subsequent to March, 1890, to be the maximum given in the table of rates on the back of the policy.\u201d Then follows, as a part of the resolution, a list of seventy-two death, claims, aggregating $193,500, with the name and residence of each deceased member. As a matter of fact, however, every one of these claims had been paid before the resolution was passed, out of funds on hand arising from previous assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The following notice of assessment was mailed to the deceased on the 28th day of April, 1893, dated May 1, 1893:</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">\u201cYou are hereby notified that in consequence of death of members of the assoei\u00e1tion whose names appear on the accompanying sheet, satisfactory proofs of death having been filed and approved, a call for $9 has been ordered in accordance with the conditions of your certificate, by the terms of which it is now due and must, under penalty of forfeiture, be received at this office on or before May 31st, or within thirty days from the date of this notice. Assm\u2019t closes May 31, 1893. Next call issued July 1, 1893. Mortuary call including-cents. Expense $--. W. H. Smollinger, Secr\u2019y.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">The sheet which accompanied the notice contained the following clause: \u201cThe following death claims having been approved and paid, mortuary call No. 180, issued May 1, 1893, is ordered by the board of managing directors.\u201d Then follows a tabulated list of claims, giving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>number of each policy, amount of policy, amount paid to the association, what same amount of insurance would have cost in old line companies, what the amount paid on each to the association would have brought in old line companies, name and residence of the deceased, name of beneficiary, when proofs were completed, when the claims were each paid, and the amount paid to each. Nothing else is stated in regard to the claims. The claims are the same as given in the resolution above. Twelve of these claims, amounting to $31,375, are stated in this sheet to have been paid on February 15, 1893; three, amounting to $6000, on February 17; four, amounting to $13,500, on February 18; nine amounting to $35,750, on February 30; five, aggregating $17,350, on February 31; nine, aggregating $33,000, on February 34; one of $3500, on February 35; two, aggregating $7-500, February 38. The proofs of thirty-four of these claims were completed on January 10,1893; 34 on February 13; two on February 38, 1893; one on March 31, 1893; and one, that of C. W. Breed, of Chicago, for $1000, on September 7, 1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">It was conclusively shown, and not controverted, that said- mortuary call No. 130 was not paid. Appellants try to meet this issue, first, by showing that under the contract of insurance he was not subject to any charges or assessments until about six months after his certificate was issued, and that the company had funds belonging to him which it should have applied to the payment of this assessment; second, that the call was not legally binding upon him, for reasons which will be hereafter considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The evidence was conflicting upon the questions whether the assured was to be charged anything for the first six months after the issuance of the certificate, and whether the company held funds of the assured which it should have applied to payment of mortuary call No. 130. The defendant\u2019s testimony tended to show, and was a sufficient predicate for the finding of the jury, that defendant\u2019s soliciting agents, Carden and Wilkerson, employed the assured as medical examiner for the company, agreeing that the company should pay him $3.50 for each person examined by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The assured agreed that he would invest half the sum realized by him from this source, upon the basis of $8 per thousand advance premium to be paid by him. Under arrangement with the company, this advance premium went as compensation to the soliciting agents, and in addition, the general agent of the company, under whom they wbre employed, paid them a bonus of $1 per thousand insurance secured by them. The soliciting agents were authorized to remit to the assured this advance premium whenever they desired so to do, and they took that course to a large extent, receiving as compensation only the $1 per thousand bonus offered by the general agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">These agents procured at Honey Grove twenty-seven applications for insurance, outside of the application of Dr. Smith, and to each of them they remitted the advance premium of $8 per thousand which the policy and laws provided should be paid. The assured, Dr. Tolbert C. Smith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>examined each of the applicants, and his agreed compensation amounted in the aggregate to $67.50. The payment of the advance premium carried the policy, under section 10 of the by-laws, heretofore quoted, for at least 105 days free of further charges. These bi-monthly mortuary calls were required to be made on the first business days of January, March, May, July, September, and November, and when the certificates were issued between November 16 and the 1st of January, the payment of the advance premium carried the insurance free of further charge for forty-five days in excess of the 105 days, 150 days, or about five months.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The policy in this case was issued December 19, 1892, and\" the advance premium therefore carried it 150 days; that is, it was not subject to mortuary call until May 1, 1893. The company paid the assured $30 by draft, on the. amount due hinvfor examination of applicants, and on his written order it paid the balance due him, $37.50, to its agent, George A. Carden. The evidence - shows conclusively that, before the giving of this order upon the company for $37.50 to the agent Carden, a controversy arose between said agents and assured as to whether the assured should pay them anything. The assured contended that the advance premium was. to be remitted to him by the agents, as had been done with the other applicants, while the agents contended that he was to pay them the advance premium. This controversy terminated in the giving of the order upon the company for $37.50 to\" the agent Carden, this sum being $2.50 less than-the advance premium provided for by the laws of the company. After this the application of the assured was sent in to the home office of the company, and the certificate was issued, to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The order given by deceased was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201cHohey Grove, Texas, Dec. 3, 1892.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201cPay to the order of Geo.

Certainly he is not entitled to any of the medical examination fee, and the only way that I can see in which he would have a right to ask you for an order for money that was due you on account of work done for this association would be if you were indebted to him.

I examined twenty-seven applicants and was to receive $3.50 each, but on settlement ivas forced to discount my account $37.50, or receive nothing, so I thought it better to take $30 than nothing, as Mr. Carden, after I had done the work, claimed that all collections came through him, and before he would send in my account I would have to give him an order for $37.50. T thought it a strange way of doing business, is the reason I have written you. From your letter I see Mr. Carden has done me a wrong, and if it is in the power of the association to have justice done me and pay me the full amount ($37.50) I would be under many obligations to you.

If there was such an arrangement he certainly was entitled to the money, and you should complete the application at once. Very truly yours,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-22\">\u201cW. H. Smollinger, Sec\u2019y.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-23\">On December 6, 1893, deceased wrote appellee, asking when he would be required to make another payment on his policy, to which the appellee replied that the policy had lapsed through nonpayment of call Ho. 120; to which last letter deceased replied on December 30, 1893: \u201cYou are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>undoubtedly mistaken when you say my policy has lapsed, for I have your written receipt for payment of advance premium for one year, and my policy bears date of December 19, 1892. If you will examine the matter closely you will find that a portion of my fees for making medical examinations for the company went to pay this advance premium. It has been my intention all the while to keep my policy in good standing.\u201d The letter inclosed $15, which was returned by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">W. C. Calkins, appellee\u2019s general counsel, testified in its behalf as follows: \u201cI am one of the directors of defendant. This call (120) was made on all of defendant\u2019s members, on those holding certificates dated prior to 1890, as well as on those dated subsequent thereto; but the call made on members whose certificates bore date prior to 1890 was made on a separate plan and according to the provisions of their respective contracts, but were all included in the call as mortuary call Ho. 120. What 1 mean by separate plan is a plan separate from the plan named in the policy involved in this suit, and described in the by-laws in force at the time the contracts were made. The call made as above stated on certificates dated prior to 1890 was made under defendant\u2019s original bylaws as revised January 26, 1886, and in 1888, and under the other bylaws preceding that. But the call was made at the same time under the same resolution as call 120, and made at the usual time, place, and in the usual and customary manner. Each policy holder is assessed according to the provisions of his contract and the by-laws in force at the time his contract was made. The calls prior to 1890 were upon policies that were, to use one expression, TCind o\u2019 pass-around-the-hat policies;\u2019 they contained no promise to pay money; they did Contain a promise to pay whatever might be realized from the assessment, realized from membership, and from ready comparison show calls there and by-laws different from those as shown by these by-laws (revised by-laws, 1892). Those policies were made with reference to paying current death claims, death claims as they occurred without reference to the future; they contained no provision with reference to paying back dividends, or on total disability. The second class, which includes the policy in this suit, as a fact contains all those clauses, total disability, which means payment of half in case a man is totally disabled, and makes the premiums to declare dividends at the end of six years; also provides for protecting future obligations. We pay, and had for some time been paying, our claims in advance, paying them just as soon as they were presented to the company, borrowing from the fund then on hand, to be replaced by future assessment, and this assessment (Ho. 120) is one of them. This levy was made in the usual manner. The death claims contained in the notice of mortuary call Ho. 120 had been paid out of the mortuary fund, and said call was made to replenish that fund. The experience of the society is that the death rate of the old policy holders averages precisely the same as it does under the new, under the same conditions. And the excess col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>lected from the new policy goes to their credit under their contract in the way of dividends at the dividend period. Members whose policies antedate the year 1890 are paid in full, same as those coming in since 1890, and the increased rates charged to those whose policies are dated since 1890 are accounted for in the total disability clause, and other extra privileges under policy since 1890, and according to our idea the mortality experience makes them pay about the same rate. The same form of notice is used in,the one class as is used in the other, except as to grade and number of particular policy and amount to be paid by that particular holder, which was governed by the contract and by-laws at the time it was insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Appellee introduced in evidence its various by-laws antedating the \u201cBe-vised By-laws of 1892.\u201d</p>\n<p

call. The same provision for the accumulation, use and distribution of the emergency fund is found in these by-laws as in those of 1892. The revised by-laws of 1892 contain ho reference to or mention of the former by-laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">This is believed to be a sufficient statement of the material facts \"shown upon the trial to serve as a basis for the disposition of the questions presented upon this appeal. Such additional facts as may be deemed necessary to consider may be stated in connection with the discussion of the questions presented for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Opinion.\u2014The first and eighth assignments of error complain respectively of the general charge and the refusal of the court to give in charge t\u00f3 the jury a special instruction requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The portion of the general charge attacked is as follows: \u201cIf said Carden agreed with Dr. Smith to remit the advance premium or membership fee, and if afterwards, and before the delivery of the certificate, he claimed such fee from Dr.- Smith, and if Dr. Smith, in compliance with such demand, gave Carden an order on defendant for $37.50, and afterwards ae cepted from defendant the certificate the application for which was pro., cured by said Carden, and if the defendant paid said Carden said sum on said order, then the defendant had the right to pay such order, notwithstanding the fact (if it was a fact) that Dr. Smith requested the defendant, after having given the order, to pay the money to him instead of Carden, and if you find such to be the facts in the ease, you will find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">This is the special charge asked: \u201cThat if you believe from the evidence that Carden had authority from the defendant to rebate the membership fee, and that he entered into a contract with the deceased for the deceased\" to take a policy of insurance for $5000 in the defendant association, and that as a part of said contract said Carden agreed to relinquish and did relinquish to the deceased\" said membership fee, and in pursuance thereof deceased made application for said policy, and that defendant delivered said policy to deceased; and that afterwards defendant applied $37.50 of the debt which it then owed deceased for medical examinations to the payment of advance premium on said policy, and \"notified deceased of such\" application, and\" that \"if deceased, in exercise of ordinary cafe, was thereby led to believe and understand, and did so believe and under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>stand, that such application of said $37.50 hy defendant was for the purpose of paying premiums on said policy to accrue after the time said policy would be carried by said relinquishment, and by reason of such belief and understanding deceased acquiesced in such application of said $37.50 by defendant, and if the defendant knew, or -in the exercise of ordinary care ought to have known, that such was the belief and understanding upon the part of deceased, and that this was why he was acquiescing in the application of said $37.50, then you will find for plaintiff, unless you find against her on account of the other instructions given you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The proposition urged against the charge of the court is, that the term \u201cadvance premium\u201d should be held to mean money paid by the assured in advance for the purpose of meeting mortuary calls made after the \u25a0expiration of the 105 days. It is insisted that, under the terms of the \u25a0certificate and laws and regulations of the association, the term \u201cadvance premium\u201d is of doubtful meaning, and that courts should give it that meaning which would he most beneficial to the assured, and prevent a forfeiture. In support of this position, authorities are cited to the effect that, where the terms of an insurance contract' are of doubtful import, and will admit of different constructions, one of which will sustain the contract and prevent its forfeiture, while the other will result in forfeiture, courts should adopt the construction which will uphold the contract. 1 Bacon on Ben. Soc., see. 203; Anson on Con., sec'. 331; Goodwin v. Savings Assn., 66 N. W. Rep., 157; Bank v. Ins. Co., 95 U. S. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The proposition of law announced is sustained by the authorities, and is well established; but the application here attempted to be made can not be admitted. We think it clearly appears that the \u201cadvance premium\u201d provided for by the laws of the association is in the nature of a membership fee. Bight dollars per thousand insurance is charged against all applicants, regardless of their ages, while the amount of the assessments to be subsequently paid are rated, and differ according to ages. The \u201cadvance premium\u201d carries the policy free of other charge for at least 105 days; that is, mortuary calls can only be made against the holder of a certificate after it has been in force 105 days, and these calls can only be made on the first business days of January, March, May, July, September, and Bovember. The payment of the advance premium by the assured would have carried his insurance, without further payment, to the mortuary call of May 1, 1893, to which his policy was subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The special charge asked is based upon the idea that the assured may have been misled into the belief that the advance premium was remitted, and that the company had applied his $37.50 to the payment of assessments to be made after the period had passed through which the advance premium would carry the policy, and that the company knew or ought to have known that he so understood the matter, and therefore should be held responsible. The evidence did not warrant any such charge. What was meant by the advance premium was clearly manifest from the contract. The assured had explicit notice that his $37.50 had been paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>to Carden as the advance premium due from the assured, and was further notified at the time the policy was delivered to him that the first mortuary call which would be made upon him would occur on May 1, and would be for the sum of $9, and he was requested to carefully read the certificate and copy of application attached. The mortuary call was made May 1st, in accordance with this notice, and forwarded to and received by the assured. Under such a state of facts, there was no occasion for any such mistake as that contended for by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The tenth and twelfth assignments are directed respectively at the refusal of a special charge asked and the charge given.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The special charge is in this language: \u201cThat the written order given by Dr. Smith to Carden was subject to countermand, and if the payment of it was countermanded by deceased before defendant became liable thereon, then defendant had no right to pay the same to Carden without deceased^ consent, or unless, deceased knowing that the same had been so paid by defendant, it was afterwards ratified by deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The part of the general charge complained of is the seventh paragraph, as follows: \u201cIf Carden agreed with Dr. Smith to remit the advance premium ,or membership fee, and if afterwards, and before the delivery of the certificate, he claimed such fee from Dr. Smith, and if Dr. Smith in compliance with such demand gave Carden an order on defendant for $37.50, and afterwards accepted from defendant the certificate the application for which was procured by said Carden, and if defendant paid said sum to Carden on said order, then the defendant had the right to pay such order, notwithstanding the fact, if it was a fact, that Dr. Smith requested the defendant, after having given the order, to pay the money to him instead of Carden; and if you find such to be the facts, you will find for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">As has been heretofore shown, the advance premium or membership fee was expressly provided for by the laws of the association, and by the terms of a private contract between the soliciting agents and the association, it was to go as compensation to said agents. The agents had authority to relieve applicants of payment of this advance premium, if they desired to do so, but they were under no obligation to do it. It was simply a matter between the soliciting agents and the assured, whether the payment should be made. The company got the benefit of the advance premium in either event, for this constituted compensation to the agents, and if they remitted it to applicants for insurance the company was not affected thereby. Under these conditions, after Carden demanded of the assured payment of the advance premium, and the assured gave him an' order on the company for $37.50 out of the amount due him by the company, in payment of such advance premium, he had no right to countermand this order, without countermanding his application for insurance at the same time. He had no right to demand the certificate of insurance without payment of the advance premium. It was a matter of grace on the part of the agent to relieve him of its payment, and if the agent withdrew his promise, claimed to have been made, to .that effect, before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sending in of the application for insurance, and in response to his demand for its payment assured gave the order for $37.50, he had no right after-wards to countermand the order and claim the benefit of the certificate of insurance without payment of the advance premium. We think the charge of the court correctly presented, this phase of the case to the jury, and did not'err in refusing the special charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Under the thirteenth and fourteenth assignments of error appellants assail these two sections of the charge:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\u2018 \u201cIf you find that Carden claimed or demanded $37.50 of Dr. Smith, on the ground that he was entitled to a part of the medical examiner\u2019s fees, and' if in fact Smith had contracted with Carden to divide his examination fees with him, and if Smith gave him the order in compliance with such claim, and afterwards countermanded the order and notified defendant not to pay.it, then defendant had no right to pay it to -Car-den, and if you so find, then, unless you find that Dr. Smith had notice that the money had been so applied and acquiesced in the same, you will .find for plaintiff. On the other hand, if you find that Dr. Smith and Carden had a controversy as to the $37.50, and -Smith gave him the order and afterwards submitted, the question as to Carden\u2019s right to the $37.50 to the defendant to decide, and if the defendant decided against Dr. Smith and paid it to. Qarden, and Smith had notice of such decision and acquiesced therein, until defendant had declared his certificate forfeited, then Dr. Smith had no right to have said money applied to payment of said mortuary call Ho. 130, although you may believe that originally he had a right to the money; and if you so find, you will return a'verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">\u201cYou are at liberty to determine from the letter from Dr. Smith to defendant, dated December 11, 1893, and from all other evidence -before you which may bear upon the -question, as to whether said letter was meant as a submission of the matter in dispute between Smith and Car-den to the defendant for .decision, and even if: you find that Smith intended it as a positive countermand of the order, if the defendant mistook the meaning and believed in good, faith, that it was intended' to submit the matter to it to investigate and decide, and paid the money to Carden under such mistaken belief, and if Dr. Smith knew or had notice of such decision and acquiesced in the same until after his certificate had been declared forfeited, then you must find for defendant.\u201d \u25a0 \u25a0 -</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Based upon these assignments appellants urge two propositions:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">First.\u2014They assert that unless the assured knew of the mistake in the interpretation of his letter by the association, his rights should not be prejudiced thereby.' We-do not think the court erred in the particular complained of. If the association in good faith applied the $37.50 due and owing by it to Dr. Smith upon the advance premium on his policy, and notified him of such application, and he acquiesced in it, receiving and retaining his policy, the assured could not, if his policy had become forfeited for nonpayment of the mortuary call,, levied subsequent to this appropriation and.notification to him, repudiate the application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>money and insist that it he applied in discharge of mortuary calls, and thereby impose a liability of $5000 in favor of beneficiaries of his certificate. That is to say, even though the application of this $37.50 by the association to the payment of the advance premium upon the policy, the same going into the hands of George A. Carden, should be determined as not strictly equitable as between the assured and the soliciting agent George A. Carden, yet if the assured knew of the application and received and retained the policy with such knowledge, he should not have allowed the policy to become forfeited by nonpayment of subsequent assessments, and can not have this transaction opened up and the rights between him and Carden adjusted, and by such adjustment impose a heavy liability upon the association. If he intended to insist upon his claim, asserted in this case, that this $37.50 should be paid to him or applied to future assessments made against his certificate, he should have asserted and maintained this claim before the forfeiture, and declined to accept the benefits of the certificate under the conditions of its delivery to him by the company. 2 Pom.

Dec., 91, and note.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Second.\u2014It is insisted that the evidence did not justify this issue being submitted to the jury. This contention is not borne out by the record. The issue had a legitimate basis in the evidence, and besides, appellants requested a charge based on ratification of the application by Dr. Smith, and having invited the court to charge upon this issue, they can not now complain that the court did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The contention that it was error in the court to leave to the jury the determination of the question whether the assured intended by the letter of December 11,1892, to countermand the order given by him to Carden upon the company for $37.50 is not well taken. The letter did not, in. express terms, countermand the payment of this order, and the court very properly left the jury to determine, under all the facts and circumstances of the case, whether the writer intended the letter to be a countermand of the order previously given to Carden. Taylor v. McNutt, 58 Texas, 75; Moss v. Helsey, 60 Texas, 438; Talliaferro v. Cundiff, 33 Texas, 416; 28 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, p. 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The eighteenth assignment of error: \u201cThe court erred in charging the jury that the contract between deceased and defendant was contained in the certificate and written .application therefor, when they should have been instructed to construe the same in connection with defendant\u2019s rules and by-laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The court, in its charge, stated to the jury the legal effect of the contract between the parties, and gave to the jury for determination only issues of fact arising in the evidence. While it is true that the-rules and by-laws of-the association constituted part of the contract of insurance, the court having fully stated the legal effect of the contract to the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>no harm was done to the appellants by the court\u2019s parenthetical statement that the certificate and application showed the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Seventh assignment of error: \u201cThe court erred in charging the jury that the failure of Dr. Smith to pay or cause to be paid, or to advance money or means to defendant to pay, said call Bo. 120 caused a forfeiture of said certificate, because it was not shown by the evidence that the deceased was ever notified by defendant that the question of the eaneella-' tion of his certificate for failure to pay mortuary call 120 would come up for- hearing and investigation before the board of managing directors of defendant, giving the time when same would come up as is provided in said certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">This assignment of error is based upon section 14 of the certificate, which reads: \u201cIf, at any time during the first five years of this contract, reliable information and evidence shall come to the knowledge of said association that the insured did make false and untrue statements in his or her application, on the good faith of which this certificate is issued, or if the insured shall be guilty of any criminal act, or shall injure his. or her health by the use of alcoholic, narcotic, or other stimulants, or shall become an habitual or excessive user of intoxicants, have delirium tremens, or shall violate any one of the conditions or agreements contained in the application or this certificate, the association may, by written or printed notice signed by its president and secretary, notify the insured of his or her violation of the conditions- and agreements therein contained, and that the question of cancellation of the same will come before the board of managing directors at the time named in said notice (which shall not be less than thirty days from date thereof) for hearing and investigation, and the finding of the said board and their action thereon shall be final and conclusive and an absolute bar to the prosecution and recovery on this certificate after the death of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Section 2 of the certificate provides: \u201cBo personal liability of the insured is incurred by becoming a policy holder in this association; but. this certificate of insurance is issued and accepted subject to the express conditions that if any of the payments stipulated in this contract, shall not be paid to the association on or before the days of the dates as provided in this contract, at its home office in Galesburg, 111., this contract shall terminate, and all rights be forfeited to this association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The general language in section 14, above quoted, \u201cor shall violate any agreements of this certificate,\u201d must be construed so as to refer to conditions and agreements of the nature and kind particularly enumerated in the preceding part of this section. This is in accordance with the-general rules of construction that the particular controls the general.. Railway v. Rambolt, 67 Texas, 656; Perez v. Perez, 59 Texas, 322-324-That this construction reaches the true meaning and intent is rendered manifest and certain by the language of section 2 above quoted, which makes the failure to meet payments stipulated for in the contract work an absolute forfeiture of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>In the second and sixth assignments of error it is urged, first, that there being no unpaid claims against the association at the time call Ho. 120 was levied, no mortuary assessments could be made. There is a provision in the policy to this effect: \u201cTo provide for the payment of all death claims, or other current expenses, and to maintain an adequate emergency or reserve fund to guarantee the prompt payment in full of all future obligations, three shall be due, according to the mortality experience and emergency fund requirements of the association, and payable at its general office in Galesburg, 111., on the first business days of January, March, May, July, September, and Hovember, respectively, of each and every year during the continuance of this contract, a bi-monthly pre-&gt; mium or assessment based upon the annexed tables of rates, according to age, and graded according to the mortality experience of the association and amounts of benefits named herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">It was shown that mortuary call Ho. 120 was paid out of funds on hand raised by previous assessments under mortuary calls, and that call Ho. 120 was made to replenish this fund. It was shown that this was a practice and method of business adopted and carried on by this association. A fair construction of the provisions of the contract, including the bylaws, rules, and regulations of the association, leads to the conclusion that this method of business was authorized. Niblack, p. 481; McGowan v. Supreme Council, 28 N. Y. Sup., 177; Wolf v. Michigan, 66 N. W. Rep., 576; 3 Am. and Eng. Eneyc. of Law, 2d ed., 1093, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">It is further urged that this call was void, because it was based upon a large number of claims which should have been included in call issued on March 1st preceding. It is sufficient to say, in answer to this proposition, that no greater sum was demanded of the assured than he had contracted to pay as his bi-monthly assessment. He was liable under the terms of his policy for the assessment made on May 1, 1893, and as the company had authority to make this assessment with a view of replenishing the mortuary fund, exhausted by the death claims which were the basis of this mortuary call, there is nothing that he can justly complain of.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The appellants further urge that call Ho. 120 was void because a greater sum was demanded of the assured than was due according to his contract, as set forth in the by-laws. The contention is that there were members of the association who became such before March, 1890, and that they ivere assessed at a less rate than was the assured. The association has had several sets of by-laws, Avith policies issued under each, and while all policy holders were assessed by call Ho. 120, each policy holder was assessed at the rates provided in the by-laws under which his policy was issued. The assured made application and received his certificate \"under the by-laws of 1892. These laws fixed his rate of assessment definitely, and by his contract he obligated himself to pay bi-monthly the sum of $9. His policy or certificate possessed benefits that the old certificate holders were not entitled to. He voluntarily went into the organization under these by-laws, with the positive obligation to pay this amount of assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ment bi-monthly. He is in no attitude to complain that old policy holders, whose certificates were issued under different by-laws and under different rates, are charged less than himself. Niblack, 273, 475; Cohen v. Ins. Co., 63 N. W. Rep., 304; Leffingwell v. Ins. Co., 53 N. W. Rep., 243; Wiler v. Ins. Co., 36 N. Y., 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Under the fourth and fifth assignments of error, this proposition is presented: Mortuary call Ho. 120 is claimed to be illegal and void because the object or objects for which the money was to be collected were not legal objects, and were not sufficiently stated. These mortuary calls are required by the terms of the policy to comply with the statutes of Illinois. The Illinois statute on the subject of notice is as follows: \u201cAssessment Hotiees\u2014Application of Funds.\u2014Assessment notices sent to members by any association or corporation doing business in this State shall state the object or objects for which the money to be collected is intended; the names, last address, and amount of certificates of deceased members, the amount to which the beneficiary of each is entitled, or the amount which would be realized for the beneficiaries of each if all the members who are assessed would pajr their assessments, and no part of the funds collected for the payment of death benefits shall b\u00e9 applied for any other purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The notice under consideration states that it is made in consequence of the death of seventy-two members of the association, whose names, addresses, and the numbers of whose claims are carefully stated in the notices. The notice states it is mortuary call Ho. 120. The contract and by-laws of the association define what is a mortuary call, and what it includes. We think' the notice was a full and fair compliance with the statute. Niblack, p. 481; McGowan v. Ins. Co., 28 N. Y. Sup., 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The eleventh assignment of error complains of the refusal of this special charge: \u201cIf, after Dr. Smith had earned the $37.50 in services rendered defendant, and had also contracted in good faith with an authorized agent (Carden) to take a policy, the membership fee to be rebated, and then Carden undertook to defraud Dr. Smith out of said $37.50, and if the defendant, knowing of such fraud on Carden\u2019s part, joined therein and became a party thereto, for the purpose of preventing Dr. Smith from collecting said debt, and to enable Carden to collect same, where he had no right to do so, and then paid same to Carden, but withheld from deceased the knowledge that he had done so, and led him to believe that the same had been applied to the payment of premiums which were to accrue and mature on'his policy in the future by use of the unexplained term \u2018advance premium,\u2019 then the forfeiture of policy for nonpayment of mortuary call Ho. 120 was void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The court did not err in refusing this special charge, for the reason that the evidence- did not warrant the presentation of such an issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">We find no error in the judgment. It is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">\u25a0 \u25a0 <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
