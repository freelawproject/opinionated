If, therefore, you find from the evidence that no notice was given to any station agent of the defendant company of said damages, you will find for the defendant; but if you find that notice was given, then you may find for the plaintiff only the kind and amount of damages as set out in said notice, provided the evidence shows the plaintiff to be entitled to that amount under all the instructions herein given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-8\">\u201cSixth\u2014If you find from the evidence that the shipment was made upon a written contract, and that in said contract defendant\u2019s liability was limited to its own route, then you are instructed that it would not be liable for any damage to said cattle after they were delivered by the defendant to its connecting line at Yinita, in the Indian Territory, and if you find that said damages, or any part of them, accrued beyond said terminal point of defendant\u2019s road, you will find for defendant, unless from the evidence you can find what part of the damage accrued upon defendant\u2019s road before being delivered to the connecting line, and if you can so find from the evidence, then you can find for the plaintiff the amount of damages only which the evidence shows was done to said stock upon defendant\u2019s line.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-9\">\u201cSeventh\u2014If you find that in the contract plaintiff agreed to give notice in writing to the conductors in charge of the same, or to some station agent of the defendant company of the condition of said cattle, and the defendant had said officers upon said train and at the terminal station at Yinita, and that plaintiff knew of that fact and could have easily made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>said report to said officer, then you are instructed that said requirement in said contract would be reasonable, and a failure on the part of the plaintiff to give said notice would defeat his cause of action, and if you so find you will find in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">\u201cEighth\u2014The shipment was made upon the written contract, and you will not consider the evidence as to what passed between the parties, with reference to the shipment, of said cattle prior to the signing of the contract, but in your consideration of the case, under the charge of the court, you will be governed entirely by the terms, stipulations, and agreements of the parties as set out and expressed in said written contract.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-6\">The argument of counsel and action of the court with reference thereto, referred to in the opinion, was as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-7\">\u201cM. E. Stringfellow, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, in his address to the jury, used the following language, to wit: \u2018Of course, this contract [referring to \u2018the written contract introduced by the defendant] was obtained by force and fraud. Mark Withers had no more chance to refuse to sign than if he stood before a highwayman with his pistol in hand. These corporations force the people to sign whatever they want them to, and we have no protection against them.\u2019 When upon objection by defendant that said language was not legitimate argument of the case or any facts in the ease, and was intended to excite and prejudice the minds of the jury against the defendant, the court instructed the jury to disregard the language used by the attorney, and permitted him to continue, as follows: \u2018You lctiow, and I know, that the people have no chance against them. We have to sign what they want us to, but the jurors can protect the people against them by declaring the contract void, and they ought to refuse to enforce a single one of them.\u2019 To which language the defendant again objected for the same reason as before, when the court, without stopping the attorney or directing the jury not to regard the language, stated to the defendant\u2019s attorney that he should have a bill.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-8\"><em>T. 8.

A corporation can only contract through its agents or officers, and the statement that an agreement is made with a corporation is a mere conclusion of the pleader, and when questioned by special demurrer the pleader should be compelled to state the agent or officer with whom the contract was made. The uncontroverted evidence shows that all prior negotiations were made in contemplation of the shipment being made under a written contract, which was in fact executed, and the terms of which were valid and binding (unless invalid because unreasonable), and all prior negotiations were merged in the written contract and could not he varied by parol evidence.

The clause of the contract providing that the shipper shall make reports of the condition of the cattle to the conductors at the end of each division, and to the station agent at the terminal station of Vinita, is reasonable, easy to be complied with, and binding.

If appellee had a verbal contract for the shipment of this stock, the court should not have submitted this theory of the case, because there is no evidence in the record that appellant\u2019s agent had any authority to make the contract as alleged by appellee, nor is there any evidence that he had ever been held out as having such authority, and under the law he had no implied authority to bind appellant by contract beyond its own line.

The pleadings and facts are substantially the same as set out in the case of Railway v. Carter, 29 Southwestern Reporter, 565. The suit here was for $1759, and verdict and judgment was for $920.80. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">We find the following facts: In May, 1892, appellee Withers and the appellant, through its agents, entered into a parol or verbal contract for shipment of the cattle in question, substantially as alleged by the plaintiff, whereby it was agreed, that the defendant would transport the cattle of plaintiff from Maxwell, Texas, to East St. Louis, and they were to be delivered by the appellant in East St. Louis on Tuesday morning, May 31, 1892, in time for that day\u2019s market. The cattle were shipped for sale in the market at that place, which fact was known to the agent of appellant. The agreement was .that the cattle were, to be loaded on the cars at Maxwell, Texas, by 1 or 2 o\u2019clock p. m., Saturday, May 28, 1892, and were to be sent on in a special train. The cattle were loaded on the train at Maxwell about 1 o\u2019clock p. m., May 28th, and the train started out about 2 or 3 o\u2019clock that evening. The agreement was that the cattle were to be run through to Vinita, Indian Territory, in twenty-six hours, and there were to have ten hours rest for feed and water. The cattle were delivered to and received by the railway company under this verbal or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>parol contract. We find that the agent- who entered into -the .contract with appellee had authority to make it. . \u25a0 . .</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">A few minutes before the train started, the appellee, at the request of the agent of the appellant, signed the written contract pleaded by the defendant. Before signing it he did not read it, and, as he says in his evidence, did not have time to read it before the train started, and did not know its contents. When the contract was signed the cattle were on board the ears, and the cars had been closed and sealed, and the evidence of plaintiff is to the effect that he supposed the contract signed by him was a pass for a man to go with the cattle and return. In the parol or verbal contract there were no conditions about signing reports as to the condition of the cattle, nor about filing claims for damages, or when suit should be brought. There does not appear-to be any additional or new considerations given for the execution of the written contract, or any additional advantage or privilege extended to. appellee in consideration of its execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The facts show substantially that the appellee sustained the damages in the way and manner stated in his pleadings, and that the appellant breached the contract in the manner there stated, and that by reason, thereof the damages resulted. The written contract signed by appellee as pleaded by appellant contains the stipulations set out in its pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"><em>Conclusions\u25a0 of </em>Law.\u2014This is the same shipment of cattle that was passed upon by this court in the case of -Railway v. Carter, 29 Southwestern Reporter, 565, and the controlling facts of this case are almost identical with that case, and the'principles of law there stated are controlling and applicable here. This case was also before this 'court, and is reported in 32 Southwestern Reporter, 906, in which the doctrine of the Carter case was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The Act of March 4, 1891, was in force when the contract in this case was entered into. In the Eddins case, 7 Texas Civil Appeals, 117 (26 Southwestern Reporter,' 162), and the Carter -ease, supra,-and in Reeves-v. Texas &amp; Pacific Railway, 32 Southwestern Reporter, 920, that act is held to apply to interstate shipments. The petition was sufficient in stating that the contract-of shipment was made With the company. There was no error in refusing the charges' requested as set out in the fourth assignment of error. The charge :of the' court fully presented all of the issues that should have been submitted to the jury. We are-not prepared, under the facts of this case, to say that the appellant, by the wrongful and, in effect, fraudulent manner in which it obtained an execution of the written contract set up by it, did not lay itself open to the charges made against it by the attorney for appellee in his argument. But, however, we do not believe that the remarks of counsel -to the jury influenced the verdict, as we are satisfied, from the case made by the facts, they would have found the way they did if this language had not been used. What has'been said concerning the charges given, and those refused, applies to the eighth, eleventh, and twelfth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>In response to the thirteenth assignment of error, we are .clearly of the opinion that the facts warrant the verdict and judgment. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
