Married Woman\u2019s Conveyance\u2014Deed of Confirmation Held Effectual.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-10\">Where a married woman\u2019s deed was void for want of proper separate acknowledgment by her, and she afterwards properly executed an instrument of confirmation, reciting the execution of the former deed, a copy of which was thereto attached, and stating her'purpose to then and thereby ratify and confirm the same so as to make.it effectual from the original date, the two instruments were construed together as one, the copy supplying the necessary words of grant and description, and were held effectual to convey the title from the date of the last instrument.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-11\">2.

The word \u201cthe\u201d after acknowledged has no more significance than an entire blank between \u201cacknowledged\u201d and \u201cexecuted\u201d would have; and as the certificate does not show that Mary and W. L. Sawyer appeared before the officer and acknowledged that they executed the instrument, the acknowledgment and also the deed are void. Huff v. Webb, 64 Texas, 286; Buell v. Irwin, 24 Mich., 152.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-16\">2. The omission of a vital word from a certificate of acknowledgment can not be cured by construction and reference to the context, and neither can it be cured by applying the doctrine of clerical omission. Huff v. Webb, supra; Buell v. Irving, supra; Moores v. Linney, 2 Texas Civ. App., 293; McDaniel v. Needham, 61 Texas, 271; McKie v. Anderson, 78 Texas, 210; Frost v.

A void act or deed can not be ratified or confirmed. \u201cConfirmation may make good a voidable or defeasible estate, but can not operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>upon or aid an estate which is void in law, but only \u2018confirms its infirmity.'\" The only exception to this rule is where the confirmation is the act of the sovereign will.\u201d Doe v. Howland, 8 Cow., 176; Jackson v. Stevens, 16 Johns., 110; Branham v. Mayor, 24 Cal., 585; Barr v. Schroeder, 32 Cal., 609; Chess v. Chess, 21 Am. Dec., 350; 3 Washb.

Hodges, 23 Texas, 104.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-5\">4. There is no contention on the part of the appellee that the original instrument was ever redelivered, or that it was ever reacknowledged as such, for it is not in evidence at all, and there is not a particle of testimony concerning it except as contained in the instrument of confirmation, and which, as appellants insist, can be nothing more than an attempted confirmation. Jordan v. Jordan, 9 S. &amp; R., 268; Barr v. Schroeder, 32 Cal., 609.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-6\"><em>W. C. Oliver, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av\">\u20141. The omission of the letter \u201cy\u201d from the word \u201cthey,\u201d before the words \u201cseverally acknowledged,\u201d in the acknowledgment of said deed, was a mere clerical omission and does not vitiate the acknowledgment. That \u201cthe\u201d was intended for \u201cthey\u201d is clear from the context. The omission of the word \u201cit\u201d after the word \u201cretract\u201d is immaterial, and does not render said acknowledgment void. Durst v. Daugherty, 81 Texas, 650; Gray v. Kaufman, 82 Texas, 65; Munroe v. Arledge, 23 Texas, 478.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-7\">2. The certified copy of the deed, dated August 30, 1845, was made part of the instrument executed October 1, 1859, and was admissible in evidence as a part thereof, in virtue of the acknowledgment made October 1, 1859.

The whole instrument executed October 1, 1859 (including as a part of it the deed of August 30, 1845), should be construed together, and so construing it the names of the grantors and all other requisites of a deed are therein contained.

Baker, clerk of said county, acting by John Allen Southyard, deputy, this day came and appeared Josiah T. Harral, of said county, to me well known, who, being duly sworn, declared that Mary and William L. Sawyer, signed, sealed with scrolls, and delivered the deed within, on the reverse hereof, as they severally declared, for the purposes set forth, and on the day of its date, that he, affiant, signed the same as a witness and recognizes all said signatures thereto as genuine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">\u201cW.

D. 1845, at one o\u2019clock.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">The second instrument set out is attached to the other, and is a certified copy of a deed recorded in Harris County on the 7th day of October, 1845. The instrument last executed, including such attached copy, was recorded as a whole in Harris County.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\">We are of the opinion that the two papers are to be treated as constituting but one deed, and that it was sufficient to pass the title which Mrs. Sawyer had to the land at the date of its execution, October 1, 1859. It may be true, as contended by appellants, that the deed of 1845 was void, because it was not acknowledged by Mrs. Sawyer. It is also true that, being a nullity, it could not be confirmed by the subsequent deed, so as to have any validity of its own. The attempt to confirm it could not change the fact that the title had not previously passed out of Mrs. Sawyer, or retroactively impart to the nullity an efficacy which it had not before possessed. But, at the date of the second instrument, Mrs. Sawyer was still the owner of the land and had capacity to convey it by complying with the law. An attempt to confirm a void deed, so as to make it operative, may fail to effect that purpose, but may still operate as a new grant. Chester v. Builting, 32 S. W. Rep., 527; Doe v. Howland, 8 Cow., 277; Jackson v. Stevens, 16 Johns., 110; Barr v. Schroeder, 32 Cal., 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">In some of the authorities it is said that such effect may be given to the deed of confirmation if apt words to convey the title in praesenti are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>employed. In order that the deed shall so operate, we think it is only essential that the intention to convey should appear, and such intention could hardly be more effectually expressed than by saying that a deed by which the party had undertaken to convey the land at a past time shall operate from such date. As surely as the greater includes the less, and the whole all of its parts, the expression of an intention to make a deed operate for all time from a past date includes the intent that it shall operate from the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">So the objection urged by appellants that the confirming deed does not expressly purport by its own terms to convey the title, can not be sustained. Besides, the true view of the matter, as before stated, is that the instrument last signed by Sawyer and wife is not the whole of the deed. By its reference to the attached document it imported into, and made part of itself, the terms of that paper, which supplied everything essential to a complete conveyance. 3 Dev. on Deeds, see. 1030; Martindale on Conv., sec. 108; Harlowe v. Hudgins, 19 S. W. Rep., 364; Herndon v. Vick, 33 S. W. Bep., 1011; same case, 35 S. W. Rep., 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The objections urged to the acknowledgment are not good. The use of the word \"the,\u201d where \"they\u201d should appear, clearly results from the clerical omission of the letter \u201cy.\u201d The certificate, when read altogether, plainly shows that the grantors in the instrument were the persons who acknowledged it. It could be held to render the certificate insufficient only under a strictness of construction applied in our courts to no other instruments. The omission of the word \"it\u201d at the end of the certificate is equally unimportant. The wish expressed, not to retract, could have reference to nothing but that which the party had just acknowledged she had done. Moores v. Linney, 3 Texas Civ. App., 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The judgment of the court below is correct, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
