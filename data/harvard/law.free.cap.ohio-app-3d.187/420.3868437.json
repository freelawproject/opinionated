App.R. 11.1, which governs accelerated-calendar cases, provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 3} \u201c(E) Determination and judgment on appeal. The appeal will be determined as provided by App.R. 11.1. It shall be sufficient compliance with App.R. 12(A) for the statement of the reason for the court\u2019s decision as to each error to be in brief and conclusionary form. The decision may be by judgment entry in which case it will not be published in any form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 4} This appeal shall be considered in accordance with the aforementioned rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">{\u00b6 5} The relevant facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant, the Golf Club of Dublin, L.L.C. (\u201cGCD\u201d) is an Ohio limited-liability company that owned and operated a golf course by the same name and related club activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">{\u00b6 7} In July 2007, GCD entered into a loan agreement with appellee General Electric Capital Corporation (\u201cGECC\u201d) for a loan of up to $8.5 million in connection with the golf course.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The note and other supporting loan documents evidencing GCD\u2019s obligations to GECC are secured by the mortgage. As demonstrated by the acknowledgements attached to the mortgage and other loan documents, the documents providing the basis for this litigation were executed in Delaware County.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">{\u00b6 8} On June 9, 2009, following GCD\u2019s default of its obligations under the note, mortgage, and other loan documents, GECC filed a complaint for foreclosure in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas (\u201cthe complaint\u201d), seeking judgment on a certain promissory note (\u201cthe note\u201d), foreclosure of an open-end <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>leasehold mortgage, security agreement, and fixture filing (\u201cthe mortgage\u201d), and to enforce other rights under the related loan documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 9} Contemporaneous with the complaint for foreclosure, GECC also filed a motion for the immediate appointment of a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 10} Hours before a scheduled hearing on the receivership motion, an involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition was filed pursuant to Section 303, Title 11, U.S.Code against GCD (the \u201cChapter 11 case\u201d). Counsel for the Chapter 11 petitioning creditors also filed a suggestion of stay in the trial court, requesting that the matter be stayed as a result of the automatic stay imposed by Section 362, Title 11, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 11} Based on the suggestion of stay, the hearing on GECC\u2019s motion for the immediate appointment of a receiver was continued and this case was placed on the court\u2019s inactive docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 12} Less than two weeks after the imposition of the stay, GECC filed an emergency motion for relief from stay in the Chapter 11 case. GECC asked that the bankruptcy court modify the automatic stay imposed by Section 362, Title 11, U.S.Code to allow the instant case to proceed in the trial court for the limited purpose of seeking the appointment of a receiver over GCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 13} On September 25, 2009, the bankruptcy court entered an unopposed order granting General Electric Capital Corporation\u2019s motion for relief from the automatic stay (\u201cthe unopposed order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 14} On October 9, 2009, based on the unopposed order, GECC moved the trial court to return the case to its active docket for the purpose of allowing GECC to seek the appointment of a receiver over GCD.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">{\u00b6 15} By judgment entry filed October 13, 2009, the trial court granted the motion and set an October 19, 2009 hearing date on GECC\u2019s motion to appoint a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">{\u00b6 16} On October 16, 2009, GCD filed a motion to transfer venue to the Franklin County Common Pleas Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">{\u00b6 17} On October 19, 2009, GECC filed its opposition to GCD\u2019s motion to transfer venue. GCD filed its reply on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">{\u00b6 18} On October 19, 2009, the trial court held a hearing on GECC\u2019s motion for immediate appointment of a receiver and GCD\u2019s motion to transfer venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">{\u00b6 19} On December 9, 2009, the trial court entered a revised entry and order granting plaintiffs motion for an order appointing a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">{\u00b6 20} By a separate order entered December 9, 2009, the trial court also denied GCD\u2019s motion to transfer venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Appellant, the Golf Club of Dublin, now appeals, assigning the following errors for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cI. The Delaware County Court of Common Pleas erred when it appointed a receiver in a case that was not properly venued in Delaware County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cII. The Delaware County Court of Common Pleas erred when it based its appointment of a receiver on its erroneous determination that venue was proper in Delaware County when there was no evidence in the record to support that determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cIII. The Delaware County Court of Common Pleas erred when it based its appointment of a receiver on its erroneous determination that venue was proper in Delaware County where the claim of proper venue relied upon an argument, unsupported by evidence, that the principal place of business of the defendant had been in Delaware County at the time prior to when the alleged cause of action arose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">I, II, III</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 25} Because appellant\u2019s assignments of error are interrelated and all assign error to the finding of proper venue and the appointment of a receiver in Delaware County, we shall address the assignments of error simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">{\u00b6 26} While conceding that a denial of a motion to transfer venue is not a final, appealable order, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s appointment of a receiver in this matter allows this court to consider the trial court\u2019s venue determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">{\u00b6 27} We find this tack to be unpersuasive. The only issue raised in this appeal is the issue of proper venue and the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to transfer venue to Franklin County. Appellant does not in any other way challenge the trial court\u2019s decision appointing the receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant\u2019s motion to transfer venue was brought pursuant to Civ.R. 3(B) and (C). To be appealable, an order must be a final order, within the meaning of R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">{\u00b6 29} R.C. 2505.02 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-15\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cAn order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-16\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>{\u00b6 32} \u201c(2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(3) An order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy and to which both of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(a) The order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(b) The appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(5) An order that determines that an action may or may not be maintained as a class action.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(B)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">{\u00b6 38} We find that R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) does not apply because the trial court\u2019s judgment in the case sub judice does not determine the action or prevent a judgment. The question of venue or choice of forum is procedural and does not decide a party\u2019s claims. See <em>Duryee v. Rogers </em>(Dec. 16, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 74963, 1999 WL 1204875.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">{\u00b6 39} Likewise, this was not an order in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment, nor was it an order that vacated or set aside a judgment or granted a new trial. See id.; R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) and (3). Nor does the order involve a determination as to whether a class action may be maintained. R.C. 2505.02(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">{\u00b6 40} The only possible applicable section is paragraph 4, regarding provisional remedies. \u201cProvisional remedy\u201d means \u201ca proceeding ancillary to an action, including, but not limited to, a proceeding for a preliminary injunction, attachment, discovery of privileged matter, or suppression of evidence.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(3). The statutory definition does not specifically refer to proceedings to transfer venue, nor are any of the listed proceedings akin to a transfer of venue. See <em>Duryee, </em>1999 WL 1204875. The basic purpose of R.C. 2505.02(A)(3) in categorizing certain types of preliminary decisions of a trial court as final, appealable orders is the protection of one party against irreparable harm by another party during the pendency of the litigation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">{\u00b6 41} We find that a decision by a trial court denying a motion for transfer of venue does not involve the same degree of risk of irreparable harm to a party as the decisions made in the types of actions listed under R.C. 2505.02(A)(3). The types of provisional remedies listed under R.C. 2505.02(A)(3) include decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>that when made preliminarily, could decide all or part of an action or make an ultimate decision on the merits meaningless or cause other irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 42} This court has previously held that the denial of a request to change venue is not a final, appealable order. <em>Mansfield Family Restaurant v. CGS Worldwide, Inc. </em>(Dec. 28, 2000), Richland App. No. 00-CA-3, 2000 WL 1886226. In <em>Mansfield, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cThe decision to deny a change of venue does not result in any of the types of irreparable harm just listed. There is an adequate legal remedy from a decision denying a change of venue, after final judgment. In other words, it may be expensive to get the cat back in the bag, if a trial court errs when it denies a change of venue, but it can be done.\u201d Id. at *2. See also <em>Buxton v. Mancuso, </em>Knox App. No. 09 CA 22, 2009-Ohio-6839, 2009 WL 5062015.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 44} We therefore find that a denial of a motion to transfer venue is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 45} Accordingly, we find that the December 9, 2009, judgment entry is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">{\u00b6 46} For the reasons stated in the foregoing opinion, the appeal of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Ohio, is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b463-11\">Farmer, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b463-12\">Hoffman, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-15\">. The land that is the subject of the foreclosure is owned by the city of Dublin and leased to GCD.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b463-13\">Hoffman, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">{\u00b6 47} While I acknowledge and agree with the majority that appellant is indirectly challenging the trial court\u2019s interlocutory order denying a change of venue, I nevertheless disagree with its decision to dismiss this appeal for want of a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">{\u00b6 48} It is well settled that the appointment of a receiver is a final, appealable order. <em>Jamestown Village Condominium Owners Assn. v. Market Media Research, Inc. </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 678, 645 N.E.2d 1265; <em>Mandalaywala v. Zaleski </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 321, 706 N.E.2d 344; <em>Community First Bank &amp; Trust v. Dafoe, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 472, 2006-Ohio-1503, 844 N.E.2d 825,</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">{\u00b6 49} Because appellant\u2019s claim of error in the appointment of the receiver is based solely on the claim of improper venue, I would find that that claim is insufficient, as a matter of law, to reverse the trial court\u2019s appointment of a receiver; therefore, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
