Binder, in an action for damages following a motor vehicle accident. On appeal, appellants, Samantha, Tammy, and Kenneth Clonch, set forth the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-16\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cAssignment of Error No. 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe Court erred in entering summary judgment for the Defendant, Binder, where there were genuine questions of material facts shown to exist as to her right to control her vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-18\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cAssignment of Error No. 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe Court erred in awarding summary judgment where as a matter of law the non moving party established a rebuttable presumption of the Defendant, Naquel Binder\u2019s, liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 6} On July 6, 2002, Binder, Binder\u2019s daughter, Amanda, her boyfriend, Lancan Holbrook, and Amanda\u2019s friend, Samantha Clonch, were involved in an automobile accident while returning to Fremont, Ohio, from King\u2019s Island amusement park. It was determined after investigation that the accident had occurred because Holbrook, who was driving a minivan owned by Binder, had failed to stop at a stop sign. As a result of Holbrook\u2019s actions, the minivan collided with another vehicle, killing the driver of that vehicle and severely injuring Samantha Clonch, who remains partially paralyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 7} Samantha and her parents filed a complaint against Holbrook, Binder, and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company in the Erie County Court of Common Pleas, on October 13, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint sought damages from Holbrook, as the driver of the minivan; Binder, as the vehicle\u2019s owner; and State Farm, as the separate insurer of both Holbrook and Binder. Holbrook and Binder answered the complaint on December 8 and December 10, 2006, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 8} On January 4, 2007, Holbrook filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, in which he stated that any financial obligations arising from the accident had been discharged in bankruptcy. That same day, Holbrook filed a motion to change venue, in which he argued that Sandusky County, not Erie County, was the proper venue, because both defendants lived in Sandusky County.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">{\u00b6 9} On January 16, 2007, State Farm filed an answer in which it admitted that Binder\u2019s insurance policy provided $100,000 in medical coverage per accident. However, State Farm denied coverage under Holbrook\u2019s separate policy because he was not driving his own vehicle at the time of the accident. State Farm also asserted that it was not responsible to pay under the liability portion of Binder\u2019s policy for damages arising from Holbrook\u2019s negligence. On January 30, 2007, the trial court issued a judgment entry in which it granted Holbrook\u2019s motion to change venue and ordered the case transferred to Sandusky County.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">{\u00b6 10} Binder filed a motion for summary judgment in the Sandusky Court of Common Pleas on July 16, 2007, in which she asserted that she was not liable for Holbrook\u2019s negligence solely by virtue of her status as an owner-passenger in the minivan at the time of the accident. In support, Binder argued that there is no basis on which to impute liability to her because she did not exercise any control over how Holbrook drove the minivan on July 6, 2002. Attached to Binder\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>motion was her own affidavit, along with Holbrook\u2019s affidavit and a copy of a police report that showed that, at the time of the accident, Holbrook was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">{\u00b6 11} Binder stated in her affidavit that Holbrook drove the minivan with her permission because he was a more experienced driver and because her minivan accommodated more passengers than Holbrook\u2019s truck. Binder also stated that she \u201cdid not direct the operation of the van by Lancan Holbrook on the trip in any manner.\u201d Binder stated that she and Holbrook were not engaged in a business venture of any kind with respect to the minivan or the trip to King\u2019s Island. In addition to confirming Binder\u2019s statements, Holbrook stated in his affidavit that he has a good driving record as an adult, and the trip to King\u2019s Island was for pleasure and was not \u201cbusiness related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 12} On July 27, 2007, the trial court denied Holbrook\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, the trial court stated that due to the discharge of Holbrook\u2019s debts in bankruptcy, any recovery from Holbrook would be limited to insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 13} On September 10, 2007, State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment, in which it stated that \u201c[bjoth Defendants Holbrook and Binder had automobile liability insurance policies with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company\u201d at the time of the accident. However, State Farm argued that no benefits are available pursuant to Holbrook\u2019s policy, and appellants are entitled to medical and liability benefits, if any, only through Binder\u2019s automobile insurance policy. State Farm also argued that appellants\u2019 claim that State Farm acted in bad faith by refusing to pay benefits pursuant to Holbrook\u2019s policy should be dismissed. Attached to State Farm\u2019s motion were copies of Binder\u2019s and Holbrook\u2019s State Farm policies and the affidavits of Holbrook, Binder, and State Farm insurance agent William Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">{\u00b6 14} On November 13, 2007, the trial court issued a judgment entry in which it found that genuine issues of fact remained as to whether Holbrook\u2019s negligence could be attributed to Binder, thereby obligating State Farm to pay additional benefits under Binder\u2019s policy. Accordingly, the trial court denied Binder\u2019s and State Farm\u2019s motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">{\u00b6 15} On May 16, 2008, with leave of court, State Farm filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether appellants were entitled to additional benefits under Holbrook\u2019s automobile insurance policy. On June 10, 2008, Binder filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether she had control of the minivan at the time of accident, thereby making her liable for Holbrook\u2019s negligence. In support of her motion, Binder relied on her deposition testimony and that of Holbrook, which was not available when Binder filed her previous motions for summary judgment. In his deposition, Holbrook stated that he had driven Binder\u2019s vehicle to and from King\u2019s Island, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>and that he alone had determined the route for the trip, during which Binder did not physically operate the vehicle or control its operation in any way. In her deposition, Binder confirmed Holbrook\u2019s statements that he controlled the vehicle. The trial court denied both supplemental motions for summary judgment on July 18, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">{\u00b6 16} On March 24, 2009, with leave of court, State Farm filed a motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s February 24, 2009 judgment entry. On March 26, 2009, Binder filed a separate motion for reconsideration, in which she asked the trial court to revisit the issue of whether she remained in control of her vehicle while it was driven by Holbrook. In support of her argument, Binder once again relied on her own and Holbrook\u2019s deposition testimony, in which they both stated that Binder did not drive or direct Holbrook as to how to drive the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 17} On April 20, 2009, appellants filed a motion to strike Binder\u2019s motion for reconsideration. In support, appellants argued that the motion was not properly before the trial court because Binder did not ask for or receive permission to file a motion for reconsideration. On May 8, 2009, following a telephone conference call with all parties, the trial court denied appellants\u2019 motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 18} On July 23, 2009, the trial court issued a judgment entry in which it found, based on evidence submitted by the parties, \u201cthat there are no material facts in dispute; and, construing the material facts most strongly in favor of [appellants,] [Binder] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court granted Binder\u2019s motion for reconsideration and dismissed that complaint against her. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment on August 21, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">{\u00b6 19} In their first assignment of error, appellants assert that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Binder because issues of fact remain as to whether she had the right to control the minivan that was driven by Holbrook. In their second assignment of error, appellants assert that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to Binder because Binder had failed to rebut the presumption that she was liable for damages resulting from Holbrook\u2019s negligence. Because appellants\u2019 two assignments of error are related, we will address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">{\u00b6 20} We note at the outset that an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard used by the trial court. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198; <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Summary judgment will be granted when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and, when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">{\u00b6 21} In support of both assignments of error, appellants rely on <em>Ross v. Burgan </em>(1955), 163 Ohio St. 211, 56 O.O. 218, 126 N.E.2d 592, in which the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c1. Where the owner of a motor vehicle being driven by another is an occupant thereof, a rebuttable presumption or inference arises that the owner has control over it and that the driver is acting as his agent in operating the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 23} <em>\u201c2. </em>In the absence of evidence to rebut such presumption, any negligence of the driver in operating the motor vehicle is imputable to the owner riding therein.\u201d Id., syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Combs </em>(1964), 2 Ohio App.2d 17, 31 O.O.2d 38, 206 N.E.2d 36, the Second District Court of Appeals, analyzing <em>Ross v. Burgan, </em>163 Ohio St. 211, 56 O.O. 218, 126 N.E.2d 592, stated that it is the owner-passenger\u2019s <em>right to control </em>the vehicle, not whether he or she actually controlled it, that ultimately determines whether the driver\u2019s negligence should be imputed to the owner-passenger. Id. at 18, 31 O.O.2d 38, 206 N.E.2d 36. However, other Ohio appellate courts have addressed both the right to control the vehicle <em>and </em>whether the driver was acting as the agent of the owner-passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 25} For example, in <em>Tittle v. Maurer </em>(Oct. 23, 1995), 3d Dist. No. 17-95-5, 1995 WL 641273, the appellate court first addressed the rebuttable presumption that the owner-passenger had the right to control the vehicle, followed by a determination as to whether the parties were engaged in a \u201cjoint enterprise\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> such that the driver was acting as the agent of the owner-passenger. See also <em>Collazo v. Myers </em>(June 25, 1975), 9th Dist. No. 2276, 1975 WL 180607 (after evidence as to whether the owner-passenger had the right to control the driver is introduced, the issue of agency becomes a question of fact to be submitted to the jury); and <em>Elramahi v. Kovach </em>(Jan. 27, 1983), 8th Dist. Nos. 44892 and 44897, 1983 WL 5710 (evidence that the owner-passenger had no control over the driver\u2019s actions was sufficient to rebut the presumption of an agency relationship, thereby defeating the presumption of liability for the driver\u2019s actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">{\u00b6 26} Upon consideration of the foregoing, we find that in cases where a third party seeks damages from the owner-passenger of a vehicle due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>negligence of the driver, it is necessary to analyze whether the owner-passenger had the right to control the vehicle <em>and </em>whether the driver was acting as the agent of the owner-passenger. If sufficient evidence is presented to rebut either presumption, an issue of fact arises that must be resolved by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 27} In this case, the record shows that at the time of the accident, Binder and Holbrook lived together. Holbrook stated that he had permission to drive Binder\u2019s minivan to King\u2019s Island, and he had driven the vehicle on other occasions. Binder stated that she did not know what route Holbrook took to King\u2019s Island. When asked whether Holbrook generally would follow her directions if she told him how to drive, Binder responded: \u201cJust depends.\u201d The record also contains evidence that Holbrook drove Binder\u2019s minivan because his pickup truck was not big enough to hold four people.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 28} Both Holbrook and Binder stated that Binder did not direct Holbrook\u2019s driving in any way. Holbrook stated in his deposition that he had his own set of keys for the minivan, and although he sometimes told Binder when he was going to use the vehicle, he did not need her express permission to drive it. When Holbrook was asked if he would stop the minivan at Binder\u2019s direction, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQuestion: So, again, whatever, wouldn\u2019t matter what she requested, you\u2019re saying it was totally up to you even though it wasn\u2019t your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cAnswer: Yeah, it\u2019s up to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">{\u00b6 31} This court has reviewed the entire record that was before the trial court and, upon consideration thereof, finds that, as a matter of law, a rebuttable presumption arises that Binder had the right to control the minivan and that Holbrook was acting as her agent by driving to and from King\u2019s Island on July 6, 2002. We find further that the record contains evidence sufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact as to whether the presumption was rebutted in this case. Accordingly, the trial court erred by granting Binder\u2019s motion for reconsideration of summary judgment and dismissing the complaint against her. Appellants\u2019 two assignments of error are, therefore, well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">{\u00b6 32} The judgment of the Sandusky Court of Common Pleas is hereby reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b614-12\">Singer and Cosme, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-10\">.
