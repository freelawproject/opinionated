Smith, appeals the decision of the Lawrence County Court of Common Pleas, Probate-Juvenile Division. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision granting the request of petitionerappellee, Derek R. Jones, to change the surname of the parties\u2019 child. Because the language of the judgment entry indicates the trial court might not have undertaken an independent review of the objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, we sustain appellant\u2019s first assignment of error and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">{\u00b6 2} Smith gave birth to a child in March 2008; at the time, she was unmarried. Smith gave the child her surname and did not list the name of the father on the birth certificate. Approximately three months later, Jones initiated judicial proceedings to establish paternity and to determine associated issues, including child support and parenting time. Jones also requested that the child\u2019s surname be changed to that of his own. The matter proceeded to trial before the magistrate, and all matters, except the name change, were agreed upon or decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 3} After taking the matter under advisement, the magistrate issued a decision finding that it was in the child\u2019s best interest to change the child\u2019s surname from Smith to Jones. Smith filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, and the matter was scheduled for hearing before the trial court. After a full hearing, the trial court subsequently upheld the magistrate\u2019s decision. Smith then timely filed the current appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">I. The trial court applied the wrong standard of review on objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">II. The trial court\u2019s decision to change the surname of the minor child was based upon insufficient evidence and is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">III. First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">{\u00b6 4} In her first assignment of error, Smith argues that the trial court erred by reviewing her objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision under the wrong standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">{\u00b6 5} The Supreme Court of Ohio has listed the factors a trial court should consider in deciding whether to change a child\u2019s surname. \u201c[W]e hold that in determining whether a change of a minor\u2019s surname is in the best interest of the child, the trial court should consider the following factors: the effect of the change on the preservation and development of the child\u2019s relationship with each parent; the identification of the child as part of a family unit; the length of time that the child has used a surname; the preference of the child if the child is of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>sufficient maturity to express a meaningful preference; whether the child\u2019s surname is different from the surname of the child\u2019s residential parent; the embarrassment, discomfort, or inconvenience that may result when a child bears a surname different from the residential parent\u2019s; parental failure to maintain contact with and support of the child; and any other factor relevant to the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d <em>In re Willhite </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 28, 32, 706 N.E.2d 778, citing <em>Bobo v. Jewell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 330, 528 N.E.2d 180, paragraph two of the syllabus, and <em>In re Change of Name of Andrews, </em>235 Neb. 170, 177, 454 N.W.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">{\u00b6 6} Further, the Supreme Court cautioned trial courts against using a best-interest analysis to give greater weight to the father\u2019s interest in having the child bear his surname than the mother\u2019s. \u201cWhile it may be a custom to name a child after the father, giving greater weight to the father\u2019s interest fails to consider that, where the parents have never been married, the mother has at least an equal interest in having the child bear the maternal surname. In these times of parental equality, arguing that the child of unmarried parents should bear the paternal surname based on custom is another way of arguing that it is permissible to discriminate because the discrimination has endured for many years.\u201d <em>Bobo </em>at 334, 528 N.E.2d 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 7} In the case sub judice, though the magistrate\u2019s decision did engage in the required best-interest analysis, we do not reach a review of that analysis, because the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision using an appellate standard of review. In its judgment entry upholding the magistrate\u2019s decision, the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe Court finds the Magistrate properly considered the issues before the Court and rendered a decision, which did not indicate an abuse of discretion. The Magistrate\u2019s Decision was not unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary as the focus on the decision was based upon the best interest of the child. The defendant, through counsel, makes effort to frame the Magistrate\u2019s Decision in a manner, which could render the decision inconsistent with Ohio law. However the Court finds the argument to be without merit. Therefore the court adopts the Magistrate\u2019s Decision filed on January 9, 2009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">{\u00b6 9} Under Juv.R. 40, \u201c[i]f one or more objections to a magistrate\u2019s decision are timely filed, the court shall rule on those objections. In ruling on objections, the court shall undertake an independent review as to the objected matters to ascertain that the magistrate has properly determined the factual issues and appropriately applied the law.\u201d Juv.R. 40(D)(4)(d). That rule, like the identically worded Civ.R. 53(D)(4)(d), \u201ccontemplates a de novo review of any issue of fact or law that a magistrate has determined when an appropriate objection is timely filed. The trial court may not properly defer to the magistrate in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>exercise of the trial court\u2019s de novo review. The magistrate is a subordinate officer of the trial court, not an independent officer performing a separate function.\u201d <em>Knauer v. Keener </em>(2001), 143 Ohio App.3d 789, 794, 758 N.E.2d 1234.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A trial court errs when it reviews a magistrate\u2019s decision using an appellate standard of review because such action prevents an appellate court from conducting the appropriate review of the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Francis v. McDermott, </em>2nd Dist. No. 1744, 2008-Ohio-6723, 2008 WL 5273258, at \u00b6 14; <em>Quick v. Kwiatkowski </em>(Aug. 3, 2001), 2nd Dist. No. 18620, 2001 WL 871406, at *4. In such instances, reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision and remand of the proceedings are required. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">{\u00b6 10} An appellate court presumes that a trial court performed an independent analysis of a magistrate\u2019s decision. <em>Mahlerwein v. Mahlerwein, </em>160 Ohio App.3d 564, 2005-Ohio-1835, 828 N.E.2d 153, at \u00b6 47. Therefore, the party asserting error must affirmatively demonstrate that the trial court failed to conduct the independent analysis. <em>Arnold, v. Arnold, </em>4th Dist. No. 04CA36, 2005-Ohio-5272, 2005 WL 2416378, at \u00b6 31; <em>Mahlerwein </em>at \u00b6 47. Further, simply because a trial court adopted a magistrate\u2019s decision does not mean that the court failed to exercise independent judgment. <em>State ex rel. Scioto Cty. Child Support Enforcement Agency v. Adams </em>(July 23, 1999), 4th Dist. No. 98CA2617, 1999 WL 597257, at *9.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">{\u00b6 11} Here, Jones does not contest that the trial court was required to review the magistrate\u2019s decision under a de novo standard of review. Rather, he argues that the court did, in fact, review and confirm the magistrate\u2019s decision using that standard. Conversely, Smith argues that the language of the trial court\u2019s judgment entry indicates that the trial court used an appellate standard of review. We agree. Because the trial court used such language, we cannot affirmatively conclude that it conducted the required independent review of the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Quick v. Kwiatkowski, </em>the Second District Court of Appeals, when presented with a similar scenario, stated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 standard that the trial court applied to review the decision of its magistrate is an appellate standard of review. It is applicable to the review performed by a superior court of the judgments and orders of inferior courts. Inherent in the abuse of discretion standard are presumptions of validity and correctness, which acknowledge the independence of the inferior courts by deferring to the particular discretion they exercise in rendering their decisions. Because its magistrate does not enjoy that independence, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>presumptions are inappropriate to the trial court\u2019s review of a magistrate\u2019s decisions. Therefore, a trial court errs when it applies the abuse of discretion standard of review * * <em>Quick </em>at *3, quoting <em>Rammel v. Rammel </em>(May 9, 1997), 2nd Dist. No. 15887, 1997 WL 337668, at *3. See also <em>Francis </em>at \u00b6 15-17; <em>Kimmel v. Shaffer, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2009-05-015, 2009-Ohio-5279, 2009 WL 3165588, at \u00b6 16; Reese <em>v. Reese, </em>3rd Dist. No. 14-03-42, 2004-Ohio-1395, 2004 WL 549812, at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">(\u00b6 14} In <em>Quick, </em>the trial court\u2019s decision was reversed even though it did not use the phrase \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d or other terms denoting the adoption of a deferential standard of review. In the case sub judice, the trial court specifically stated that the magistrate\u2019s decision \u201cdid not indicate an abuse of discretion\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Magistrate\u2019s Decision was not unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary.\u201d Whether or not it was the trial court\u2019s intent, that language implies that the trial court used the appellate abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing the magistrate\u2019s decision. Therefore, we are unable to conclude that the trial court independently, and without deference to the magistrate, reviewed the matter before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, we sustain Smith\u2019s first assignment of error and remand the matter to allow the trial court to independently review the objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision or, if it has already undertaken an independent review, to enter a judgment entry devoid of language indicating that it employed a deferential review. As Smith\u2019s first assignment of error requires remand, we decline to address her remaining assignment of error.
