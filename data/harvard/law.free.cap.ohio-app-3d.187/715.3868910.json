(\u201cSFJV\u201d) concerning real property owned by Paul and Donna Ream. The hospitals claim that the trial court erred in granting judgment to SFJV entering a decree of foreclosure and confirming the sale of the property. For the following reasons, the trial court\u2019s judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">{\u00b6 2} The evidence at trial established the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">{\u00b6 3} In July 2000, Paul and Donna Ream entered into a land contract with Richard and Marilyn Freyhof for the purchase of the property located at 471 Gwynne Street in Urbana, Champaign County, Ohio. In April 2004, the Reams completed the land contract and received a survivorship deed (in both their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>names) for the property. To finance the purchase, Donna Ream obtained a loan from and gave a note to American Mortgage Service Company (\u201cAMSC\u201d) in the amount of $64,705. Due to Paul Ream\u2019s financial and employment situation, he was not included on the note. The accompanying mortgage identified Donna Ream as the mortgagor/borrower. However, at closing, Paul Ream initialed each page and signed the signature page as a \u201cborrower\u201d below his wife\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">{\u00b6 4} Within 30 days of closing, AMSC indorsed the note to Washington Mutual Bank FA. Washington Mutual subsequently indorsed the note twice \u2014 to Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) and to SFJV. HUD also indorsed the note to SFJV.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">{\u00b6 5} The mortgage was held by Mortgage Electronic Registrations Systems, Inc. (\u201cMERS\u201d), as nominee for AMSC. In December 2005, MERS assigned the mortgage to HUD. A couple of months later, HUD assigned the mortgage to SFJV 2004-1, L.L.C., which, in May 2007, assigned the mortgage to SFJV. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a successor by merger to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, executed the assignment of mortgage from SFJV 2004-1, L.L.C., to SFJV pursuant to a limited power of attorney from SFJV 2004-1, L.L.C., to Wells Fargo Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">{\u00b6 6} SFJV entered into a servicing agreement with EMC Mortgage SFJV 2005 (\u201cEMC\u201d), whereby EMC was authorized to service mortgages on SFJV\u2019s behalf. In accordance with that servicing agreement, EMC appointed Wells Fargo Bank as the subservicer of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">{\u00b6 7} In 2005, Donna Ream defaulted on her loan, and a foreclosure action was filed. In October 2006, Wells Fargo Bank, doing business as America\u2019s Servicing Company, entered into a loan-modification agreement with Donna Ream. As part of the agreement, the principal balance was modified to $67,695.45. The foreclosure action was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">{\u00b6 8} Donna Ream again defaulted on her loan. As a result, in May 2007, SFJV filed a complaint for foreclosure and reformation of mortgage. Miami Valley Hospital was named as a defendant due to a judgment lien obtained by the hospital against the Reams in September 2005. Mercy Memorial Hospital was subsequently added, with leave of court, due to a judgment lien obtained by that hospital against the Reams in August 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">{\u00b6 9} SFJV filed an amended complaint in December 2007. In that complaint, SFJV sought an equitable lien, a constructive trust, and a resulting trust as to Paul Ream\u2019s one-half interest in the property. It also sought reformation of the mortgage to fully secure Paul Ream\u2019s interest in the property. SFJV requested that it be granted judgment on the note against Donna Ream, that it be found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>have first lien priority (subject to any lien by the county treasurer), and that the property be foreclosed and sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 10} A trial on the matter was held on October 22, 2008, during which evidence was presented as to whether Paul Ream had mortgaged his interest in the property, whether SFJV was the real party in interest, and the balance due on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">{\u00b6 11} On January 21, 2009, the trial court found that Donna Ream had signed a note secured by a mortgage in favor of SFJV\u2019s predecessor in interest and that SFJV was the holder of the note. The balance on the note had been modified pursuant to a loan-modification agreement signed by Donna Ream and America\u2019s Servicing Company. The court further found that the balance due under the note, as modified, was $67,400.32, plus interest at a rate of 6.5 percent per annum from January 1, 2007, plus court costs, advances, and other charges as allowed by law. The court ordered judgment in favor of SFJV and against Donna Ream in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 12} With respect to the mortgage, the court found that the mortgage signed by Donna and Paul Ream \u201csecures the entire property, not just the interest held by Defendant Donna Ream.\u201d Thus, the court found \u201cthat the mortgage is valid on its face and that, by signing and initialing the mortgage, Defendants Donna and Paul Ream: (a) mortgaged, granted, and conveyed their interest in the respective property; (b) covenanted that they were lawfully seised of the estate; and (c) accepted and agreed to the terms and covenants contained in the body of the mortgage.\u201d The court found that SFJV\u2019s claims for reformation and equitable relief were moot. The court ordered SFJV to submit a proposed decree of foreclosure for review by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">{\u00b6 13} On February 9, 2009, the court entered a judgment and decree in foreclosure, and it ordered the property to be sold. On February 27, 2009, SFJV filed a praecipe for order of sale for 471 Gwynne Street. An order of sale was issued on the same date. The house was appraised to be worth $25,000, and the sheriffs sale was scheduled for April 24, 2009. Kelly Shank of the Urbana Daily Citizen, a daily newspaper published in Urbana, filed an affidavit stating that a notice of the sheriffs sale (which was attached to the affidavit) was published \u201cthree consecutive weeks and next after March 24, 2009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">{\u00b6 14} On April 24, 2009, the sheriff sold the property to SFJV for $38,000. The sheriffs return of the writ of execution was filed three days later. On June 17, 2009, the trial court confirmed the sale of the property, directed that the property be conveyed to SFJV, and ordered distribution of the proceeds of the sale to the appropriate parties. The order confirming the sale consisted of a proposed entry by SFJV\u2019s counsel with handwritten modifications by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>{\u00b6 15} The hospitals appeal from the judgment and decree of foreclosure and the confirmation of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 16} In case No. 09-CA-07, the hospitals appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment and decree in foreclosure, raising three assignments of error. We will address the assignments in an order that facilitates our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">\n<em>A. Interpretation of the Mortgage Document</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 17} The hospitals\u2019 first and third assignments of error state:</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe trial court erred in holding as a matter of law that, on its face, the mortgage encumbered the entire property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">{\u00b6 20} In their first assignment of error, the hospitals claim that the trial court erred in finding that the mortgage signed by the Reams was clear and unambiguous. They argue that the mortgage is ambiguous and that Paul Ream could have signed the mortgage in order to release his dower right to the property. The hospitals thus argue that the trial court erred in finding, as a matter of law, that Paul Ream had mortgaged his interest in the property. The hospitals observe that the trial court had previously concluded that it could not rule, as a matter of law, on SFJV\u2019s reformation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">{\u00b6 21} The hospitals\u2019 third assignment of error argues that to the extent the trial court did consider the evidence adduced at trial in concluding that the mortgage attached to Paul Ream\u2019s interest in the property, the court\u2019s judgment is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">{\u00b6 22} We review the mortgage under general principles of contract law. \u201cCourts presume that the intent of the parties to a contract resides in the language they have chosen to employ in the agreement.\u201d <em>Fountain Skin Care v. Hernandez, </em>175 Ohio App.3d 93, 2008-Ohio-489, 885 N.E.2d 286, \u00b6 22, citing <em>Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Convention Facilities Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 353, 361, 678 N.E.2d 519. \u201cIf a contract is clear and unambiguous, then its interpretation is a matter of law and there is no issue of fact to be determined.\u201d <em>Inland Refuse Transfer Co. v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 321, 322, 15 OBR 448, 474 N.E.2d 271. Under such circumstances, a court may not go beyond the plain language of the agreement to determine the parties\u2019 rights and obligations, and it may not consider parole evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions. <em>Fountain Skin Care </em>at \u00b6 22; <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. CPS Holdings, Inc., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 306, 2007-Ohio-4917, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>875 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 7. Instead, the court must give effect to the express terms of the contract. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">{\u00b6 23} In contrast, \u201cif a term cannot be determined from the four corners of a contract, factual determination of intent or reasonableness may be necessary to supply the missing term.\u201d <em>Inland Refuse Transfer Co. </em>at 322, 15 OBR 448, 474 N.E.2d 271. \u201cIf an ambiguity exists in a contract, then it is proper for a court to consider \u2018extrinsic evidence,\u2019 i.e., evidence outside the four corners of the contract, in determining the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Blosser v. Carter </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 215, 219, 586 N.E.2d 253. Such extrinsic evidence may include (1) the circumstances surrounding the parties at the time the contract was made, (2) the objectives the parties intended to accomplish by entering into the contract, and (3) any acts by the parties that demonstrate the construction they gave to their agreement. Id.\u201d <em>U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. St. Elizabeth Med. Ctr. </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 45, 55-56, 716 N.E.2d 1201; <em>GZK, Inc. v. Schumaker Ltd. Partnership, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19764, 2003-Ohio-5842, 2003 WL 22461779, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 24} We review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of a contract de novo. <em>Ignazio v. Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 276, 2007-Ohio-1947, 865 N.E.2d 18, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 25} According <em>to </em>SFJV\u2019s Exhibit 1, on April 12, 2004, Donna Ream and Paul Ream each signed the open-end mortgage. Page 1 states that the mortgagor is \u201cDonna Ream, a married person,\u201d who was thereafter referred to as the \u201cborrower.\u201d The security interest was given to MERS, as nominee for the lender, AMSC. The mortgage secured Donna\u2019s repayment of a debt of $64,705, as evidenced by a note, with the property located at 471 Gwynne Street in Urbana, Champaign County, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 26} Both Paul and Donna Ream initialed each page of the mortgage and both signed the last page as \u201cborrower.\u201d Although not discussed by the parties, paragraph 12 of the mortgage addresses cosigners. It provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe covenants and agreements of this Security Instrument shall bind and benefit the successors and assigns of Lender and Borrower, subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(b). Borrower\u2019s covenants and agreements shall be joint and several. Any Borrower who co-signs this Security Instrument but does not execute the Note: (a) is co-signing this Security Instrument only to mortgage, grant and convey that Borrower\u2019s interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) is not personally obligated to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (c) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower may agree to extend, modify, forbear or make any accommodations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>with regard to the terms of this Security Instrument or the Note without that Borrower\u2019s consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">{\u00b6 28} The mortgage includes additional terms relating to payment of the principal and interest on the debt, insurance and residency requirements, condemnation, subordination of other liens, grounds for acceleration of the debt, reinstatement, and waiver, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 29} The hospitals assert that the mortgage is ambiguous because Paul Ream is not listed as a \u201cBorrower\u201d on the first page of the security instrument. They claim that \u201cbecause Paul could have been signing merely to release his dower rights, his intent cannot be gleaned from the face of the mortgage.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">{\u00b6 30} The trial court\u2019s January 21, 2009, decision does not indicate whether the court found the mortgage unambiguous as a matter of law or, instead, concluded after considering the evidence that Paul Ream had mortgaged his interest in the property. Regardless, we find nothing ambiguous about the mortgage. The first page states that Donna Ream, the borrower, owes the lender a debt of approximately $64,000, which was evidenced by a note due and payable on May 1, 2034. These statements are followed by terms that provide that the \u201cborrower\u201d mortgages the property located at 471 Gwynne Street in Urbana as security for repayment of that debt. Paul initialed each page of the mortgage and signed the signature page on a line labeled \u201cborrower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 31} Although Paul Ream is not listed as a borrower/mortgagor on the first page of the mortgage, paragraph 12 of the mortgage makes clear that a \u201cborrower\u201d who signs the mortgage instrument but does not' execute the note mortgages his interest in the property without assuming liability for repayment of the debt; Paul signed as a \u201cborrower.\u201d There is no mention in the mortgage about the release of dower rights, nor is there any provision that suggests that Paul Ream signed the mortgage for a purpose other than to mortgage his interest in this property.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Even if we were to conclude that the mortgage was ambiguous, the trial court had ample evidence to support its conclusion that Paul Ream had mortgaged his interest in 471 Gwynne Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c[T]he civil manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard was explained in <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co., </em>54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus (\u2018Judgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence\u2019). We have also recognized when reviewing a judgment under a manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard, a court has an obligation to presume that the findings of the trier of fact are correct. * * * This presumption arises because the trial judge [or finder-of-fact] had an opportunity \u2018to view the witnesses and observe their demeanor, gestures and voice inflections, and use these observations in weighing the credibility of the proffered testimony.\u2019 * * * \u2018A reviewing court should not reverse a decision simply because it holds a different opinion concerning the credibility of the witnesses and evidence submitted before the trial court. A finding of an error in law is a legitimate ground for reversal, but a difference of opinion on credibility of witnesses and evidence is not.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 24, quoting <em>Seasons Coal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80-81, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 34} Theresa Hurley of Ohio Real Estate Title, who conducted the closing on the Reams\u2019 purchase of the property, testified that Paul Ream was on the deed with Donna Ream but was not a borrower on the note. Hurley stated that Paul was originally expected to release his dower interest at closing, but that did not occur, because Paul was placed on the deed, giving him a fee interest in the property. Hurley stated that \u201cwe had him sign as spouse to mortgage his half interest.\u201d Hurley indicated that she would not have allowed the transaction to close if Paul were not signing to <em>mortgage </em>his half interest in the property. She stated: \u201cI need to fully secure my lender who was in a serious position. And without his signature and without him signing the mortgage to mortgage his half interest, then my lender is not secure.\u201d Hurley testified that it is \u201cvery common to not have a non-borrowing spouse in the agreeing clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">{\u00b6 35} Cindy Banks-Mattachione, the mortgage banker for AMSC who originated the 2004 loan for Donna Ream, also testified that it is common for a person who is not the primary obligor on a debt not to have his or her name on first page of the mortgage. Banks-Mattachione did not know why that was case, but she indicated that it was \u201ctypical in this industry\u201d not to have the nonobligor\u2019s name on the first page. Banks-Mattachione stated that it was AMSC\u2019s intention that it be fully secured with first-lien priority. She testified that she reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Reams\u2019 mortgage after it was signed at closing and that AMSC did not \u201chave a problem with the execution of the documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 36} Based upon the evidence at trial, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that Paul Ream signed the mortgage for the purpose of mortgaging his interest in 471 Gwynne Street. The trial court\u2019s conclusion was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 37} The first and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">B. <em>Evidentiary Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 38} The hospitals\u2019 second assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe trial court erred in admitting certain evidence at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">{\u00b6 40} In their second assignment of error, the hospitals claim that the trial court erred in admitting several of SFJV\u2019s documentary exhibits and a portion of a witness\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">{\u00b6 41} SFJV offered the testimony of Tamara Savery, a litigation processor for Wells Fargo Bank N.A., to establish the chain of ownership of the Reams\u2019 mortgage and of the note signed by Donna Ream. After discussing numerous exhibits \u2014 including assignments of mortgage, servicing agreements, the loan-modification agreement, and the report of use of a fictitious name \u2014 the hospitals made a general objection to Savery\u2019s testimony regarding these exhibits. Counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-12\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cI apologize. It try \u2014 I really don\u2019t want to object to everything. What the witness is doing is testifying to some documents. There has been no foundation laid for these documents. Well, as far as foundation for admissibility, of course, the only things she is doing is reading the documents. There\u2019s been no sense to me she knows anything about transactions described in the documents. So I would move to strike all of her testimony with regard to these documents, until at least there has been enough foundation to admit them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">{\u00b6 43} The court overruled the objection. Counsel for SFJV responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-14\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThank you, Judge. We would submit that these are documents of a public agency and that they would qualify on their own self-authentication under the rules of evidence, without regard to this witness laying the foundation. But I appreciate the Court\u2019s ruling here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-15\">{\u00b6 45} At the conclusion of the trial, the hospitals objected to the admission of several of SFJV\u2019s exhibits. They argued that Exhibits 2 through 5 were inadmissible because SFJV did not provide certified copies and no one had authenticated any of the signatures on those documents. They objected to Exhibits 8 through 10 on the ground that those exhibits were not certified copies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>The hospitals objected to Exhibit 11, the servicing agreement, arguing that there was no foundation that the document was executed. They objected to Exhibit 12, a subservicing agreement, because that document was dated prior to Exhibit 11 yet the testimony was that the subservicing agreement was made in furtherance of the servicing agreement. They objected to the loan-history documents, Exhibit 15, arguing that there was no foundation that the documents were business records. The hospitals objected to Exhibit 16 because counsel had no recollection of that exhibit\u2019s being discussed. Finally, the hospitals objected to Exhibit 23, a letter from HUD, for lack of foundation, stating that the letter was not on HUD letterhead and was unsigned. The hospitals reassert these objections on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cProving the contents of a writing presents problems with hearsay, authentication, and the best evidence rule.\u201d <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), Ross App. No. 99 CA 2479, 2000 WL 1466189. Evid.R. 801(C) defines hearsay as a \u201cstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d A \u201cstatement,\u201d as included in the definition of hearsay, is an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct of a person if that conduct is intended by him as an assertion. Evid.R. 801(A). \u201cEvid.R. 802 mandates the exclusion of hearsay unless any exceptions apply.\u201d <em>In re Lane, </em>Washington App. No. 02CA61, 2003-Ohio-3755, 2003 WL 21652176, at \u00b6 11.

Evid.R. 1001(4) defines a \u201cduplicate\u201d as \u201ca counterpart produced * * * by means of photography, including enlargements and miniatures, or by mechanical or electronic re-recording, * * * or by other equivalent techniques which accurately reproduce the original.\u201d Upon review of exhibits and the trial transcript, we find no basis to conclude that the original documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>were required. Accordingly, we will review the exhibits/duplicates as if they were the originals.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">{\u00b6 49} First, the hospitals assert that the trial court erred in admitting Exhibits 2 through 5. Exhibits 2, 3, and 5 are assignment-of-mortgage documents, and Exhibit 4 is a limited power of attorney; each of these documents was recorded in Champaign County. The hospitals assert that these documents are inadmissible hearsay because SFJV failed to offer certified copies at trial, as required by Evid.R. 902(4), in order to authenticate the documents. SFJV responds that the documents were properly admitted under Evid.R. 902(8), because they are all acknowledged by a notary.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">{\u00b6 50} Exhibits 2 through 5 each bear a stamp indicating the date and time that the documents were recorded in Champaign County, and there is a notation of the book and page in which the document was recorded. As assignments of mortgage, Exhibits 2 through 5 constitute documents affecting an interest in property, and, accordingly, they are exempted from the hearsay rule under Evid.R. 803(14). Moreover, each of the exhibits has a page consisting of an acknowledgment by a notary. \u201cDocuments acknowledged by [a notary] are self-authenticating.\u201d <em>Lorain Cty. Bar Assn. v. Kennedy </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 116, 766 N.E.2d 151; Evid.R. 902(8). The trial court did not err in admitting Exhibits 2 through 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">{\u00b6 51} Next, the hospitals assert that the trial court erred in admitting Exhibits 8, 9, and 10, which are three documents filed with the Ohio secretary of state \u2014 report of use of fictitious name, certificate of amendment to foreign corporation application for license, and a document indicating that Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. had been merged out of existence. Exhibits 8 through 10 are public records and, thus, are admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. Evid.R. 803(8). Furthermore, the documents include a certificate by the secretary of state\u2019s office that it has custody of these specific business records and that the business records show the recording and filing of these documents; the certification is signed by the Ohio secretary of state and includes the seal of the office of the secretary of state. This certification is sufficient to meet the self-authentication requirements of Evid.R. 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">{\u00b6 52} The hospitals object to Exhibit 11, the unsigned servicing agreement between SFJV and EMC Mortgage SFJV 2005, L.L.C., giving EMC the right to service mortgages on SFJV\u2019s behalf, and Exhibit 12, the subservicing agreement whereby Wells Fargo Bank agreed to perform as the subservicer of the mortgage. Both of the exhibits are unsigned, and the hospitals argue that SFJV \u201coffered no proper evidence that [Exhibit 11] had ever been signed.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>hospitals further argue that, because the admission of Exhibit 12 is premised on the admission of Exhibit 11, Exhibit 12 should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">{\u00b6 53} During her direct examination, Savery was asked several questions about the terms of Exhibits 11 and 12. On cross-examination, the hospitals\u2019 counsel asked her if the servicing agreement, Exhibit 11, was signed by anyone. Savery responded: \u201cThis particular copy is not, but we did bring a signed copy. I believe we have the signed copy.\u201d It is unclear whether a signed copy was actually produced, but based on Savery\u2019s testimony, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that Exhibit 11 accurately reflected the terms of the executed servicing agreement. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Exhibits 11 and 12.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">{\u00b6 54} Next, the hospitals object to the trial court\u2019s admission of Exhibit 15, computer screen printouts of Donna Ream\u2019s loan history. Savery testified that as part of her duties with Wells Fargo Bank, she reviews loan files and loan documents owned by the bank. With regard to this case, she stated that she had reviewed and become familiar with the loan file of Donna Ream. Savery was asked to identify Exhibit 15, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cQ: Okay, Now, I\u2019d like to refer your attention to what\u2019s in your notebook as Exhibit 0, but that is now Plaintiffs Exhibit 15. Do you see that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-9\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cQ: And can you tell the Court what that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cA. That\u2019s the loan history. A mortgage loan history from our system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-11\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cQ: Okay. And it\u2019s broken down into a number of screens. Are those screen prints from your computer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-12\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cA: They are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">{\u00b6 61} Although Savery did not expressly testify that the loan history was maintained in the regular course of business, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the loan history printouts were business records maintained by Wells Fargo Bank regarding Donna Ream\u2019s loan. The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Exhibit 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">{\u00b6 62} The Hospitals challenged the admission of Exhibit 16, which merely states: \u201cExhibit P TBA.\u201d SFJV concedes that \u201cExhibit 16 appears to be an irrelevant document, having not been introduced in the proceeding. It was evidently inadvertently admitted as an exhibit.\u201d We agree that Exhibit 16 is nonsubstantive and irrelevant, and we find its admission to be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">{\u00b6 63} The hospitals further assert that the court should not have admitted Exhibit 23, a letter from HUD to Washington Mutual. This document merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>substantiates other exhibits which demonstrate how Donna Ream\u2019s loan was serviced. Assuming, arguendo, that the letter should not have been admitted, its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">{\u00b6 64} Finally, the hospitals assert that the trial court erred in allowing Savery to testify to the balance due on the note. During her testimony, Savery stated that the principal balance due on the loan, as of that date, was $67,400.32. The hospitals objected, which prompted the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 65} \u201c[Counsel for the hospitals]: Your Honor, I would object. I believe the witness is looking at something that hasn\u2019t been introduced or hasn\u2019t been marked as an exhibit. She was fiddling with papers. I really can\u2019t tell. I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s referring to Exhibit [15], though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">{\u00b6 66} \u201c[Counsel for SFJY]: We would be happy to - I think this witness brought paperwork from the file with her today. Your Honor, we\u2019re happy to share that with counsel. I\u2019ll mark it as an exhibit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">{\u00b6 67} \u201c[Counsel for the hospitals]: Well, Your Honor. I did ask some time ago for all the trial exhibits. And I thought I had them. And then we got some more last week. And now they are offering new ones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">{\u00b6 68} \u201c[Counsel for SFJV]: With all due respect, Your Honor, this is a document that is created to picture the account today. It didn\u2019t exist on the day prior to today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">{\u00b6 69} \u201cTHE COURT: Witness can testify about the claimed mortgage balance due now. And Defense can cross-examine as to that and to the source of that ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">{\u00b6 70} Savery then testified that the amount of interest due, calculated through October 24, 2008, was $7,942.95. In addition, the account had advances of $2,212.31 that had not been reimbursed, as well as late charges. Donna Ream would also have to pay a recording fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">{\u00b6 71} On cross-examination, counsel for the hospitals asked Savery what documents she was reviewing when she gave the balance due under the note. Savery responded, \u201c[I am] referring to the printout that I brought from the payoff screen from our system, calculated through tomorrow\u2019s date.\u201d Counsel for the hospitals was provided an opportunity to examine the documents. Savery also noted that Exhibit 17, a letter from the law firm of Lerner, Sampson and Rothfuss, was also a payoff document.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">{\u00b6 72} Exhibit 17, which was admitted without objection, reflected the payoff amounts stated by Savery in her testimony. Moreover, counsel for the hospitals was provided an opportunity to review the documents that Savery had relied upon in testifying to the payoff amount of Donna Ream\u2019s loan. We find no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>reversible error in the court\u2019s decision to allow Savery\u2019s testimony regarding the balance due on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">{\u00b6 73} The hospitals\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">{\u00b6 74} In case No. 09-CA-27, the hospitals appeal from the trial court\u2019s confirmation of sale of the Reams\u2019 property. Their sole assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cThe trial court erred in confirming the sheriffs sale of the foreclosed property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">{\u00b6 76} The hospitals\u2019 assignment of error raises two issues: (1) whether the party seeking the order of confirmation must file a motion in accordance with Civ.R. 7(B) and (2) whether the trial court may confirm the sheriffs sale more than 30 days after the date of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">{\u00b6 77} Beginning with the hospitals\u2019 contention that SFJV should have filed a motion with the court requesting an order confirming the sale, the hospitals claim that they were never given an opportunity to object to the confirmation of sale. They assert that SFJV\u2019s failure to comply with Civ.R. 7(B), which requires applications to the court for an order to be made by motion, \u201cdeprived [them] of the opportunity to protect their interest in the sales proceeds.\u201d They state: \u201cHad they received notice of the confirmation, they could have moved the Court to hold sufficient funds on deposit to satisfy their judgment amounts from the sales proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">{\u00b6 78} The trial court\u2019s distribution of the sale proceeds in the order confirming the sale was consistent with its prior judgment of foreclosure, which established the priority of lienholders, and the hospitals do not raise any defects in the procedures used to effectuate the sale of the property. In light of our affirmance of the judgment of foreclosure in 09-CA-7, the hospitals were not prejudiced by SFJV\u2019s failure to seek a confirmation order by motion. We decline to reverse the trial court\u2019s confirmation of sale on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">{\u00b6 79} The hospitals further claim that the trial court\u2019s confirmation of sale was untimely. R.C. 2329.31(A) requires the trial court, upon return of the writ of execution, to examine the sale proceedings and, if the sale was conducted according to law, to direct the clerk of court to make an appropriate entry and the attorney who filed the writ of execution to give the purchaser the deed. Effective September 11, 2008, such directions must be given within 30 days of the return of the writ. R.C. 2329.31(A). However, the court may stay the confirmation of the sale to permit a property owner time to redeem the property or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>any other reason that it determines is appropriate. Id. When a stay is issued, the court must confirm the sale within 30 days after the termination of any stay. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">{\u00b6 80} In this case, the trial court confirmed the sale on June 16, 2009, approximately seven weeks after the sheriffs return of the writ of execution. Although the trial court did not meet the statutory 30-day deadline and did not enter a stay of proceedings, we find that no prejudicial error has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 81} The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 82} The often Byzantine and even obfuscatory practices of the mortgage industry added a layer of complexity to this case not necessary to resolve the legal issues presented. Having overruled each of the assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of foreclosure and the judgment confirming the sale of the Reams\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b769-9\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\">. \u201cA dower interest is an interest in real estate that is intended to protect a non-title-holding spouse.\u201d <em>Standard Fed. Bank v. Staff, </em>168 Ohio App.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-3601, 857 N.E.2d 1245, \u00b6 16. In Ohio, dower interests are codified in R.C. 2103.02.
