Because we agree with those Ohio appellate districts that have held that aggravation of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>appealed condition is based on a theory of causation that a claimant need not raise administratively before pursuing an appeal under R.C. 4123.512, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter judgment for plaintiff-appellant Joseph Starkey on his claim for \u201cdegenerative osteoarthritis of the left hip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\n<em>I. Starkey\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Starkey was injured on September 11, 2003, in the course and scope of his employment with defendant-appellee Builders Firstsource Ohio Valley, L.L.C. He filed a claim with the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation that was allowed for the following conditions: sprain of left hip and thigh, \u201csprain lumbrosacral\u201d; \u201centhesopathy of left hip\u201d; \u201ctear left hamstring\u201d; \u201cglenoid labrum tear of left hip\u201d; \u201cvenous embolism deep vein thrombosis\u201d left leg; and \u201cdegenerative joint disease left hip.\u201d His claim for \u201cdiabetes either by way of direct causation or aggravation\u201d was disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 3} In December 2005, Starkey moved to amend his claim to add the additional condition of \u201cdegenerative osteoarthritis of the left hip.\u201d The claim was allowed by a district hearing officer and a staff hearing <em>officer. </em>Builders Firstsource appealed to the Industrial Commission, which denied further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\n<em>II. Builders Firstsource\u2019s Appeal to the Common Pleas Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 4} Builders Firstsource then appealed to the common pleas court pursuant to R.C. 4123.512. Starkey filed a complaint, which he then voluntarily dismissed under Civ.R. 41(A). He then refiled the complaint within the one-year period provided by R.C. 2305.19, the saving statute. Starkey\u2019s case then proceeded to a trial before the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 5} At trial, Starkey testified that he was working as a service technician for Builders Firstsource on September 11, 2003, when he injured his hip while installing a window. Starkey testified that he had not had any left-hip problems prior to the workplace incident. He sought immediate medical attention for his injured hip at Mercy Fairfield Hospital\u2019s emergency room. When the problems with his left hip persisted, he sought follow-up treatment with Dr. John Gallagher, M.D., a board-certified orthopedic surgeon. When this proved unavailing, he was referred to Dr. George Shybut, M.D., in 2005, for arthroscopic surgery on his left hip. When this surgery ultimately proved unsuccessful, he was referred back to Gallagher. In July 2006, he underwent a total hip replacement, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>was performed by Gallagher. Starkey testified that he has continued to receive treatment from Gallagher for problems related to his left hip.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">{\u00b6 6} Starkey\u2019s counsel then introduced the deposition of Gallagher. Gallagher testified that he had treated Starkey for the left-hip problems resulting from his September 11, 2003, workplace injury. During his treatment of Starkey, Gallagher reviewed x-rays, an MRI, and an arthrogram of Starkey\u2019s left hip. The MRI and arthrogram showed that Starkey had osteoarthritis in his left hip. Gallagher testified that Starkey had no history of left-hip pain or left-hip problems prior to the workplace injury. Gallagher testified that conservative care of Starkey\u2019s left-hip injury failed, so he referred Starkey to Dr. Shybut for arthroscopic surgery on his left hip. When the surgery failed to alleviate Starkey\u2019s left-hip pain, Shybut referred Starkey back to Gallagher for a total left-hip replacement. Gallagher performed that surgery on Starkey in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 7} Gallagher testified that in his opinion, Starkey had degenerative osteoarthritis in his left hip; that the degenerative osteoarthritis had pre-existed his injury of September 11, 2003; and that it had been \u201cdirectly aggravated by [his workplace] injury o[n] September 11[, 2003].\u201d Gallagher testified that his opinion was consistent with Dr. Thomas Bender, Builders Firstsource\u2019s expert witness. During cross-examination, Gallagher was again asked whether Starkey\u2019s work-related injury had caused the degenerative osteoarthritis or whether it had aggravated it. Gallagher testified that Starkey\u2019s workplace injury had aggravated the degenerative osteoarthritis.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 8} At the conclusion of Starkey\u2019s evidence, Builders Firstsource moved for a directed verdict based upon the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ward v. Kroger.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It argued that because Starkey had applied to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation to allow his claim only for degenerative osteoarthritis of the left hip, he could not, for the first time in the trial court, seek to participate in the fund for aggravation of the pre-existing degenerative osteoarthritis, when that was a separate condition that Starkey had not raised before the bureau. The trial court overruled the motion for a directed verdict sub silencio when it ultimately entered judgment for Builders Firstsource on Starkey\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for \u201cthe additional condition of degenerative osteoarthritis of the left hip.\u201d In its findings of fact and conclusions of law, the trial court stated that it felt compelled to follow this court\u2019s judgment in <em>Collins v. Conrad, </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark>which had been cited by the Second Appellate District in <em>Davidson v. Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Starkey now appeals, raising a single assignment of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\n<em>III. Starkey\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">{\u00b6 9} In his sole assignment of error, Starkey argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it granted judgment to Builders Firstsource on his claim for degenerative osteoarthritis of the left hip. Starkey contends that the trial court too narrowly interpreted the scope of an appeal under R.C. 4123.512. Starkey relies on a line of cases that were decided prior to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ward v. Kroger, </em>which hold that because aggravation is a theory of causation, a claimant need not raise the aggravation of an appealed condition administratively to raise it in an appeal pursuant to R.C. 4123.512.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 10} Builders Firstsource, on the other hand, relies on another line of cases that were decided after the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ward v. Kroger. </em>These cases hold that a claim for the aggravation of a pre-existing condition and a claim for that same condition by way of direct causation are intrinsically two separate claims because they require different elements of proof. Thus, claimants who do not raise the issue of aggravation administratively are precluded from raising that issue on appeal to the common pleas court under <em>Ward v. Kroger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>A. Aggravation as a Theory of Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 11} Prior to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ward v. Kroger, </em>the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Appellate Districts had held that a claimant could raise the aggravation of a pre-existing condition in an appeal under R.C. 4123.512, where the claimant had raised the direct causation of that same condition administratively, because the claimant was not seeking to prove a new or separate injury, but was merely advancing a new theory of causation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The reasoning was based on the de novo nature of an appeal under R.C. 4123.512. The courts acknowledged that such appeals were not error proceedings or even appeals upon questions of law and fact, but rather were governed by the issues as raised in the petition filed by the claimant and in the subsequent pleadings filed by the parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 12} The trial court was then required to conduct a trial de novo to determine the right of the claimant to participate or to continue to participate in the fund. While that determination was informed by the evidence adduced before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Industrial Commission, neither party was limited to that evidence, but instead could present such evidence pertinent to the issues raised by the petition as was material and relevant to the issue of the right of the claimant to participate or to continue to participate in the fund.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because only the claimant\u2019s theory of causation had changed at the common pleas level (i.e., aggravation of condition rather than direct causation), not the medical condition for which the claimant had sought participation before the Industrial Commission, the claimant was not precluded from seeking participation under this new theory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Robinson v. AT &amp; T Network Sys., </em>the Tenth Appellate District extended the reasoning in these cases to a claimant who had failed to appeal the Industrial Commission\u2019s denial of an earlier claim for the allowance of degenerative disc disease.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court held that the claimant was barred by res judicata from bringing a subsequent claim before the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation for aggravation of degenerative disc disease,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> because he was not advancing a new injury, but was merely litigating a variant of the initial causation theory.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\n<em>B. Ward v. Kroger</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Ward v. Kroger, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that claimants may seek to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund only for those conditions that have been addressed at the administrative level.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, a claimant in an appeal from a decision of the Industrial Commission may not amend a complaint at the common pleas level to add conditions that were not part of the administrative proceedings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As a result, the Supreme Court concluded in the case before it that the common pleas court had exceeded its jurisdiction under R.C. 4123.512 when it permitted the claimant, who had sought to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for a medial meniscus tear and chondromalacia of the right knee, to amend his complaint to include two new conditions: aggravation of pre-existing degenerative joint disease and aggravation of pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>existing osteoarthritis.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">{\u00b6 15} In so holding, the court resolved a conflict between Ohio\u2019s appellate districts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Previously, this district, along with the Third and Sixth Appellate Districts, had allowed a claimant to amend a complaint to add new and distinct conditions on appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Appellate Districts had reached the opposite conclusion, holding that claimants were precluded from litigating new or different conditions in the court of common pleas.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court agreed with the latter courts\u2019 interpretation, holding that permitting a claimant to amend a complaint to add new or distinct conditions on appeal would usurp the Industrial Commission\u2019s authority and would cast the common pleas court \u201cin the role of a claims processor.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 16} The claimant in <em>Ward </em>had argued that he was required under the Tenth Appellate District\u2019s decision in <em>Robinson v. AT &amp; T Network Sys.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to \u201clitigate all issues relating to the same body part in one proceeding or trial.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, it was imperative that he include the aggravated conditions in his appeal, or res judicata would bar him from later raising those claims administratively.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Ohio Supreme Court disagreed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 17} It held that the holding in <em>Robinson </em>was distinguishable because the claimant in that case had sought the administrative allowance of an additional claim for the same injury to the same body part, but on a different theory of recovery.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The claimant in <em>Ward, </em>however, had originally sought to participate for one condition and had then sought to add two new and distinct conditions on appeal.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, the Supreme Court held that nothing in <em>Robinson </em>prevented the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>claimant in <em>Ward </em>\u201cfrom going back to the administrative agencies and requesting\u201d the allowance of these two additional conditions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 18} The Supreme Court limited <em>Robinson </em>\u201cto the situation in which a claimant obtains an allowance of a particular claim for a particular body part, does not appeal the order to the common pleas court, and then seeks the administrative allowance of an additional claim for the same injury to the same body part, but on a different theory.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The court specifically stated, however, that it was not addressing \u201cwhether a claim for a certain condition by way of direct causation must necessarily include a claim for aggravation of that [same] condition for purposes of either R.C. 4128.512 or res judicata.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\n<em>C. Aggravation of a Condition as a Separate Condition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 19} Following <em>Ward, </em>the Second Appellate District in <em>Davidson v. Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp, </em>held that \u201ca claim for aggravation of a pre-existing condition not previously adjudicated by the commission is not appealable at the trial court level,\u201d even where direct causation of the condition itself had been addressed administratively, because the direct causation of an injury and the aggravation of that same injury are intrinsically two separate conditions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The claimant in <em>Davidson </em>had argued under <em>Robinson </em>that his claim to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for a lumbar sprain \u201cinherently included a request for the condition of aggravation of a pre-existing lumbar sprain.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Thus, he argued that the trial court had erred by failing to adopt his proposed jury instruction and verdict form for aggravation of a pre-existing lumbar strain.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 20} The Second Appellate District disagreed. While acknowledging that \u201cthe Ohio Supreme Court [had] explicitly chose[n] not to address this issue in its review of <em>Robinson,\u201d </em>the Second Appellate District nonetheless held that under <em>Ward, </em>a claim for aggravation of a pre-existing condition not previously adjudicated by the Industrial Commission cannot be raised at the trial-court level.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In viewing the aggravation of an injury as a separate condition from an injury by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>way of direct causation, the Second Appellate District focused solely on the evidence a claimant must present to advance such a claim.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">{\u00b6 21} The court noted that claimants who argue a direct injury as the result of a workplace accident \u201cmust show that a direct or proximate causal relationship existed between the claimant\u2019s accidental injury and his or her harm.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But claimants who argue that a pre-existing condition has been aggravated by a workplace injury must show that the \u201c \u2018aggravation had an impact on a person\u2019s bodily functions or affected an individual\u2019s ability to function or work.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The court further noted that the \u201caggravation of a pre-existing condition can be demonstrated \u2018through symptoms, debilitating effects, or physiological changes not due to the normal progression of the condition.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The court then concluded that \u201c[t]o presume that the commission will consider the evidence in light of both types of conditions, regardless of the type of claim made, is too broad an interpretation of the commission\u2019s role.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 22} The Second Appellate District cited this court\u2019s judgment entry in <em>Collins v. Conrad </em>as instructive.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In that case, we had \u201cfound that the employee\u2019s jury instruction addressing an aggravation of her claimed condition was not a correct statement of law where the original claim to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund only sought allowance for conditions directly caused by her injury.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We held that <em>\u201cWard </em>preclude[d] claimants from seeking to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for conditions not addressed in the administrative order from which the appeal to the common pleas court was taken.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Thus, we held that \u201cthe trial court [ha]d not abuse[d] its discretion in refusing to submit the claimant\u2019s instruction.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Plotner v. Family Dollar Stores, </em>the Sixth Appellate District \u201crecognize[d] that a workers\u2019 compensation claim for any given condition does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>include a claim for aggravation of that condition, and vice-versa\u201d and cited <em>Davidson </em>with approval.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The court, however, found <em>Davidson </em>to be factually distinguishable from the case before it.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The court held that because the employee\u2019s claim, although inartfully drafted, had included a claim for the aggravation of a pre-existing condition, and because there was ample evidence before the court to support the employee\u2019s claim for aggravation of the preexisting condition, the trial court had not erred in failing to grant a directed verdict to the employer on the employee\u2019s claim for aggravation of the preexisting condition.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 24} Similarly, in <em>Plaster v. Elbeco, </em>the Third Appellate District acknowledged the Second Appellate District\u2019s holding in <em>Davidson, </em>but nonetheless concluded that <em>Davidson </em>did not apply to the facts before it, because the employee had not argued the aggravation of the condition claimed, but had merely sought to prove the claimed condition, a herniated disc, by showing the aggravation of degenerative disc disease.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Thus, the Third Appellate District held that the trial court had not erred in instructing the jury on the theory of aggravation when the evidence in the case supported such an instruction.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\n<em>D. Analysis of Arguments in this Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 25} Starkey first argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law in relying upon our decision in <em>Collins, </em>which was cited by the Second Appellate District in <em>Davidson. </em>We agree. <em>Collins </em>is a judgment entry, and as such, it has no precedential value beyond the parties in that case.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> As a result, the analysis and reasoning in <em>Collins </em>is not binding upon this court in the current appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">{\u00b6 26} We disagree with Starkey, however, that the outcome of his case is controlled by <em>Robinson. </em>Starkey argues that under <em>Robinson, </em>he was required to raise all possible theories of causation for the injury of degenerative osteoarthritis of his left hip on appeal to the common pleas court, or res judicata would have precluded him from later bringing a claim on that issue. But in <em>Ward, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court explicitly limited <em>Robinson </em>\u201cto the situation in which a claimant obtains an allowance of a particular claim for a particular body part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>does not appeal the order to the common pleas court, and then seeks the administrative allowance of an additional claim for the same injury to the same body part, but on a different theory.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Because Starkey raised the issue of his participation in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for the condition of aggravation of pre-existing degenerative osteoarthritis of the left hip on appeal to the common pleas court, <em>Robinson </em>is factually inapposite.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 27} Thus, in the absence of a definitive statement by the Ohio Supreme Court on this issue, we are left to determine which line of cases is better reasoned: the one marked by <em>McManus v. Eaton Corp., </em>or the one marked by <em>Davidson v. Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>Builders Firstsource argues that the line of cases Starkey relies upon is no longer good law following <em>Ward. </em>But as Starkey points out, the reasoning in these cases is not inconsistent with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ward. </em>These courts, like <em>Ward, </em>had held that the scope of an appeal under R.C. 4123.512 as a trial de novo meant only that new evidence could be presented with regard to the appealed condition, not that evidence of a new condition could be presented for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Thus, we agree with Starkey that nothing in these cases conflicts with the <em>Ward </em>court\u2019s interpretation of the scope of an appeal under R.C. 4123.512.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 28} Furthermore, as Starkey points out, R.C. 4123.01, in defining an injury, does not prescribe how the causal link is to be made between the work-related event and the employee\u2019s injury. Ohio courts have ruled that workers can be injured in various ways, including by direct causation, aggravation of a preexisting condition, flow-through, a secondary condition, or acceleration.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In <em>Ward, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court clarified that a workers\u2019 compensation claim simply seeks the recognition of the employee\u2019s right to participate in the fund for a specific injury or medical condition that is defined narrowly, and that it is only for that condition, as set forth in the claim, that compensation and benefits under the act may be provided.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The court explicitly stated that it was not determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>any issues related to the causation of the injury or condition.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">{\u00b6 29} In this case, Starkey sought to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for the additional condition of \u201cdegenerative osteoarthritis of the left hip.\u201d The Industrial Commission held that he was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for this condition. On appeal to the common pleas court, his argument involved that same medical condition. The only thing that changed was the method of causation. The trial court, however, assumed that because the Industrial Commission\u2019s order referred to Starkey\u2019s medical condition without any modifiers, his claim had involved only direct causation. But there are no statutes, rules, administrative code sections, or cases, aside from <em>Davidson, </em>that create a presumption that a condition identified by the Industrial Commission has automatically arisen by direct causation unless otherwise stated in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, the Second Appellate District\u2019s statement in <em>Davidson </em>that it could not presume \u201cthat the commission will consider the evidence in light of both types of conditions, regardless of the type of claim made, is too broad an interpretation of the commission\u2019s role\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> is at direct odds with Industrial Commission Hearing Officer Manual Memo S \u2014 11, which explicitly provides that \u201c\u00e1 request to allow a condition in a claim is to be broadly construed to cover theories of causation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 31} Finally, we agree with Starkey that the underpinnings of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ward </em>are not implicated here. Medical evidence and testimony were presented administratively by both parties on Starkey\u2019s medical condition of \u201cdegenerative osteoarthritis of the left hip.\u201d On appeal to the common pleas court, Dr. Gallagher, Starkey\u2019s expert witness, acknowledged that his opinion that Starkey had degenerative osteoarthritis in his left hip; that the degenerative osteoarthritis had pre-existed his injury of September 11, 2003; and that it had been \u201cdirectly aggravated by [his workplace] injury o[n] September 11[, 2003],\u201d was consistent with the opinion of Builders Firstsource\u2019s expert, Dr. Thomas Bender. Thus, there was no ambush by Starkey\u2019s counsel in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 32} For all of these reasons, we sustain Starkey\u2019s assignment of error and reverse the trial court\u2019s decision. Based upon the undisputed evidence presented at trial, we enter judgment for Starkey and order that he is entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund for the additional condition of degenerative osteoarthritis of the left hip. Furthermore, we would be inclined to entertain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>motion to certify our judgment as being in conflict with the Second and Sixth Appellate Districts, should the parties choose that course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b249-6\">Hildebrandt, P.J., and Cunningham, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-11\">. The Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Office filed an answer to Starkey's complaint on behalf of the Administrator for the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, stating that Starkey was entitled to participate in the Workers Compensation Fund. The Attorney General\u2019s Office also indicated that it would be inactive in the common pleas court proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\">. <em>Ward v.
