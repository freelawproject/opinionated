Appellant assigns five errors to the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-13\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cI. The trial court erred as a matter of law in giving Section 3107.07(A), revised code, as amended April 7, 2009, retroactive application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-14\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cII. The trial court erred in failing to consider attempts by Ms. VanBremen to communicate with J.G. prior to July 14, 2008, which evidence discloses a pattern of significant custodial discouragement of communication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>{\u00b6 4} \u201cHI. The trial court erred in finding Ms. VanBremen failed to enforce an existing visitation order in a separate juvenile court proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">(\u00b6 5} \u201cIV. The trial court erred in failing to find that the manifest evidence supported a finding that petitioner Christy Ann Geer had significantly interfered with attempts made by Mr. VanBremen [sic] to communicate with her child, J.G., and that such interference was justifiable cause for failure to communicate making her consent to the adoption mandatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cV. The trial court erred as a matter of law in granting the adoption of J.G. by petitioner Christy Ann Geer, for the reason that absent statutory prescribed parental consent, the probate court lacked jurisdiction to consider the best interests of the child for a proposed adoption or to grant such an adoption petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellee is the current wife of the minor child\u2019s father and appellant is the biological mother of the minor child. Appellee filed a petition for adoption of J.G. on July 14, 2009. At the time of the filing of the petition for adoption, the father was the custodial parent of the minor child, and appellant had court-ordered visitation privileges. The minor child\u2019s father consented to the adoption. Appellant did not consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant was served with notice of the hearing on the petition for adoption. The notice stated that the hearing was scheduled for September 22, 2009, at 1:30 p.m. in the Probate Court of Ashland County. At the time of the hearing, appellee and the biological father were present in the courtroom. Appellant called the court, stating that she would be ten minutes late. Approximately 20 minutes after the hearing was scheduled to start, appellant had not appeared, and the court proceeded with the hearing without her.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 9} Both the biological father and the appellee testified. The father testified that in the year preceding the filing of the petition, appellant had not sent J.G. any cards, had not called him on the telephone, did not send him any e-mails, and had not communicated with him after July 14, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 10} Appellee testified that appellant did not send J.G. any letters, birthday card, or Christmas card, that she had not tweeted or texted him, and that she had not had any contact at all with J.G. between July 14, 2008, and July 14, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 11} Immediately after appellee testified, appellant appeared at the hearing without the benefit of legal counsel. The trial court did not provide appellant with the opportunity to cross-examine either appellee or the biological father, but appellant testified on her own behalf and offered five exhibits. Exhibit A was a certified-mail return receipt showing that appellee had signed for a card appellant sent to J.G. on June 5, 2008. Exhibit B was a Thanksgiving card from appellant to J.G. along with a packet of stickers for him, sent by certified mail on December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>3, 2008. Exhibit C was a letter that appellant sent to J.G. by certified mail on September 24, 2008. Exhibit D was also a letter sent by appellant to J.G. by certified mail on August 20, 2008. Within the letter, appellant expressed her love and affection for J.G. In that letter, appellant again expressed her love for J.G. Exhibit E was also a letter appellant sent by certified mail to J.G. on July 7, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 12} The court found that it appeared that the card exhibit A referred to was received at appellee\u2019s home, but there was no evidence that the card was given to the child. The other certified-mail letters were marked \u201crefused\u201d and were returned to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 13} Additionally, appellant testified she had tried on numerous occasions to contact J.G. On one occasion she saw him with appellee at Wal-Mart, although the exact date of the encounter was not established. Appellant testified that she was able to kiss him and tell him she loved him. She told J.G., \u201cI\u2019m not seeing [you] because I don\u2019t want to because I can\u2019t.\u201d She stated that appellee then took J.G. away from her and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s because you don\u2019t care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 14} Appellant testified that she had sent numerous text messages to J.G., had made phone calls, and had stopped at the home. Appellant also stated, \u201cI just want to be a part of [J.G.\u2019s] life. And they\u2019re denying me that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 15} Thereafter, the trial court took testimony again from both appellee and the biological father with respect to whether the adoption was in the best interest of the child. The court ruled that the allegations in the adoption petition were true and the adoption was in the best interest of the child. The court stated that it would issue a written opinion regarding whether appellant\u2019s consent was necessary for the adoption to proceed, after reviewing appellant\u2019s documentary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 16} Appellant asked the court if she could introduce the text messages that she had previously mentioned, to which the court replied, \u201cWell I\u2019ve concluded with the presentation of the evidence in this case, so I\u2019m not willing to take any additional evidence at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court issued a written opinion on October 14, 2009, granting the petition for adoption, finding that appellee had established by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant failed \u201cwithout justifiable cause to provide more than de minimis contact with the child during the year immediately preceding the filing of the Adoption Petition,\u201d and that appellant\u2019s consent was not required for the adoption to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">{\u00b6 18} In her first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in giving retroactive effect to the revised version of R.C. 3107.07 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>applying it to the entire one-year period prior to the filing of the adoption petition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">(\u00b6 19} The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that natural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children. <em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551; <em>Santosky v. Kramer </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599; <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49. A parent\u2019s right to raise a child is an essential civil right. <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 157, 556 N.E.2d 1169. An adoption permanently terminates the parental rights of a natural parent. <em>In re Adoption of Reams </em>(1989), 52 Ohio App.3d 52, 55, 557 N.E.2d 159. Thus, courts must afford the natural parent every procedural and substantive protection allowed by law before depriving the parent of the right to consent to the adoption of his or her child. <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 20} The termination of a natural parent\u2019s right to object to the adoption of her child requires strict adherence to the controlling statutes. <em>In re Adoption of Kuhlmann </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 44, 649 N.E.2d 1279. Ordinarily, the written consent of a minor child\u2019s natural parents is required prior to adoption. R.C. 3107.07 provides exceptions to this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 21} As amended effective April 7, 2009, R.C. 3107.07(A) now states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cConsent to adoption is not required of any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(A) A parent of a minor, when it is alleged in the adoption petition and the court, after proper service of notice and hearing, finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has failed without justifiable cause to provide more than de minimis contact with the minor or to provide for the maintenance and support of the minor as required by law or judicial decree for a period of at least one year immediately preceding either the filing of the adoption petition or the placement of the minor in the home of the petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">{\u00b6 24} The language of R.C. 3107.07(A) prior to April 7, 2009, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(A) A parent of a minor, when it is alleged in the adoption Petition and the Court finds after proper service of notice and hearing, that the parent has failed without justifiable cause to communicate with the minor * * * for a period of at least one year immediately preceding either the filing of the adoption petition or the placement of the minor in the home of the petitioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">{\u00b6 26} The Ohio legislature has determined that \u201c[statutes are presumed to apply only prospectively unless specifically made retroactive.\u201d R.C. 1.48; see also <em>State v. Cook </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 404, 410, 700 N.E.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>{\u00b6 27} In <em>Cincinnati School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 308, 744 N.E.2d 751, the Supreme Court explained Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, stating that \u201c \u2018[t]he retroactivity clause nullifies those new laws that \u201creach back and create new burdens, new duties, new obligations, or new liabilities not existing at the time [the statute becomes effective].\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. at 315, 744 N.E.2d 751, quoting <em>Bielat v. Bielat </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 350, 352-353, 721 N.E.2d 28, quoting <em>Miller v. Hixson </em>(1901), 64 Ohio St. 39, 51, 59 N.E. 749. The court set forth a two-prong test to determine whether the Constitution permits a statute to be applied retroactively. First, the court must \u201cdetermine whether the General Assembly expressly intended the statute to apply retroactively.\u201d <em>Bielat </em>at 353, 721 N.E.2d 28, citing R.C. 1.48.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 28} With regard to this first step, the legislature did not expressly provide for the retroactive application of the new version of R.C. 3107.07(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 29} If the legislature has provided for the retroactive application of the statute, the court moves on to the second step, which is the question whether \u201cthe statute is substantive, rendering it unconstitutionally retroactive, as opposed to merely remedial [i.e., constitutionally retroactive].\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 30} Laws that may be applied retroactively are laws that are remedial, that is, ones that \u201cmerely substitute a new or more appropriate remedy for the enforcement of an existing right.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>83 Ohio St.3d at 411, 700 N.E.2d 570. \u201cOn the other hand, a retroactive statute is substantive \u2014 and therefore unconstitutionally retroactive \u2014 if it impairs vested rights, affects an accrued substantive right, or imposes new or additional burdens, duties, obligations, or liabilities as to a past transaction.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Bielat, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 354, 721 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 31} R.C. 3107.07 as revised does not merely substitute a new or more appropriate remedy for the enforcement of an existing right, and therefore it is not remedial in nature. The statute affects parental rights, which are not merely substantive but fundamental. A natural parent\u2019s rights are paramount until such time that the parent complies with requirements of a valid adoption proceeding. See <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">{\u00b6 32} The leading case defining the R.C. 3107.07(A) \u201cfailure to communicate\u201d requirement is <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 361, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613. In <em>Holcomb, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court found that failure to communicate is sufficient to authorize adoption without consent only if there is \u201ca complete absence of communication\u201d for the statutorily defined one-year period. <em>Holcomb </em>at 367, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613. Thus, the prior version of R.C. 3107.07, in effect at the start of the one-year period, essentially provided that any contact whatsoever was sufficient to require appellant\u2019s consent to the adoption, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>while the revised version now requires that the contact be more than de minimis. We find that the revised version places a lesser burden on the petitioner who seeks to adopt the child without the consent of the natural parent and conversely places a higher burden on the natural parent who opposes the petition. We conclude that the revised version of R.C. 3107.07 cannot be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"AY2\">{\u00b6 33} The adoption petition was filed approximately three months after the effective date of the revised statute. We find that the trial court erred in applying the revised statute to the period of time prior to its effective date. The trial court should have applied the former version of the statute from the starting date of the one-year period, July 14, 2007, until the effective date of the revision, April 7, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">{\u00b6 34} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">II, III, IV, &amp; V</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">{\u00b6 35} In her second through fifth assignments of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s adoption petition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">{\u00b6 36} Appellee had the burden of proof in this action. \u201cThe party petitioning for adoption has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the parent failed to communicate with the child during the requisite one-year period and that there was no justifiable cause for the failure of communication.\u201d <em>Holcomb, </em>18 Ohio St.3d at 368, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613. See also <em>In re Adoption of Bovett </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 102, 104, 515 N.E.2d 919. \u201cNo burden is to be placed upon the non-consenting parent to prove that his failure to communicate was justifiable.\u201d <em>Holcomb </em>at 368, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">(\u00b6 37} \u201cOnce the clear and convincing standard has been met to the satisfaction of the probate court, the reviewing court must examine the record and determine if the trier of fact had sufficient evidence before it to satisfy this burden of proof. * * * The determination of the probate court should not be overturned unless it is unsupported by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">{\u00b6 38} Therefore, for appellee to prevail in this adoption proceeding without appellant\u2019s consent, she must prove by clear and convincing evidence that (1) there has been a failure of communication or support by the natural parent for the one-year period and (2) the failure is unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">{\u00b6 39} The court found that appellant does not dispute that she failed to communicate with her child during the one-year period immediately preceding the filing of the adoption petition. There appears no doubt that appellant\u2019s attempts to contact the child by certified mail were unsuccessful. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>appellee must also establish that the failure to communicate was without justifiable cause. \u201cIf the natural parent presents evidence showing that his failure to communicate was not unjustified, the petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that such failure was not justified.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Shea </em>(July 24, 1990), 10th Dist. No. 90-AP-245, 1990 WL 106468, citing <em>Holcomb.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">{\u00b6 40} <em>Holcomb </em>further held:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cSignificant interference by a custodial parent with communication between the non-custodial parent and the child, or significant discouragement of such communication, is required to establish justifiable cause for the noncustodial parent\u2019s failure to communicate with the child. The question of whether justifiable cause exists in a particular case is a factual determination for the probate court and will not be disturbed upon appeal unless such determination is unsupported by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 18 Ohio St.3d 361, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">{\u00b6 42} The trial court found that appellant sent letters by certified mail, the letters were refused, and the letters were returned to appellant. We agree with appellant that this represents significant interference with the communications between her and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 43} Appellee\u2019s assertion that R.C. 3107.07(A) requires the court to look at <em>only </em>the one year immediately preceding the filing of the petition is not legally supported. R.C. 3107.07(A) specifies that the natural parent must have failed to communicate or support the minor child for <em>at least </em>one year immediately preceding the petition without justifiable cause. Of the letters from appellant, three were sent during the period of time that the older version of R.C. 3107.07 was in effect. Because we find that appellant made attempts to contact the child during the one year prior to the filing of the petition, and while former R.C. 3107.07 was applicable, we need not decide whether the court should have looked at the attempted communications prior to July 14, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">{\u00b6 44} We find that appellant met her burden of proving that she had complied with R.C. 3107.07(A) in attempting to communicate with her son. Appellee failed to present clear and convincing evidence that appellant\u2019s failure to communicate was without justifiable cause. The fact that appellee and/or the biological father significantly interfered with her attempts to communicate via letter with J.G. cannot be held against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">{\u00b6 45} We find that the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Appellant\u2019s second through fifth assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>{\u00b6 46} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Ashland County Probate Court is reversed, and the judgment is vacated. Appellant\u2019s parental rights are hereby reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Judgment reversed and vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-6\">Hoffman, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b268-7\">Delaney, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b268-8\">Delaney, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AdB\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 47} I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion with respect to appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. I would find that the trial court properly applied the new version of R.C. 3107.07(A), because the petition for adoption was filed on July 14, 2009, three months after the new version of R.C. 3107.07(A) took effect, although part of the conduct in question occurred under the prior version.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">{\u00b6 48} I would therefore overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">{\u00b6 49} Regarding appellant\u2019s second through fifth assignments of error, I concur in the majority\u2019s opinion that the trial court\u2019s findings are not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Regardless of which version of the law applies, appellant\u2019s communications with her son would satisfy the higher burden set forth under the new version of R.C. 3101.07(A), and therefore her conduct would also be sufficient to establish contact under the prior version as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">{\u00b6 50} As noted by the majority, on numerous occasions preceding the filing of the adoption petition, appellant attempted to send letters to her son. Those letters were sent by certified mail, someone at the residence (either appellee or the biological father) marked the letters refused, and they were returned to appellant. We are unaware who refused the letters because the trial court failed to allow appellant to cross-examine appellee and the biological father. Appellant also attempted to introduce text messages into the record to show her attempts to contact her son. The trial court erroneously refused to allow appellant to introduce these messages into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">{\u00b6 51} Even in light of the trial court\u2019s refusal to afford appellant \u201cevery procedural and substantive protection\u201d allowed by law before depriving her of the right to consent to the adoption, <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 679 N.E.2d 680, the record clearly shows that appellant wishes to have a relationship with her biological son. She attempted numerous times to contact him by letter and once in person at a Wal-Mart, where appellee refused to let her have contact with her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>{\u00b6 52} I am troubled not only by the conduct of appellee and the biological father, but also by the actions of the trial court in failing to allow appellant a full opportunity to show her attempts to contact her son. I find this to be particularly troubling since both appellee and the biological father testified, under oath, that in the year preceding the filling of the petition, appellant never contacted J.G., either by text message or by card or letter. Had the trial court allowed appellant to fully present her case, the text messages may have provided more proof of additional attempts to contact J.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 53} For these reasons, I concur in the majority decision in reversing and vacating the judgment of the trial court and reinstating appellant\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
