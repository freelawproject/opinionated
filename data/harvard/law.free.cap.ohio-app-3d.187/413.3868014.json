Appellant assigns a single error to the trial court:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cI. The lower court erred in affirming the decision of the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">{\u00b6 3} The claimant, appellee Vincent J. Turner, was employed by appellant from June 7, 1999, to October 12, 2006. On October 12, 2006, appellant informed Turner that if he did not voluntarily resign, he would be discharged. Appellant gave as its reason its belief that Turner had falsified a report or claim for benefits. Turner resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">{\u00b6 4} In early 2006, appellant had given its employees, including Turner, questionnaires entitled \u201cSpouse Coverage Questionnaire.\u201d The form was designed to determine whether employees\u2019 spouses were covered by health insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>anee. Appellant would provide coverage for employees\u2019 spouses only if the spouse did not have benefits from another source.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">{\u00b6 5} The form stated that if the employee\u2019s spouse was not employed, the employee had to complete only part \u201cA,\u201d but if the spouse was employed, the employee should complete part \u201cA,\u201d and the spouse\u2019s employer should complete part \u201cB\u201d of the form. If the spouse was not employed, the employee did not have to have part \u201cB\u201d filled out before returning the questionnaire to Human Resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 6} The questionnaire asked for the employee\u2019s name, date of birth, Social Security number, and marital status. If the employee was married, the form asked for the spouse\u2019s name, date of birth, and Social Security number. The form included a space to list the spouse\u2019s employer, if applicable. The form also asked whether the spouse\u2019s employer offered group medical coverage, and if so, whether the spouse was currently covered under the employer\u2019s group medical plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 7} Turner checked the block indicating that his spouse was employed and listed the spouse\u2019s employer as SCCAA Head Start. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question, \u201cDoes your spouse\u2019s employer offer group medical coverage?\u201d and \u201cno\u201d to the question, \u201cIs your spouse currently covered under his/her employer\u2019s group medical plan?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 8} The last block to be completed states: \u201cIt is important that spouses be enrolled in the medical plan provided by their employers. If for some reason your spouse cannot enroll in his or her employer\u2019s plan, please explain below. [Example: Open enrollment will be held-name month].\u201d The questionnaire Turner submitted states: \u201cEmployer has open enrollment. Open enrollment will be held 10/1/06.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 9} Above the line for the employee\u2019s signature, the form contains a notice: \u201cEmployee acknowledgment of responsibility. I understand that SARTA has implemented a spousal requirement for medical coverage. I acknowledge that the information on this form is accurate to the best of my knowledge. I understand that if any false statement is made or information is withheld, SARTA will have the right to recover any overpayment and recoup any legal fees incurred and medical coverage and employment may be immediately terminated. I also agree to report any changes in my spouse\u2019s status to the Human Resources Department within thirty (30) days of the change.\u201d Turner signed the questionnaire.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">{\u00b6 10} When SARTA\u2019s Human Resources Director discovered Turner did not submit Part \u201cB\u201d of the questionnaire, which should have been completed by his wife\u2019s employer, the director placed a phone call to the employer and learned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>SCCAA Head Start did not have open enrollment. An employee could apply for benefits at any time, but could be subject to a waiting period or other restrictions or denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 11} Turner presented a document from SCCAA outlining his wife\u2019s options for medical benefits. The document listed a number of choices, and beneath those choices, it stated: \u201cI understand that I [illegible] for a period of at least one year or until the next open enrollment period, after which I may elect a change of medical plans during the [illegible] period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 12} Turner maintained that he had relied on the form that indicated his wife\u2019s employer had open enrollment. He conceded that he did not know the actual date of open enrollment, but because she was a Head Start teacher whose school year did not begin until the end of September, he believed the open enrollment period would likely begin the first of the month following her return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 13} Appellee issued an initial determination that Turner had quit without just cause and disallowed his application for benefits. Upon redetermination, appellee affirmed its initial determination. Turner then appealed the matter to the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, and a hearing officer conducted an evidentiary hearing. The hearing officer determined that the decision to disallow Turner\u2019s application for benefits was incorrect and found that Turner had been discharged without just cause. On appeal, the review commission affirmed this decision. The hearing officer found that while appellant may have been dissatisfied with Turner\u2019s answers, the answers were simply mistakes and did not demonstrate sufficient fault or misconduct to disqualify him from unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 14} Upon review, the court of common pleas affirmed the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a) provides that no individual may be paid benefits when that individual \u201chas been discharged for just cause in connection with the individual\u2019s work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 4141.282 governs appeals from decisions of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review. The statute provides that if the court finds a decision to be unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence, it shall reverse, vacate, or modify the decision, or it may remand the matter to the commission. The statute also provides for an appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">{\u00b6 17} All reviewing courts have the same obligation: \u201cto determine whether the board\u2019s decision is supported by the evidence in the record,\u201d without substituting its own findings of fact or determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses for those of the board. <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Servs. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 694, 696, 653 N.E.2d 1207. \u201cThe board\u2019s role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>as factfinder is intact; a reviewing court may reverse the board\u2019s determination only if it is unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d Id. at 697, 653 N.E.2d 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Tzangas, </em>the Supreme Court reviewed a situation in which the employer had discharged its employee because it had found the employee unsuitable and unable to perform the work. The employee had made numerous errors over a period of some nine months, which required duplicative efforts by her and her employers. Initially, the employee\u2019s application for unemployment compensation was allowed, because the employee was not at fault for willfully or wantonly refusing to do her job, but was merely incapable of performing the job despite her best efforts. The matter was affirmed through the administrative process and at the common pleas level, but this court reversed the decision and held that although the employee was not at fault, her inability to perform her job was sufficient justification for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 19} The Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201cfault on behalf of the employee is an essential component of a just cause termination.\u201d <em>Tzangas, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 694, 653 N.E.2d 1207, paragraph two of the syllabus. Essentially, the Supreme Court held that while an employee may not be at fault in a moral sense, in some situations, the employee may still be at fault in a legal sense. The Supreme Court has explained that while there is no slide-rule definition of just cause, just cause is that which, to an ordinarily intelligent person, is a justified reason for doing or not doing a particular act. <em>Irvine v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Rev. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587, citing <em>Peyton v. Sun TV </em>(1975), 44 Ohio App.2d 10, 73 O.O.2d 8, 335 N.E.2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 20} Thus, a determination of just cause depends upon the unique factual considerations of a particular case and is primarily an issue for the trier of fact. <em>Irvine, </em>19 Ohio St.3d at 17, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587. Although just cause is reviewed from the employer\u2019s point of view, \u201c[i]n keeping with the intent and purpose of the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Act, \u2018fault\u2019 must be further determined from the employee\u2019s perspective.\u201d <em>Ohio Turnpike Comm. v. Conrad </em>(Dec. 1, 1994), 8th Dist. No. 66405, 1994 WL 677491, *5; <em>Morris v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 295, 299, 629 N.E.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 21} While <em>Tzangas </em>held that fault is a necessary element of any just-cause discharge, not every fault or mistake is grounds for termination. The hearing officer here found that Turner made a mistake, but it was not sufficient to justify firing him. We do not agree. In <em>Wilson v. Matlack, Inc. </em>(2000), 141 Ohio App.3d 95, 99, 750 N.E.2d 170, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth District reviewed an unemployment-compensation appeal wherein the employee had admitted that he had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in his personal life, namely, indulging in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>marijuana on one occasion, and as a result, failed a random drug test. His employer terminated his employment, and through the administrative process, his claim for unemployment-compensation benefits was denied. However, at the common pleas level, the court reversed, holding that the collective-bargaining agreement did not permit firing for this infraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 22} The court of appeals reversed the judgment of the common pleas court, holding that it had erred in relying solely on the collective-bargaining agreement. More importantly, the court of appeals noted that the positive random drug test disqualified the employee from performing essential tasks related to his employment as a truck mechanic, and therefore, the employer was justified in discharging the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 23} Here, Turner argues that he simply made a mistake on the form. The mistake was not insignificant, such as making a mistake on the date. The form in question notified Turner that the entire purpose of the questionnaire was to determine whether his spouse received or could receive health-insurance benefits from her employer. The form required him to certify the information on the form and warned him that he could be sanctioned, even including termination of his employment, for a false statement. The mistake Turner made went to the very heart of the purpose for the questionnaire. In addition, while he arguably had a misleading document from his wife\u2019s employer indicating that there was open enrollment, he admitted that the date he listed was based upon his own speculation. If Turner or his wife had checked with SCCAA Head Start, or if Head Start had completed its portion of the form, the mistake would have been detected.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 24} We must defer to the hearing officer\u2019s finding of fact that Turner made a mistake rather than a deliberate misrepresentation, but nevertheless, we disagree with the conclusion that it was not a sufficient error to justify his termination. While we might have preferred to see a lesser sanction, we cannot say that appellant was not within its rights to terminate Turner\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 25} The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 26} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, Ohio, is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b456-11\">Farmer, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b456-12\">Delaney, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b456-13\">Delaney, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A5C\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">{\u00b6 27} I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>{\u00b6 28} The sole basis for Turner\u2019s discharge was that he knowingly falsified an insurance form. I therefore agree with appellee that the facts of this case necessitated a finding of intentional misconduct on the part of Turner to justify termination, as the insurance form stated that employment may be terminated if any false statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">{\u00b6 29} Although appellant correctly contends that \u201cjust cause\u201d does not typically require intentional action, the determination of just cause depends upon the \u201cunique factual considerations of the particular case\u201d and is therefore an issue for the trier of fact. <em>Irvine v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Rev. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 17, 482 N.E.2d 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 30} The hearing examiner found that \u201c[w]hile the employer may have been dissatisfied with the answers provided by claimant, claimant has provided credible testimony to establish that the answers to which the employer objected were simply mistakes. It has not been shown that claimant engaged in sufficient fault or misconduct to suspend his unemployment benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 31} I would conclude that the foregoing findings of fact, as determined by the hearing examiner, and as approved by the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission and the trial court, are not unlawful, unreasonable, or against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 32} The majority concludes: \u201cWe must defer to the hearing officer\u2019s finding of fact that Turner made a mistake rather than a deliberate misrepresentation but nevertheless, we disagree with the conclusion it was not a sufficient error to justify his termination.\u201d By so stating, the majority substitutes its judgment for that of the reviewing tribunals and goes beyond the narrow scope of review possessed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">{\u00b6 33} Therefore, I would overrule appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error and affirm the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
