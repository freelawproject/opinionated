Appellant, Michael Kaufman, appeals the March 25, 2008 decision of the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas that sentenced him to five consecutive life sentences and four consecutive five-year sentences, subsequent to a jury finding him guilty of four counts of rape, four counts of gross sexual imposition, and one count of felonious sexual penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">{\u00b6 2} Kaufman argues on appeal that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the force specifications for his rape convictions were based on insufficient evidence. Kaufman also contends that the trial court provided improper jury instructions, erroneously allowed irrelevant expert testimony, improperly provided assistance to the state, and limited Kaufman\u2019s right to cross-examine a witness. Kaufman further contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion to continue, \u2022 that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, and that the state committed prosecutorial misconduct. Finally, Kaufman argues that the trial court erroneously allowed the improper joinder of victims and offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">{\u00b6 3} The force specifications for Kaufman\u2019s rape convictions were based on sufficient evidence under <em>State v. Eskridge </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 56, 526 N.E.2d 304. Although the evidence supporting Kaufman\u2019s convictions was not terribly strong given the weakened credibility of one of the victims, his convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court\u2019s decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>regarding jury instructions, admission of expert testimony, and limitation of cross-examination were proper. Kaufman did not demonstrate that the state\u2019s objectionable statements deprived him of his right to a fair trial. Finally, the trial court\u2019s decision not to sever the charges against Kaufman for the two separate victims was an abuse of discretion, where the testimony of each victim would not have been admissible in separate trials under Evid.R. 404(B), and the offenses committed against each victim were too similar and inflammatory to realistically avoid fostering the erroneous belief that the distinct offenses corroborated one another. Kaufman\u2019s remaining assignments of error regarding assistance to the state, denial of motions to continue, and ineffective assistance of counsel are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">{\u00b6 4} Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed and remanded for new trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">{\u00b6 5} On November 1, 2007, a grand jury indicted Kaufman on eight counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b); five counts of gross sexual imposition, in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4); and one count of felonious sexual penetration, in violation of R.C. 2907.12(A)(1)(b). The counts encompassed offenses against three different victims, JB, DC, and KC. JB was born on October 4, 1987, DC was born on April 22, 1991, and KC was born on December 21, 1992, and all victims were minors under the age of 13 at the time of the indicted offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">{\u00b6 6} Kaufman was charged with committing offenses against the three victims as follows: For offenses against victim JB between October 4, 1995, and October 3, 1998, Kaufman was charged with three of the counts of rape, three counts of gross sexual imposition, and one count of felonious sexual penetration. For offenses against victim DC between January 1, 2002, and September 7, 2002, Kaufman was charged with one count of rape and one count of gross sexual imposition. For offenses against victim KC between January 1, 2001, and August 31, 2003, Kaufman was charged with the remaining four counts of rape and one count of gross sexual imposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">{\u00b6 7} On November 7, 2007, Kaufman entered a plea of not guilty, and the tidal court appointed John B. Juhasz as counsel after finding Kaufman to be indigent. The trial court scheduled the trial for December 17, 2007. On December 6, 2007, Kaufman filed a motion to continue, noting that counsel had sustained a back injury on November 13, 2007, and that counsel for the state had failed to complete its responses to discovery requests. The trial court granted Kaufman\u2019s motion and the trial was rescheduled to take place on January 7, 2008. On December 20, 2007, Kaufman filed another motion to continue due to a conflict with another trial. The trial court rescheduled the trial to January 22, 2008. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>January 9, 2008, the parties filed a joint motion for continuance due to scheduling conflicts, which the trial court overruled. On January 16, 2008, Kaufman filed another motion to continue, stating that counsel\u2019s back injury, untimely discovery responses from the state, and investigation difficulties rendered counsel unable to provide effective assistance of counsel at such a close trial date. During a January 18, 2008 hearing on Kaufman\u2019s motion, the trial court asked defense counsel to pick a continuance date well in the future in order to ensure that such time constraints would not cause any further problems with this trial. The trial court granted Kaufman\u2019s motion and continued the trial to March 17, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">{\u00b6 8} On February 19, 2008, the state filed a supplemental disclosure of evidence regarding a fourth victim, RT, not included in the indictment. On March 3, 2008, Kaufman filed a motion for relief from prejudicial joinder, asking for three separate trials for the three separate victims. Kaufman also filed another motion to continue the trial. The trial court overruled the motion to continue and set a hearing for the motion for relief from prejudicial joinder. Additionally, Kaufman filed a motion to dismiss charges 7, 8, and 11 for lack of jurisdiction, because the offenses were alleged to have occurred outside of Mahoning County. The state filed a motion to introduce evidence of other acts, requesting that the trial court allow testimony from RT, the victim not included in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">{\u00b6 9} Subsequent to a hearing on March 11, 2008, the trial court denied Kaufman\u2019s request to sever trials and denied the state\u2019s motion to admit other acts evidence regarding the fourth victim. The trial court sustained Kaufman\u2019s motion to dismiss three of the charges, which left 11 charges against two victims remaining on the indictment. Kaufman repeated his request for severance throughout his trial, but each request was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">{\u00b6 10} On March 12, 2008, the state filed a motion in limine, asking the trial court to allow KC to testify about acts that had occurred outside the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. On March 13, 2008, Kaufman filed a supplemental motion to continue, repeating his request for an enlarged amount of time to prepare. The trial court overruled both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">{\u00b6 11} On March 17, 2008, the state filed a second motion in limine, asking the trial court to disallow any reference to a 1993 report by JB\u2019s mother of suspected sexual abuse of JB by an unspecified person and a 2000 report that JB had molested his little brother, RT, which the trial court sustained. The state filed a third motion in limine, asking to admit the testimony of DC (the third victim in the dismissed counts) as other-acts evidence and asking that KC be permitted to testify about acts not included in the indictment for the purpose of explaining the background behind the offenses actually charged. The trial court disallowed the other-acts evidence of DC, but sustained the state\u2019s motion regarding KC.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>{\u00b6 12} During the course of the proceedings, the trial court dismissed Counts 1 and 13, due to errors in the indictment. Pursuant to Kaufman\u2019s motion, the indictment was amended to renumber the remaining nine counts. The counts remaining were as follows: For offenses against victim JB between October 4, 1995, and October 3, 1998, Kaufman was charged with two of the counts of rape, three counts of gross sexual imposition, and one count of felonious sexual penetration (Counts 1 through 5 and 9); and for offenses against victim KC between January 1, 2002, and August 31, 2003, Kaufman was charged with two counts of rape and one count of gross sexual imposition (Counts 6 through 8). During proceedings, the state successfully moved the trial court to provide an <em>Eskridge </em>definition of force in the jury instructions and to include the additional finding of force or threat of force for each of the rape and felonious-sexual-penetration charges. See <em>Eskridge, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 58, 526 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">{\u00b6 13} At trial, the state presented the testimony of KC, Karen, JB, Officer Suzanne Doni-Ellis, and Dr. Paul McPherson. Kaufman presented his own testimony and the testimony of Officer Doug Fiara, Donna, and Tracey. An initial explanation of the parties\u2019 relationships with each other will clarify the parties\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">{\u00b6 14} Tracey was married to Frederick from approximately 1987 to 1991. The couple had a son, JB, on October 4, 1987. Tracey was married to Reginald from approximately 1995 to 1999, though they gave birth to a son, RT, in 1994. Reginald worked at Long Bar Trucking (\u201cLBT\u201d). Kaufman also worked at LBT, starting in 1991. Tracey and Kaufman were married in 2001 and had a son in 2005. Kaufman\u2019s mother, Donna, lives in Boardman. Donna\u2019s sister, Karen, lives in Wisconsin, but visited Donna in Boardman during most summers. On past visits to Donna, Karen would bring her grandchildren and step-grandchildren along, one of whom is KC, born December 21,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">{\u00b6 15} KC testified that he met Kaufman when Kaufman was visiting family in Wisconsin in 2002 and that he saw Kaufman three other times during KC\u2019s short visits to Donna\u2019s house in Ohio during the summers of 2002 to 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">{\u00b6 16} KC testified that he and other family members met up with Kaufman in the early summer of 2002 and stayed in a motel together, with the males staying in one room and the females in another room. KC testified that as he was getting out of Kaufman\u2019s car in a parking lot of the motel, he scratched the car next to him with the door of Kaufman\u2019s car. KC stated that Kaufman \u201csaid that he would call the sheriff and tell them that I scratched the car next to me, or I could receive punishment.\u201d During that night at the motel, Kaufman woke KC and \u201csaid it was time for the punishment,\u201d by which he meant performing oral sex on Kaufman. KC also stated that he did not tell anyone what happened at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>that time because he was scared that Kaufman \u201cmight do something\u201d or get KC in trouble for scratching the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">{\u00b6 17} During the summer of 2002 and 2003, when KC was in Ohio visiting extended family at Donna\u2019s house, Kaufman would get KC alone and continue the \u201cpunishment,\u201d which involved striking KC\u2019s testicles, digitally penetrating KC\u2019s anus, or performing fellatio on one another. There were eight <em>or nine </em>people, along with two large dogs, staying in Donna\u2019s house during KC\u2019s family visits. KC testified that Kaufman got KC alone in the attic, the basement, or the second-floor bathroom in order to commit the abuse. On cross-examination, KC stated that he did not remember Kaufman locking any doors when they were in the basement or the attic, but he remembered Kaufman locking the second-story bathroom door.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">{\u00b6 18} KC testified to three or more incidents of Kaufman striking his testicles, two instances of digital-anal penetration, two instances of Kaufman performing fellatio on KC, and one instance of KC performing fellatio on Kaufman in 2002. KC also testified that Kaufman once used a hand-held video recorder to tape KC in the garage while Kaufman was touching KC\u2019s penis. KC testified to two instances of Kaufman striking his testicles, one instance of digital-anal penetration, and two instances of fellatio in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">{\u00b6 19} KC testified that at first, he did not tell anyone about what Kaufman did during the summer incidents because KC was scared and did not want to get in trouble. Shortly before the family\u2019s summer 2004 visit, KC told his step-siblings about the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">{\u00b6 20} KC testified that during the summer 2004 visit, Kaufman asked KC if he had told anyone about their sexual interactions and that Kaufman \u201cseemed kind of angry.\u201d KC denied telling anyone because he was afraid of what Kaufman would do. KC and his step-brother, JT, took a tape recorder from Karen and Donna and used it to try to catch an instance of Kaufman\u2019s abuse, but the adults repeatedly found the recorder and took it back. JT told Karen about the abuse during this visit, and Karen took the grandchildren back to Wisconsin.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">{\u00b6 21} On cross-examination, KC testified that Kaufman did not threaten to hurt him. KC testified that Karen was the adult in charge of him during the summer trips to Donna\u2019s house, not Kaufman, and that KC called Kaufman \u201cUncle Mikey.\u201d However, KC also testified that Kaufman was an authority figure in Donna\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">{\u00b6 22} KC testified that Kaufman had been driving a red Firebird during his 2002 trip to Wisconsin. When asked about the purpose of Kaufman\u2019s Wisconsin visit, which was to pick up furniture from Kaufman\u2019s recently deceased grandmother, KC agreed that Kaufman would not be able to move a lot of furniture in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>a Firebird. KC stated that he did not remember what car Kaufman was driving when KC scratched the car door in the parking lot of the motel. KC did not remember Tracey\u2019s presence during the 2002 Wisconsin trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">{\u00b6 23} When KC was interviewed by social workers in Wisconsin after the 2004 disclosure, he did not tell them about the video-taping incident in the garage of Donna\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">{\u00b6 24} Karen testified that she would visit her sister, Donna, in Ohio during summer breaks from school and that she brought KC along in 2002 to 2004. Karen brought a tape recorder with her during the 2004 trip, and after it disappeared a few times, one of the grandchildren disclosed Kaufman\u2019s abuse of KC. The adults confronted Kaufman about the abuse, and Kaufman denied the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">{\u00b6 25} On cross-examination, Karen described renting motel rooms for family gatherings in Wisconsin in February and April 2002, but did not remember whether the family had all stayed together in motel rooms during Kaufman\u2019s trip to Wisconsin to pick up furniture. On redirect examination, Karen stated that when the family stayed at a motel, they always had one room for the women and one room for the men.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">{\u00b6 26} Kaufman did not live at or stay overnight at Donna\u2019s house when KC was visiting, but he would spend time there with the family after work, during weekends, and sometimes in the morning. He would come over to the house by himself or with Tracey. When describing the layout and sleeping arrangements at Donna\u2019s house, Karen noted that the door to the second-story bathroom did not shut all the way. Karen described Donna\u2019s house as a little hectic when all the adults, children, and dogs are there. Karen testified that she had authority over her grandchildren when she brought them on the trips to Donna\u2019s house, but also stated that all of the adults were authority figures for the children at Donna\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">{\u00b6 27} JB, born October 4, 1987, testified that he and Kaufman were good friends before Tracey and Kaufman \u201cgot together.\u201d Tracey, Reginald, and Kaufman all worked at LBT, and Tracey became friends with Kaufman while Reginald was away on truck-driving jobs. Tracey married Reginald when JB was six, divorced when JB was ten, and married Kaufman when JB was fifteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">{\u00b6 28} Tracey frequently sent JB to Kaufman\u2019s house to spend time with him. During those visits, Kaufman was the only adult in the house and was in charge of JB. When JB stayed with Kaufman in south Youngstown, Kaufman would pick JB up at his school in Niles. JB sometimes stayed with Kaufman only during the day, then started staying with him over weekends, and then overnights during the week.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>{\u00b6 29} JB testified that his friendship with Kaufman became inappropriate when he was approximately five or six years old. JB stated that inappropriate sexual conduct began when he was six or seven years old and physical abuse began when he was ten. Kaufman began to digitally penetrate JB\u2019s anus starting at the age of eight, and did so at least once every three months, usually when JB was in Kaufman\u2019s bathroom. Between the ages of eight and 11, JB estimated that Kaufman had digitally penetrated his anus 12 to 14 times and had JB perform fellatio two times. JB specified that one instance of fellatio happened in the spring of 1997 and the other during the fall of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">{\u00b6 30} On cross-examination, JB testified that Kaufman began to touch JB inappropriately around the age of six and that the first instance occurred at Donna\u2019s house. JB testified that he told his mother about Kaufman rubbing his buttocks right afterwards, but Tracey did nothing. JB also testified that Kaufman touched him inappropriately at age 11 while washing him after JB had broken his arm in a bicycle accident at a location in New Springfield, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">{\u00b6 31} JB testified that he only disclosed Kaufman\u2019s abuse recently because he wants to become comfortable with himself so that he can start his own family. JB did not report the sexual abuse to anyone besides Tracey and the police, though he said that Reginald was made aware of Kaufman\u2019s physical abuse of JB at some unspecified point.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">{\u00b6 32} JB first spoke with the police in November 2006 and made an official report of sexual abuse to the police in June 2007, after having been out of Ohio. JB admitted that he did not report the instances of fellatio or the inappropriate touching in New Springfield to the police and said that he did not feel comfortable reporting all of it. JB admitted that he had told the police that the inappropriate touching started at age five rather than six, but said he had just given the police an approximate date and was very ill during the reporting process. On further cross, JB agreed that the touching started at age five. JB stated that Kaufman began penetrating his anus when he was six or seven years old, at Kaufman\u2019s house on Berkshire in Youngstown. On further cross, JB agreed that no anal penetration occurred prior to 1997 (which would have been when he was nine and ten years old). On redirect, JB testified that Kaufman\u2019s inappropriate touching began at age five or six, anal penetration began at age eight, and the sexual abuse stopped by the time JB was twelve.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">{\u00b6 33} Officer Suzanne Doni-Ellis of the Youngstown Police Department testified that JB filed a police report with her on June 4, 2007, and stated that Kaufman\u2019s inappropriate touching began at age five, anal penetration began at age eight, and the abuse stopped by the time JB was 11 or twelve. Ellis did not gather physical evidence due to the remote dates of abuse. During her investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>tion, Ellis procured reports from police departments in Boardman and Wisconsin regarding EC\u2019s 2004 allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">{\u00b6 34} Dr. Paul McPherson was proffered by the state as an expert regarding allegations of sex abuse by children. McPherson did not interview the victims and testified about his general academic knowledge and professional experience with child sexual-abuse victims. McPherson testified that it is common for child victims to delay disclosure of the abuse or to partially disclose the abuse and that it is not common for anal penetration to result in permanent scars. Kaufman cross-examined McPherson on statistics regarding false allegations and hypothetical questions about anal trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">{\u00b6 35} Once the state rested, Kaufman renewed his motion for relief from prejudicial joinder and entered a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, both of which the trial court denied. For Kaufman\u2019s case in chief, Officer Doug Fiara of the Boardman Police Department Youth and Family Services Division testified that he received a report of sexual abuse from the Milwaukee Department of Child Welfare regarding KC in 2004. Fiara interviewed Donna and Kaufman and spoke with Jennifer (EC\u2019s step-mother) via telephone. Fiara took the case to the prosecutor\u2019s office in 2004, but no action was taken on the case until JB\u2019s report in 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">{\u00b6 36} Donna testified that she moved to Boardman, Ohio in 1996 and lived in Michigan prior to that. Donna testified that Kaufman drove her up to Wisconsin for her mother\u2019s funeral (in February 2002) in her white Buick. Kaufman and KC were both at the bereavement luncheon. Donna stayed up in Wisconsin to deal with her mother\u2019s estate, until Kaufman returned in late April 2002 with Tracey, in a moving truck. After a group family dinner, Kaufman and Tracey drove KC and two other boys to the motel where they were staying. Donna testified that the family got two rooms and that Kaufman, Tracey, KC, and EC\u2019s step-brother slept in one room. The door between the two adjoining motel rooms was left open, and Donna did not notice anything strange that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">{\u00b6 37} When Karen and the grandchildren came to visit Donna in the summers of 2002 to 2004, eight people stayed at Donna\u2019s house, and additional people, including Kaufman and Tracey, would spend time there during the day. Donna testified that the bathroom doors at her house could not shut due to mistakes made during remodeling. During the family visits to Donna\u2019s house in 2002 to 2004, Donna had not noticed any strange behavior and was shocked by EC\u2019s allegations in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">{\u00b6 38} Tracey testified that she was married to Frederick from 1987 to 1991 and had one child with him, JB. She had one child, RT, with Reginald in 1994 and was married to Reginald from 1995 to 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>{\u00b6 39} Tracey testified that she met Kaufman in early 1996 and that she began to work for LBT in late 1996. Tracey testified that Kaufman met JB in the fall of 1997 and that she would send JB to stay with Kaufman when she was having marital difficulties with Reginald. JB did not report any abuse to her, and Tracey first found out about the abuse when JB made the police report in 2007. JB would stay with Kaufman a few times a month, only on the weekends, and Kaufman never drove JB to school in Niles.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">{\u00b6 40} In 2000, Tracey moved in to Kaufman\u2019s house on Berkshire. Tracey testified that the shower at Kaufman\u2019s house did not work and was never fixed. Tracey and Kaufman were married in 2001 and had a son in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">{\u00b6 41} Tracey provided testimony identical to Donna\u2019s regarding the family trip to Wisconsin in late April 2002, though Tracey stated that the door between the two adjoining motel rooms did not stay open the entire time. Tracey stated that she got up during the night at the motel and did not notice anything strange.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">{\u00b6 42} In Tracey\u2019s description of the family visits to Donna\u2019s house in the summers of 2002 to 2004, Tracey said that she stayed close to Kaufman the whole time, because she did not know his family very well.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">{\u00b6 43} Kaufman testified that he started working at LBT in 1991. He bought his house on Berkshire Drive in Youngstown in April 1996. Kaufman\u2019s exhibit 14, an inspection report on the Berkshire house, stated that there was one bathroom in the house, and that \u201cShower head is damaged. Shower head replacement is recommended. No water pressure to shower. (Repairs needed.)\u201d Kaufman never fixed the shower and testified that it still does not work.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">{\u00b6 44} Kaufman testified that he met JB in the fall of 1997, when JB was nine or ten. Kaufman testified that he still lived in Austintown when he first started spending time with JB and would have JB stay the night one or two times a month. Kaufman had a \u201cbig brother/little brother\u201d relationship with JB from 1997 to 1999 and started to spend time with JB and Tracey \u201cas a family\u201d in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">{\u00b6 45} Kaufman\u2019s testimony addressed JB\u2019s claim that Kaufman had touched him inappropriately after JB had broken his arm in a bicycle accident. Kaufman stated that the bike accident occurred during a camping trip in Pennsylvania and that JB had never been to New Springfield, Ohio. Kaufman\u2019s testimony otherwise generally duplicated most of the defense testimony already presented, and Kaufman denied ever having touched either victim inappropriately.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">{\u00b6 46} At the close of trial, Kaufman renewed his motions for acquittal and relief from prejudicial joinder, which the trial court denied. After a day of deliberations, the jury returned a guilty verdict for each of the nine counts against Kaufman, On March 24, 2008, the trial court held a sentencing hearing and imposed four consecutive life sentences for the rape convictions, an additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>consecutive life sentence for the felonious-sexual-penetration conviction, and four consecutive five-year sentences for the gross-sexual-imposition convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">{\u00b6 47} Kaufman timely filed the present appeal, asserting ten assignments of error. We will address Kaufman\u2019s assignments of error in an order that facilitates our analysis of the issues raised therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Insufficient Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">{\u00b6 48} In his fourth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cAppellant Was Denied Due Process and the Liberties Secured by the United States Constitution and Ohio Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 10 and 16 When He Was Convicted of the Life Offenses of Rape upon Insufficient Evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">{\u00b6 50} Kaufman argues that his special felony rape convictions were based on insufficient evidence because the state did not provide proof of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">{\u00b6 51} In reviewing a challenge of insufficient evidence, \u201cthe inquiry is, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, whether any reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492, superseded by state constitutional amendment on other grounds. The court does not examine the credibility of the witnesses, nor does it weigh the evidence in this process. <em>State v. Goff </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 139, 694 N.E.2d 916. Sufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy, used to determine whether the case may go to the jury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter of law. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541, citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6 Ed.1990) 1433. This is a burden of production, not of persuasion. <em>Thompkins </em>at 390, 678 N.E.2d 541. A reviewing court should not disturb the decision below unless it finds that reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier of fact. <em>Jenks </em>at 273, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">{\u00b6 52} Kaufman was convicted of four counts of rape of a person under 13, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), the elements of which are not argued in this assignment of error. Pursuant to the version of R.C. 2907.02(B) in effect at the time of the commission of the offenses, a conviction of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) is sentenced as a first degree felony, but carries a mandatory life sentence if there is a finding that the offender \u201cpurposely compels the victim to submit by force or threat of force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">{\u00b6 53} The force element is defined as follows: \u201c \u2018Force\u2019 means any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\u201d R.C. 2901.01(A)(1). Force or the threat of force \u201ccan be inferred from the circumstances surrounding sexual conduct.\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>Schaim </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 600 N.E.2d 661, at paragraph one of the syllabus. In order to make a finding of force under R.C. 2907.02, \u201csome amount of force must be proven beyond that force inherent in the crime itself.\u201d <em>State v. Dye </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 323, 327, 695 N.E.2d 763. However, the Ohio Supreme Court has explained that the force necessary to commit rape depends upon the respective age, size, and strength of the parties and their relation to each other. <em>Eskridge, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 58, 526 N.E.2d 304. Thus, the context of the rape will also affect our inferences regarding the additional element of force or threats of force. In the case of a child victim, a person in a position of authority over the victim can be convicted of rape with the force specification \u201cwithout evidence of express threat of harm or evidence of significant physical restraint.\u201d <em>Dye </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">{\u00b6 54} Kaufman argues that his rape convictions were based on insufficient evidence because the state did not provide evidence that Kaufman had used force or threats of force against either victim. Kaufman also contends that the inference of psychological force in <em>Eskridge </em>and <em>Dye </em>does not apply in this case because Kaufman was not an authority or parent figure for either of the victims. Kaufman contends that he was merely \u201can adult who had met these boys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">{\u00b6 55} It is true that the law does not impute an authoritative relationship merely because the victim is a child and the defendant is an adult. See <em>State v. Drayer, </em>10th Dist. No. 03AP-1033, 2004-Ohio-5061, 2004 WL 2803426, at \u00b6 31, vacated on other grounds by <em>State v. Drayer, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 189, 2004-Ohio-6120, 823 N.E.2d 492. However, an adult need not be the child\u2019s parent in order to establish that the child felt obligated to obey him. <em>Dye, </em>supra. In <em>Dye, </em>the defendant was merely the victim\u2019s neighbor, but there was direct proof that the defendant was acting in loco parentis, as there was testimony that the victim\u2019s mother specifically instructed the victim to obey the defendant when in his charge or else she would bring him home. <em>Dye, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 328-329, 695 N.E.2d 763. In other cases, the child\u2019s belief that he must obey the adult has been established even without specific instruction from the victim\u2019s parent that the defendant was to be obeyed in place of the parent. See, e.g., <em>State v. Milam, </em>8th Dist. No. 86268, 2006-Ohio-4742, 2006 WL 2639448 (defendant was in a position of authority with regard to the victim because he was the father of one of the victim\u2019s friends, the victim spent many nights at the defendant\u2019s home, and the victim testified that the defendant was \u201cin charge\u201d of him while at the defendant\u2019s home); <em>State v. Haschenburger, </em>7th Dist. No. 05 MA 192, 2007-Ohio-1562, 2007 WL 969067 (defendant manipulated his relationship as a family friend to condition the victim to think that she should comply with his demands).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">{\u00b6 56} In this case, Kaufman had a long-standing relationship with JB\u2019s mother, first as a friend, then live-in boyfriend, then husband, though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>marriage occurred after the dates of the charged offenses for JB. JB\u2019s mother testified that she would send JB to stay overnight at Kaufman\u2019s house when she was experiencing difficulties with her previous husband, Reginald. JB testified that he would have to obey Kaufman if Kaufman told him what to do. JB did not respect Kaufman as an authority figure, but specified that Kaufman was in charge when JB was in his care. JB stated that he was frightened of Kaufman.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">{\u00b6 57} In addition to ongoing incidents of sexual touching and digital-anal penetration, JB testified that on two specific occasions, during the time periods of each of rape counts, \u201cI was in the process of getting out of the shower, and [Kaufman] grabbed me and pulled my head down * * * [and] I was forced to suck his penis.\u201d JB also testified to a specific incident, during the time period of the second rape count, where Kaufman both physically assaulted JB and forcefully penetrated his anus for an extended period of time, causing him to bleed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">{\u00b6 58} The foregoing testimony indicates that Kaufman was an authority figure to JB. He was repeatedly entrusted to care for JB by JB\u2019s mother, and JB felt obligated to obey Kaufman. The sexual acts occurred either while JB was under Kaufman\u2019s sole supervision, or during a period when Kaufman was living with JB and his mother, Tracey. JB repeatedly described being \u201cforced\u201d by Kaufman to perform sexual acts with him and described at least one incident of Kaufman inflicting physical violence on JB in conjunction with a sexual act. The state therefore presented sufficient evidence that Kaufman was in a position of authority over JB, that JB\u2019s will was overcome by fear or duress, and that JB\u2019s will was overcome on at least one occasion by physical violence. Given the totality of the evidence presented by the state, reasonable minds could conclude that the rape counts against JB were committed with force or threat of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">{\u00b6 59} As for the force specifications on Counts 6 and 8, Kaufman did not have a similar long-standing relationship with KC. KC testified that he had first met Kaufman when Kaufman was visiting in Wisconsin in 2002 and saw Kaufman three other times, during KC\u2019s short visits to Kaufman\u2019s mother\u2019s house in Ohio during the summers of 2002 to 2004. Kaufman\u2019s mother was KC\u2019s step-mother\u2019s aunt, and KC called Kaufman \u201cUncle Mikey.\u201d KC testified that Kaufman was not one of the adults responsible for telling KC what he could or could not do when he was staying at Kaufman\u2019s mother\u2019s house. However, KC also testified that Kaufman was an authority figure in Kaufman\u2019s mother\u2019s house. Kaufman did not live at or stay overnight at his mother\u2019s house when KC was there, but he would visit with the family after work or during weekends. KC\u2019s step-grandmother, Karen, testified that \u201call of the adults\u201d were the authority figures at Donna\u2019s house when the family got together there.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">{\u00b6 60} KC described the first incident in 2002 with Kaufman, which was outside the jurisdiction of the trial court and not included in the counts in this case, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>explained the background of his relationship with Kaufman. KC testified that as he was getting out of Kaufman\u2019s car in a parking lot of the motel where they were staying and scratched the car next to him with the door of Kaufman\u2019s car, Kaufman \u201csaid that he would call the sheriff and tell them that I scratched the car next to me, or I could receive punishment [from Kaufman]. And I was scared because I didn\u2019t really want to be in trouble with the police, so \u2014 I was a little kid. I didn\u2019t know. And so I chose the punishment because I thought it would be a lot easier. I didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d During that night at the motel, Michael woke KC and \u201csaid it was time for the punishment,\u201d which was to perform oral sex on Kaufman. KC testified that he was afraid of Kaufman. KC also stated that he did not tell anyone what happened at that time because he was scared that Kaufman \u201cmight do something\u201d or get KC in trouble for scratching the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">{\u00b6 61} During the summer of 2002 and 2003, when KC was in Ohio visiting his extended family, Kaufman would get KC alone and continue the \u201cpunishment,\u201d which involved striking KC\u2019s testicles, digitally penetrating KC\u2019s anus, or KC and Kaufman performing fellatio on one another. KC testified that it was Kaufman who removed KC\u2019s pants during each incident. KC stated that he did what Kaufman said because he was scared and did not want to get in trouble. KC also said that he did not tell anyone about what Kaufman did during the summer 2002 incidents because KC was scared. Shortly before the summer 2004 visit, KC told his step-siblings about the abuse. KC testified that Kaufman asked KC during his 2004 visit if he had told anyone about their sexual interactions and that Kaufman \u201cseemed kind of angry.\u201d KC denied telling anyone, because he was afraid of what Kaufman would do.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">{\u00b6 62} Based <em>solely </em>on their distant familial relationship, the evidence is insufficient to allow the court to use the <em>Eskridge </em>inference of psychological force. See 38 Ohio St.3d at 58, 526 N.E.2d 304. Kaufman was never in charge of caring for KC, nor was he acting in loco parentis at any point, and was instead merely one of the adults at the house during family gatherings. However, Kaufman placed himself in a position of authority over KC when he said that he would punish KC for damaging the car and that if KC did not acquiesce to Kaufman\u2019s punishment, then Kaufman would get him into even more trouble. This is coupled with the fact that KC was of tender years and small for his age during the two offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">{\u00b6 63} Additionally, Kaufman did in fact physically harm KC by repeatedly striking him in the testicles. It appears that striking his testicles was not intended to subdue KC for the purpose of committing other sexual acts, but was one of the sexual acts in and of itself. Nonetheless, the physical violence, the age disparity between the parties, the threats of worse punishment, and Kaufman\u2019s assertion of authority as an adult who had the power to discipline KC all indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that KC\u2019s will was overcome by fear and duress, and he felt compelled to submit. Given the totality of the evidence presented by the state, reasonable minds could conclude that the rape counts against KC were committed with force or threat of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">{\u00b6 64} The force element in each of Kaufman\u2019s rape convictions was based on sufficient evidence; thus, Kaufman\u2019s fourth assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Manifest Weight of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">{\u00b6 65} In his third of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cThe trial court denied Appellant due process under the Fourteenth Amendment in that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence and the jury\u2019s verdict was inconsistent with the evidence and testimony presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">{\u00b6 67} Kaufman argues that the convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence due to the number of contradictions in testimonial evidence and the lack of physical evidence of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">{\u00b6 68} When a court conducts a manifest-weight analysis, it weighs all of the evidence and reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of each witness, and determines whether the fact-finders clearly lost their way in resolving conflicts in the evidence to the point that they \u201ccreated such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. The factors that a reviewing court may consider in a manifest-weight analysis include whether the evidence was incredible; whether the evidence was uncontradicted; whether a witness was impeached; what was not proved; the certainty of the evidence; the reliability of the evidence; whether any witness\u2019s testimony was self-serving; and whether the evidence was vague, uncertain, conflicting, fragmentary, or illogical. <em>State v. Brown, </em>7th Dist. No. 03 MA 231, 2005-Ohio-4502, 2005 WL 2077697, at \u00b6 35-45. See also <em>State v. Apanovitch </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 23-24, 514 N.E.2d 394, citing <em>State v. Mattison </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 23 OBR 43, 490 N.E.2d 926, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">{\u00b6 69} The manifest-weight analysis is a broader inquiry into the original trial, but allows for a reversal only in exceptional circumstances. <em>Thompkins </em>at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. This is because the trier of fact was in the best position to determine the credibility of the witnesses and the weight due to the evidence. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212. Thus, the reviewing court must determine whether the appellant or the appellee provided the more believable evidence, but must not completely substitute its judgment for that of the original trier of fact \u201cunless it is patently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>apparent that the factfinder lost its way.\u201d <em>State v. Woullard, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-3395, 813 N.E.2d 964, at \u00b6 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">{\u00b6 70} Kaufman lists three main factors as going against the weight of the evidence: the lack of physical evidence to corroborate the claims, contradictions of the details of KC\u2019s testimony, and contradictions of the details of JB\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">{\u00b6 71} As for the physical-evidence argument, there is no requirement that testimonial evidence of sexual abuse must be corroborated by physical or other evidence. See <em>In re Hollobaugh, </em>7th Dist. No. 08 MA 22, 2009-Ohio-797, 2009 WL 428576, at \u00b6 21. The lack of physical evidence in this case is understandable, given that this case was prosecuted years after the abusive acts were alleged to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">{\u00b6 72} As for KC\u2019s testimony, Kaufman points to conflicting testimony about certain details during the first instance of abuse in Wisconsin and whether or not the bathroom door at Donna\u2019s house could be shut or locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">{\u00b6 73} KC testified that Kaufman had been driving a red Firebird during a trip to Wisconsin, but defense witnesses testified that Kaufman had been driving a moving truck and a white Buick. There also were conflicts as to which trips to Wisconsin were made, when they were made, and which people stayed in which hotel rooms. These conflicts surround events that were not charged against Kaufman and were only described as background information. Thus, these conflicts were not material to the case against Kaufman and at most would have spoken to KC\u2019s overall credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">{\u00b6 74} KC described Kaufman as having abused him during the weeks that he visited Donna in Ohio and described the abuse as happening in the attic, the basement, and the second-floor bathroom. On cross-examination, KC stated that he did not remember Kaufman locking any doors when they were in the basement or the attic, but that he remembered Kaufman locking the second-story bathroom door. Witnesses for both the state and the defense testified that the door to the second-story bathroom did not shut all the way and could not be locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">{\u00b6 75} Kaufman has pointed out a few inconsistencies in KC\u2019s testimony, but KC otherwise gave detailed testimony about all of the events pertinent to the case and provided consistent testimony as to the facts that satisfied the elements of the offenses charged against Kaufman. Taking into account inconsistencies or conflicting evidence while weighing the credibility of an individual witness is well within the province of the jury. Kaufman has not demonstrated that the evidence as it pertained to KC was so inconsistent that no reasonable jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>have believed him. The convictions regarding KC were therefore not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">{\u00b6 76} As for JB\u2019s testimony, Kaufman points to inconsistencies in his description of events that occurred before, during, and after the time periods of the charges in order to argue that JB\u2019s overall credibility was undermined. Kaufman also specifically argues that the conflicting testimony of other witnesses as to when JB first met Kaufman rendered Counts 3 and 9 to be factually impossible and therefore against the manifest weight of the evidence. The three time periods of the convictions are October 1995 to 1996 (Counts 3 and 9), October 1996 to 1997 (Counts 1 and 4), and October 1997 to 1998 (Counts 2 and 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">{\u00b6 77} JB testified that Kaufman began to touch JB inappropriately around the age of six (October 1993 to 1994) and that the first instance occurred at Kaufman\u2019s mother\u2019s (Donna) house. Kaufman and Donna testified that Donna lived in Michigan at that time and did not move to Ohio until 1996. JB also testified that Kaufman touched him inappropriately at age 11 (October 1998 to 1999) while washing him after JB had broken his arm in a bicycle accident at a location in New Springfield, Ohio. Tracey and Kaufman testified that JB had fractured his arm in a bicycle accident during a camping trip in Pennsylvania and that JB had not been to New Springfield. Additionally, Kaufman points out that JB agreed during cross-examination that no anal penetration occurred before 1997. However, JB also testified on direct and redirect examination that the first instance of anal penetration occurred when he was eight years old, which would have been between October 1995 and October 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">{\u00b6 78} JB testified that his mother Tracey met Kaufman through LBT. JB\u2019s ex-stepfather, Reginald, worked for LBT. No one testified as to when they thought Reginald had started working at LBT, though he started some time before Tracey did, and possibly before Kaufman did, though the testimony is unclear. Kaufman started working at LBT in 1991. JB did not testify as to when he thought his mother started working at LBT, though he said that Tracey and Kaufman became friends while Reginald was \u201con the road\u201d working for LBT.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">{\u00b6 79} Tracey testified that she met Kaufman in early 1996, that she began to work for LBT in late 1996, and that she became friends with Kaufman at that time. Tracey and Kaufman testified that Kaufman had met JB in the fall of 1997. However, Kaufman also testified that he had met JB while Kaufman was living in Austintown, before he had the house on Berkshire Drive in Youngstown, which occurred in April 1996. Although the defense testimony severely undermines JB\u2019s credibility regarding his descriptions of Kaufman\u2019s abuse from 1993 to 1995, Kaufman\u2019s own testimony could support the contention that Kaufman knew JB during all of the dates between 1995 and 1998 in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>{\u00b6 80} Thus, although Kaufman claims that the defense testimony that JB met Kaufman in 1997 proved that the counts in October 1995 to 1996 were factually impossible, the testimony offered by both sides was incomplete, inconsistent, and vague. The matter comes down to a question of overall credibility, which the jury apparently resolved in favor of JB.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">{\u00b6 81} Kaufman further points to inconsistencies in JB\u2019s testimony to argue that the remainder of the convictions against Kaufman involving JB, were against the manifest weight of the evidence. Kaufman asserts that JB\u2019s claims that most of the molestation occurred during or after getting out of the shower at the house on Berkshire were impossible because the shower did not work. Kaufman\u2019s Exhibit 14, an inspection report on the Berkshire house, stated that there was one bathroom in the house, and that \u201cShower head is damaged. Shower head replacement is recommended. No water pressure to shower. (Repairs needed.)\u201d Tracey and Kaufman both testified that the shower did not work and was never fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">{\u00b6 82} However, given that there was only one bathroom in Kaufman\u2019s house on Berkshire, it does not necessarily follow that JB\u2019s claims were factually impossible. Although Kaufman offered testimony that contradicted JB\u2019s testimony, the defense did not unequivocally impeach JB\u2019s testimony regarding abuse that occurred in 1995 to 1996 or abuse that occurred in the bathroom of Kaufman\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">{\u00b6 83} Kaufman was able to strongly call into question the accuracy or believability of JB\u2019s testimony as compared to KC\u2019s testimony. But JB otherwise gave detailed testimony about all of the events pertinent to the case and provided consistent testimony as to the facts that satisfied the elements of the offenses charged against Kaufman. Moreover, a defendant \u201cis not entitled to a reversal on manifest weight grounds merely because inconsistent evidence was offered at trial\u201d as \u201c[t]he trier of fact is free to believe or disbelieve any or all of the testimony presented.\u201d <em>State v. Favor, </em>10th Dist. No. 08AP-215, 2008-Ohio-5371, 2008 WL 4598297, at \u00b6 10. The jury was permitted to believe or disbelieve any of the testimony presented, and we still must give deference to the jury\u2019s determination of the credibility of the witnesses. Kaufman has not demonstrated that JB\u2019s testimony was so inconsistent that no reasonable jury could have believed him. A jury could have found JB to be the more credible witness without having lost its way.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">{\u00b6 84} Although the issue is close given that the overall credibility of JB was extremely questionable, this is not one of the exceptional cases in which the evidence weighs heavily against the defendant\u2019s convictions, warranting reversal. Therefore, Kaufman\u2019s convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and his third assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Limitation of Cross-Examination in Violation of the Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">{\u00b6 85} In his second of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cThe Trial Court Erred in Limiting the Scope of Cross Examination Thereby Depriving Appellant of His Constitutional Right Of Confrontation and Cross Examination in Violation of U.S. Const. Amend V, VI, XIV and Ohio Const. Art. I \u00a7 10 &amp; 16.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">{\u00b6 87} Kaufman asserts that the trial court violated his right to confront witnesses by not allowing Kaufman to cross-examine JB regarding his juvenile adjudication for the molestation of his step-brother, RT. The state counters that the elicitation of such testimony was barred by Evid.R. 609(D), R.C. 2151.357(H), and R.C. 2907.02(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">{\u00b6 88} A trial court enjoys broad discretion regarding the admissibility of evidence. Thus, an appellate court should not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Diar, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, at \u00b6 66; <em>State v. Shoop </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 462, 469, 622 N.E.2d 665. Because JB\u2019s adjudication involved matters of a sexual nature, the limitations of the rape-shield statute applied. Pursuant to the rape-shield statute, evidence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual activity is inadmissible \u201cunless it involves evidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, or the victim\u2019s past sexual activity with the offender, and only to the extent that the court finds that the evidence is material to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value.\u201d R.C. 2907.02(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">{\u00b6 89} The rape-shield statutes were designed to prohibit evidence that is extremely inflammatory and prejudicial and only marginally probative. <em>State v. Gardner </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 14, 17, 13 O.O.3d 8, 391 N.E.2d 337. \u201cThe court, in determining whether prior acts should be admitted, must balance the interests of the victim, which the statute is designed to protect, and the defendant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 33, 21 OBR 320, 487 N.E.2d 560. If the evidence in question is merely being used to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility, it is not of probative value as to the alleged rape itself and should not be admitted. Id. However, if the evidence has probative value to the determinative issue of fact\u2014 i.e., whether the victim was raped by the defendant on the date alleged \u2014 then the probative value of the testimony outweighs any interest the state has in exclusion. Id. at 36[, 21 OBR 320, 487 N.E.2d 560].\u201d <em>State v. Yenser, </em>176 Ohio App.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-1145, 889 N.E.2d 581, at \u00b6 4. See also <em>State v.

Counsel asked JB to specify, to which JB responded, \u201cSoon after I had moved in with my father, I was no longer allowed to come over, nor was I permitted to call my mother.\u201d Counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cQ: What you were complaining about is that you were not able to see your stepbrother [RT]; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cA: And my mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cQ: And you\u2019re attributing that to Michael Kaufman; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cA: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">{\u00b6 95} Counsel then had a side bar and asked to bring in extrinsic evidence of JB\u2019s juvenile adjudication for the molestation of RT, in order to impeach his testimony. Counsel intended to show that JB was removed from his mother and Kaufman\u2019s house due to the adjudication. The state asserted that JB did not make claims as to why he had to move out of the home, and moreover, it was Tracey\u2019s decision to kick JB out of the house, not any order from the juvenile court. Additionally, the state noted that allowing the evidence would open the door for the state to introduce testimony regarding Kaufman\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of RT, whose testimony had previously been barred as \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. The trial court decided that the matter was collateral and did not allow Kaufman to bring in extrinsic evidence of the adjudication. Upon further questioning, counsel asked JB why his mother and Kaufman wanted him out of the house, and JB responded that he did not know why. Counsel renewed his motion, and the trial court stated that Kaufman was stuck with the answer he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">{\u00b6 96} The question of exactly why JB hated Kaufman or what events led to JB being kicked out of his mother\u2019s and Kaufman\u2019s home are issues collateral to the case. The admission of evidence that JB had been adjudicated for the molestation of his younger brother would not help to prove or disprove any of the elements of any charges against Kaufman. It would have served only to impeach JB\u2019s credibility. Because the evidence served only to impeach JB and did not have any probative value regarding a material issue in the case, the evidence was inadmissible. The trial court\u2019s decision to bar such cross-examination was therefore not in error, let alone an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">{\u00b6 97} Additionally, although the topic of JB\u2019s adjudication was raised during pretrial discussions, Kaufman did not request a hearing or otherwise move <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the court to consider the admissibility of such evidence three or more days before trial as dictated by the rape-shield statute. R.C. 2907.02(E). Because Kaufman failed to give the statutorily required notice and request for hearing, he has waived the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">{\u00b6 98} Finally, even if JB\u2019s adjudication had not involved evidence of JB\u2019s prior sexual activity, the evidence nonetheless would have been barred by Evid.R. 609(D), which provides that evidence <em>of </em>a juvenile adjudication is not admissible for impeachment except as provided by statute. In his argument on appeal, Kaufman has not provided any statutory justification for the introduction of JB\u2019s adjudication, aside from R.C. 2151.357(H), which explicitly states that adjudication cannot be used for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness. As discussed above, proof that JB had been adjudicated at age 13 for molesting RT did not go to a material issue to Kaufman\u2019s case, and thus the attempted use was only for the purpose of impeaching JB\u2019s credibility. Again, the decision to prohibit the introduction of JB\u2019s juvenile adjudication was not error. Accordingly, Kaufman\u2019s second assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Improper Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">{\u00b6 99} In his fifth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cAppellant Was Denied Due Process, a Fair Trial and the Liberties Secured by the United States Constitution Amend.

An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies an attitude on the part of the court that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">{\u00b6 104} The state moved the trial court to include the <em>Eskridge </em>definition of force during jury instructions. See 38 Ohio St.3d at 58, 526 N.E.2d 304. The trial court provided the following information on the force specifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">{\u00b6 105} \u201cThe purpose to compel someone to submit must be by force or threat of force. Force means any violence, compulsion or constraint, physically exerted by any means upon or against any person or thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">{\u00b6 106} \u201cThreat includes any direct threat or any indirect threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cResistance, the prosecutor need not prove that the victim physically resisted the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">{\u00b6 108} \u201cThe court instructs you that when the relationship between the victim and the defendant is one of child and parent or stepparent or steprelative or other similar authority figure, the element of force need not be openly displayed or physically brutal. It can be subtle or slight or psychological or emotionally powerful. Evidence of an expressed threat of harm, or evidence of significant physical restraint is not required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cIf you find beyond a reasonable doubt that under the circumstances in the evidence, the victim\u2019s will was overcome by fear or duress or intimidation, then the element of force has been proved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">{\u00b6 110} Kaufman does not take issue with any of the wording of the trial court\u2019s instructions. Kaufman simply contends that the <em>Eskridge </em>portion of the instruction as a whole should not have been included because of his insufficient-evidence claim. Pursuant to our analysis in Kaufman\u2019s fourth assignment of error, the state presented sufficient evidence that Kaufman was in a position of authority over the victims. Moreover, the language of the instructions indicates that the trial court did not tell the jury that they must find Kaufman to have been in a position of authority over the victims. Instead, the trial court explained that a finding of an authoritative relationship was a condition precedent for the use of the relaxed \u201cpsychological force\u201d standard. The jury was free to use either force definition provided, depending on their findings regarding the relationship between Kaufman and the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">{\u00b6 111} There was sufficient evidence for the trial court to present the question of Kaufman\u2019s position of authority over the victims and thus the <em>Eskridge </em>definition of force. The trial court properly instructed the jury, and Kaufman\u2019s fifth assignment is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Abuse of Discretion to Allow Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">{\u00b6 112} In his sixth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 113} \u201cIt was An Abuse of Discretion for The Trial Court to Permit \u2018Expert\u2019 Testimony Without the Expert having Any Factual Basis for the Testimony Offered, Thereby Denying Appellant\u2019s Right to Due Process Guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1,16 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">{\u00b6 114} Kaufman argues that the expert testimony of Dr. Paul McPherson should not have been admitted because it merely bolstered the credibility <em>of </em>the victims, the general nature of the testimony rendered it irrelevant to the case, it involved information within the general knowledge of the jury, and it was not based on McPherson\u2019s first-hand knowledge about the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">{\u00b6 115} A trial court\u2019s determination of the admissibility of expert testimony is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Valentine v.

Adams, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">{\u00b6 116} Courts should favor the admissibility of expei't testimony whenever it is relevant and the criteria of Evid.R. 702 are met. <em>State v. Nemeth </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 202, 207, 694 N.E.2d 1332, citing <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 4 OBR 144, 446 N.E.2d 444, syllabus. Evid.R. 702 provides that a witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">{\u00b6 117} \u201c(A) The witness\u2019 testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">{\u00b6 118} \u201c(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">{\u00b6 119} \u201c(C) The witness\u2019 testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">{\u00b6 120} Additionally, Evid. R.703 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-13\">{\u00b6 121} \u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by him or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>{\u00b6 122} Thus, according to Evid.R. 702 and 703, McPherson\u2019s testimony must be needed to assist the jury, he must be adequately qualified as an expert on the specific subject matter, his testimony must be based on reliable information, and the information or opinion that he shares must be based on admitted evidence or on facts that McPherson has perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">{\u00b6 123} Kaufman does not raise issue with McPherson\u2019s general qualifications and seems to concede that it was not error to qualify McPherson as an expert in his field. McPherson was allowed to testify regarding his academic knowledge and professional experience with child sexual-abuse victims. McPherson testified that it is common for child victims to delay disclosure of the abuse or to partially disclose the abuse and that it is not common for anal penetration to result in permanent scars. The parties do not dispute that McPherson did not interview either victim or testify as to the specific facts regarding either victim. Further, the parties do not dispute the fact that McPherson did not give any opinion regarding JB\u2019s or KC\u2019s credibility or the veracity of their testimony. The court limited McPherson\u2019s testimony to general information and refused to allow specific hypothetical examples. Kaufman extensively cross-examined McPherson on statistics of false allegations and hypothetical questions about anal trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">{\u00b6 124} As his first argument, Kaufman contends that McPherson\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because he merely functioned as an advocate and bolstered the credibility of the victims. Kaufman cites <em>State v. Butcher, </em>170 Ohio App.3d 52, 2007-Ohio-118, 866 N.E.2d 13, in support of his argument. However, in <em>Butcher, </em>the witness\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because it was a violation of the rules against hearsay. Id. at \u00b6 66. The trial court in <em>Butcher </em>permitted the witness\u2019s testimony of the victim\u2019s statements through the medical hearsay exception. Id. at \u00b6 52. The appellate court found that the context of the medical interview was to collect evidence, not to diagnose, and there had been no voir dire of the victims. Id. at \u00b6 66-71. Because that witness was a manufactured witness for the state, the hearsay testimony was not inherently reliable under the medical hearsay exception. In the case at hand, the trial court was not concerned with the inherent reliability of McPherson\u2019s hearsay statements because McPherson offered no hearsay testimony. As for Kaufman\u2019s contention that McPherson merely acted to bolster the credibility of the victims, it is well established that expert testimony that bolsters a victim\u2019s credibility is permissible. <em>State v. Jordan, </em>7th Dist. No. 06 HA 586, 2007-Ohio-3333, 2007 WL 1880029, at \u00b6 24, citing <em>State v. Stowers </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 262, 690 N.E.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">{\u00b6 125} Kaufman\u2019s argument attempts to create an expert-advocate dichotomy out of the medical professional-advocate dichotomy under Evid.R. 803(4). Such a dichotomy does not exist under the rules of evidence applicable to this case, Evid.R. 702 and 703. An expert witness\u2019s first-hand testimony, like any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>other witness\u2019s first-hand testimony, can be believed or disbelieved by the finder of fact, and there is no requirement that all experts only provide \u201cinherently reliable\u201d testimony. Kaufman\u2019s first argument is therefore not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 126} As his second argument, Kaufman contends that McPherson\u2019s testimony was so general that it did not make the existence of any material fact in the case more or less probable and was thus inadmissible pursuant to Evid.R. 401 and 402. However, evidence that impeaches or bolsters witness credibility \u201cis of consequence to the action because it might determine whether the jury believes a particular witness.\u201d <em>State v. Moore </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 65, 531 N.E.2d 691. Moreover, an expert witness is permitted to testify about general information which allows the finder of fact to draw its own conclusion. See, e.g., <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 131, 22 OBR 203, 489 N.E.2d 795 (allowing expert testimony concerning factors that might impair the accuracy of a typical eyewitness identification). The Ohio Supreme Court has specifically stated that testimony from a qualified expert on the general behavioral characteristics of sexually abused children is admissible. <em>State v. Stowers </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 262, 690 N.E.2d 881. As Kaufman himself argued, McPherson\u2019s testimony functioned to bolster the credibility of the victims, specifically the common patterns of disclosure of child sex-abuse victims. McPherson\u2019s testimony was therefore not inadmissible due to relevancy issues. Kaufman\u2019s second argument is therefore not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">{\u00b6 127} As his third argument, Kaufman argues that McPherson\u2019s testimony was inadmissible under Evid.R. 702(A) because he offered no specialized knowledge outside the realm of the common knowledge of the jury. Kaufman primarily relies on <em>State v. Roquemore </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 448, 620 N.E.2d 110, in support of his argument. The expert testimony in <em>Roquemore </em>was an opinion on whether a violent \u201ctype\u201d of person would have committed the crime in question based on a crime-scene photograph assessment and comparison with statistics on other violent crimes. Id. at 453-154, 620 N.E.2d 110. In essence, the expert witness testified that because the crime scene was disorganized, the crime was committed in a violent rage. Id. at 454, 620 N.E.2d 110. Such testimony not only contravened Evid.R. 702(A) because the jury was able to determine whether something violent had happened at the scene, but the testimony was also questionable under Evid.R. 705 for a lack of statistical reliability, under Evid.R. 403(A) for the prejudicial way in which the defendant was profiled or stereotyped, and under Evid.R. 404(A) for imputing a violent character to the defendant without the issue of the defendant\u2019s character having been raised. Id. at 454-456, 620 N.E.2d 110. Such issues are not applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>{\u00b6 128} Instead, it is established in Ohio law that the average fact-finder may require assistance in understanding the \u201cbehavioral characteristics of minor victims of sexual abuse.\u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>176 Ohio App.3d 378, 2008-Ohio-2578, 891 N.E.2d 1280, at \u00b6 56, discussing <em>Stowers, </em>supra. This includes the characteristics of typical child victims in regard to their disclosure of the abuse. See <em>State v. McGlown, </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1163, 2009-Ohio-2160, 2009 WL 1263173, at \u00b6 41; <em>State v. Bortner, </em>9th Dist. No. 02CA008189, 2003-Ohio-3508, 2003 WL 21509000, at \u00b6 46. The trial court in this case allowed McPherson to testify to help the jury better understand the behavioral characteristics of child sex-abuse victims that a layperson might not normally take into account, provided that McPherson did not testify as to the veracity of the victims\u2019 statements. The trial court allowed the testimony in accordance with current Ohio case law and with Evid.R. 702(A) and was thus not an abuse of discretion. Kaufman\u2019s third argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 129} As a fourth argument, Kaufman argues that McPherson\u2019s testimony was inadmissible pursuant to Evid.R. 703 because he had no first-hand knowledge about the victims. Kaufman relies on cases in which experts testified regarding the consistency of the particular victim\u2019s behavior with that generally observed in other victims. Kaufman argues that those cases should not apply here, because McPherson had no information about JB and KC. It is true that McPherson\u2019s testimony would have been inadmissible had he offered specific conclusions about JB and KC without being given any information about them. However, McPherson did not provide any specific conclusions about JB and KC.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 130} Evid.R. 703, as it applies to this case, does require that McPherson testify only about facts that he has perceived. However, it does not require that he testify on facts specific to the case. As noted above, an expert witness is allowed to testify about general background information that might assist the fact-finder. <em>Buell, </em>supra. See also, e.g., <em>Wightman v. Consol. Rail Corp. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 431, 437-438, 715 N.E.2d 546 (providing general statistics on railroad crossings); <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038 (providing general expert testimony regarding gang culture). The Rules of Evidence do not require that an expert witness provide a factual link between his general testimony and the specific facts of a case. As to the information imparted by McPherson, Kaufman does not argue that his statistics were unfounded or that he gave inaccurate information regarding his personal professional experience with children making allegations of sexual abuse. Thus, McPherson\u2019s testimony was admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 703, and Kaufman\u2019s fourth argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">{\u00b6 131} In summary, McPherson\u2019s testimony was within the permissible bounds of the Rules of Evidence. McPherson testified about characteristics of sexually abused children. He made no comparison between those generalities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>within his expertise and the victims in question. He offered no opinion as to whether JB and KC had in fact been sexually abused, whether he believed the testimony of JB and KC, or whether JB and KC were credible witnesses. McPherson only provided information regarding common patterns of child-abuse victims in order to assist the jury in their assessment of JB and KC\u2019s credibility. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing McPherson to testify, Kaufman\u2019s sixth assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">{\u00b6 132} In his tenth of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 133} \u201cAppellant Was Denied Due Process, a Fair Trial and the Liberties Secured by the United States Constitution Amend.

Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">{\u00b6 136} As his first argument, Kaufman contends that the state asked improper questions during the cross-examination of Tracey and Kaufman in order to imply that they were bad people. During Tracey\u2019s cross-examination, the state asked the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">{\u00b6 137} \u201cQ: You understand that [JB] loves you; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-12\">{\u00b6 138} \u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>{\u00b6 139} \u201cQ: And if he had complained to you about sexual abuse, and you didn\u2019t do anything about it, that would make you a pretty bad mother, wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">{\u00b6 140} \u201cA: Yes it would.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 141} During Kaufman\u2019s cross-examination, the state asked the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 142} \u201cQ: And if you [committed the offenses charged], that would make you a bad person, wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 143} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">{\u00b6 144} \u201cA: I would think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">{\u00b6 145} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">{\u00b6 146} \u201cQ: A really sick person; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">{\u00b6 147} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">{\u00b6 148} \u201cA: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">{\u00b6 149} Kaufman contends that these two exchanges were only for the purpose of attacking the witness\u2019s character. The general scope of the questioning of Tracey was appropriate, given that her direct examination included repeated testimony that JB had not disclosed the abuse to her at any point. However, the form of the questions posed to Tracey and to Kaufman was inappropriate. The state seems to have worded the questions merely to have the witnesses assent to questions with the words \u201cbad mother\u201d and \u201csick person\u201d in them, even though the hypothetical nature of the questions added nothing to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">{\u00b6 150} Kaufman\u2019s argument indicates that he is taking issue with these two questions because of the general impression that the mere utterance of the questions would leave in the jury\u2019s mind. However, we cannot conclude that the jury decided that Tracey was a bad mother and that Kaufman was a sick person due to the state\u2019s hypothetical questions which elicited obvious answers. While it would have been preferable for the state to have refrained from adding such superfluous questions, the questions did not rise to the level of prejudicial error in the context of the entirety of testimony presented at trial. See, e.g., <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 226, 230, 533 N.E.2d 272 (noting that the reference to the defendant\u2019s nickname as originating from shooting a sleeping woman in the head, while improper, was insignificant compared to the weight of the evidence presented). Within the larger scope of the cross-examinations, the witnesses answered the questions in a way that indicated that they did not share the qualities of the sick or bad people described. Kaufman was not denied a fair trial merely because the state asked the foregoing questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>{\u00b6 151} As his second argument, Kaufman contends that the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by stating during closing argument that Kaufman was \u201ca liar, a con artist, and a child molester.\u201d Again, Kaufman asserts that the state improperly impugned his character.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">{\u00b6 152} Because the statements were made during the state\u2019s closing arguments, \u201cwe must keep in mind the latitude counsel is given during closing arguments and that the closing must be viewed in its entirety in determining whether the complained of remarks were prejudicial.\u201d <em>State v. Morris, </em>7th Dist. No. 08 CO 7, 2009-Ohio-3326, 2009 WL 1915140, at \u00b6 133, citing <em>State v. Byrd </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 79, 82, 512 N.E.2d 611; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. An appellate court must \u201cview the state\u2019s closing argument in its entirety to determine whether the allegedly improper remarks were prejudicial.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 466, 739 N.E.2d 749. A conviction should be reversed due to improper statements in closing only if the jury would have found the defendant not guilty but for the improper statements. <em>State v. Benge </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 136, 141, 661 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"> {\u00b6 153} The state has the duty to pursue the convictions of guilty defendants with all appropriate zeal. However, the state\u2019s arguments to the jury cannot extend beyond reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence presented. A prosecutor may state his opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial. <em>Diar, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, at \u00b6 213. For example, in <em>State v. Carter, </em>7th Dist. No. 05 JE 7, 2007-Ohio-3502, 2007 WL 1976666, this court noted that a prosecutor may state in closing arguments that the defendant is \u201csomeone who kills people,\u201d as a conclusion based on the evidence presented during trial that the defendant had killed someone. Id. at \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">(\u00b6 154} The state presented evidence during trial that Kaufman had manipulated the victims into submitting to his sexual abuse, violating their trust and the trust of the other family members involved in the victims\u2019 lives at the time. Although \u201c \u2018[a] conviction based solely on the inflammation of fears and passions, rather than proof of guilt, requires reversal\u2019 * * *, \u2018[r]ealism compels us to recognize that criminal trials cannot be squeezed dry of all feeling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter, </em>at \u00b6 45, quoting <em>State v. Williams </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 16, 20, 23 OBR 13, 490 N.E.2d 906, and <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 409, 613 N.E.2d 203. Although the state\u2019s choice of words could be seen as hyperbolic, the depiction of Kaufman was based on evidence presented at trial and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom. Moreover, any potential error from the statement would have been corrected by the trial court\u2019s instructions that the arguments of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>counsel were not evidence. <em>Diar </em>at \u00b6 211, citing <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 436, 588 N.E.2d 819. Thus the state\u2019s single description of Kaufman as \u201ca liar, a con artist, and a child molester\u201d in its closing argument was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">{\u00b6 155} Finally, Kaufman argues that the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by inserting into evidence the fact that all witnesses for the state were gone and could not be called back to provide rebuttal testimony. Kaufman points out that the state further exploited this evidence during closing arguments by implying that Kaufman waited for the witnesses to leave as part of his trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 156} As noted above, the state had some latitude to make broad statements or inferences during its closing argument. However, a prosecutor is not permitted to go beyond the admissible evidence in a trial. <em>Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The state should avoid insinuations, which are not supported by admissible evidence, which are used to mislead a jury. Id. at 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. In <em>Smith, </em>the prosecution stated during closing arguments that the entirety of the defense\u2019s evidence was fabricated, and implied that defense counsel had committed perjury by intentionally manufacturing the allegedly false evidence presented. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court found that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was flagrant and overarching to the point of depriving the defendant of a fair trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 157} Some parallel could be drawn between <em>Smith </em>and this case in that the state in this case made an unsupported inference regarding Kaufman\u2019s trial strategy in order to undermine his credibility. However, during the state\u2019s closing statements, the state appears to be undermining Kaufman\u2019s credibility specifically regarding conflicting testimony regarding whether or not Donna\u2019s bathroom door could be locked. The state did not make the kind of flagrant overarching comments that were at issue in <em>Smith. </em>The testimony regarding the bathroom door was pertinent to whether or not KC was a credible witness, or specifically whether KC\u2019s testimony regarding one particular instance of abuse was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 158} The state\u2019s insinuation was not terribly strong: Kaufman testified that he thought that the state\u2019s witnesses would still be available at the time of his testimony. Kaufman specifically argued against the state\u2019s claim that he \u201cconveniently\u201d waited until the state rested to introduce the fact that the bathroom door did not lock and pointed out that the evidence was in fact discussed before the state rested. The jury found that KC was, overall, credible despite the strong evidence that he was mistaken as to whether Donna\u2019s second floor bathroom could be locked. The jury\u2019s finding of credibility could have been based on the other consistent and credible testimony offered by KC or perhaps based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>fact that the bathroom door was a relatively small and collateral piece of evidence. It is less likely that the jury would have acquitted Kaufman but for the state\u2019s improper but relatively weak statements. Given the entirety of the evidence presented and the context of the state\u2019s statements, the state\u2019s misconduct did not prejudice Kaufman so as to deprive him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 159} In conclusion, counsel for the state did exceed the boundaries of propriety a few times during cross-examination and closing statements. However \u201c[i]f every remark made by counsel outside of the testimony were ground for a reversal, comparatively few verdicts would stand, since in the ardor of advocacy, and in the excitement of trial, even the most experienced of counsel are occasionally carried away by this temptation.\u201d <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 267, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, quoting <em>Dunlop v. United States </em>(1897), 165 U.S. 486, 498, 17 S.Ct. 375, 41 L.Ed. 799. The few instances of misconduct by the state did not pervade Kaufman\u2019s trial to the point that he was denied his due process right to a fair trial. Accordingly, Kaufman\u2019s tenth assignment of error is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Improper Joinder in Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">{\u00b6 160} In his first of ten assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 161} \u201cThe Trial Court Erred by Denying Relief from Improper Joinder of the Indictment Thereby Depriving Appellant a Fair Trial in Violation of U.S. CONST. Amend. VI, and XIV; and OHIO CONST. Art. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9, 10, and 16.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">{\u00b6 162} Kaufman contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for relief from prejudicial joinder. Kaufman asserts that the trial court should have granted separate trials for each of the two victims in the complaints against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">{\u00b6 163} Crim.R. 8(A) provides that \u201c[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, information or complaint in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting pai-ts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\u201d The law favors joinder because a single trial will conserve time and expense and may minimize the potentially disparate outcomes that can result from successive trials before different juries. <em>State v. Schiebel </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 86-87, 564 N.E.2d 54; <em>State v. Torres </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288; <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 225, 15 O.O.3d 234, 400 N.E.2d 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">{\u00b6 164} However, the interest in joint trials is not unrestricted. Crim.R. 14 protects parties from prejudicial joinder and states, \u201cIf it appears that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>defendant * * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts * * *, or provide such other relief as justice requires.\u201d Severance may be warranted if the trial court finds a serious risk that a joint trial would prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence. <em>Zafiro v. United States </em>(1993), 506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">{\u00b6 165} \u201cWhen a defendant claims that he was prejudiced by the joinder of multiple offenses, a court must determine (1) whether evidence of the other crimes would be admissible even if the counts were severed, and (2) if not, whether the evidence of each crime is simple and distinct.\u201d <em>State v. Schaim </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 59, 600 N.E.2d 661. The first determination, known as the \u201cother acts test,\u201d may negate prejudice from joinder if the state could have introduced evidence of one offense in a separate trial of another offense under the other-acts portion of Evid.R. 404(B). <em>State v. Franklin </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, 580 N.E.2d 1. The second determination, known as the \u201cjoinder test,\u201d only requires a showing that the evidence of each of the joined offenses is simple and direct. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"> {\u00b6 166} It is the defendant who bears the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced by joinder. <em>State v. Clifford </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 207, 211, 733 N.E.2d 621, citing Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288. Absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion, a trial court\u2019s decision regarding joinder will not be disturbed. <em>Torres', Clifford. </em>The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the trial court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. <em>State v. Adams, </em>62 Ohio St.2d at 158,16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 167} Kaufman argues that neither the other-acts test nor the joinder test was satisfied in this case. Kaufman first argues that the evidence from each victim would be inadmissible as other-acts evidence in separate trials under Evid.R. 404(B) and the rape-shield statute. Kaufman states that the alleged pattern of committing sex offenses against children in a secretive manner is not evidence of a unique modus operandi, but instead simply multiple offenses. The state argues that the evidence would have been admissible under Evid.R. 404(B) because the offenses were committed with the same modus operandi and showed motive, opportunity, intent, plan, knowledge, and/or absence of mistake or accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 168} During the March 11, 2008 hearing on Kaufman\u2019s motion to sever and the state\u2019s motion to admit other-acts testimony for unindicted offenses against RT, which the trial court denied, the state\u2019s position on both motions was that Kaufman\u2019s similar modus operandi with each victim justified the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>other victims\u2019 evidence in all of the charged offenses. Although there was much discussion by counsel regarding the motions, the trial court did not provide reasoning on the record as to why it specifically overruled Kaufman\u2019s motion to sever. In the written judgment entry, the trial court stated only that Kaufman failed to demonstrate that he would be prejudiced by the joinder of the offenses and quoted the language of Crim.R. 8(A) that the offenses \u201care of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\u201d Thus, although the state argued in favor of joinder only under the other-acts test, the trial court did not indicate whether it had overruled Kaufman\u2019s motion for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 169} Looking first at the \u201cother acts test,\u201d we analyze whether evidence from each victim would have been admissible in other trials if they had been severed as requested. We note that \u201c[t]he admissibility of other acts evidence is carefully limited because of the substantial danger that the jury will convict the defendant solely because it assumes that the defendant has a propensity to commit criminal acts, or deserves punishment regardless of whether he or she committed the crime charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>Schaim, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 59, 600 N.E.2d 661, citing <em>State v. Cury </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 68, 72 O.O.2d 37, 330 N.E.2d 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 170} Had there been separate trials for the offenses against the different victims, a request to admit testimony from other victims would need to have survived both Evid.R. 404 and the rape-shield statutes. Evid.R. 404 states that \u201c[e]vidence of a person\u2019s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion\u201d and that \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Evid.R. 404 notes that exceptions apply pursuant to rape and gross-sexual-imposition statutes. The exception language in both the rape and gross-sexual-imposition statutes, R.C. 2907.02(D) and 2907.05(E) is identical and states:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 171} \u201cEvidence of specific instances of the defendant\u2019s sexual activity, opinion evidence of the defendant\u2019s sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the defendant\u2019s sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section unless it involves evidence of the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, the defendant\u2019s past sexual activity with the victim, or is admissible against the defendant under section 2945.59 of the Revised Code, and only to the extent that the court finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>that the evidence is material to a fact at issue in the case and that its inflammatory or prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">{\u00b6 172} Because we are looking at the admission of sexual-activity evidence from two different victims that do not involve the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease, the other-acts evidence must be admissible pursuant to R.C. 2945.59, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 173} \u201cIn any criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 174} Thus, there are only a few limited circumstances under which other acts involving sexual activity would be admissible in a separate case. The state\u2019s objective of showing that Kaufman had committed the offenses with the same pattern would only fall under the \u201cscheme, plan, or system\u201d category of R.C. 2945.59. However, such \u201cpattern\u201d evidence is only relevant in a case under two scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 175} The first scenario exists in a case when \u201cthe \u2018other acts\u2019 form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment. In such cases, it would be virtually impossible to prove that the accused committed the crime 'charged without also introducing evidence of the other acts. To be admissible pursuant to this subcategory of \u2018scheme, plan or system\u2019 evidence, the \u2018other acts\u2019 testimony must concern events which are inextricably related to the alleged criminal act.\u201d <em>Curry, </em>43 Ohio St.2d at 73, 72 O.O.2d 37, 330 N.E.2d 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">{\u00b6 176} An example of inextricably related acts might involve overlapping time and place of the offenses against different victims, such as occurred in <em>In re Hollobaugh, </em>7th Dist. No. 08 MA 22, 2009-Ohio-797, 2009 WL 428576, at \u00b6 35: \u201cFor instance, victim B related that he stood look out for appellant during an assault on victim A, which assault was previously described by victim A. * * * Victim B also disclosed that he and his brother once gave appellant oral sex at the same time.\u201d However, when the acts against separate victims are \u201cchronologically and factually separate occurrences, they are generally not inextricably related.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 647, 667, 617 N.E.2d 1160, citing <em>State v. Eubank </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 183, 14 O.O.3d 416, 398 N.E.2d 567. In the case at hand, the offenses alleged occurred at temporally distinct times against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>victims who did not know one another. Neither victim\u2019s evidence was necessary for the background or explanation of the other victim\u2019s allegations. Thus, the evidence from other victims could not be admitted as other-acts evidence under this first scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 177} The second scenario exists in a case when the identity of the perpetrator of a crime is at issue. See, e.g., <em>State v. Coley </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 259-260, 754 N.E.2d 1129; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 157-159, 652 N.E.2d 721. \u201cIdentity is in issue when the fact of the crime is open and evident but the perpetrator is unknown and the accused denies that he committed the crime.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>at 666, 617 N.E.2d 1160. See also <em>Schaim, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 53, 600 N.E.2d 661, fn. 1. As is often the case in offenses of a sexual nature, whether or not the crime actually occurred is in issue and is thus not open and evident. Here, the identity of the offender is not disputed. Like the facts in <em>Schaim, </em>there is no dispute that if the victims were telling the truth, Kaufman was the perpetrator. See <em>Schaim </em>at 61, 600 N.E.2d 661. This indicates that witness credibility rather than identity is the material issue in the case. Thus the evidence from other victims should not be admitted as other-acts evidence under this second scenario.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 178} More importantly, in the same hearing on Kaufman\u2019s motion for relief from prejudicial joinder, the trial court denied the state\u2019s motion to admit evidence of other acts through the testimony of RT, the victim not included in the original indictment. The state had requested the admission of evidence from the additional victim for the same reason: in order to demonstrate that Kaufman committed additional offenses in the same manner against the same type of victim. The trial court noted the extremely prejudicial nature of other-acts evidence during that hearing and during later discussion on the matter at trial. Given the trial court\u2019s decision on a different alleged victim on the same other-acts issue, the trial court could not have denied Kaufman\u2019s motion for relief from prejudicial joinder on the same grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 179} Based on the foregoing, it is clear that joinder was not possible under the other-acts test. Thus, the only way joinder would have been permissible in this case would have been through satisfaction of the broader joinder test.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 180} The joinder test only requires that the evidence of each joined offense is simple and distinct and ensures that a jury would be capable of segregating the proof required for each offense. <em>Schaim </em>at 62, 600 N.E.2d 661; <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, at \u00b6 37; <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 362, 582 N.E.2d 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">{\u00b6 181} On this point, Kaufman argues that the evidence was not simple and distinct because the inflammatory nature of the offenses prevented the jury from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>being able to segregate the evidence as it applied to each victim. The state counters that the evidence was simple and distinct because the testimony of each victim was separate and uncomplicated. The state relies primarily on <em>State v. Bell, </em>7th Dist. No. 06 MA 189, 2008-Ohio-3959, 2008 WL 3009858, and <em>In re Hollobaugh, </em>7th Dist. No. 08 MA 22, 2009-Ohio-797, 2009 WL 428576, to support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 182} It is true that <em>Hollobaugh and Bell </em>survived the \u201csimple and direct evidence\u201d analysis on the joinder issues raised therein. However, the joinder issue in both of those cases was resolved under a plain-error standard of review due to waiver. Here, Kaufman timely moved for relief from prejudicial joinder and renewed his motion repeatedly during trial in order to preserve the issue for appeal. Additionally, <em>Bell </em>and <em>Hollobaugh </em>are both factually distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 183} In <em>Bell, </em>the presence <em>of </em>DNA evidence linked the perpetrator to the offenses. <em>Bell </em>at \u00b6 21-22. Due to the immediate reporting of the victims and the presence of DNA evidence, the fact of the crimes in <em>Bell </em>was open and evident, which indicates that the testimony otherwise may have been admissible pursuant to the second scenario of the other-acts test as described above. In <em>Hollobaugh, </em>this court relied on the fact that the case was tried under the Juvenile Rules, and at a bench trial rather than to a jury, in order to conclude that the risk of prejudice from multiple inflammatory accusations was low. <em>Hollobaugh </em>at \u00b6 34. This court also pointed out the inextricable nature of the victims\u2019 testimony, which indicates that the testimony otherwise may have been admissible pursuant to the first scenario of the other-acts test. Id. at \u00b6 35. Thus, although the factual backgrounds of these two cases may be similar to the one at hand, they do not support a finding of nonprejudicial joinder in this case due to additional factors at play.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 184} Focusing entirely on the simplicity versus complexity of evidence, this case could be appropriate for joinder at first blush. The offenses took place during different time periods, in different places, against different victims. Each victim gave clear testimony as to his allegations, and the testimony offered by one victim did not contradict or overlap with the testimony of the other victim. We have no reason to presume that the jury confused which offenses Kaufman committed against KC and which offenses Kaufman committed against JB.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\"> {\u00b6 185} However, complexity of information is not the only consideration in this analysis. This inquiry at hand \u201cfocuses on whether the trier of fact is likely to consider \u2018evidence of one [offense] as corroborative of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Wiles </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 571 N.E.2d 97, quoting <em>Dunaway v. United States </em>(C.A.D.C.1953), 205 F.2d 23, 27. The risk of the jury erroneously using one victim\u2019s evidence to corroborate the other victim\u2019s testimony is not only possible through the confusion of facts, but also through mistakenly presuming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>that the numerous similarities between unrelated, offenses make it more likely that the offenses occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"> {\u00b6 186} As stated in <em>Torres, </em>\u201c[j]oinder may be prejudicial when the offenses are unrelated and the evidence as to each is very weak, * * * but it is otherwise when the evidence is direct and uncomplicated <em>and can reasonably be separated as to each offense.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Torres, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 343, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288. In <em>Schaim, </em>the defendant had been convicted of rape and gross sexual imposition stemming from offenses against his adopted daughter and a younger daughter. <em>Schaim, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 52, 600 N.E.2d 661. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected the state\u2019s argument that the evidence against Schaim was simple and direct enough to avoid prejudice. After pointing out that even the appellate court had confused the testimony of two of the victims, the Ohio Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[g]iven the highly inflammatory nature of the offenses, the similarities between portions of [the victims\u2019] testimony, and the fact that joinder allowed the state to circumvent the prohibition on other acts testimony, we conclude that the defendant was prejudiced by the consolidated trial.\u201d Id. at 62-63, 600 N.E.2d 661. Thus, prejudice can occur with offenses which are highly inflammatory in nature and involve similar victim testimony. When such prejudice was demonstrated in <em>Schaim, </em>the trial court \u201cabused its discretion in refusing to sever these counts, particularly when its reasons for doing so were based on the fact that committing one of these Crimes shows a propensity to commit another \u2014 an inference that a jury is forbidden to draw.\u201d Id. at 63, 600 N.E.2d 661. Although Kaufman\u2019s offenses against victims JB and KC were distinct in terms of time and place, the similarities between the sexual abuses committed against each victim, the inflammatory nature of the offenses, and the weakness of the evidence, especially in regards to JB, all indicate that the risk of prejudice from joinder in this case was extremely high.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 187} Because there is an especially high danger that the jury may cumulate the evidence of separate offenses that are jointly tried, \u201cboth the trial court and counsel must conduct such a trial with \u2018vigilant precision in speech and action far beyond that required in the ordinary trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Garrett, </em>12th Dist. No. CA2008-08-075, 2009-Ohio-5442, 2009 WL 3260640, at \u00b649, quoting <em>Drew v. United States </em>(C.A.D.C.1964), 331 F.2d 85, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 188} Such \u201cprecision in speech and action\u201d was not conducted here and is most clearly exemplified by the state\u2019s following remarks during closing arguments: \u201cThere are no eyewitnesses to these types of crimes. They happen in private with the defendant or any other defendant, and the victim. But what you have here is even stronger than if there were eyewitnesses, because you have two independent victims, separate and apart. * * * That is stronger than an eyewitness. <em>That is independent corroboration. </em>They both said what happened to them, and <em>they corroborate each other\u2019s stories, </em>because what happened to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>is essentially the mirror image of what happened to the other.\u201d (Emphasis added). This statement elucidates the risk of prejudice from erroneously considering the separate evidence of JB and KC cumulatively, especially in light of the weakness of the evidence regarding victim JB. As in <em>Schaim, </em>we find that Kaufman was prejudiced by the joinder of multiple victims, given the inflammatory nature of the offenses, the similar victim testimony, and the fact that the state was able to use the \u201cjoinder test\u201d as a back door to present an \u201cother acts\u201d and propensity argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 189} Our conclusion is not meant to imply that any offenses of a sexual nature must be severed for fear that a fact-finder will erroneously use the evidence of one crime to corroborate the other. A good example of when multiple sexual offenses do not call for severance is in this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State v. Dew, </em>7th Dist. No. 08 MA 62, 2009-Ohio-6537, 2009 WL 4756342. In <em>Dew, </em>the defendant requested separate trials for two groups of victims, one group of victims who were minors at the time of the offenses and one group of victims who were adults. Id. at \u00b6 6, 89. The circumstances of Dew\u2019s offenses against the two groups of victims, as well as his relationships with the two groups of victims, were rather different: Dew had been a gymnastics coach for the minors, had a great amount of control over their lives, was an authority figure and even a father figure to the victims, and groomed the victims over a number of years. Id. at \u00b6 5-22. As for the adult victims, they received unnecessary and inappropriate chiropractic treatments by Dew. Id. at \u00b6 31-40. There was no indication in <em>Dew </em>that each victim\u2019s allegation was used in order to argue that the victims\u2019 claims independently corroborated one another and, by implication, made it more likely that the offenses occurred. There was further indication that the jury was in fact able to segregate the evidence regarding each victim, as the jury acquitted Dew on a number of counts. Id. at \u00b6 95, citing <em>State v. Schiebel </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 88, 564 N.E.2d 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 190} When keeping in mind the policies promoted by the rape-shield statute, which must be applied equally to protect both the victims and the defendants, the tendency for a jury to use one victim\u2019s testimony to corroborate the other\u2019s is too likely given the particular facts presented at Kaufman\u2019s trial. Although it may not have been an abuse of discretion for the trial court to initially deny Kaufman\u2019s motion for relief from prejudicial joinder, the trial court abused its discretion by summarily denying the motion when Kaufman renewed his motion both after the state\u2019s case in chief and at the close of trial. Accordingly, Kaufman\u2019s first assignment of error is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Remaining Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">{\u00b6 191} In his seventh, eighth, and ninth assignments of error, Kaufman asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>{\u00b6 192} \u201cAppellant Was Denied Due Process, a Fair Trial and the Liberties Secured by the United States Constitution Amend. V &amp; XIV and Ohio Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 16 When the Trial Court Provided Assistance to the State to Insure All Evidence of all Elements had been Presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">{\u00b6 193} \u201cThe Trial Court Abused its Discretion in Denying a Request for Continuance When Defense Counsel Cannot Provide Effective Assistance of Counsel and Additional Time is Needed to Prepare.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 194} \u201cAppellant\u2019s Convictions and Sentences Are in Violation of the State and Federal Constitutions Because Appellant Was Denied the Effective Assistance of Counsel. U.S. CONST., Amend. VI and XIV; OHIO CONST., Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1,10 and 16.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 195} Given our disposition of Kaufman\u2019s first assignment of error, Kaufman\u2019s seventh, eighth, and ninth assignments of error are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 196} In conclusion, Kaufman\u2019s assertions regarding sufficiency of the evidence, manifest weight of the evidence, cross-examination, jury instructions, expert testimony, and prosecutorial misconduct are meritless. However, Kaufman\u2019s assertion of prejudicial joinder is well taken and his first assignment of error is meritorious. Kaufman\u2019s remaining assignments of error are rendered moot due to the resolution of the first assignment of error. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b136-9\">Donofrio, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b136-10\">Vukovich, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b136-11\">Vukovich, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AH0\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">{\u00b6 197} I dissent from the decision to reverse appellant\u2019s conviction merely because sexual offenses committed against two child-victims were joined in one trial. I believe that the defendant has not met his burden of establishing prejudice under the \u201cjoinder test.\u201d As a result, the \u201cother acts\u201d test is irrelevant. <em>State v. Johnson </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 95, 109, 723 N.E.2d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">{\u00b6 198} As the majority points out, joinder is favored in the law. The joinder test is \u201cless stringent\u201d than the \u201cstricter\u201d other-acts test. Id. at 109, 723 N.E.2d 1054; <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 50. Thus, policy reasons for the other-acts test should not seep into the application of the joinder test.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">{\u00b6 199} A claim of prejudice can be negated if the evidence of each joined offense is simple and direct. <em>LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 767 N.E.2d 166, at \u00b6 50, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>52. Thus, where the proof of the joined offenses was separate and distinct and the jury was not likely to be confused as to which evidence proved which offense, a trial court does not abuse its discretion in refusing to sever the offenses. <em>State v. Coley </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 260, 754 N.E.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">{\u00b6 200} As for references to the strength of the evidence and the relatedness of the offenses, I believe that the majority misinterprets the following test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 201} \u201cJoinder may be prejudicial when the offenses are unrelated and the evidence as to each is very weak, * * * but it is otherwise when the evidence is direct and uncomplicated and can reasonably be separated as to each offense.\u201d <em>State v. Torres </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343-344, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">{\u00b6 202} This statement clearly means that if the second part of this sentence is satisfied, there is no prejudice regardless of the first part. Here, the evidence was direct and uncomplicated and could be reasonably and readily separated as to each offense. See <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 34. As the majority acknowledges, the offenses against each of the two victims were separated in time and place. Each victim testified as to their various allegations against appellant. There was no apparent confusion as to which acts were committed against which victim. The evidence was simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 203} In any event, I would not characterize the evidence as \u201cvery weak.\u201d See <em>Torres, </em>66 Ohio St.2d at 343-344, 20 O.O.3d 313, 421 N.E.2d 1288. The trial court, whose discretion is being evaluated here, heard and viewed the witnesses as they testified; this court did not. Furthermore, the offenses are not unrelated, as they involved the sexual abuse of two young male children by a person in a position of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">{\u00b6 204} Nor do I agree that the \u201cinflammatory\u201d nature of the allegations require severance. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court had no problem with joinder of a kidnapping/robbery victim with a <em>death-penalty </em>aggravated murder that occurred two months apart, focusing on the simplicity and directness of the evidence and the fact that it was unlikely that the jury confused the evidence proving the separate charges. <em>Johnson, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 110, 723 N.E.2d 1054. Cf. <em>State v. Schaim </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 63, 600 N.E.2d 661 (finding that the jury was not capable of segregating very similar evidence because even the three appellate judges could not keep the facts of each victim straight). Finally, this court recently upheld joinder where minor gymnast victims and adult chiropractic victims were joined for one trial where all allegations were sexual in nature. <em>State v. Dew, </em>7th Dist. No. 08MA62, 2009-Ohio-6537, 2009 WL 4756342, \u00b6 95-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">{\u00b6 205} Accordingly, I would overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error dealing with joinder. I would then overrule all other assignments of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>(including numbers seven through nine, which the majority found to be moot) and uphold appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
