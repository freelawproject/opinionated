Diorio Custom Homes, Inc., appeals the judgment of the Warren County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee, Westfield Insurance Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>{\u00b6 2} On January 9, 2008, David and Brenda Schumacher filed an underlying action against Diorio regarding Diorio\u2019s construction of their home and certain business practices. Among other allegations, the Schumachers alleged breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation on the basis that (1) Diorio failed to construct much of the home in a workmanlike manner, (2) Diorio failed to construct the home in a timely manner, and (3) Diorio misrepresented the time and expenses associated with the construction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">{\u00b6 3} Pursuant to a commercial general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy held by Diorio, Westfield defended Diorio in the underlying action under a reservation of rights. The CGL coverage form, which sets forth the terms and conditions of CGL coverage, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cSECTION I \u2014 COVERAGES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cCOVERAGE A.

We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages. However, we will have no duty to defend any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages for * * * \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance does not apply. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c b. This insurance applies to * * * \u2018property damage\u2019 only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(1) The * * * \u2018property damage\u2019 is caused by an \u2018occurrence\u2019 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">{\u00b6 10} The term \u201coccurrence\u201d is defined in Section V, paragraph 13, as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d \u201cProperty damage\u201d is defined in paragraph 17 to include \u201c[p]hysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it.\u201d \u201cProperty damage\u201d also includes \u201c[ljoss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u2018occurrence\u2019 that caused it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">{\u00b6 11} On December 26, 2008, Westfield filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration that it did not have a duty to defend the underlying action and that no coverage existed under the CGL policy. Westfield later moved for summary judgment to that effect. The trial court granted the motion and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>dismissed Diorio\u2019s counterclaim, which sought a declaratory judgment requiring Westfield to defend and indemnify it against the Schumachers\u2019 claims. In granting summary judgment against Diorio, the trial court stated that the Schumachers\u2019 complaint in the underlying case did not \u201cassert damage as the result of an \u2018occurrence\u2019 as defined in the policy. Consequently, there is no duty to defend [Diorio] in that action.\u201d From that order, Diorio timely appeals, asserting two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">{\u00b6 12} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Westfield.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">{\u00b6 14} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing Diorio\u2019s counterclaim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">{\u00b6 16} For ease of discussion, we will address both of Diorio\u2019s assignments of error concurrently. Diorio first argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Westfield because the insurer had a duty to defend Diorio in the underlying action. Diorio asserts that the Schumachers\u2019 complaint is ambiguous as to the damages sought and that the only damages specifically pleaded are consequential to construction delays. Thus, Diorio argues that the damages sought should be covered under the CGL policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">{\u00b6 17} In its second assignment of error, Diorio argues that the trial court erred in dismissing its counterclaim against Westfield for \u201cthe same reasons the trial court erred\u201d in granting summary judgment and finding that the claims in the underlying action could not even \u201cpotentially or arguably\u201d give rise to coverage under the policy. As stated, Diorio, in its counterclaim, sought a declaration from the trial court that Westfield is obligated, under the policy, to defend Diorio against any and all claims contained in the Schumachers\u2019 complaint and indemnify Diorio if liability is determined in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">{\u00b6 18} This court conducts a de novo review of a trial court\u2019s decision on summary judgment. <em>Burgess v. Tackas </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 294, 296, 708 N.E.2d 285. A court may grant summary judgment only when (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence submitted that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, who is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor. Civ.R. 56(C); <em>Welco Indus., Inc. v. Applied Cos. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 344, 346, 617 N.E.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cAn insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader and distinct from its duty to indemnify. The scope of the allegations in the complaint against the insured determines whether an insurance company has a duty to defend the insured. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The insurer must defend the insured in an action when the allegations state a claim that potentially or arguably falls within the liability insurance coverage. However, an insurer need not defend any action or claims within the complaint when all the claims are clearly and indisputably outside the contracted coverage.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ohio Govt. Risk Mgt. Plan v. Harrison, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 241, 2007-Ohio-4948, 874 N.E.2d 1155, \u00b6 19; <em>Paramount Parks, Inc. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>Warren App. No. CA2007-05-066, 2008-Ohio-1351, 2008 WL 757533, \u00b620.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">{\u00b6 20} As described above, the Schumachers\u2019 complaint alleges that Diorio failed to construct their home in a workmanlike manner, failed to construct the home in a timely manner, and misrepresented the time and expenses relating to the construction of their home. The Schumachers further allege that as a result of Diorio\u2019s breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, they have suffered damages in excess of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">{\u00b6 21} After an independent and thorough review of the record, we find that the allegations contained in the Schumachers\u2019 complaint failed to assert damages as the result of an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the policy. A CGL policy like the one at issue does not insure against claims for defective or negligent workmanship or construction, because defective workmanship does not constitute an \u201caccident.\u201d <em>Paramount Parks </em>at \u00b6 25; <em>Heile v. Herrmann </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 351, 353, 736 N.E.2d 566. Therefore, claims for defective or negligent workmanship do not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. Id. In addition, Diorio\u2019s alleged delay in rectifying any deficiencies and any resulting damages does not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined in the policy. <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Coastal Group, Inc., </em>Lorain App. No. 05CA008664, 2006-Ohio-153, 2006 WL 120041, at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">{\u00b6 22} The CGL policy at issue is not intended to protect Diorio \u201cagainst every risk of operating a business.\u201d <em>Heile, </em>136 Ohio App.3d at 353, 736 N.E.2d 566. This type of policy is intended to insure the risks of the insured causing damage to other persons and their property, but it is not intended to insure the insured\u2019s work itself. Id. Rather, the policies generally insure consequential risks that stem from the insured\u2019s work. Id. The claims for faulty workmanship and delays in construction appropriately fit within the definition of \u201cbusiness risks,\u201d as both are normal consequences of doing business that could have or should have been controlled by Diorio. Id.; <em>Coastal Group, </em>2006-Ohio-153, 2006 WL 120041, at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">{\u00b6 23} We recognize, however, that some courts have concluded an insured\u2019s defective workmanship on a construction project constitutes an insurable \u201coccurrence\u201d under a CGL policy. <em>Erie Ins. Exchange v. Colony Dev. Corp. </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 406, 736 N.E.2d 941; <em>Indiana Ins. Co. v. Alloyd Insulation Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Montgomery App. No. 18979, 2002-Ohio-3916, 2002 WL 1770491; <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. G.L.H. Inc., </em>Erie App. No. E-07-053, 2008-Ohio-3853, 2008 WL 2940663. These courts have reasoned that allegations of negligence in constructing a building and breaching a duty to perform in a workmanlike manner reasonably fall within the policy\u2019s definition of an \u201caccident,\u201d and therefore \u201coccurrence,\u201d because negligent acts are not done with the intent or expectation of causing injury or damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">{\u00b6 24} Assuming, arguendo, that delay, a failure to construct the home in a workmanlike manner, or misrepresentations of both constituted \u201coccurrences\u201d under the policy, we conclude that Westfield would still have no duty to defend or indemnify Diorio in the underlying action based upon the exclusions contained in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">{\u00b6 25} In addition to the general statement of coverage set forth above, the policy at issue contains a number of exceptions. In particular, the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c2.

See <em>Coastal Group, </em>2006-Ohio-153, 2006 WL 120041, at \u00b6 17; <em>Bosak v. H &amp; R Mason Contrs., Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 86237, 2005-Ohio-6732, 2005 WL 3475817 (exclusions in an insurance policy generally operate to ensure that most damage resulting from a contractor\u2019s own work is excluded from coverage because liability insurance should not be a warranty or performance bond for general contractors); <em>Acme Constr.

We also find the court did not err in dismissing Diorio\u2019s counterclaim against Westfield. Accordingly, both of Diorio\u2019s assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-8\">Young, P.J., and Ringland, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-13\">.
