The state is asking the court to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>appeal of defendant-appellant, Lamont Mitchell. On February 12, 2010, Mitchell timely filed his notice of appeal in connection with the trial court\u2019s January 25, 2010 judgment of conviction. In this judgment, the trial court corrected its February 2007 judgment of conviction and resentenced Mitchell pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163. Before addressing the merits of the state\u2019s arguments, a brief review of the procedural history in this case is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">{\u00b6 2} On January 31, 2007, Mitchell entered a no-contest plea and was found guilty by the court of trafficking in cocaine in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2) and (C)(4)(f). The trial court sentenced Mitchell on February 26, 2007. The trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction states: \u201cThe Court finds that defendant <em>has been convicted </em>of Trafficking in Cocaine a violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2) &amp; (C)(4)(f). Defendant given post release control notice under R.C. 2929.19(B)(3) and R.C. 2967.28.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Mitchell appealed his sentence. This court affirmed that sentence in <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>6th Dist. No. L-07-1092, 2007-Ohio-5316, 2007 WL 2874351.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">{\u00b6 3} On January 21, 2010, the trial court resentenced Mitchell pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, and <em>State v. Bloomer, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 200, 2009-Ohio-2462, 909 N.E.2d 1254. The corrected judgment of conviction states: \u201cThe Court finds on January 31, 2007, defendant entered a plea of No Contest and <em>was found Guilty </em>by the Court of * * * Trafficking Cocaine * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cIt is ordered that defendant serve a term of five (5) years in prison</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cDefendant given notice of * * * mandatory five (5) years post release control * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">Crim.R. 32(C) Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cIn <em>State v. Baker, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 197, 2008-Ohio-3330, 893 N.E.2d 163, syllabus, we held that Crim.R. 32(C) requires that a judgment of conviction set forth the following to be a final appealable order: \u2018(1) the guilty plea, the jury verdict, or the finding of the court upon which the conviction is based; (2) the sentence; (3) the signature of the judge; and (4) entry on the journal by the clerk of court.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Culgan v. Medina Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 535, 2008-Ohio-4609, 895 N.E.2d 805, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">{\u00b6 7} In <em>State ex rel. Culgan, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that a judgment of conviction that stated that the defendant \u201chas been convicted\u201d (the same language used in Mitchell\u2019s February 2007 judgment) was not a final, appealable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>order and did not comply with either Crim.R. 32(C) or <em>Baker </em>because the judgment did not contain a guilty plea, a jury verdict, or the finding of the court upon which the defendant\u2019s convictions were based. Id. at \u00b6 2, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">{\u00b6 8} Both the state and Mitchell acknowledge that the trial court\u2019s February 2007 sentencing entry did not comply with Crim.R. 32 or <em>Baker </em>because the trial court used the phrase \u201chas been convicted\u201d instead of \u201cfound guilty.\u201d The real dispute between the parties arises as to how this court should treat that noncompliant <em>Baker </em>sentencing entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 9} Mitchell argues that the February 2007 sentencing entry was a not a final, appealable order because it did not comply with Crim.R. 32(C) or <em>Baker, </em>and the subsequent decision by this court affirming Mitchell\u2019s sentence was a nullity. Mitchell cites this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State v. Lampkin, </em>6th Dist. No. L-09-1270, 2010-Ohio-1971, 2010 WL 1781496, in which the court denied the state\u2019s motion to dismiss and held that the defendant was entitled to proceed with his appeal after the trial court corrected his sentencing entry to comply with Crim.R. 32(C) and <em>Baker. </em>In that case, this court found that when it heard the defendant\u2019s initial appeal, it was without jurisdiction to do so because there was no final, appealable sentencing entry. The court agreed to hear the defendant\u2019s appeal again, this time from his <em>Baker- </em>and Crim.R. 32(C)-compliant sentencing entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">{\u00b6 10} The state characterizes Mitchell\u2019s appeal as a \u201cre-appeal\u201d and argues that this \u201cre-appeal\u201d is barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. The state also argues that Mitchell consented to this court\u2019s jurisdiction on his original appeal and thus has waived any argument relating to the court\u2019s jurisdiction in hearing that appeal. Essentially, the state maintains that because Mitchell appealed his conviction based upon the noncompliant <em>Baker </em>sentencing entry, he is precluded from rearguing the merits of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Collateral Estoppel and Waiver of Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c \u2018The doctrine of collateral estoppel cannot be invoked when there is no final order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stumpff v. Hams, </em>2d Dist. No. 23354, 2010-Ohio-1241, 2010 WL 1138972, \u00b6 31, quoting <em>Glidden Co. v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. </em>Co., 112 Ohio St.3d 470, 2006-Ohio-6553, 861 N.E.2d 109, \u00b646.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Lampkin, </em>this court rejected a similar argument raised by the state:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cAppellee alternatively argues * * * that Lampkin\u2019s appeal should be dismissed because he stipulated to this court\u2019s jurisdiction when he prosecuted his original appeal. In <em>Palmer, </em>the court stated: \u2018Stipulation to the truth of facts necessary to insure jurisdiction, however, may suffice to confer jurisdiction through estoppel.\u2019 <em>[In re Palmer </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 194, 196, 12 OBR 259, 465 N.E.2d 1312.] There is no such stipulation in this case; Lampkin did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>stipulate to the \u2018fact\u2019 of a final appealable order of conviction by filing a notice of appeal. Further, the <em>Palmer </em>case did not involve the issue of stipulating to a final appealable order and is not applicable.\u201d <em>Lampkin, </em>2010-Ohio-1971, 2010 WL 1781496, at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">{\u00b6 14} In addition to our holding in <em>Lampkin, </em>the court also recognizes the general rule that parties cannot stipulate to a particular court\u2019s jurisdiction when it does not otherwise exist. <em>Durgans v. Durgans </em>(Feb. 9, 2001), 11th Dist. No. 2000-P-0026, 2001 WL 114983. See also <em>Beatrice Foods Co. v. Porterfield </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 50, 59 O.O.2d 76, 282 N.E.2d 355, paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201c[AJdverse parties may not confer jurisdiction upon a court by mutual consent, where none would otherwise exist * * * \u201d); and <em>Toledo v. Toledo Edison Co. </em>(C.P.2000), 118 Ohio Misc.2d 131, 142, 770 N.E.2d 132, citing <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Suster </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 70, 701 N.E.2d 1002 (subject-matter jurisdiction may not be altered by the agreement of the parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">{\u00b6 15} As in <em>Lampkin, </em>we reject the state\u2019s argument that Mitchell waived and consented to this court\u2019s jurisdiction by appealing his noncompliant <em>Baker </em>sentencing entry. We also find that collateral estoppel is inapplicable because there was never a final judgment for purposes of Crim.R. 32(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 16} The court also rejects the state\u2019s claims that Mitchell\u2019s appeal is barred by res judicata. \u201cThe doctrine of res judicata is defined as \u2018[a] valid, final judgment rendered upon the merits [that] bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.\u2019 <em>Grava v. Parkman Twp., 73 </em>Ohio St.3d 379, 653 N.E.2d 226, syllabus, * * *. The doctrine is a substantive rule of law that applies to <em>a final judgment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Indiana Ins. Co. v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Columbus, Inc., </em>5th Dist. No. 2004 AP 07 0055, 2005-Ohio-1774, 2005 WL 858168, \u00b6 38. See also <em>DiRando v. Toledo </em>(June 30, 1995), 6th Dist. No. L-94-312, 1995 WL 386475, *4, fn. 2 (\u201c[The judgment] was not a final, appealable order and, therefore, the doctrine of res judicata was inapplicable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">{\u00b6 17} In this case, there was no final order for purposes of Crim.R. 32, and therefore res judicata is inapplicable due to the \u201clack of a final order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u201cVoid\u201d vs. \u201cVoidable\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">{\u00b6 18} The state also argues that this court had jurisdiction to hear Mitchell\u2019s prior appeal because Mitchell\u2019s sentencing entry was \u201cvoidable,\u201d not \u201cvoid.\u201d The state argues that there is nothing to suggest that a noncompliant Crim.R. 32(C) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Baker </em>sentencing entry is \u201cvoid.\u201d We disagree with the state and find that a noncompliant <em>Baker </em>sentencing entry is \u201cvoid,\u201d not \u201cvoidable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 19} The specific issue of whether a judgment is \u201cvoid\u201d or \u201cvoidable\u201d was recently addressed in detail by the majority in <em>State v. Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568:</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cOur analysis begins by making a key distinction that has been obscured in our law: the difference between sentences that are void and those that are voidable. We recognize that we have not always used these terms as properly and precisely as possible. See, e.g., <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b6 34 (Lanzinger, J., concurring) (suggesting that the court had not properly used the term \u2018void\u2019 and instead should have used the term \u2018voidable\u2019 in referring to the sentences at issue in <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, \u00b6 103); <em>Kelley v. Wilson, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 201, 2004-Ohio-4883, 814 N.E.2d 1222, \u00b6 14 (\u2018despite our language in <em>[State v. Green </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 100, 689 N.E.2d 556] that the specified errors rendered the sentence \u2018void,\u2019 the judgment was voidable and properly challenged on direct appeal\u2019); <em>State v. Parker, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 524, 2002-Ohio-2833, 769 N.E.2d 846, \u00b6 20-26 (Cook, J., dissenting) (arguing that the majority opinion confused void and voidable judgments).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIn general, a void judgment is one that has been imposed by a court that lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the case or the authority to act. <em>State v. Payne, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 502, 2007-Ohio-4642, 873 N.E.2d 306, \u00b627. Unlike a void judgment, a voidable judgment is one rendered by a court that has both jurisdiction and authority to act, but the court\u2019s judgment is invalid, irregular, or erroneous. Id.\u201d <em>State v. Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, \u00b6 11-12, superseded by statute as stated in <em>State v. Singleton, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 173, 2009-Ohio-6434, 920 N.E.2d 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">{\u00b6 22} The <em>Simpkins </em>court concluded that the failure to provide the defendant with notice of mandated postrelease control rendered the sentences and judgments of conviction \u201cvoid,\u201d not \u201cvoidable.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">{\u00b6 23} Applying <em>Simpkins </em>to the instant case, we find no discernible difference between the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with its mandatory duty to provide a judgment of conviction that complies with Crim.R. 32, and the failure to provide the requisite notice of postrelease control specifically addressed in <em>Simpkins. </em>The trial court\u2019s failure in February 2007 to issue a judgment of conviction that complied with Crim.R. 32(C) rendered Mitchell\u2019s conviction void. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Indeed, in her dissent in <em>Simpkins, </em>Justice Lanzinger foresaw the very issue before this court:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cIf, as the majority states, the sentencing judgment is \u2018a mere nullity and the parties are in the same position as if there had been no judgment,\u2019 \u00b6 19, we face troublesome consequences. <em>A sentence that is null and void impairs the underlying conviction as a final appealable order, see Crim.R. 32(C), and therefore a defendant may be able to appeal the underlying conviction when the judge eventually imposes a nonvoid sentence and time begins to run for appeal.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, \u00b6 48 (Lanzinger J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">{\u00b6 25} In conclusion, the parties have each raised compelling arguments. The state\u2019s motion to dismiss is premised on the practical implications of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in <em>Baker, Culgan, </em>and <em>Simpkins: </em>\u201c[A]s this court is no doubt well aware [defective sentencing entries] have been numerous because the Supreme Court decisions condemning them have been of recent origin and the bar and lower courts have been slow to realize their implications. As a result, a host of appeals have been filed, briefed, argued and decided without anyone being aware that the appeal may have been predicated upon an order that was, or would ultimately be determined to be defective and thus non-appealable. A careful consideration of defendant\u2019s claim that he is entitled to re-litigate issues already decided by this court several years ago, is thus important, because, given the sheer volume of defective sentencing entries that escaped notice in the past, we can all anticipate being deluged by defendants who are disgruntled with the results of their merit appeal and who can be expected to vigorously pursue any chance they might be given to start the appeals process over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 26} Mitchell, while perhaps also cognizant of the practical implications raised in the state\u2019s arguments, responds in kind:</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe obvious problem with all of this (the state\u2019s arguments), however, is that, whereas it all seems plausible and in compliance with Due Process principles, we cannot make up procedural rule changes to deal with these Crim.R. 32(C) (and PRC error cases) on the fly without any rule changes or other structural fix to allow the same. * * * [W]e cannot just make this up as we go * <em>* *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cHopefully the Ohio Supreme Court will intervene to actually set forth procedural rules that make sense and that fix this monstrosity of a problem. However, this \u2018fix\u2019 of simply dismissing appeals because they seem too onerous or too messy is not acceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">{\u00b6 29} The court concurs with Mitchell. While the practical implications indeed may be \u201conerous\u201d and \u201cmessy,\u201d this court is bound by the rulings of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Ohio Supreme Court, and we believe that today\u2019s result is consistent with, and mandated by, the court\u2019s decisions in <em>Baker, Culgan, </em>and <em>Simpkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 30} The Ohio Supreme Court may also reexamine these issues in the near future. The court is mindful that on March 30, 2010, the Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments on appeal of the case of <em>State v. Fischer, </em>9th Dist. No. 24406, 181 Ohio App.3d 758, 2009-Ohio-1491, 910 N.E.2d 1083. The proposition of law before the court in <em>Fischer </em>is \u201c[a] direct appeal from a void sentence is a legal nullity; therefore, a criminal defendant\u2019s appeal following a * * * resentencing is the first direct appeal as of right from a valid sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">{\u00b6 31} We suspect we are not the first, nor the last, court to engage these issues. Perhaps in <em>Fischer, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court will provide the courts of appeal and trial courts with additional clarification and specific guidance on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 32} Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss is found not well taken and is denied. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-9\">Osowik, P.J., and Singer and Cosme, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\">. Similarly, res judicata does not apply to a \"void\u201d judgment. <em>Simpkins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 420, 2008-Ohio-1197, 884 N.E.2d 568, \u00b6 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
