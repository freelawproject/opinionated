Robinson contends that these convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Robinson\u2019s conviction for having weapons under a disability, but we reverse his conviction for carrying concealed weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">Background Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">{\u00b6 2} In 2006, Robinson was employed as a private security guard for DECO Security Services, providing security for a federal government building in Cincinnati. Robinson was licensed by the Ohio Department of Public Safety, Division of Homeland Security, to carry an unconcealed firearm as a security guard. To obtain the license, Robinson had to meet certain requirements, including passing a BCI and FBI background check. DECO had issued Robinson a firearm, namely a 9 mm semiautomatic Glock pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">{\u00b6 3} Robinson agreed to meet Logan Mathews after work on January 28, 2006. According to the state, Robinson had intended to sell marijuana to Mathews. According to Robinson, he had intended to sell Mathews a television that was located on the back seat of his Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">{\u00b6 4} The meeting between Robinson and Mathews occurred in Robinson\u2019s Cadillac. Shortly thereafter, Mathews shot Robinson three times with a revolver. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Robinson grabbed a .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol and shot Mathews in the chest, killing him. Robinson then called his mother on his cellular phone while driving to her house nearby. Robinson\u2019s phone call to his mother occurred less than four minutes after Mathews\u2019s last cellular phone call to Robinson before the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 5} When Robinson arrived at his mother\u2019s house, she transported him to the hospital in her vehicle. Robinson\u2019s brother called 9-1-1 from his mother\u2019s house. The police responded to the house and found Mathews dead in the front passenger seat of the Cadillac. Underneath Mathews\u2019s slumped body, they recovered a $20 bill and a plastic bag containing a small amount of marijuana, both covered with blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 6} The police recovered several weapons in the Cadillac. On the floor of the driver\u2019s seat, they recovered the revolver Mathews had used to shoot Robinson, the pistol that Robinson had used to shoot Mathews, and a knife. They found an additional revolver in Mathews\u2019s zippered coat pocket. In the trunk, they located the pistol issued to Robinson by his employer. A detective\u2019s photograph of the Cadillac showed that the trunk access on the rear-seat center armrest was open.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 7} In the case numbered B-0601814, Robinson was indicted on one count of murder<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and one count of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Later, in the case numbered B-0704756, Robinson was indicted on one count of tampering with evidence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> one count of having weapons while under a disability,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and one count of carrying concealed weapons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 8} Robinson unsuccessfully moved to dismiss several of the charges. At a trial to the bench, Robinson claimed self-defense and admitted that he did not have an R.C. 2923.125 license to carry a concealed weapon. The trial court acquitted Robinson of murder and tampering with evidence but found him guilty of the three other offenses. After determining that the offense of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle and the offense of carrying concealed weapons were allied offenses of similar import, the court merged those offenses for sentencing. The court sentenced Robinson to 12 months\u2019 incarceration for the offense of carrying concealed weapons and to one year of incarceration for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>offense of having weapons under a disability, with the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Carrying Concealed Weapons</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 9} We first address Robinson\u2019s conviction for carrying concealed weapons. Robinson was indicted and convicted under R.C. 2923.12(A)(3), which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly carry or have, concealed on the person\u2019s person or concealed ready at hand, * * * dangerous ordnance.\u201d The indictment also contained a penalty-enhancement specification indicating that \u201cthe weapon involved [was] a firearm that [was] either loaded or with ammunition ready at hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 10} In challenging this conviction, Robinson argues that the state failed to establish the \u201cready at hand\u201d element. To support this argument, Robinson relies on his own testimony at trial that both of his loaded pistols had been in the locked trunk of his Cadillac before the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 11} We find Robinson\u2019s argument meritless. \u201c \u2018Ready at hand\u2019 means so near as to be conveniently accessible and within immediate physical reach.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state presented evidence that one of Robinson\u2019s loaded firearms was kept under the driver\u2019s seat and was thus ready at hand. Specifically, Cincinnati Police Officer Bill Hilbert testified that Robinson had stated in an interview at the hospital that he had pulled the weapon he had used to defend himself from under the driver\u2019s seat. At trial, Robinson denied making this statement to Hilbert and challenged his competency at the time of the statement. But the evidence is in the record. When we view this statement along with the other evidence in the light most favorable to the state, we hold that the state sufficiently established the \u201cready at hand\u201d element of the offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 12} Further, even if we lend no weight to Hilbert\u2019s testimony and accept as true Robinson\u2019s testimony that both of his pistols were in the trunk, Robinson\u2019s argument is still unavailing. Robinson admitted that neither loaded pistol was in a locked box and that he was able to obtain access to at least one pistol easily and quickly through the rear-seat trunk access. Thus, at least this pistol \u201cwas so near as to be conveniently accessible and within immediate physical reach\u201d and, therefore, \u201cready at hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">{\u00b6 13} Although we hold that the state established the \u201cready at hand\u201d element of the offense, we reverse Robinson\u2019s conviction for carrying concealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>weapons because the state indicted Robinson under the wrong subsection of the statute. Instead of charging him under the (A)(2) subsection of R.C. 2923.12, which applies to handguns other than dangerous ordnance, the state charged him with violating subsection (A)(3), which applies to dangerous ordnance.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cDangerous ordnance\u201d is defined in R.C. 2923.11(K) and includes a weapon such as a sawed-off firearm, a zipgun, an explosive or incendiary device, a weapon designed and manufactured for military purposes, a ballistic knife, and an automatic firearm. \u201cAutomatic firearm\u201d includes a firearm designed or specially adapted to fire a succession of cartridges with a single function of the trigger, as well as some \u201csemi-automatic firearm[s] designed or specially adapted to fire more than thirty-one cartridges without reloading.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 15} In this case, the firearms examiner in a stipulated report identified the weapon that Robinson had used to defend himself as a \u201csemiautomatic pistol, 10 + 1 shot, 40 S <em>&amp; </em>W chambered, Glock model 22,\u201d and the other weapon as a \u201csemiautomatic, 10 + 1 shot, 9mm Lugar chambered, Glock model 17.\u201d Because the evidence was not sufficient to establish the \u201cdangerous ordnance\u201d element of the offense, we must reverse Robinson\u2019s conviction for carrying concealed weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Having Weapons Under a Disability</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 16} Robinson also assigns as error the trial court\u2019s entry of a conviction for the offense of having weapons under a disability. Robinson was charged with violating R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), which provides, \u201cUnless relieved from disability * * * no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if * * * the person is under indictment for or has been convicted of any offense involving the illegal possession * * * [of] any drug of abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 17} To establish the disability element of the offense in this case, the state presented Robinson\u2019s prior convictions for possession of marijuana in violation of R.C. 2925.11. These convictions involved minor-misdemeanor offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">{\u00b6 18} Robinson contends that these prior convictions were not a disability because R.C. 2925.11(D) provides that an arrest or conviction for a minor-misdemeanor violation of the drug-possession statute does not constitute a \u201ccriminal record.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, he contends that assigning a disability by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>of his prior convictions for minor-misdemeanor offenses created an absurd result because the state had actually licensed him to carry a firearm as a security guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 19} After careful consideration, we reject Robinson\u2019s argument. In interpreting or construing a statute, our primary concern is the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To discern this intent, we must \u201cread words and phrases in context according to the rules of grammar and common usage,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> mindful that criminal statutes must be strictly construed against the state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) \u201cbroadly\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> provides that a disability arises when one is indicted for or convicted of \u201cany offense involving the illegal possession, [or] use * * * [of] any drug of abuse.\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court has held that the drug-abuse offenses referred to in R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) are defined in R.C. 2925.01(G)(1) through (4), formerly R.C. 2925.01(H)(1) through (4).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Subsection (G)(1) of R.C. 2925.01 expressly includes a violation of R.C. 2925.11, the possession statute. \u201cOffense,\u201d as used in Ohio\u2019s criminal code, includes conduct classified as a minor misdemeanor,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and \u201cany\u201d is a common, inclusive term. Thus, under the clear, unambiguous language of the disability statute, a conviction for a minor-misdemeanor violation of R.C. 2925.11 creates a disability precluding the possession of a firearm. This court interpreted the statute accordingly in <em>State v. Mackin,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but in <em>Mackin </em>we did not consider the argument that Robinson presents based on R.C. 2925.11(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 21} Robinson essentially argues that our interpretation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3) is inconsistent with the language of R.C. 2925.11(D). But we do not find the statutes inconsistent when read together. The criminal-record exception of R.C. 2923.11(D) has a specified application that includes employment opportunities and that, by its terms, is distinct from the weapons proscription found in the disability statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>{\u00b6 22} In addition, the legislature has excepted a conviction for a minor-misdemeanor offense, in some circumstances, from the definition of a \u201cprevious or subsequent conviction\u201d for the limited purpose of determining first-offender status under the expungement statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the legislature had intended to except convictions for minor-misdemeanor offenses from the disability statute, it could have easily done so. Rather, the legislature intended the disability statute to provide a broad \u201c \u2018prohibition against weapons in the hands of bad risks.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Instead of excepting minor-misdemeanor drug offenses, the legislature provided a mechanism for the removal of the disability in R.C. 2923.14, if warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 23} We hold that a conviction for a minor-misdemeanor violation of R.C. 2925.11 creates a disability prohibiting the possession of a firearm or dangerous ordnance, even though the conviction may not constitute a \u201ccriminal record\u201d for background checks involved in licensing. Thus, we reject Robinson\u2019s interpretation of the disability statute and his challenge to his conviction based upon his erroneous interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 24} As to Robinson\u2019s challenge to his conviction on the ground that he did not know that his prior convictions created a disability, Robinson\u2019s convictions, which he was fully aware of, put him on notice that certain disabilities attached as a matter of law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u201cEveryone is presumed to know the law; ignorance of its dictates is not a ground for relief from its application.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And in light of the mandatory language of the disability statute, it is no defense that Robinson had a license to carry a firearm as a security guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 25} Ultimately, we conclude that Robinson\u2019s conviction for having weapons under a disability was supported by the evidence and was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Improper Handling of Firearms in a Motor Vehicle</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">{\u00b6 26} Finally, Robinson argues that the trial court erred by convicting him of the offense of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle, as charged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>count two of the indictment in the case numbered B-0601814. He claims to appeal this \u201cconviction\u201d in the appeal numbered C-081084.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"> {\u00b6 27} A conviction does not exist without a sentence.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although the trial court found Robinson guilty of this offense, the court did not sentence Robinson for this offense. Thus, Robinson has not been convicted of the offense, and we do not have a conviction to review. Because there is no assignment of error for us to review in the appeal numbered C-081084, we dismiss that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, in the appeal numbered C-081141, we sustain the first assignment of error in part, reverse Robinson\u2019s conviction for carrying concealed weapons, and discharge him from further prosecution for the offense under the indictment numbered B-0704756. We overrule Robinson\u2019s assignments of error challenging his conviction for having weapons under a disability, and we affirm that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-8\">Hendon, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\">.
