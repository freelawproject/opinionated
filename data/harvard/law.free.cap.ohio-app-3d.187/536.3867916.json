Dahlhausen, D.V.M., appeals the decision of the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas dismissing his complaint against defendant-appellee and cross-appellant Stephen W. Aldred, M.D., for lack of personal jurisdiction, and dismissing his complaint against defendant-appellee and cross-appellant Research Avian Laboratory, Inc. (\u201cAvian\u201d), and all but one of his claims against defendant-appellee and cross-appellant, Ernest Colaizzi, under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 2} Dahlhausen, a Clermont County, Ohio resident, originally filed a complaint in the trial court against Aldred and Colaizzi in October 2007. In July 2008, Dahlhausen filed an amended complaint adding Avian as a defendant. Aldred and Colaizzi are both Texas residents; Avian is a Texas corporation. The complaints alleged several contract and tort claims arising from a transfer of ownership interest in Research Associates Laboratory, Inc. (\u201cRAL\u201d) to Aldred and Colaizzi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">{\u00b6 3} The facts giving rise to Dahlhausen\u2019s complaints against all three defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are as follows: In 1991, Dahlhausen formed an Ohio corporation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>manufacture and distribute avian food products and supplements and to conduct avian diagnostic research and testing. The name of the corporation was later changed to RAL. In 1992, Steven Radabaugh, D.V.M., joined RAL as a partner; Dahlhausen and Radabaugh each owned 50 percent of RAL. Over the next nine years, Dahlhausen and Radabaugh built a successful business and a solid reputation in the field of animal research and diagnostic testing. In 2001, Radabaugh sought to leave RAL; Dahlhausen began investigating selling Radabaugh\u2019s ownership interest in RAL to another partner or partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 4} The parties, casual acquaintances sharing an interest in avian research, agree that they began discussing the possible involvement of Aldred and Colaizzi in RAL in 2001. The parties disagree, however, as to who made the initial overtures. Dahlhausen claims that during one of their regular phone conversations (discussing aviculture and avian matters), Colaizzi approached him to inquire as to whether he and Aldred might purchase Radabaugh\u2019s 50 percent interest in RAL. By contrast, Aldred and Colaizzi claim that Dahlhausen first contacted Colaizzi by telephone in Texas, informing him of Radabaugh\u2019s desire to leave RAL and gauging his interest in buying Radabaugh\u2019s ownership interest. Interested but undercapitalized, Colaizzi recruited Aldred to join in the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 5} Negotiations ensued. Here as well, the parties present differing versions. Dahlhausen claims that over the next several months, Colaizzi, on his behalf and Aldred\u2019s behalf, contacted Dahlhausen in Ohio almost daily by telephone and e-mails; the majority of these contacts dealt with the purchase of Radabaugh\u2019s interest in RAL. In August 2001, while negotiations were ongoing, Aldred visited RAL and its laboratory and viewed a PowerPoint presentation. Dahlhausen claims that he prepared the PowerPoint presentation at Colaizzi\u2019s request to promote RAL and its lab and to pique Aldred\u2019s interest in RAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 6} By contrast, Aldred claims that he merely accepted Dahlhausen\u2019s open invitation to visit RAL while transporting his son to college at Denison University. The visit was simply to satisfy his personal curiosity about the lab\u2019s operations, included Radabaugh in attendance, and dealt solely with matters related to the lab facilities and pathology. No discussions regarding the lab\u2019s finances or any other aspects of a sale or purchase took place during the visit. In fact, Aldred claims that prior to September 2001, he had never talked to Dahlhausen about Radabaugh\u2019s interest in RAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 7} The record indicates that Radabaugh was never told that Aldred and Colaizzi were interested in buying his ownership interest in RAL. Dahlhausen claims that Aldred and Colaizzi did not want Radabaugh to know about their desire to buy his interest. Aldred and Colaizzi claim that Dahlhausen had specifically told them not to contact Radabaugh about purchasing his interest. As a result, Aldred and Colaizzi remained in the background while Dahlhausen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>conducted all negotiations with Radabaugh. Simultaneously, Dahlhausen conducted negotiations with Aldred and Colaizzi regarding the terms of the purchase of Radabaugh\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">{\u00b6 8} In September 2001, Dahlhausen flew to Dallas, where he met Colaizzi, Aldred, and Aldred\u2019s wife for dinner. Dahlhausen claims that he went to Dallas at Colaizzi\u2019s request to explain to Aldred and his wife the nature of the business. During the meeting, the parties discussed the potential purchase of Radabaugh\u2019s interest by Aldred and Colaizzi and relocating the RAL lab to Texas. According to Aldred and Colaizzi, the meeting involved a general discussion about Dahlhausen\u2019s negotiations with Radabaugh and the fact that Aldred and Colaizzi would pay whatever price Radabaugh would receive for his ownership interest in RAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 9} The parties did not reach an agreement during the Dallas meeting. Negotiations continued, with daily communications between Dahlhausen and Colaizzi. According to Dahlhausen, the three men eventually reached the following oral agreement in October 2001: the parties agreed to value RAL at $250,000; Radabaugh would be paid $125,000 for his 50 percent interest in RAL; Dahlhausen would receive $41,667 to buy down his interest in RAL from 50 percent to 33% percent; as a result, Dahlhausen, Colaizzi, and Aldred would each own one third; the lab would be relocated to Dallas; and Dahlhausen would continue receiving his $52,000 annual salary in exchange for interpreting test results in Clermont County, Ohio. Dahlhausen claimed that the oral agreement was reached between the three men in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 10} Aldred and Colaizzi claim that Dahlhausen entered into an agreement with Radabaugh to purchase his 50 percent interest in RAL and then transferred all RAL assets to a new Texas corporation, Avian, in exchange for a one-third ownership interest in Avian. Avian was formed in Texas on December 5, 2001. Dahlhausen was made a director, officer, and shareholder of Avian. A checking account was opened in Avian\u2019s name in Texas and was originally funded by Aldred\u2019s wife with $175,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 11} In December 2001, Dahlhausen entered into a stock purchase agreement with Radabaugh to purchase Radabaugh\u2019s ownership interest in RAL and a related veterinary practice for $125,000. Between December 2001 and February 2002, Radabaugh received three checks totaling $125,000 signed by Dahlhausen and issued from Avian\u2019s Texas bank account. Dahlhausen claims that the checks were sent to him by Aldred and Colaizzi, who instructed him as to the amount and when to pay them. He also claims that the stock-purchase agreement was not reflective of his oral agreement with Aldred and Colaizzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 12} According to Aldred and Colaizzi, Avian began operating from its Texas base in March 2002. RAL was dissolved in December 2002. Dissolution documents list Dahlhausen as the sole owner of RAL. In 2002 and part of 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Dahlhausen received hundreds of test results from Avian, which he interpreted in Clermont County, Ohio before sending them back to Texas. He resigned in early May 2003. He never received the $41,667 and received only $7,000 for his services in 2002-2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 13} In July 2008, Dahlhausen filed an amended complaint against the three defendants alleging several contract and tort claims. Specifically, Dahlhausen alleged claims of (1) breach of oral contract, (2) rescission and restitution, (3) unjust enrichment, (4) quantum meruit, (5) fraud and misrepresentation, and (6) conversion against Aldred and Colaizzi (Counts I through VI), and sought compensatory and punitive damages, costs, and attorney fees from all three defendants. Dahlhausen also alleged claims of (1) defamation, (2) libel, and (3) slander against Colaizzi only (collectively, the defamation claim) and sought damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 14} Following the filing of the original complaint, Aldred and Colaizzi moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. Following an evidentiary hearing on the motion, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss in September 2008. The trial court (1) held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi as to the contract and tort claims (Counts I through VI), (2) held that it had personal jurisdiction over Colaizzi as to the defamation claim, (3) relying on the doctrine of forum non conveniens, found that allowing Dahlhausen to pursue only one claim against one defendant in Ohio \u201cwould undermine the concept of judicial efficiency,\u201d and (4) granted the motion to dismiss in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 15} On October 31, 2008, the trial court issued a second decision taking into account the addition of Avian as a defendant. Consistent with its previous decision, the trial court found that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi as to Counts I through VI, but had personal jurisdiction over Colaizzi as to the defamation claim. The trial court also found that it had personal jurisdiction over Avian as to Counts I through VI. The trial court noted that having jurisdiction over Colaizzi as to the defamation claim allowed it to exercise jurisdiction over Colaizzi, but not Aldred, as to Dahlhausen\u2019s other claims. As a result, because some of Dahlhausen\u2019s claims were properly seated in Ohio but others would have to be tried in Texas, the trial court ordered the parties to brief the issue of the application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 16} On April 7, 2009, the trial court dismissed Counts I through VI against Colaizzi and Avian pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens, dismissed Counts I through VI against Aldred for lack of personal jurisdiction, and allowed Dahlhausen to pursue his defamation claim against Colaizzi in Ohio. The dismissal of the counts against Avian and Colaizzi was conditioned upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>successful refiling of the claims in Texas to ensure the availability of an alternative forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 17} Dahlhausen appeals, raising two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 18} Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThe trial court erred in determining that the defendants were not subject to personal jurisdiction under Ohio\u2019s long-arm statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 20} Dahlhausen argues that the trial court erred in finding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi with regard to Counts I through VI. Dahlhausen asserts that the trial court has personal jurisdiction over the two Texas residents under R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) with regard to the contract claims (Counts I through IV) as a result of the parties\u2019 substantial negotiations over ten months, Colaizzi\u2019s numerous phone calls to Ohio, and the Texas residents\u2019 purchase of a two-third interest in RAL under the parties\u2019 oral agreement. Dahlhausen also asserts that the trial court has personal jurisdiction over the two Texas residents under R.C. 2307.382(A)(3), (4), and (6) with regard to the tort claims, including the defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b6 21} We review a trial court\u2019s judgment granting a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo. <em>Buflod v. Von Wilhendorf, L.L.C., </em>Warren App. No. CA2006-02-022, 2007-Ohio-347, 2007 WL 210790, \u00b6 10. Where a nonresident defendant asserts that the trial court lacks personal jurisdiction over his person, the plaintiff has the burden to establish the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Giachetti v. Holmes </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 306, 307, 14 OBR 371, 471 N.E.2d 165. Where the trial court conducts an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. Id.; <em>Friedman v. Speiser, Krause &amp; Madole, P.C. </em>(1988), 56 Ohio App.3d 11, 14, 565 N.E.2d 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 22} When determining whether a state court has personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, a trial court must first determine whether the defendant\u2019s conduct falls within Ohio\u2019s long-arm statute under R.C. 2307.382. If it does, the trial court must then determine whether granting jurisdiction would deprive the defendant of the right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall Co. v. Mitchell\u2019s Formal Wear, Inc. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 73, 75, 559 N.E.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">{\u00b6 23} Dahlhausen first asserts that the trial court has personal jurisdiction over the contract claims under R.C. 2307.382(A)(1), which states: \u201cA court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s [transacting any business in this state.\u201d R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) is very broadly worded and permits jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>a nonresident defendant who is transacting any business in Ohio. <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 75, 559 N.E.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 24} To \u201ctransact\u201d means \u201cto prosecute negotiations; to carry on business; to have dealings.\u201d Id. The mere solicitation of business by a foreign corporation does not constitute transacting business in Ohio. <em>U.S. Sprint Communications Co., Ltd. Partnership v. Mr. K\u2019s Foods, Inc. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 181, 185, 624 N.E.2d 1048. Rather, \u201ca nonresident\u2019s ties must create a \u2018substantial connection\u2019 with the forum state.\u201d Id. Whether a nonresident defendant has transacted any business in Ohio is a case-by-case determination. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 25} At the outset, we note that Dahlhausen argues that Aldred and Colaizzi transacted business in Ohio by citing cases such as <em>Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 462, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528, and by framing the issue in terms of whether the Texas residents \u201cpurposely availed themselves of the privilege of doing business\u201d in Ohio, whether their acts \u201chave a sufficiently substantial connection\u201d with Ohio, and similar phrases. However, those cases and phrases fall under the second prong of the test in <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall </em>\u2014 that is, whether granting jurisdiction would deprive the defendant of the right to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and not whether nonresident defendants have transacted business in Ohio pursuant to R.C. 2307.382(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 26} It is undisputed that in 2001 the parties began discussing the possibility of Aldred and Colaizzi\u2019s buying Radabaugh\u2019s ownership interest in RAL. Negotiations ensued and involved numerous exchanges of phone calls and e-mails between Dahlhausen and Colaizzi, Aldred\u2019s trip to the RAL lab in Ohio, and Dahlhausen\u2019s trip to Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 27} The parties presented differing versions as to who initiated the negotiations. Dahlhausen and Colaizzi also both testified that a number of telephone or e-mail exchanges between them involved avian matters, and not the purchase of Radabaugh\u2019s ownership interest in RAL. Assuming Colaizzi initiated the negotiations and subsequently contacted Dahlhausen in Ohio on a daily basis regarding the negotiations, we find it well established that the mere solicitation of business by a nonresident defendant does not constitute transacting business in Ohio. See <em>U.S. Sprint Communications, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 185, 624 N.E.2d 1048. Nor does the mere fact that parties engage in various communications incident to their transaction. See <em>Buflod, </em>2007-Ohio-347, 2007 WL 210790 at \u00b6 14. In addition, given the conflicting evidence and without more, Dahlhausen has failed to prove the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Friedman, </em>56 Ohio App.3d at 14, 565 N.E.2d 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Prior to negotiating with Dahlhausen, neither Aldred nor Colaizzi had ever conducted business in Ohio, owned property in Ohio, or advertised or solicited business in Ohio. Neither Texas resident had, or has, a registered agent to receive service in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 29} During the negotiations, Aldred visited the RAL lab in Ohio. Again, the parties presented differing versions as to the purpose of Aldred\u2019s visit. Dahlhausen claims that the visit, which included a PowerPoint presentation at the request of Colaizzi to promote RAL and pique Aldred\u2019s interest in RAL, was in furtherance of the ongoing negotiations. By contrast, Aldred claims that the visit, which was attended by Radabaugh, was merely in response to Dahlhausen\u2019s open invitation to visit the RAL lab and was not in furtherance of any pending transaction between the parties. Again, given this conflicting evidence and without more, Dahlhausen has failed to prove the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Friedman, </em>56 Ohio App.3d at 14, 565 N.E.2d 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 30} In September 2001, Dahlhausen flew to Texas, where he met Colaizzi, Aldred, and Aldred\u2019s wife. During the meeting, discussions regarding the purchase of Radabaugh\u2019s interest in RAL by Colaizzi and Aldred took place. In December 2001, Dahlhausen alone entered into a stock-purchase agreement with Radabaugh to purchase Radabaugh\u2019s 50 percent interest in RAL. That same month, Avian was formed in Texas; Dahlhausen was made a director, officer, and shareholder of the Texas corporation. It is undisputed that Dahlhausen alone conducted all negotiations with Radabaugh regarding the purchase of the latter\u2019s interest in RAL; Aldred and Colaizzi remained in the background.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 31} Radabaugh was subsequently paid $125,000 for his ownership interest in RAL, with three checks signed by Dahlhausen and issued from Avian\u2019s Texas bank account. Avian started operating in March 2002. RAL was dissolved in December 2002. Dissolution documents filed with the state of Ohio named Dahlhausen as the sole owner of RAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">{\u00b6 32} Given all of the foregoing, we cannot say that Aldred and Colaizzi transacted business in Ohio pursuant to R.C. 2307.382(A)(1). The parties\u2019 interstate negotiations during 2001 and the individual involvement, if any, of Aldred and Colaizzi in RAL that same year were secondary and contingent upon Dahlhausen\u2019s own negotiations with Radabaugh. Once Dahlhausen became the sole owner of RAL, Aldred and Colaizzi never became individually involved in RAL. Rather, all subsequent aspects of the disputed transaction between the parties took place between Dahlhausen, RAL, and Avian in that all of RAL\u2019s assets were ultimately transferred to Avian. We agree with the trial court that \u201cthe actions of Aldred and Colaizzi lack the requisite strength of connection to Ohio so as to reasonably permit an exercise of jurisdiction over them. At most, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the negotiations between the parties appear to have led to the formation of a corporation under the laws of Texas which then \u2018transacted business\u2019 with an Ohio corporation and an Ohio resident within the purview of R.C. 2307.382(A)(1).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 33} In light of the foregoing, we find that Dahlhausen has failed to establish the trial court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi under R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) with regard to the contract claims. Because Dahlhausen failed to establish the court\u2019s jurisdiction under Ohio\u2019s long-arm statute, we do not address the second prong under <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall </em>(whether granting jurisdiction to an Ohio court comports with due process). See <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 75, 559 N.E.2d 477. The trial court did not err in finding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi with regard to Counts I through IV and in subsequently dismissing those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 34} Dahlhausen next asserts that the trial court has personal jurisdiction over the tort claims under R.C. 2307.382(A)(3), (4), and (6). Dahlhausen includes the defamation claim as a tort claim under this assignment of error. The statutory provisions allow a court to exercise its jurisdiction over claims arising from a defendant\u2019s \u201c[cjausing tortious injury by an act or omission in [Ohio],\u201d R.C. 2307.382(A)(3); \u201c[c]ausing tortious injury in [Ohio] by an act or omission outside [Ohio] if he regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenues from goods used or consumed or services rendered in [Ohio],\u201d R.C. 2307.382(A)(4); and \u201c[c]ausing tortious injury in [Ohio] to any person by an act outside [Ohio] committed with the purpose of injuring persons, when he might reasonably have expected that some person would be injured thereby in [Ohio],\u201d R.C. 2307.382(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 35} In his brief, Dahlhausen simply asserts that the fraudulent and unjust acquisition of his business interest by Aldred and Colaizzi without paying for it and Colaizzi\u2019s acts of libel, slander, and defamation have caused injury and damage to him in Ohio. As a result, the trial court has jurisdiction over the tort claims under R.C. 2307.382(A)(3), (4), and (6). It is undisputed, and Colaizzi so conceded below, that the trial court has personal jurisdiction over the defamation claim under R.C. 2307.382(A)(6); that finding by the trial court is not before us on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">(\u00b6 36} The trial court found that because the substantive dealings occurred between Dahlhausen and Avian (in that Dahlhausen consolidated his entire ownership of RAL before all of RAL\u2019s assets were transferred to Avian), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>claimed injuries did not result from any act or omission by Aldred or Colaizzi that took place in Ohio. See R.C. 2307.382(A)(3). Likewise, because the evidence did not show that Aldred or Colaizzi themselves (1) regularly did or solicited business in Ohio, (2) engaged in a persistent course of conduct within Ohio, or (3) derived substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in Ohio (in that after Avian began its Texas operation, Dahlhausen performed testing-related services in Ohio for Avian\u2019s benefit), the trial court found that it lacked jurisdiction over Counts V and VI under R.C. 2307.382(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 37} Upon a thorough review of the record, we find that the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings. Dahlhausen has failed to establish the trial court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi under R.C. 2307.382(A)(3) and (4) with regard to the tort claims (Counts V and VI). Because Dahlhausen failed to establish the court\u2019s jurisdiction under Ohio\u2019s long-arm statute, we do not address the second prong under <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall </em>(whether granting jurisdiction to an Ohio court comports with due process). See <em>Kentucky Oaks Mall, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 75, 559 N.E.2d 477. The trial court, therefore, did not err in finding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi with regard to Counts V and VI and in subsequently dismissing those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 38} Dahlhausen\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 39} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing Dahlhausen\u2019s remaining claims under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 41} Dahlhausen argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his claims against Avian under the doctrine of forum non conveniens. We note that Dahlhausen does not challenge the trial court\u2019s analysis of the doctrine as to his claims against Avian. Rather, he simply asserts that because the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against Avian was based upon the court\u2019s erroneous determination that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi, \u201cits dismissal of claims against Avian on grounds of forum non conveniens * * * was therefore necessarily an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 42} The doctrine of forum non conveniens allows a trial court to decline to exercise jurisdiction over cases when convenience of the parties and the ends of justice would be better served if the action were brought and tried in another forum. See <em>Chambers v. Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 123, 519 N.E.2d 370. Under Dahlhausen\u2019s first assignment of error, we held that the trial court properly determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi as to Counts I through VI. As a result, we need not address the argument that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Dahlhausen\u2019s claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>against Avian under the doctrine of forum non conveniens was an abuse of discretion. The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">{\u00b6 43} Cross-assignment of Error:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to dismiss Count VII as to the defendant-appellee Colaizzi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 45} In its September 2008 decision, the trial court found that it lacked jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi as to Counts I through VI but had personal jurisdiction over Colaizzi as to the defamation claim and granted the motion to dismiss in its entirety pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The trial court reasoned that allowing Dahlhausen to pursue only one claim (out of 13 claims) against one defendant in Ohio \u201cwould undermine the concept of judicial efficiency [which] requires that the entire dispute be resolved in a single forum, without needless duplication of evidence and expense. Furthermore, the convenience of the parties and witnesses would be best served by a single trial in a single location. Under the circumstances, the proper forum for all of [Dahlhausen\u2019s] claims would be Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 46} Following the addition of Avian as a defendant, the trial court issued a decision in October 2008, finding once again that it lacked jurisdiction over Aldred and Colaizzi as to Counts I through VI but had personal jurisdiction over Colaizzi as to the defamation claim. The court also found that it had personal jurisdiction over Avian as to Counts I through VI. On April 7, 2009, the trial court dismissed Counts I through VI against Aldred for lack of personal jurisdiction and dismissed Counts I through VI against Colaizzi and Avian pursuant to the doctrine of forum of non conveniens (thereby dismissing 18 claims), but allowed Dahlhausen to pursue one claim, the defamation claim, against Colaizzi in Ohio. The trial court did not refer to its earlier contradictory decision or \u201creason it away.\u201d In light of the foregoing, the defendants argue that the trial court\u2019s failure to dismiss the defamation claim was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 47} The ultimate inquiry under the doctrine of forum non conveniens is \u201cwhere [a] trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 127, 519 N.E.2d 370. The doctrine furnishes criteria that \u201care to be applied flexibly, with each case turning on its own facts.\u201d Id. at 126, 519 N.E.2d 370. These factors may be divided into the private interests of the litigants and factors of public interest involving the courts and citizens of the forum. Id. at 126, 519 N.E.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 48} Important private interests include \u201cthe relative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to the action; and all other practical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious, and inexpensive. There may also be questions as to the enforceability of a judgment if one is obtained.\u201d Id. at 126-127, 519 N.E.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 49} Public interest factors to be considered include \u201cthe administrative difficulties and delay to other litigants caused by congested court calendars, the imposition of jury duty upon the citizens of a community which has very little relation to the litigation, a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home, and the appropriateness of litigating a case in a forum familiar with the applicable law.\u201d Id. at 127, 519 N.E.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThe forum non conveniens determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court [and] may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. \u201c[W]here the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves substantial deference.\u201d Id.; <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Allstate Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>Butler App. No. CA2009-01017, 2009-Ohio-3540, 2009 WL 2140146, \u00b6 15. Because \u201c[o]ur * * * task is to determine whether the trial court below properly employed the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>considering all the relevant private and public interest factors and the weight given to each[,] [we] will not independently assess and reweigh each factor * * <em>Chambers, </em>35 Ohio St.3d at 132-133, 519 N.E.2d 370; <em>Cincinnati </em>at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 51} According to Dahlhausen, Colaizzi defamed him by showing to Avian employees in Texas and employees of Colaizzi\u2019s Texas pet store papers connecting Dahlhausen\u2019s name to pornographic websites, by posting Dahlhausen\u2019s name on pornographic websites, by making disparaging comments in e-mails sent from the Avian lab to various Internet groups, and by making disparaging remarks during an annual industry trade show in Chicago, Illinois, to one of Dahlhausen\u2019s Ohio customers. Members of the Internet groups represent a large cross-section of the avian industry and include current or potential customers, veterinarians, researchers, past and current officers of national organizations, business owners, and aviculturalists. Dahlhausen asserts that he has a national reputation and has presented papers both nationally and internationally. Dahlhausen claims that the numerous disparaging remarks discredit his credentials and expertise in the avian field and destroy his reputation among his peers and customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 52} The trial court declined to dismiss Dahlhausen\u2019s defamation claim against Colaizzi in Ohio, on the grounds that Texas courts have a limited subpoena power; that because the defamation claim concerns only Colaizzi, there is no risk that an inconsistent ruling may issue from another court and the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>is readily severable from Dahlhausen\u2019s other claims against the three defendants; and that any harm stemming from the defamation claim has befallen an Ohio resident and will have continuing repercussions within Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 53} We find that the trial court\u2019s balancing of the relevant public and private interest factors is not reasonable. The fact that the defamation claim is readily severable and does not involve a risk of inconsistent ruling favors neither jurisdiction. While Dahlhausen is an Ohio resident, most of Colaizzi\u2019s defamatory conduct occurred in Texas and involved Texas employees and/or occurred through e-mails sent from Texas to Internet groups. The state of origin for most of Colaizzi\u2019s defamatory conduct is Texas. That is also where Colaizzi\u2019s employees (who likely would be witnesses in any court proceedings) and the majority of the sources of proof (Internet postings, e-mails) are located. See <em>Lee v. Burnett, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-40, 2007-Ohio-3742, 2007 WL 2110801. Colaizzi\u2019s conduct allegedly discredits Dahlhausen\u2019s reputation not merely in Ohio but nationally as well (and perhaps to some extent internationally).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 54} In addition, the trial court\u2019s decision dismisses 18 claims (out of a total of 19 claims) yet retains jurisdiction over one lone claim. As the trial court originally found when it addressed Dahlhausen\u2019s 13 claims against Aldred and Colaizzi, allowing Dahlhausen to pursue only one claim against one defendant in Ohio \u201cwould undermine the concept of judicial efficiency [which] requires that the entire dispute be resolved in a single forum, without needless duplication of evidence and expense. Furthermore, the convenience of the parties and witnesses would be best served by a single trial in a single location.\u201d The proper forum for all of Dahlhausen\u2019s 19 claims is in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 55} We therefore find that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to dismiss the defamation claim pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The cross-assignment of error is well taken and sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 56} The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b588-10\">Powell and Hendrickson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\">.
