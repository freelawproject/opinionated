Dean, through counsel, appeals from a judgment of the Clark County Court of Common Pleas, which sustained Dean\u2019s pro se motion to terminate his postconviction proceedings. The postconviction proceedings stem from Dean\u2019s conviction and death sentence in 2006 for the murder of Titus Arnold. Counsel for Dean filed a timely notice of appeal with this court on April 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 2} On May 2, 2005, Dean was indicted for six counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated murder, four counts of having weapons while under disability, two counts of aggravated robbery, and two counts of discharging a firearm into a habitation. After a jury trial, Dean was found guilty on all counts in the indictment, and the jury recommended that he be sentenced to death. The trial court accepted the recommendation of the jury and sentenced Dean to death on June 2, 2006. <em>State v. Dean </em>(June 2, 2006), Clark C.P. No. 05CR0348. Dean subsequently filed a notice of appeal with the Ohio Supreme Court on June 12, 2006, and the appeal is currently pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 3} On March 23, 2007, Dean filed a petition for postconviction relief in the trial court. Additionally, Dean filed motions for discovery, recusal of the trial court judge, appropriation of funds for substance-abuse testing, and appropriation of funds for neuropsychological testing. The state filed a response to Dean\u2019s petition on January 28, 2008. On February 28, 2008, the trial court overruled Dean\u2019s motion for recusal. Dean filed a memorandum contra to the state\u2019s response to his petition for postconviction relief on March 7, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 4} On January 21, 2009, Dean sent the trial judge a letter requesting that his postconviction proceedings be terminated. The trial judge construed Dean\u2019s letter to be a pro se motion to terminate his postconviction proceedings, and the letter was filed on January 26, 2009. On February 18, 2009, the state filed a request for a hearing on Dean\u2019s motion to terminate his postconviction proceedings, and the court issued an order scheduling the hearing for February 26, 2009. On February 24, 2009, counsel for Dean filed a motion to continue the hearing pending the outcome of Dean\u2019s direct appeal in the Ohio Supreme Court. The trial court did not rule on Dean\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 5} At the hearing on February 26, 2009, Dean\u2019s counsel argued that the trial court should withhold any decision on Dean\u2019s pro se motion to terminate his postconviction proceedings until the Ohio Supreme Court has issued its decision regarding Dean\u2019s direct appeal of his conviction and sentence. In the alternative, Dean\u2019s counsel requested that the trial court allow Dean to be evaluated in order to establish whether he was competent to waive his postconviction proceedings. In support of the request, Dean\u2019s counsel proffered evidence that called Dean\u2019s mental capacity to waive into question. The state argued that the record was insufficient to establish that Dean was mentally incompetent and thus unable to waive his postconviction proceedings. The state suggested that the court personally address Dean in order to determine whether any waiver would be knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. After a short colloquy with Dean, the court granted his pro se motion to terminate his postconviction proceedings. It is from this judgment that Dean now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 6} Dean\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred when it granted Dean\u2019s pro se motion to terminate post-conviction proceedings without first ordering an evaluation and holding a hearing to determine Dean\u2019s competence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, Dean, through counsel, contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it allowed him to waive his right to postconviction review of his capital case without first ordering that he submit to a competency evaluation. Specifically, Dean\u2019s counsel argues that dismissal of his petition for postconviction review based on a pro se motion was inappropriate because sufficient indicators were present that cast doubts upon Dean\u2019s competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 has been defined as an attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Huffman v. Hair Surgeon, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 83, 87, 19 OBR 123, 482 N.E.2d 1248, 1252. It is to be expected that most instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cA decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision. It is not enough that the reviewing court, were it deciding the issue de novo, would not have found that reasoning process to be persuasive, perhaps in view of countervailing reasoning processes that would support a contrary result.\u201d <em>AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp. </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">{\u00b6 11} Initially, we note that a postconviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment. <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67. \u201cIndeed, post-conviction state collateral review itself is not a constitutional right, even in capital cases.\u201d Id., citing <em>Murray v. Giarratano </em>(1989), 492 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 2765, 106 L.Ed.2d 1. Postconviction review is a narrow remedy, because res judicata bars any claim that was or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal. Id. Accordingly, in a postconviction proceeding, a convicted defendant has only the rights granted him by the legislature. <em>State v. Moore </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 748, 751, 651 N.E.2d 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">{\u00b6 12} However, the issue here is whether the trial court should have ordered Dean to submit to a mental evaluation in order to determine whether he was competent to waive his right to postconviction review of his conviction and sentence. In <em>State v. Berry </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 371, 686 N.E.2d 1097, the defendant desired to submit to execution and therefore to terminate further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>challenges to his conviction and sentence. The Ohio Public Defender, who had been representing Berry, claimed that he was not mentally competent to make such a decision. Id. The state contended that Berry was competent. After repeated representations by Berry to the Ohio Supreme Court and others that he desired to discontinue his litigation, the state filed a motion in the Ohio Supreme Court for a competency hearing. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court ordered an evaluation of Berry\u2019s competence and appointed a psychiatrist to conduct the evaluation. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court set forth the following standard regarding the procedure by which Berry\u2019s competence was to be evaluated:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cA capital defendant is mentally competent to abandon any and all challenges to his death sentence * * * if he has the mental capacity to understand the choice between life and death and to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to pursue further remedies. The defendant must fully comprehend the ramifications of his decision, and must possess the \u2018ability to reason logically,\u2019 i.e., to choose \u2018means which relate logically to his ends.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Berry, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court relied on language in the United States Supreme Court case of <em>Rees v. Peyton </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 312, 86 S.Ct. 1505, 16 L.Ed.2d 583. In <em>Rees, </em>the defendant had filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court in which he sought review of a federal court judgment denying habeas corpus relief. A short time later, the defendant directed his counsel to withdraw the petition and forgo any further review of his conviction and sentence. Id. Counsel for the defendant had him evaluated by a psychiatrist, who determined that he was incompetent. Id. The United States Supreme Court directed the federal district court to determine the defendant\u2019s mental competence, framing the question as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[WJhether he has capacity to appreciate his position and make a rational choice with respect to continuing or abandoning further litigation[,] or on the other hand whether he is suffering from a mental disease, disorder, or defect which may substantially affect his capacity in the premises.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 16} In a postconviction review of a capital case, the defendant\u2019s life is at stake. Pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Berry, </em>a capital defendant is entitled to a competency hearing when he is seeking to terminate all further challenges to his death sentence. Id. If and when the trial court determines that a defendant is competent after an evaluation has been performed, then he is free to \u201cdecide what is in his own best interest\u201d and waive his right to any further review of his conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Berry </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d at 385, 686 N.E.2d 1097, quoting <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 29, 553 N.E.2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In the following exchange with the trial court, defense counsel provided a basis for granting Dean a competency hearing before allowing him to waive his right to postconviction proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe Court: * * * And I\u2019ve received a motion to continue the hearing on this \u2014 on the defendant\u2019s pro se motion and I\u2019ve also received a proffer of Dr. Stinson\u2019s letter in support of that motion. Did defense counsel want to address the Court on that motion to continue the hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cDefense Counsel: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you. We think it would be appropriate since Mr. Dean would be waiving his right to post-conviction review under the statute and waiving his opportunity to challenge constitutional violations that obviously from his statements he feels occurred in his trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cWe think it would be appropriate to have Mr. Dean evaluated for his competence and mental capacity to effectuate a waiver, including addressing any neurological deficits that have been noted in the record through Dr. Stinson and through some of the records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u2018We\u2019ve obviously, as the Court has noted, offered Dr. Stinson\u2019s letter in support of this request for a competency evaluation. We just note for the record, Your Honor, that in addition to Dr. Stinson\u2019s letter he\u2019s referring back to his post-conviction in his review of the record filed thus far in the post-conviction case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThere are prior diagnoses for Mr. Dean of bipolar disorder, dysthymic disorder. At age fourteen, he was diagnosed by Dr. Gibeau with an atypical organic brain syndrome. Dr. Stinson notes there\u2019s strong evidence of neurological deficits present. These include deficits in impulse control, planning future behavior, and lack of emotional stability, <em>which would all impact upon knowing intelligent waiver with a capacity to waive.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cAdditionally, Dr. Stinson noted in his affidavit that Mr. Dean had previously tested as a youth in the average range of intelligence, and in 2006, Dr. Stinson noted that he was given the wide-range achievement test, version three of an IQ test, and he was in borderline range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThere is also a history of Mr. Dean having used \u2014 having been administered antipsychotic and antidepression drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-12\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cDr. Stinson notes he\u2019s been on the mental health care caseload while incarcerated, and we also note for the record that Dr. Stinson diagnosed multiple substance abuse of alcohol dependence, cannabis dependence, cocaine dependence, and the evidence that the post \u2014 developed in the post-conviction petition establishes that Mr. Dean was using those drugs as early as age ten or twelve. So we feel that there is a substantial body of evidence that warrants at least the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>concern especially in death penalty case that Mr. Dean\u2019s competence be evaluated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">{\u00b6 26} In response to defense counsel\u2019s request for a competency evaluation, the state advanced the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe Court: Thank you. Did the State have any response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe State: Your Honor, the State believes that the appropriate procedure is for the Court to engage in a dialogue with this defendant as the Court already has done to a limited extent so that in order to determine initially whether he does understand the nature of these proceedings here and does understand exactly what he\u2019s doing in making his waiver and whether he has, in fact, worked with his attorneys on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cI would note that the letter contained from Dr. Stinson references an evaluation \u2014 at least a partial evaluation that was done in February and March 2007. At least according to the letter that there was bipolar, there is no diagnosis that\u2019s mentioned here that even an Axis One, DSM-IV-TR, a diagnosis that in any way interferes with competency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cI would also note for the record, Your Honor, that Mr. Dean is presently incarcerated at the Youngstown super max death row. There\u2019s two death rows in Ohio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cOne is at Mansfield for those that are on the mental health caseload and that need assessment of the department of rehabilitation of corrections mental health assistance and so forth, and then Youngstown is for those, at least at this point, who do not. I find it curious that despite all of these concerns, that at least as far as from those who observe him on a day-to-day basis that it has not been determined that he should be at Mansfield even.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cAt this point in time, Your Honor, of course, it is within the Court\u2019s discretion to order a competency evaluation to be done by mental health professionals, if the Court so desires; however, I believe the appropriate procedure for the Court would be to address the defendant as to these mental health issues and to determine whether after addressing those issues with the defendant, whether the Court believes that such an evaluation is wanted or necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cSo I would urge the Court to have further dialogue just to determine whether this defendant realizes the rights that he is waiving is similar to perhaps a [Crim.] Rule 11 type of inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-13\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cAnd whether he understands the implications of waiving post-conviction rights on a post-conviction petition because once he does, those rights cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>reinstituted. And then the Court, I believe, should exercise discretion as to whether there is any further proceedings that are necessary in this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 36} Dean\u2019s counsel requested that the trial court stay any decision regarding Dean\u2019s pro se motion to terminate his postconviction proceedings until his competency could be evaluated. In support of the request for a competency hearing, defense counsel proffered a letter from Bob Stinson, Psy.D., who recommended that Dean be evaluated prior to being permitted to waive his rights. We also note that Dean\u2019s counsel recited a veritable laundry list of mental conditions and prior diagnoses during the hearing on February 26, 2009 that Dean allegedly suffered. Interestingly, the evidence submitted by defense counsel established that Dean\u2019s IQ had dropped significantly since his trial in 2006. After a thorough review of the record, we find that defense counsel presented sufficient evidence that would require the trial court to order a competency evaluation prior to allowing Dean to waive his right to postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 37} In the instant case, the trial court ignored the letter from Dr. Stinson as well as the attendant arguments of defense counsel, which clearly demonstrated the need for Dean to be evaluated prior to granting his motion to waive his right to postconviction relief. Instead, the trial court decided to move forward without the benefit of a competency determination and entered into a dialogue with Dean, as suggested by the state, in an effort to establish that he was knowingly and voluntarily l-elinquishing his rights. In the following excerpt, the trial court inquired into Dean\u2019s reasons for wanting to waive his rights: \u201cThe Court: Now, because I\u2019m presiding over this case I am going to engage in a little bit more of a significant dialogue with Mr. Dean to try to determine whether or not that he\u2019s filed, that he understands his rights and that he\u2019s voluntarily waiving those rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cMr. Dean, I\u2019ll begin by asking you. You have already told me that this is, in fact, what you want to do. You have given me a reason why. Has anyone threatened you to get you to waive your right to pursue these post-conviction proceedings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cMr. Dean: Your actions and the way you\u2019ve handled my case has inadvertently threatened me, just like you threatened my attorneys at my original trial. That you would deal with them after the trial was over, which you attempted to do and failed to do. That motion was filed and denied. And just the way you handled my trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cYou have been vindictive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe Court: You\u2019re saying that I\u2019ve threatened you to give up your rights to post-conviction proceedings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cMr. Dean: I feel threatened by anything you have to do with my case because of the way you handled my case to begin with.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 44} Dean\u2019s responses to the trial court\u2019s questions reveal that his sole rationale for withdrawing his postconviction relief petition was his belief that the trial court was biased and unfair. Dean never suggested that his petitions were without merit and/or failed to raise valid legal arguments. A sentiment by Dean that the court is prejudiced against him should not result in a willingness by the trial court to so readily accept a waiver against the advice by counsel where genuine issues exist as to Dean\u2019s mental capacity to understand the difference between life and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 45} Our conclusion finds further support in R.C. 2953.21, the section of the Revised Code that confers a right to postconviction relief. Paragraph (I)(l) of that section provides that the court must appoint counsel to represent an indigent defendant who is sentenced to death when the defendant intends to file a petition for postconviction relief and \u201cthe person either accepts the appointment of counsel or is unable to make a competent decision whether to accept or reject the appointment of counsel.\u201d The court appointed the State Public Defender to represent defendant Dean in the matter of his petition for postconviction relief. The court could not thereafter proceed to rule on the merits of Dean\u2019s pro se application to withdraw the petition that his counsel had filed without first determining that Dean is competent to proceed unrepresented by the counsel that the court had appointed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(I)(1). The same competency hearing that Dean\u2019s counsel requested regarding the merits of his motion to withdraw his petition would allow the court to determine whether he was able to seek that relief unrepresented.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 46} Dean\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">{\u00b6 47} Dean\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion when it held a hearing on Dean\u2019s pro se motion to terminate his post-conviction proceedings without first considering the arguments of the Ohio Public Defender to continue that hearing pending a decision on Dean\u2019s direct appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">{\u00b6 49} In light of our ruling with respect to Dean\u2019s first assignment of error, his second assignment is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 50} Dean\u2019s first assignment of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this matter is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b542-7\">Fain and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
