Because appellants have enforceable \u201cbumping\u201d rights pursuant to a commission rule governing layoffs, we reverse the common pleas court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">{\u00b6 2} The facts are undisputed in this case. Appellants are members of a collective bargaining unit that the Columbus Municipal Association of Government Employees, Communications Workers of America, Local 4502 (\u201cCMAGE\u201d) represents. CMAGE entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the city pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4117. Article 22 of the CMAGE contract sets forth the agreement of the city and CMAGE on the subject of \u201cLayoffs,\u201d stating in full: \u201cThe Civil Service Commission is responsible for the establishment and enforcement of the rules governing layoffs. Both the City and the Union agree to strictly adhere to the Rules in effect on August 24, 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">{\u00b6 3} Municipal Civil Service Commission Rule XII(C), as the commission adopted and published it on August 24, 2005, provides that in the event of layoffs, seniority will determine who is to be laid off in a job classification that is being reduced. More specifically, the rule provides that a classified employee who is being removed from his or her position pursuant to a layoff is entitled to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>layoff by \u201cbumping\u201d a less senior employee holding a position in the same or a lower class series or job family as the more senior employee. Rule XII(C)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 4} In 2008, appellants held full-time classified civil service positions with the city, but the city notified them that they were to be laid off. To avoid layoff, appellants sought to bump less senior employees holding lower-paid positions in their respective class series, but the only employees subject to appellants\u2019 bumping were members of a collective bargaining unit that the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (\u201cAFSCME\u201d) represented. The city determined that the provisions of AFSCME\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the city prohibited appellants from \u201cbumping\u201d the less senior AFSCME employees. The executive director of the commission formalized the decision in a \u201cLayoff Certification List\u201d issued on August 29, 2008, that certified appellants for layoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 5} Appellants appealed the executive director\u2019s decision to the commission. Following an evidentiary hearing on the matter, the commission denied appellants\u2019 appeal. In its decision, the commission acknowledged that at the time of appellants\u2019 layoff, appellants had more seniority than employees holding positions in a lower class series than appellants. The commission further recognized that it had adopted rules that, on their face, would afford appellants the opportunity to bump the employees with less seniority in order to avoid layoff. The commission nonetheless determined that Article 15 of the city\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with AFSCME modified the city\u2019s Rule XII(C)(3) by providing that \u201cMon-bargaining unit employees shall have no bumping rights into an AFSCME bargaining unit classification.\u201d Applying that provision, the commission concluded the following: (1) appellants had no \u201cbumping opportunity\u201d in their situation because the only employees subject to being \u201cbumped\u201d were members of the AFSCME bargaining unit, and (2) the commission rules, as the AFSCME contract provision modified them, prevented appellants from displacing the AFSCME classified employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 6} Pursuant to R.C. 2506.01, appellants appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the common pleas court. The common pleas court agreed with the commission\u2019s determination that Article 15 of the AFSCME collective bargaining agreement prevailed over and modified the commission\u2019s promulgated rule governing employee \u201cbumping rights\u201d as they relate to layoffs. The court concluded that the change to the commission\u2019s rule \u201cwas not a change that necessitated publishing as would be required in the course of a normal amendment to a rule\u201d but, rather, was \u201cself-effectuating\u201d under R.C. 4117.10(A) when the city entered into the collective bargaining agreement with AFSCME.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 7} The common pleas court similarly rejected appellants\u2019 alternative argument that appellants are \u201cbargaining unit employees and therefore fall within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>those who may bump under the AFSCME contract.\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[wjhile Appellants are obviously employees covered by a bargaining agreement, they are not within the literal or contemplated coverage of the AFSCME agreements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 8} The court accordingly denied appellants\u2019 appeal and journalized its decision in a September 2, 2009 judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">II. Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"AkQ\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants assign four errors on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>Assignment of Error 1:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The Common Pleas Court erred in holding in its Decision that a municipal civil service commission rule, which is incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement between the municipal employer and labor organization A, and which protects the municipal employees covered by that collective bargaining agreement from layoff by the municipal employer, can be amended or preempted by a collective bargaining agreement between that same municipal employer and labor organization B, the latter being a labor organization which does not represent the municipal employees protected from layoff on the face of the subject civil service commission rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">\n<em>Assignment ofEmr 2:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The Common Pleas Court erred in concluding in its Decision that Article 15 of the collective bargaining agreement between AFSCME and the City of Columbus was intended or can be interpreted as amending Appellee\u2019s Rules, so as to preclude Appellants from exercising bumping rights to avoid layoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">\n<em>Assignment of Error 3:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">The Court of Common Pleas erred in its Decision by finding (assuming) that the collective bargaining agreement provision (Article 15 of the collective bargaining agreement between AFSCME and the City of Columbus), upon which Appellee relies as having amended its rules, was bargained before Appellants obtained \u201cbargaining status,\u201d before Appellants\u2019 exclusive representative (CMAGE/CWA) was certified by the State Employment Relations Board, and before CMAGE enjoyed a collective bargaining relationship with the City of Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\"><em>Assignment ofEmr </em>A</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">The Common Pleas Court erred in its Decision by relying upon its erroneous finding, as set forth in Assignment of Error 3, above, to support its legal conclusion that the Civil Service Commission Rule and contract provision upon which Appellants rely was amended or preempted by the collective bargaining agreement between AFSCME and the City of Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>III. Subject-Matter Jurisdiction of Common Pleas Court</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 10} Preliminarily, we address the commission\u2019s claim, raised for the first time on appeal, that the common pleas court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction under R.C. 2506.01 to hear appellants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 11} Subject-matter jurisdiction addresses the power of the court to adjudicate the merits of a case and is a necessary predicate for a court to hear and decide a case upon the merits. See, e.g., <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, \u00b6 11; <em>Morrison v. Steiner </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 86, 61 O.O.2d 335, 290 N.E.2d 841, paragraph one of the syllabus. Subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and may be challenged at any time. Civ.R. 12(H)(3); <em>Pratts; State ex rel. Bond v. Velotta Co. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 418, 419, 746 N.E.2d 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 2506.01 grants authority to the common pleas court to review final decisions of administrative officers and agencies, such as a municipal civil service commission. See, e.g., <em>Nuspl v. Akron </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 511, 575 N. E.2d 447; <em>Haught v. Dayton </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 32, 63 O.O.2d 49, 295 N.E.2d 404; <em>Royster v. Circleville Civ. Serv. Comm. </em>(Apr. 5, 1996), 4th Dist. No. 95CA19, 1996 WL 174995. In order for a final decision of an administrative agency to be appealable under R.C. 2506.01, the agency\u2019s decision must be the product of \u201cquasi-judicial proceedings.\u201d Section 4(B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution; <em>M.J. Kelley Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 150, 61 O.O.2d 394, 290 N.E.2d 562, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Fortner v. Thomas </em>(1970), 22 Ohio St.2d 13, 51 O.O.2d 35, 257 N.E.2d 371, paragraph one of the syllabus. An administrative proceeding is not \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d unless it involves an exercise of discretion and includes a \u201crequirement for notice, hearing and the opportunity for introduction of evidence.\u201d <em>M.J. Kelley Co. </em>at 150, 61 O.O.2d 394, 290 N.E.2d 562; <em>State ex rel. Scherach v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 245, 2009-Ohio-5349, 915 N.E.2d 647, \u00b6 15; <em>State ex rel. Upper Arlington v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 478, 2008-Ohio-5093, 895 N.E.2d 177, \u00b6 16; <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 184, 186, 718 N.E.2d 908 (all determining that proceedings of administrative officers and agencies are not quasi-judicial unless the proceeding is required to resemble a judicial trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">{\u00b6 13} Although the commission agrees that the evidentiary hearing held in this case on October 9, 2009, involved an exercise of its discretion and actually resembled a trial, the commission nonetheless contends that the hearing was not a quasi-judicial proceeding because no statute or other pertinent law required the commission to conduct such a proceeding in this matter. Accordingly, in resolving the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction, we must determine whether the commission was required under law to provide appellants with the hearing held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>before the commission. See <em>Scherach </em>at \u00b6 23; <em>In re Appeal of Howard </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 717, 719, 598 N.E.2d 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 14} The Columbus City Charter commands the commission to \u201cprescribe, amend and enforce rules for the classified service,\u201d including rules that provide for employees in the classified service who are discharged or reduced in rank or compensation to receive notice of the reasons for the employment action and to have an opportunity to be heard at a hearing before the commission. Columbus City Charter, Sections 149 and 149-1. A \u201clayoff\u2019 by definition is a temporary or permanent termination of a person\u2019s employment. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009). Because it typically involves at least a temporary reduction in the employee\u2019s rank or compensation, classified employees \u201cwho are discharged or reduced in rank or compensation\u201d include classified employees who are subject to layoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 15} Pursuant to the city charter, the municipal civil service commission promulgated Rule XIII, which provides that classified employees who are subject to a discharge or reduction in rank, position, or compensation may appeal such action or decision to the commission. Rule XIV, in turn, prescribes that when a classified employee files such an appeal, the commission shall (1) notify the parties in writing of the time, date, place, and forum of a hearing on the appeal, (2) conduct an evidentiary hearing at which the parties have a right to appear, examine witnesses, and present evidence, and (3) issue a decision affirming, disaffirming, or modifying the action or decision the employee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 16} Because the commission\u2019s rules, promulgated pursuant to the city charter, required the commission to provide \u201cnotice, hearing and the opportunity for introduction of evidence\u201d upon appellants\u2019 appeal to the commission, the proceedings the commission conducted in this matter are \u201cquasi-judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>M.J. Kelley Co., </em>32 Ohio St.2d 150, 61 O.O.2d 394, 290 N.E.2d 562. See also <em>Nuspl, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 516, 575 N.E.2d 447 (determining that civil service rule affording an \u201cappellant an opportunity to be heard in his own behalf\u2019 is of the \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d nature contemplated in <em>M.J. Kelley Co.); Haught, </em>34 Ohio St.2d 32, 63 O.O.2d 49, 295 N.E.2d 404 (concluding employees had right to appeal under R.C. 2506.01 because proceeding outlined in city charter to contest their \u201callegedly wrongful layoffs\u201d was quasi-judicial).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">{\u00b6 17} The commission\u2019s final decision in this matter, determining that appellants are not entitled to exercise \u201cbumping rights\u201d to avoid layoff, was a product of quasi-judicial proceedings. The common pleas court thus had subject-matter jurisdiction to review the commission\u2019s decision pursuant to R.C. 2506.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">IV. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">{\u00b6 18} In the appeal under R.C. 2506.01 from the commission\u2019s decision involving largely undisputed facts, the court of common pleas did not need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>apply the language of R.C. 2506.04 that requires the court to assess whether the evidence is reliable, substantial, and probative. Instead, because the facts are undisputed, the court was required to determine whether the commission\u2019s decision is, among other things, unconstitutional, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or \u201cillegal,\u201d meaning contrary to law. R.C. 2506.04; see <em>Deemer v. Ashtabula City Civ. Serv. Comm. </em>(1997), 124 Ohio App.3d 630, 636, 707 N.E.2d 20. Following its review, the court was authorized to reverse, vacate, or modify the commission\u2019s decision, remand the cause to the commission with instructions to enter a decision consistent with the court\u2019s determination, or, as here, affirm the commission\u2019s decision. R.C. 2506.04. The common pleas court\u2019s judgment may be appealed to the appellate court on questions of law. R.C. 2506.04. This court will affirm the judgment of the common pleas court unless we conclude that, in view of the largely undisputed facts, the common pleas court\u2019s judgment is contrary to law. R.C. 2506.04. See <em>Cincinnati Bengals, Inc. v. Papania </em>(1993), 92 Ohio App.3d 785, 787, 637 N.E.2d 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">V. Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 19} To facilitate our analysis, we first address appellants\u2019 second assignment of error. Appellants assert that, even if the common pleas court correctly determined that Article 15 of the AFSCME collective bargaining agreement modified Rule XII(C)(3) on \u201cbumping,\u201d appellants are, contrary to the common pleas court\u2019s determination, \u201cbargaining unit employees\u201d within the scope of coverage of Article 15 of the AFSCME collective bargaining agreement. Appellants thus contend that Article 15 of that contract, which prohibits <em>\u201cnon-</em>bargaining unit employees\u201d from exercising \u201cbumping rights into an AFSCME bargaining unit classification,\u201d does not apply to appellants. Appellants\u2019 argument is grounded in their observation that they are members of the CMAGE bargaining unit, so they are not \u201cnon-bargaining unit employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 20} To discern the meaning of the phrase \u201cnon-bargaining unit employees\u201d in Article 15 of the AFSCME collective bargaining agreement, we examine the agreement itself. \u201cA collective bargaining agreement is a contract, and [t]he overriding concern of any court when construing a contract is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Kabert v. Shaker Hts. City School Disk Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 37, 44, 676 N.E.2d 101, quoting <em>TRINOVA Corp. v. Pilkington Bros., P.L.C. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 271, 276, 638 N.E.2d 572. \u201cThe intent of the parties to a contract is presumed to reside in the language they chose to employ in the agreement.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411, paragraph one of the syllabus, following and approving <em>Blosser v. Enderlin </em>(1925), 113 Ohio St. 121, 148 N.E. 393, paragraph one of the syllabus. When the terms of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>contract are unambiguous, courts look to the plain language of the document and interpret it as a matter of law. <em>State ex rel. Parsons v. Fleming </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 509, 511, 628 N.E.2d 1377. <em>Latina v. Woodpath Dev. Co. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 212, 214, 567 N.E.2d 262; <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 21} The AFSCME collective bargaining agreement does not define the phrase \u201cnon-bargaining unit employees\u201d but does define its discrete terms, \u201cemployee\u201d and \u201cbargaining unit.\u201d Article 2 of the AFSCME contract defines \u201cemployee\u201d to mean \u201cany member holding a bargaining unit classification.\u201d Appellants arguably fall within the AFSCME definition of \u201cemployees\u201d because, at the time of their layoffs, appellants held bargaining-unit classifications, albeit as members of the CMAGE bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 22} The term \u201cbargaining unit\u201d is defined in Section 4.2 of the AFSCME contract to mean \u201cthat group of City of Columbus employees meeting the definition of a public employee pursuant to Section 4117.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, [and] serving in class titles included in Appendix A attached\u201d to the AFSCME agreement. \u201cBargaining unit\u201d thus refers to city employees holding positions in job classifications that the AFSCME bargaining unit represents. Hei-e, appellants undisputedly are city of Columbus \u201cpublic employees\u201d pursuant to R.C. 4117.01. They, however, do not satisfy the definition of \u201cbargaining unit\u201d in the AFSCME agreement because, at the time of their layoff, appellants held positions in job classifications that the CMAGE bargaining unit, not the AFSCME bargaining unit, represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. Chapter 4117, the Ohio Collective Bargaining Act, is to \u201cbe construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purpose of promoting orderly and constructive relationships between all public employers and their employees.\u201d R.C. 4117.22; <em>Kabert, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 44, 676 N.E.2d 101. Its \u201cpurpose is not furthered by expanding the composition of a collective bargaining unit beyond that intended by the parties to the agreement to include individuals who are not members of the association that is a party to the agreement.\u201d Id. Under the circumstances of this case, to construe the phrase \u201cbargaining unit employees\u201d in the AFSCME collective bargaining agreement to include appellants, who are not members of the union that is a party to the agreement, does not further the purpose of R.C. Chapter 4117.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">{\u00b6 24} In sum, because appellants are not members of, and did not hold positions in job classifications represented by, the AFSCME bargaining unit at the time of their layoff, the trial court did not err in determining that appellants are not \u201cbargaining unit employees\u201d within the \u201cliteral or contemplated coverage of the AFSCME agreement.\u201d Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>VI. Remaining Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 25} In their remaining, interrelated assignments of error, appellants claim that the commission and common pleas court erred in determining that Article 15 of the AFSCME contract, which protects employees in the AFSCME bargaining unit from being bumped by senior \u201cnon-bargaining unit employees,\u201d prevails over and \u201cmodifies\u201d the conflicting commission Rule XII(C)(3), in effect on August 24, 2005, that governs employee \u201cbumping rights\u201d in layoffs. Specifically, appellants contend that the commission and common pleas court erred by (1) concluding that the negotiated agreement of the city and AFSCME on the matter of employee \u201cbumping rights\u201d automatically \u201cmodified\u201d the commission\u2019s properly promulgated Rule XII(C)(3) through a \u201cself-effectuating change\u201d pursuant to R.C. 4117.10(A), even though the city failed to publish the amendment to the rule, and by (2) applying the \u201cmodified\u201d commission rule to members of the CMAGE bargaining unit, who do not fall within the \u201cpublic employment covered by the [AFSCME] agreement,\u201d as required under the express terms of R.C. 4117.10(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 26} The Columbus City Charter governs the city of Columbus, a home-rule city. Section 149 of the Columbus City Charter requires the city\u2019s civil service commission to \u201cprescribe, amend, and enforce rules for the classified service\u201d and further requires that the rules that the commission promulgates provide \u201cfor the publication of the rules and amendments thereto in the City Bulletin.\u201d Except as otherwise provided by law, clear provisions of a city charter cannot be bypassed or abrogated. <em>Marshall v. Columbus Mun. Civ. Serv. Comm. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio App.2d 289, 10 O.O.3d 292, 382 N.E.2d 1167. See also <em>State ex rel. Elchlinger v. Ramser </em>(1961), 113 Ohio App. 289, 17 O.O.2d 275, 172 N.E.2d 731. Accordingly, civil service rules of a city must comport with the city\u2019s charter. <em>IAFF v. Dayton Civ. Serv.

See Municipal Civil Service Commission Rule XXI(A) (providing that the commission shall have the power to adopt, amend, or rescind rules, or any part thereof, by a majority vote of the commission). Rule XXI(B), entitled \u201cPublication,\u201d provides that \u201cno rule or amendment thereto passed by the Commission shall go into effect until it has been published in the City Bulletin subsequent to passage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>{\u00b6 28} In this case, the city agreed in the CMAGE contract to \u201cstrictly adhere to the Rules governing layoffs that were \u2018in effect on August 24, 2005\u2019 Rule XII(C)(3), promulgated and in effect on that date, provided that classified employees with more seniority may avoid layoff by \u201cbumping\u201d classified employees with less seniority in the same or a lower job classification as the more senior employee. Rule XII(C)(3), as published on August 24, 2005, and incorporated by reference into the CMAGE contract, conflicts with the provision in the AFSCME contract on the same subject matter, as the city provided in the AFSCME contract that a more senior classified employee who is not in the AFSCME bargaining unit cannot \u201cbump\u201d a classified employee in the AFSCME bargaining unit. The undisputed facts reveal that the commission did <em>not </em>amend the bumping provisions of Rule XII(C)(3). Nor did it publish an amendment to the rule in the City Bulletin in an attempt to conform the rule to the AFSCME contract provision that protects AFSCME bargaining unit members from being \u201cbumped\u201d by non-AFSCME bargaining unit members with more seniority. Accordingly, Rule XII(C)(3), as the commission adopted and published it on August 24, 2005, is still valid and enforceable unless the rule has otherwise been amended by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 29} The commission contends that the common pleas court correctly determined that R.C. 4117.10(A) amended Rule XII(C)(3) by operation of law to conform to the AFSCME collective bargaining agreement provision on \u201cbumping\u201d rights. R.C. 4117.10(A) states that \u201c[a]n agreement between a public employer and an exclusive representative entered into pursuant to [R.C. Chapter 4117] governs the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of public employment covered by the agreement.\u201d If, however, \u201cno agreement exists or where an agreement makes no specification about a matter, the public employer and public employees are subject to all applicable state or local laws or ordinances pertaining to the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment for public employees.\u201d Id. The statute further provides that R.C. Chapter 4117 \u201cprevails over any and all other conflicting laws, resolutions, provisions, present or future, except as otherwise specified in this chapter or as otherwise specified by the general assembly.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 30} The provisions of the CMAGE and AFSCME collective bargaining agreements on the matter of employee \u201cbumping rights\u201d in layoffs are \u201creduction-in-force\u201d provisions, which pertain to \u201cwages, hours, and terms and conditions of public employment\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 4117.10(A) and therefore are appropriate subjects for collective bargaining. See <em>Cuyahoga Falls Edn. Assn. v. Cuyahoga Falls City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 193, 197, 574 N.E.2d 442. Well-established law reflects that, pursuant to R.C. 4117.10(A), the provisions of collective bargaining agreements entered into pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ant to R.C. Chapter 4117, such as the city\u2019s collective bargaining agreements with CMAGE and AFSCME, generally prevail over conflicting laws, rules, and regulations of a chartered municipality, such as the city. See <em>DeVennish v. Columbus </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 163, 566 N.E.2d 668; <em>Cincinnati v. Ohio Council 8, Am. Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emps., AFL-CIO </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 658, 576 N.E.2d 745, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Ryther v. Gahanna, </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-1220, 2005-Ohio-2670, 2005 WL 1274212, \u00b6 12. Those cases, however, concerned the binding effect of negotiated collective bargaining agreement provisions on the parties to the agreement; the cases did not address whether the negotiated provisions, rather than conflicting laws, were binding on third parties who did not enter into the collective bargaining agreement at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 31} R.C. 4117.10(A) limits the scope and binding effect of collective bargaining agreements entered into pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4117, stating that an agreement between a public employer and an exclusive representative of a labor association, such as CMAGE or AFSCME, governs the \u201cterms and conditions of <em>public employment covered by the agreement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) R.C. 4117.10(C), in turn, provides that \u201c[w]hen the matters about which there is agreement are reduced to writing and approved by the employee organization and the legislative body [of a municipality], <em>the agreement is binding upon </em>the legislative body, the employer, and <em>the employee organization and employees covered by the agreement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Giving effect to the plain language in R.C. 4117.10, emphasized here, we conclude that the legislature plainly expressed its intent to limit the scope and binding effect of a collective bargaining agreement to the parties who entered into and are covered by the agreement. Accordingly, when the statutory language in R.C. 4117.10 is applied to the facts in this case, the negotiated provision in AFSCME\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the city on the subject of employee \u201cbumping rights\u201d prevails over the conflicting commission rule and is binding <em>only </em>as between the city and its employees who are members of the AFSCME bargaining unit, but not to members of the CMAGE bargaining unit who are not parties to that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[Negotiated collective bargaining agreements are just as binding upon public employers as they are upon private employers. Courts should not allow public employers to disregard the terms of their collective bargaining agreements whenever they find it convenient to do so\u201d and, instead, must \u201crequire public employers to honor their contractual obligations to their employees.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities v. Mahoning Cty. TMR Edn. Assoc. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 80, 84, 22 OBR 95, 488 N.E.2d 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>{\u00b6 33} Here, as members of the CMAGE bargaining unit, appellants availed themselves of the rights guaranteed under R.C. Chapter 4117 to bargain collectively, and Article 22 of the agreement they negotiated with the city requires the city to \u201cstrictly adhere to the [commission] Rules in effect on August 24, 2005.\u201d Pursuant to R.C. 4117.10(C), the commission rule governing \u201cbumping rights,\u201d in effect on August 24, 2005, and incorporated by reference into the CMAGE collective bargaining agreement with the city, is binding as between the city and its employees who are members of the CMAGE bargaining unit. R.C. Chapter 4117 and principles of equity entitle CMAGE to the same protection and enforcement of its collective bargaining agreement with the city as is afforded to AFSCME.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 34} As appellants note in their brief before this court, the city \u201cnegotiated itself into this mess\u201d by making mutually exclusive and inconsistent promises to AFSCME and CMAGE with respect to classified employee \u201cbumping rights\u201d in layoff situations, and \u201cwhile that may be a problem for the City, it cannot be Appellants\u2019 problems.\u201d Appellants are entitled to enforce the terms and conditions of employment negotiated in CMAGE\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the city on the matter of employee \u201cbumping rights\u201d in layoffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 35} In the final analysis, we conclude that the provision in Article 22 of the city\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the CMAGE bargaining unit on the subject of employee \u201cbumping rights\u201d in layoffs, in which \u201c[b]oth the City and the Union agree to strictly adhere to the [Civil Service Commission] Rules in effect on August 24, 2005,\u201d is valid and enforceable. Appellants\u2019 first, third, and fourth assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">VII. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">{\u00b6 36} Having overruled appellants\u2019 second assignment of error and sustained their remaining assignments of error, we reverse the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas and remand this matter to that court with instructions to return it to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Judgments reversed and causes remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b664-10\">Brown and Klatt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
