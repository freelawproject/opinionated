Lahni, a court-appointed receiver, to sell property at private sale free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons outlined below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">{\u00b6 2} On October 27, 2008, plaintiff-appellee, the Park National Bank, filed a complaint seeking to foreclose upon a mortgage it held on real property located at 6551 Franklin-Lebanon Road, Warren County, Ohio. The property in dispute, upon which Lykins held a junior lien, consists of a gas station, a convenience store, and a fast-food restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">{\u00b6 3} On May 20, 2009, after Lykins filed its answer, as well as a cross-claim and counterclaim, the trial court appointed a receiver, Lahni, to preserve and protect the property. Within that order, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe Receiver * * * may sell the Property at one or more <em>public or private sales </em>on notice to the parties to this action and such other notice as the Receiver deems appropriate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">{\u00b6 5} Lykins did not appeal from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">{\u00b6 6} Two months later, on July 20, 2009, Park National and Lahni filed a joint motion to grant the receiver authority to sell real property and personal property by private sale. The parties\u2019 joint motion sought authorization for Lahni to sell the property at a private sale \u201cfree and clear of all liens and encumbrances,\u201d whereby any claims by those with an interest in the property would subsequently attach to the net proceeds in order of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">{\u00b6 7} On August 9, 2009, Lykins filed a motion opposing the sale as being contrary to law. However, after holding a hearing on the joint motion, the trial court overruled Lykins\u2019s objection and authorized Lahni to proceed with the sale pursuant to the terms of the pending sales contract free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. Prior to the closing on the property, Lykins appealed, raising one assignment of error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred in authorizing the receiver to enter into a private sale of real property free and clear of the liens thereon without following the process for foreclosure sales set forth in the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">{\u00b6 9} In its sole assignment of error, Lykins argues that the trial court erred by authorizing Lahni, the court-appointed receiver, to sell the property at a private sale free and clear of all liens and encumbrances because such an order is contrary to law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">{\u00b6 10} A receiver, who is \u201cappointed for the benefit of all the creditors of the property subject to the receivership,\u201d is \u201can officer of the court and at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>times subject to its order and direction.\u201d <em>Castlebrook Ltd. v. Dayton Properties Ltd. Partnership </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 340, 350, 604 N.E.2d 808; <em>Bank One, Cleveland, N.A. v. Grbavac </em>(June 15, 1989), Cuyahoga App. No. 55541, 1989 WL 65656, at *2, citing <em>Clarke v. Thomas </em>(1887), 34 Ohio St. 46, 63. In turn, the primary purpose of a receiver is to carry out the orders of the appointing court, for the \u201cappointing court defines the powers of the receiver and, therefore, controls his actions.\u201d <em>Javitch v. First Union Secs., Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 2003), 315 F.3d 619, 626; <em>Natl. City Bank v. Semco, Inc., </em>183 Ohio App.3d 229, 2009-Ohio-3319, 916 N.E.2d 857, \u00b6 8 .</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2735.04, which details the powers of a receiver, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cUnder the control of the court which appointed him, * * * a receiver may bring and defend actions in his own name as receiver, take and keep possession of property, receive rents, collect, compound for, and compromise demands, make transfers, and <em>generally do such acts respecting the property as the court authorizes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 13} The Supreme Court of Ohio has interpreted R.C. 2735.04 \u201c \u2018as enabling the trial court to exercise its sound judicial discretion to limit or expand a receiver\u2019s powers as it deems appropriate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Norris v. Dudley, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-425, 2007-Ohio-6646, 2007 WL 4340263, \u00b6 21, quoting <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Gibbs </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 69, 74, 573 N.E.2d 62. As a result, because R.C. Chapter 2735 \u201cdoes not contain any restrictions on what the court may authorize when it issues orders regarding receivership property,\u201d we find that this includes the power to authorize a receiver, under certain circumstances, to sell property at a private sale free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Quill v.

Callahan &amp; Sons Inc. v. Dykeman Elec. Co.

Au Rustproofing Ctr., Inc. </em>(July 3, 1984), Richland App. No. CA-2227, 1984 WL 4959.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 14} In receivership actions, \u201can appellate court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s judgment regarding a receiver\u2019s powers absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Quill, </em>2005-Ohio-2020, 2005 WL 994676, at \u00b6 34; <em>Campbell Investors v. TPSS Acquisition Corp., </em>152 Ohio App.3d 218, 2003-Ohio-1399, 787 N.E.2d 78, \u00b6 15, citing <em>Celebrezze </em>at 73-74, 573 N.E.2d 62. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of law; rather, it suggests that the trial court\u2019s decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Natl. City Bank, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 229, 2009-Ohio-3319, 916 N.E.2d 857, at \u00b6 8, citing <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 15} At the hearing on Lykins\u2019s objection to the joint motion seeking authorization for the receiver to sell the property free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, Lahni testified that when he took control of the property, the gas station had ceased to operate and the convenience store was unable to renew its liquor license and that although he was able to operate the store for seven days, he was forced \u201cshut it down\u201d because he had \u201cbarely enough [money] to cover payroll.\u201d Lahni then testified that even though he listed the property for sale at $975,000, due to an extensive amount of unpaid taxes, as well as unforeseen issues regarding the renewal of the now expired liquor license, the best offer he received for the property was $850,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When asked if he believed the pending sales contract offer of $850,000 presented the \u201cbest opportunity for creditors to make recovery,\u201d Lahni testified affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 16} In addition, besides Lahni\u2019s testimony, Drew Hartman, the president of Wendmiddle, L.L.C., the company in charge of operating the fast-food restaurant located on the property, testified that he saw a significant decrease in business when the accompanying gas station and convenience store were closed. Hartman then cautioned that the restaurant would remain on the property only if the sale was \u201cdone in a timely manner\u201d and that if he was forced to wait for the completion of a sheriffs sale, he would \u201cclose that restaurant and vacate the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In denying Lykins\u2019s motion objecting to the sale, the trial court found that all parties had been properly served with the motion and that \u201c[ujrgent exigent circumstances exist that deem it necessary for the Receiver to sell the Property as soon as practicable.\u201d In addition, the court found that the pending sales contract \u201crepresents the highest and best offer for the property\u201d and that conducting a sheriffs sale would \u201cnot generate a price greater\u201d than the pending sales contract but instead would result in the fast-food restaurant terminating its lease, thus prompting an even greater reduction in the already sinking property value.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 18} After a thorough review of the record, and under the facts of this case, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by authorizing the receiver to sell the property free and clear of liens and encumbrances. As noted above, the property has encountered a number of significant impediments that ran off virtually all potential buyers. However, despite the nearly insurmountable obstacles, Lahni, while acting for the benefit of all the creditors of the property subject to the receivership, was able to find a buyer willing to pay $850,000 for the troubled property, or, stated differently, just over 87 percent of the original asking price. In turn, just as the trial court found, and we agree, selling the property at a sheriffs sale would not generate a price greater than the pending sales contract, for it represents the highest and best offer for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, because we hold that a trial court may authorize a receiver to sell property at a private sale free and clear of liens under certain circumstances, and because the pending sales contract represents the highest and best offer for the trouble property, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by authorizing Lahni to sell the property free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. Lykins\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-8\">Young, P.J., and Powell, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-14\">.

Lahni also testified that he received several offers for the property ranging from $675,000 to $875,000. However, the $875,000 offer was conditioned upon obtaining a Cl and C2 liquor license, for which none were available in the district, and having \"everything clean.\" In addition, Lahni testified that once other prospective buyers were told that they could obtain only a DI and D2 liquor license, which merely allows alcohol consumption on the premises, \"they [would] walk away.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
