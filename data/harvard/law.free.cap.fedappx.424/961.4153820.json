Shinseki, </em>No. 09-3860, 2010 WL 5080074, at *1 (Vet.App.2010). Because Mr. Mattress challenges only factual determinations, we <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b386-19\">Mr. Mattress served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1984 to October 1988. Mr. Mattress\u2019 service medical records indicate that he was seen in May 1984 with complaints of back pain, but had no history of trauma. During an in-service physical in June 1985, Mr. Mattress denied having any recurrent back pain, and his spine was noted as normal. In August and September 1986, Mr. Mattress complained of neck pain that he said had begun in 1984, and he was diagnosed with acute recurrent cervical muscle spasms. In November 1987, Mr. Mattress was also diagnosed with a lumbar muscle strain.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>At a Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) medical examination in March 1989, Mr. Mattress reported that he heard something \u201csnap\u201d while doing pushups in the service and was diagnosed with fibromyositis in the left trapezius muscle. Resp\u2019t\u2019s App. 16. In June 1989, a VA Regional Office (\u201cRO\u201d) granted service connection for Mr. Mattress\u2019 neck disability and assigned the disability a noncompensable rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In September 2000, Mr. Mattress was treated at a VA urgent care center for pain in his lower back and an inability to support weight on his right leg after picking up a box of books at work. In October 2000, Mr. Mattress reported the same complaints, and again said that the pain began after he lifted a box of books. During treatment in October 2000, Mr. Mattress said he had not previously had a lower back disorder. Mr. Mattress was treated at a VA medical center between February 2002 and January 2003 for lower back and right leg pain. Magnetic resonance imaging tests in February and June 2003 revealed protrusion, dessieation, and herniation of the focal disk in his lumbar spine. The Chief of Neurosurgery at the VA medical center concluded that the workplace injury in September 2000 aggravated Mr. Mattress\u2019 disk disease. November 2003 records from a private physician noted that Mr. Mattress injured his lower back while lifting a box at work. September 2004 records from a private treatment also noted that Mr. Mattress\u2019 lower back symptoms began as a result of the September 2000 work injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In December 2003, Mr. Mattress filed a claim for service connection for a lower back disability. In May 2004, the RO denied service connection for that claim. Mr. Mattress appealed the RO\u2019s decision to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Mr. Mattress was given a spine examination in March 2005. The examiner concluded that his neck disability did not cause his lower back problem and said there was no evidence of a lower back disorder in the time between his military service and the work-related injury in September 2000. Mr. Mattress was given another VA spine examination in October 2006, and the examiner said that Mr. Mattress\u2019 symptoms at that time were not related to or caused by his time in military service. The examiner said that his lower back injury was a normal product of the aging process and had been aggravated by his September 2000 work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">In May 2007, Mr. Mattress had a hearing before the Board where he testified that he believed his lower back problems were linked to his military service. In August 2007, the Board remanded the claim to the RO for it to be developed more fully. In July 2009, Mr. Mattress had another spine examination, and the examiner determined that Mr. Mattress\u2019 lower back condition was \u201ca degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine\u201d and was not related to either his military service or his neck disorder. <em>Mattress, </em>2010 WL 5080074, at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">The Board found that Mr. Mattress was not entitled to service connection for a lower back disability. The Board noted that medical opinions from March 2005, October 2006, and July 2009 indicated that Mr. Mattress\u2019 lower back disorder was related to neither his military service nor his service-connected spine disability. The Board also found that there was no evidence that Mr. Mattress had a lumbar spine injury during service, apart from the acute lumbar muscle strain he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The Veterans Court affirmed the decision of the Board denying service connection for Mr. Mattress\u2019 lower back disability. <em>Mattress, </em>2010 WL 5080074, at *4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>The Veterans Court did not substantially address Mr. Mattress\u2019 request for a higher disability rating for his neck injury. <em>Id. </em>The court found that it did not have jurisdiction over that issue because the matter had not been previously decided by the Board. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Mattress timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">This court\u2019s jurisdiction to review decisions of the Veterans Court is limited by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292. We have \u201cjurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under this section, and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c). We \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case\u201d unless the appeal raises a constitutional issue. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2); <em>Ambeman v. Shinseki, </em>570 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Mr. Mattress raises only factual issues in his appeal. Mr. Mattress claims that 1) the VA doctor was biased in his decision finding that Mr. Mattress\u2019 back injury was not service connected, 2) an increase in the disability rating for his neck injury is required, and 3) his back sprain was not just a back sprain but actually a herniated disk. Pursuant to 38 USC \u00a7 7292(d), this court may not review challenges to factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Mr. Mattress first raises the issue of whether the VA doctor was biased. The credibility of expert medical opinions is a question of fact. <em>Moberly ex rel. Moberly v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>592 F.3d 1315, 1326 (Fed.Cir.2010). Mr. Mattress\u2019 assertion that the VA doctor was biased raises no constitutional issue or allegation that a law or regulation was misinterpreted. Therefore, the court does not have jurisdiction over this claim because it asks the court to consider the factual sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Mr. Mattress also requests an increase in the disability rating assigned to his neck injury. This issue was not decided by the Board, thus the Veterans Court found that it lacked jurisdiction over this claim. <em>Mattress, </em>2010 WL 5080074, at *4 (citing <em>Jarrell v. Nicholson, </em>20 Vet.App. 326, 331 (2006) (en banc)). The Veterans Court did not interpret any laws or regulations, rather it applied the law to the facts of the case. <em>Id.; see Ferguson v. Principi, </em>273 F.3d 1072,1075-76 (Fed.Cir.2001). As the disability rating is a factual determination and was not addressed on the merits by the Veterans Court, the issue is not reviewable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">Finally, Mr. Mattress claims that his back injury was \u201cmuch more than just a back sprain\u201d and \u201cwas the result of [a] herniated disc.\u201d Pet\u2019s Br. 2. The accuracy of the findings in medical records is a question of fact. <em>Waters v. Shinseki, </em>601 F.3d 1274, 1277 (Fed.Cir.2010). Mr. Mattress\u2019 claim that his back injury was more than a sprain raises no constitutional issue or allegation that either a law or regulation was wrongly interpreted. Therefore, the court does not have jurisdiction over this claim because it asks the court to review a factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Accordingly, because Mr. Mattress raises only factual issues in this appeal, which are beyond the scope of this court\u2019s review, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">No Costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
