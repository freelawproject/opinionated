Shinseki, </em>No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>09-2890, 2010 WL 4923934 (Vet.App. Dec.1, 2010). For the reasons discussed below, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Pimentel\u2019s now-deceased husband served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March 1946 to April 1954. He applied for service-connected disability benefits for schizophrenia and avitaminosis in 1976. These claims were still pending at the time of his death in 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In March 1999, Pimentel filed an application for DIC benefits with the Department of Veterans Affairs (the \u201cDepartment\u201d). DIC is a monthly benefit paid to surviving spouses of veterans when a veteran\u2019s service-connected disability was a principal or a contributory cause of the veteran\u2019s death. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1310, 1311; 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.312(a). Alternatively, if a veteran\u2019s death is not service-connected, a surviving spouse may still receive DIC benefits if the veteran had received, or was entitled to receive, compensation at the time of his death for a service-connected disability in certain situations. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1318. Pimentel claimed that her husband was hypothetically entitled to service-connected disability benefits at the time of his death and therefore she was entitled to DIC benefits under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">In order to establish that her husband was hypothetically entitled to service-connected disability benefits, Pimentel sought to obtain certain of her husband\u2019s medical records from the U.S. Naval Hospital at Yokosuka, Japan. After multiple attempts to locate these medical records, the Department responded that, after an exhaustive search, it could not locate these records and that the Naval Hospital only kept records dating back to 1980, whereas her husband\u2019s records would have been from 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">On July 8, 2009, the Board denied Pimentel\u2019s claim for DIC benefits, finding that a \u201chypothetical entitlement\u201d claim under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1318 was precluded as a matter of law. The Board similarly found that the Department had satisfied its duty to assist by performing an exhaustive search until it was informed that the requested records did not exist. Pimentel appealed to the Veterans Court, which affirmed the Board in an opinion dated December 1, 2010. Pimentel timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">This court\u2019s authority to review decisions of the Veterans Court is extremely limited. Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), this court has jurisdiction over rules of law or the validity of any statute or regulation, or an interpretation thereof relied on by the Veterans Court in its decision. In appeals from the Veterans Court not presenting a constitutional question, this court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). In other words, this court lacks authority to review challenges to the Board\u2019s factual determinations. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Derwinski, </em>949 F.2d 394, 395 (Fed.Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Pimentel argues that her husband should have been found to be entitled to service-connected benefits at the time of his death. Pimentel also contends that the Department failed to comply with its duty to assist by not obtaining certain medical records of her husband. Pimentel further argues that the Veterans Court \u201cfailed to consider the value of material evidence[ ] submitted.\u201d <em>Appellant\u2019s Br. </em>at 1. The government responds that the Veterans Court properly determined that the Department had satisfied its duty to assist and had no further duty once it learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>that the requested medical records of her husband no longer existed. According to the government, whether the Department had a responsibility to procure certain records and whether the Department discharged its duty to assist, involve the application of law to fact and are thus beyond this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Finally, the government responds that Pimentel\u2019s challenge to the fact-finder\u2019s weighing of the evidence is similarly outside of this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">This court agrees with the government. Whether the Department satisfied its duty to assist is a factual matter outside this court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Hayre v. West, </em>188 F.3d 1327, 1332 (Fed.Cir.1999), <em>overruled on other grounds, Cook v. Principi, </em>318 F.3d 1334 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>Glover v. West, </em>185 F.3d 1328, 1333 (Fed.Cir.1999). Similarly, Pimentel\u2019s argument that the Veterans Court improperly considered the value of the submitted evidence is really a challenge to the weighing of evidence in her case, a factual matter entirely outside this court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Maxson v. Gober, </em>230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Pimentel also argues that she is entitled to DIC benefits under a \u201chypothetical entitlement claim.\u201d In other words, Pimentel argues that she is entitled to DIC benefits because her husband should have been entitled to service-connected disability benefits before his death, even though he was not actually receiving them. The government responds that this court has held that \u201chypothetical entitlement\u201d cannot be the basis for a DIC claim as a matter of law. <em>See Rodriguez v. Peake, </em>511 F.3d 1147, 1154 (Fed.Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">This court again agrees with the government. Pimentel filed her DIC claim in March of 1999. In January 2000, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (\u201cSecretary\u201d) amended 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.22 to preclude reading a \u201chypothetical entitlement\u201d approach, such as the one advanced by Pimentel, into 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1318. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>511 F.3d at 1150. Even though Pimentel filed her claim prior to the Secretary\u2019s amendment of \u00a7 3.22, this court has previously held that \u201c38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.22, as amended by the Secretary in 2000, ... may be applied to claims for DIC benefits filed by survivors before the amendment took effect.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>511 F.3d at 1154, 1156 (finding that \u201cthe amendment to \u00a7 3.22 did no more than interpret the requirements of [38 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1318 and clarify the agency\u2019s earlier interpretation of that statute.\u201d (internal quotation and citation omitted)); <em>see also Tarver v. Shinseki, </em>557 F.3d 1371, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2009) (rejecting \u201chypothetical entitlement\u201d approach where DIC claim was filed in June of 1999, before the 2000 amendment). Thus, Pimentel\u2019s \u201chypothetical entitlement\u201d DIC claim fails as a matter of law. <em>See Tarver, </em>557 F.3d at 1377; <em>Rodriguez, </em>511 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Veterans Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
