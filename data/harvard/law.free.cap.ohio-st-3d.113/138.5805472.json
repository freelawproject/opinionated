The issue in this appeal is whether a Jewish organization that provides classes and research facilities to several resident scholars, and also offers classes to the Jewish community in Cincinnati, is a \u201ccharitable or educational institution\u201d under that statutory provision. We conclude that it is, and we therefore reverse the contrary decision of the Board of Tax Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant Cincinnati Community Kollel' \u2014 -an Ohio nonprofit corporation\u2014 seeks a real-property tax exemption for the years 1998 through 2002 for two parcels that it owns on Elbrook Avenue in the Hamilton County village of Golf Manor. Each parcel contains one building, and each building is divided into two residential apartments. The apartments are occupied by four students, who study at the kollel\u2019s nearby learning center.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">{\u00b6 3} A kollel is an institute for the advanced study of Jewish religious texts. A community kollel combines that mission with the goal of providing adult educational opportunities and outreach events for the Jewish community.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">{\u00b6 4} Rabbi David Spetner \u2014 the executive director of the Cincinnati Community Kollel \u2014 testified at a hearing in this case before the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), and he explained that his community kollel strives to \u201ceducate the Jewish community in which it\u2019s situated.\u201d The Cincinnati Community Kollel pays four married men a stipend to study Judaism\u2019s classic texts in depth, and those men then teach classes to the local Jewish community. The married men \u2014 whom Rabbi Spetner described as \u201cstaff scholars\u201d \u2014 typically stay between two and five years, and then they move on to pursue other academic or professional interests. While the four scholars study at the kollel, they and their families live rent-free in the apartment buildings that are at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">{\u00b6 5} In 2002, the kollel sought an exemption for real property taxes that it owed or had already paid on the two apartment buildings and the land on which they sit for the years 1998 through 2002. The Tax Commissioner denied the exemption, focusing primarily on the residential nature of the buildings in question. (The kollel\u2019s worship and learning center has already been granted an exemption from real property taxes under the \u201cpublic worship\u201d exemption in R.C. 5709.07(A)(2), and that exemption is not at issue in this appeal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>{\u00b6 6} The kollel appealed to the BTA, which held a hearing on the matter in June 2005. The BTA affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision, concluding that the kollel is neither an educational institution nor a charitable institution. The kollel, according to the BTA, provides very little formal teaching activity to local community members, and it does not award degrees to the four staff scholars. As for any charitable activities, the BTA concluded that the kollel does not advance or benefit the public in general, but rather primarily benefits the staff scholars.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 7} The kollel has filed this appeal of right from the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">{\u00b6 8} In reviewing a BTA decision, this court looks to see whether that decision was \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783. The court \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. But \u201c[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u201d this court will affirm them. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 9} Any claimed exemption from taxation \u201cmust be strictly construed, and the taxpayer must affirmatively establish a right to the exemption.\u201d <em>Athens Cty. Aud. v. Wilkins, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 293, 2005-Ohio-4986, 834 N.E.2d 804, \u00b6 8. See, also, R.C. 5715.271 (\u201cthe burden of proof shall be placed on the property owner to show that the property is entitled to exemption\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 5709.121(A) \u2014 the statutory provision on which the kollel relies in claiming a tax exemption \u2014 states that \u201c[r]eal property * * * belonging to a charitable or educational institution\u201d may be eligible for an exemption if the property is used in specified ways. Only the kollel\u2019s status as a \u201ccharitable or educational institution\u201d is at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">{\u00b6 11} The court, when examining R.C. 5709.121 and other similar statutes, has described an \u201cinstitution\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c \u2018 \u201cAn establishment, especially one of eleemosynary or public character or one affecting a community. An established or organized society or corporation. It may be private in its character, designed for profit to those composing the organization, or public and charitable in its purposes, or educational <em>(e.g. </em>college or university).\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Case W. Res. Univ. v. Wilkins, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 276, 2005-Ohio-1649, 825 N.E.2d 146, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Highland Park Owners, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 405, 407, 644 N.E.2d 284, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>{\u00b6 13} The kollel \u2014 an Ohio nonprofit corporation \u2014 does qualify as an \u201cinstitution.\u201d The meaning of \u201ccharitable or educational\u201d in the statute is less certain. This court has, however, considered in other tax cases whether similar entities or activities could rightly be characterized as educational. See, e.g., <em>Am. Chem. Soc. v. Kinney </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 258, 261, 16 O.O.3d 288, 405 N.E.2d 272 (holding that the phrase \u201cpublic institution of learning\u201d in a tax statute may encompass more than \u201ca college or academy in the traditional sense,\u201d but that any such institution must have \u201ca teacher-student character\u201d; therefore, the term could not be applied to an institution that merely summarized others\u2019 research and sold the summaries to willing buyers); <em>Am. Commt. of Rabbinical College of Telshe, Inc. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 654, 36 O.O. 264, 76 N.E.2d 719, paragraph two of the syllabus (\u201cA school which is organized and operated by a religious denomination for the sole purpose of training men in denominational tenets and doctrines and which provides no educational opportunities to the public generally\u201d does not qualify as a tax-exempt \u201cpublic institution of learning\u201d); <em>Socialer Turnverein v. Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 622, 623, 23 O.O. 117, 41 N.E.2d 710 (an organization whose avowed purpose was the \u201cphysical, mental and moral advancement of its members\u201d that provided gymnasium classes and athletic facilities to its members was not a tax-exempt \u201cpublic institution of learning,\u201d as it was not public and the \u201clearning\u201d it offered was \u201cincidental\u201d); <em>In re Taylor\u2019s Estate </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 417, 419, 22 O.O. 489, 40 N.E.2d 936 (\u201cAn institution of learning connotes a teaching staff and students\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 14} Federal statutes and regulations offer helpful insights on the question of what an \u201ceducational institution\u201d is as well. See, e.g., Section 170(b)(l)(A)(ii), Title 26, U.S.Code (contributions to an educational organization are tax deductible if the educational organization \u201cnormally maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are regularly carried on\u201d); Section 1.170-2(b)(3)(i), Title 26, C.F.R. (the term \u201ceducational organization\u201d does not include \u201corganizations engaged in both educational and noneducational activities unless the latter are merely incidental to and growing out of the educational activities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 15} From the various Ohio tax cases and the federal tax provisions, we can identify some attributes that ought to be required of any entity that seeks a tax exemption as an \u201ceducational institution.\u201d Such an institution must be marked by the presence of both students and teachers, offer educational opportunities to the public, involve the transfer of knowledge and skills in one or more structured classes rather than in merely social activities, and have as its primary function the presentation of formal instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Under that formulation, the Cincinnati Community Kollel has presented sufficient probative evidence that it is indeed an educational institution. The kollel\u2019s executive director, Rabbi Spetner, testified at the BTA hearing that the organization\u2019s primary aim is an educational one, and the kollel\u2019s written constitution states that it \u201cis organized and is to be operated exclusively for charitable and educational purposes.\u201d Rabbi Spetner quoted from that constitution when discussing the kollel\u2019s mission, explaining that it strives to \u201cprovide an environment of Torah study combining the advanced studies of the kollel staff scholars with a venue for community learning.\u201d The staff scholars, he explained, \u201care given the mission of teaching the community around them, at the same time [that they] continue their own studies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 17} Rabbi Spetner also testified about the kollel\u2019s \u201cmany different types of classes that are geared towards giving people the education to know how to pray.\u201d The 2003 annual report for the kollel explains that the organization\u2019s goal is \u201cto share the beauty of Torah study throughout the Cincinnati Jewish community, and through that, to help each Jew draw closer to his or her Judaism.\u201d According to Rabbi Spetner, the \u201cstudents are members of the Jewish community in Cincinnati, and they can range from elementary school-age children who are coming for enrichment, high school age students, to college, [to] senior citizens. It runs the gamut.\u201d The kollel, Rabbi Spetner explained, teaches \u201cJewish law, Jewish ethics, [and] Jewish history\u201d to the Cincinnati Jewish community, including a course on kosher laws. A daily schedule admitted as an exhibit before the BTA lists a variety of classes offered at the kollel, including \u201cJewish Civil Law,\u201d \u201cAdvanced Talmud I,\u201d \u201cEthics,\u201d and \u201cIntermediate Hebrew.\u201d The name of the instructor and the meeting time for each class are listed on that schedule. At the oral argument before this court, the kollel\u2019s attorney also indicated that the classes are open to Jews and non-Jews alike at no cost to the attendees.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">{\u00b6 18} As for the four staff scholars\u2019 educational activities, Rabbi Spetner explained that they \u201cprobe, study, and analyze the Torah\u201d for six hours each day. The scholars are taught by rabbis at the kollel, and they are tested weekly on the material that they have studied. Most of the staff scholars who have left \u201chave gone on to be teachers and administrators in other educational institutions,\u201d according to Rabbi Spetner. And during their years at the kollel, the scholars themselves, he explained, are actively \u201cinvolved in teaching members of the Jewish community\u201d who visit the kollel\u2019s learning center.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 19} The kollel does not award degrees for the postgraduate advanced studies pursued at the learning center by the staff scholars, and there is no evidence that the community members who attend classes at the center receive degrees or grades for their beginning and intermediate-level studies. Yet as long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>as an institution meets the criteria that we have noted above, it meets the standards of an \u201ceducational institution\u201d under R.C. 5709.121. The Internal Revenue Service has found that an organization that \u201cmaintains no regular curriculum and provides no credits, grades, or degrees\u201d can \u201cadvanc[e] education\u201d if it \u201cenables] students and instructors to come together for purposes of instruction on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to the community.\u201d Rev. Rui. 71-413, 1971-2 C.B. 228 (recognizing a federal tax exemption for a nonprofit organization that acted as a clearinghouse and course coordinator, bringing together instructors and students by publishing a bulletin listing scheduled courses for the community).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">{\u00b6 20} We find that the Cincinnati Community Kollel has met its burden of showing that it is indeed an educational institution, and we therefore reverse the BTA\u2019s decision to the contrary. In light of our conclusion, we need not address whether the kollel is also a charitable institution. An entity seeking a tax exemption under R.C. 5709.121(A) need only show that it is a charitable \u201cor\u201d educational institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 21} For the reasons explained above, we reverse the BTA\u2019s decision. The Cincinnati Community Kollel has presented sufficient probative evidence supporting its claim that it is an educational institution, and the BTA\u2019s contrary decision was not reasonable in light of that evidence. We remand the cause so that the BTA can consider whether the purposes for which the kollel uses the apartment buildings qualify those buildings for a property-tax exemption under R.C. 5709.121(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Decision reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-7\">Donofrio, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b271-8\">Moyer, C.J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b271-9\">Gene Donofrio, J., of the Seventh Appellate District, was assigned to sit for Resnick, J., whose term ended on January 1, 2007.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b271-10\">Cupp, J., whose term began on January 2, 2007, did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b271-11\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-h\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">{\u00b6 22} I respectfully dissent.
