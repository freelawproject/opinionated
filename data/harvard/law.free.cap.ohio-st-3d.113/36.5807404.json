On September 8, 1993, we suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice for one year, but stayed the suspension in its entirety, and placed him on probation for two years. <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Young </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 226, 617 N.E.2d 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">{\u00b6 2} On February 19, 2002, after receiving notice that respondent had been convicted of a felony, we issued an interim suspension of respondent\u2019s license pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(4). <em>In re Young </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 1473, 763 N.E.2d 181. On April 28, 2004, we indefinitely suspended respondent\u2019s license for his felonious conduct, which occurred in 2001 when he was involved in paying a witness to falsely exonerate his client of a drug-dealing charge, and for improprieties committed in a 1993 criminal case in which respondent solicited money from one or more defendants to guarantee that his client would not testify for the prosecution. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Young, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 113, 2004-Ohio-1809, 807 N.E.2d 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>{\u00b6 3} On June 13, 2005, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with additional violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility, alleging neglect and other misconduct in performing his duties as a guardian. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause and made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct, but modified the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent stipulated to charges that he had violated DR 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting an entrusted legal matter), and 9-102(B)(3) (requiring a lawyer to properly account for client funds) while acting as guardian for Michael Gordon. He denied that he had also violated DR 7-101(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally failing to carry out a contract for professional services), and relator withdrew a remaining allegation that respondent had violated DR 7-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from prejudicing or damaging a client during representation).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b6 5} The Cuyahoga County Probate Court appointed respondent to succeed another attorney as Gordon\u2019s guardian in May 1992. Two years before, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs had declared Gordon incompetent and awarded him benefits. As guardian, respondent was responsible for arranging for Gordon\u2019s medical care and using Gordon\u2019s monthly benefit checks to pay his bills and purchase his living necessities.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent opened a guardianship checking account for Gordon with Key Bank, making himself the only signatory on the account. The probate court required respondent to file a biennial report accounting for Gordon\u2019s finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">{\u00b6 7} LaTonya Jackson was respondent\u2019s secretary from November 1989 until February 2002, when respondent was placed on interim suspension from practicing law. From the beginning of respondent\u2019s appointment as Gordon\u2019s guardian, Jackson assumed many of the tasks associated with the guardianship. She met with Gordon when he appeared, usually without an appointment, at respondent\u2019s office. She also usually purchased whatever necessities Gordon required.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">{\u00b6 8} In time, respondent became impatient with Gordon and felt burdened by the demands of being his guardian, so he delegated to Jackson all of the daily responsibilities of the guardianship. At some point prior to 1996, respondent authorized Jackson to sign his name in carrying out these responsibilities. Respondent was aware that Jackson was signing his name to checks on the Gordon guardianship checking account with Key Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">{\u00b6 9} In January 1996, respondent decided to relinquish his role as guardian, and Jackson agreed to succeed him. Although respondent drafted a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>withdraw as Gordon\u2019s guardian, he never signed the motion, he did not file it in probate court, and he never followed up to confirm the appointment of his successor. Notwithstanding this, he later shrugged off Gordon\u2019s complaints about Jackson, saying that Jackson was his guardian and that he was no longer responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">{\u00b6 10} Jackson was never formally appointed respondent\u2019s successor, but she acted as guardian by performing tasks under respondent\u2019s name. Jackson filed biennial reports with the probate court in respondent\u2019s name and also signed respondent\u2019s name to checks written on the guardianship account, and at some point, she even changed the address on the account so that statements no longer went to respondent\u2019s office. Eventually, she did not even inform respondent of probate court notices that were sent to him as guardian. Jackson continued to handle the Gordon guardianship in this manner after respondent\u2019s February 19, 2002 suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 11} On December 5, 2002, the probate court removed respondent as Gordon\u2019s guardian on its own motion for failure to file an account. On March 20, 2003, the probate court appointed attorney Gregory S. Thomas as the successor guardian for Gordon. Thomas assumed control of the guardianship checking account and filed an inventory. He also moved for a surcharge, seeking to have respondent and involved sureties held responsible for any financial deficiency in the guardianship estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent learned of the surcharge motion from a court magistrate in the summer of 2003. On August 3, 2003, Jackson executed an affidavit acknowledging that respondent had asked her to prepare a motion for his withdrawal as guardian, that she had acted as the custodian of Gordon\u2019s funds, and that she had signed the checks on the guardianship account. The surcharge action was later resolved by the parties, and pursuant to an agreed judgment entry, the probate court found that \u201cthe successor guardian\u2019s services and expenditures for bond were necessary and proper to secure and safeguard assets due to the former fiduciary\u2019s willful and wanton neglect.\u201d Under the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement, the sureties paid the successor guardian for the benefit of his ward \u201c$40,000 for which the former fiduciary failed to account\u201d and $4,101.06 for the reasonable value of the services of the successor guardian, and a judgment was entered against respondent in favor of the sureties for $44,101.06. Respondent has not even attempted to satisfy the judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent thereafter tried to recover damages from Jackson and Key Bank for Jackson\u2019s allegedly embezzling and concealing assets, but his complaint was dismissed. Respondent did not, however, disclaim during the disciplinary proceedings his own responsibility for the mistakes in the handling of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>guardianship, readily admitting that he had not properly followed through on the motion to withdraw and that he had not adequately supervised Jackson.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 14} Based on the stipulations, the panel and board found clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), and 9-102(B)(3). Finding that respondent had also intentionally failed to carry out his contract of employment to serve as Gordon\u2019s guardian, the panel and board also found a violation of DR 7-101(A)(2). Adopting the panel\u2019s report, the board explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIt is undisputed that Respondent was Gordon\u2019s guardian. It is also undisputed that despite that fact, Respondent did not want to serve as Gordon\u2019s guardian so he passed the responsibility to his secretary. He gave her permission to sign his name and never looked back. Respondent testified that a motion to withdraw as guardian was prepared but never signed or filed. When Gordon called Respondent to voice his concerns about the handling of his guardianship, Respondent told him it was not his problem. Respondent never verified that he was no longer Gordon\u2019s guardian or that his secretary was actually Gordon\u2019s guardian. We believe Respondent\u2019s intentional failure to act as Gordon\u2019s guardian and thus carry out the employment contract began when he gave his secretary control of the matter. With each decision or lack of decision Respondent was acting intentionally. Respondent knew he had an employment contract to act as Gordon\u2019s guardian and he intentionally failed to carry it out. Moreover, the Agreed Judgment Entry signed by Respondent and filed in probate court contains the following statement: \u2018The Court further finds that the successor guardian\u2019s services and expenditures for bond were necessary and proper to secure and safeguard assets due to the former fiduciary\u2019s willful and wanton neglect, which necessitated the appointment of the successor administrator.\u2019 We agree with the probate court\u2019s assessment of Respondent\u2019s behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">{\u00b6 16} In recommending a sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the panel and board weighed the mitigating and aggravating factors of respondent\u2019s case, those that favor leniency and those that favor severity. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">{\u00b6 17} The board accepted the panel\u2019s findings of mitigation, the most persuasive of which are that respondent fully and freely disclosed the extent of his misconduct during the disciplinary process and that he presented evidence of his good character and reputation apart from the unethical conduct. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d) and (e). As to character and reputation, a former Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas judge testified that respondent was an experienced criminal-defense lawyer whom he had come to know first in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>courtroom and later through their mutual membership in Alcoholics Anonymous (\u201cAA\u201d). Respondent had joined the judge\u2019s AA group during the prior criminal and disciplinary proceedings against him, and Judge Pokorny testified that respondent has a \u201csuperior dedication\u201d to the principles of AA. The judge had no reservations about respondent\u2019s returning to the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">{\u00b6 18} A pastor at Mount Sinai Baptist Church in Cleveland with an anti-substance-abuse ministry similarly testified about respondent\u2019s good character and commitment to recovery. The pastor is acquainted with respondent personally and professionally. He advised that respondent has become an active leader in the church community and has enrolled in the seminary to become ordained, and that in the process, respondent has taken responsibility for his mistakes and come to grips with his past behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 19} A retired physician who met respondent in June 2001 through AA also testified. The physician reported that he attends AA meetings with respondent two to three time per week and has witnessed a \u201ctremendous psychological change\u201d in him. In the physician\u2019s opinion, respondent\u2019s zealous AA participation is not contrived and is generated by a \u201cdeep-seated motivation for an improved, useful, purposeful life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 20} Respondent admits that he suffers from a chemical dependency on drugs and alcohol, and the misconduct at issue in this case occurred before he sought treatment for his dependency. Respondent argued that his addictions should have mitigating effect pursuant to BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g). This provision requires proof that (1) a qualified health-care professional or substance-abuse counselor has diagnosed the lawyer\u2019s chemical dependency, (2) the chemical dependency contributed to cause the misconduct, (3) the lawyer has experienced a sustained period of successful treatment, and (4) a qualified health-care professional or substance-abuse counselor has concluded that the lawyer will be able to return, under specified conditions if necessary, to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">{\u00b6 21} Again based on the panel\u2019s findings, the board was not convinced that respondent\u2019s chemical dependency contributed to cause his misconduct. Although the associate director of the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d) testified that a causal connection existed, the board relied on respondent\u2019s testimony that he had authorized his secretary to manage the guardianship because he had not wanted to take on Gordon\u2019s care in the first place and found Gordon\u2019s many demands bothersome. Respondent did not blame his alcohol and drug problems for abandoning his client. Thus, although the panel and board commended respondent for his strides in managing his addiction, neither attributed mitigating effect to his chemical dependency.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>{\u00b6 22} With respect to aggravating features, the panel and board first recounted respondent\u2019s extensive disciplinary record. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a). Moreover, although respondent did not profit financially from his misconduct, the panel and board concluded that his neglect of Gordon\u2019s guardianship was self-centered in that he had cavalierly handed the job over to his secretary and ultimately could not account for $40,000. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b). Because respondent repeatedly allowed his secretary to act as guardian without supervision, which resulted in four violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility, the panel and board further found a pattern of misconduct and multiple offenses. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (d). Finally, because respondent abandoned his incompetent client and has not reimbursed the sureties for the $44,101.06 they paid to the guardianship estate and the successor guardian, the panel and board determined that respondent had harmed a particularly vulnerable client and had not made restitution. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(h) and (i).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">{\u00b6 23} Relator proposed that respondent receive a one-year suspension to run consecutively to the indefinite suspension he is currently serving. In part because the misconduct in this case occurred prior to or contemporaneously with the ethical improprieties for which he was placed on indefinite suspension, respondent proposed a two-year suspension to run concurrently with the earlier sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">{\u00b6 24} The panel declined to recommend extending respondent\u2019s sanction through a consecutive suspension, opting for a somewhat more lenient result. The panel explained that respondent\u2019s inattention to Gordon\u2019s guardianship was less egregious than his deliberate attempts to obstruct justice and solicit bribes and that even with this serious misconduct, this court had not gone so far as to follow the board\u2019s earlier recommendation to disbar. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Young, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 113, 2004-Ohio-1809, 807 N.E.2d 317. From this, the panel reasoned that we would have issued the same indefinite suspension even if the instant charges had been brought in the earlier case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">{\u00b6 25} The panel recommended a two-year actual suspension of respondent\u2019s license, to run concurrently with the existing indefinite suspension, with a conditional stay of any suspension period remaining if the existing indefinite suspension is terminated upon a petition for reinstatement. As conditions for respondent\u2019s reinstatement to the Ohio bar, the panel recommended that respondent be required to (1) show that he has successfully completed an OLAPapproved alcohol- and drug-abuse treatment program and that he can return to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law and (2) establish his compliance with a payment plan, approved by the OLAP monitor, for making restitution to the appropriate insurance companies. Upon any reinstatement and as further conditions of the stay, the panel recommended that respondent be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>placed on probation for three years and be required to (1) continue treatment for his substance-abuse problem under the supervision of an OLAP monitor, (2) submit to testing as directed by the OLAP monitor to ensure sobriety, (3) report quarterly to his OLAP monitor on his treatment progress and his compliance with his payment plan, (4) follow the OLAP monitor\u2019s recommendations as to appropriate case management, client communication, and financial responsibility in his practice, and (5) refrain from any further misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">{\u00b6 26} The board considered the panel report on June 8, 2006, and modified the recommendation, with the panel\u2019s approval. The board recommended that respondent be indefinitely suspended, that the suspension run consecutively to the existing indefinite suspension, and that any reinstatement be subject to the conditions in the panel report.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">{\u00b6 27} Respondent does not object to the board\u2019s findings of misconduct, and we agree that he violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), 6 \u2014 101(A)(3), 7 \u2014 101(A)(2), and 9-102(B)(3). Part of a lawyer\u2019s obligation to his client is to ensure that delegated legal duties are completed properly. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Ball </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 401, 404, 618 N.E.2d 159. Because respondent failed to supervise his secretary, disciplinary measures are warranted. <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. Lavelle, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 92, 2005-Ohio-5976, 836 N.E.2d 1214 (lawyer\u2019s license suspended for 18 months, with 12 months of suspension conditionally stayed, because he neglected a client\u2019s marriage-dissolution case, delayed three months in responding to disciplinary investigation, and failed to supervise nonlawyers in his law office, which resulted in nonlawyers\u2019 falsifying documents).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">{\u00b6 28} Respondent objects to the recommended sanction, arguing that a consecutive indefinite suspension is unwarranted for the acts he committed at or around the time of the misconduct for which his license is now under indefinite suspension. He further argues that his chemical dependency did contribute to cause his misconduct, that the misconduct did not harm a vulnerable victim, because Gordon received compensation for all the money that was lost and therefore only the sureties have been harmed, and that he should not be penalized for being unable to make restitution. We overrule respondent\u2019s objections and agree that a second consecutive indefinite suspension, with conditions for reinstatement, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">{\u00b6 29} We first reject respondent\u2019s assertions that the panel and board had no clear and convincing evidence for the findings relative to mitigating and aggravating factors. Both the panel and board relied on respondent\u2019s testimony to find that indifference, rather than addiction, caused him to neglect Gordon\u2019s guardianship. Both found that respondent\u2019s inattention significantly harmed a vulnerable client in that the guardianship estate lost $40,000, notwithstanding that the loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>was ultimately repaid by sureties. Finally, both found from respondent\u2019s admitted failure to repay any of the loss that he had failed to make any restitution. These findings are based on credibility determinations or other evidentiary inferences, determinations to which we normally defer, <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. Suarez, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 235, 2002-Ohio-5935, 778 N.E.2d 569, \u00b6 10, and we accept them.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">{\u00b6 30} We also reject respondent\u2019s argument that when relatively contemporaneous ethical infractions are prosecuted separately and suspensions are ordered in both cases, the sanction in the second case should necessarily run concurrently with the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">{\u00b6 31} Respondent cites <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Jaynes </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 245, 611 N.E.2d 807, in which we followed the board\u2019s recommendation and ordered an indefinite suspension to be served concurrently with an earlier indefinite suspension. Nothing requires this result, however, because, as we recently said in <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Marosan, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 439, 2006-Ohio-2816, 848 N.E.2d 837, each case of charged misconduct is an independent action. This means that the sanction imposed in each case must be justified based on the ethical duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Bowman, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 480, 2006-Ohio-4333, 854 N.E.2d 480, \u00b6 20; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Beeler, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 188, 2005-Ohio-1143, 824 N.E.2d 78, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">{\u00b6 32} Consecutive suspensions serve to ensure a lawyer\u2019s rehabilitation and thereby protect the public from additional misconduct. Thus, in <em>Marosan, </em>when the lawyer had already violated conditions of a partially stayed two-year suspension, leading us to revoke the stay, we ordered him, in a second disciplinary proceeding, to serve a six-month suspension at the end of the two-year period. 2006-Ohio-2816, 109 Ohio St.3d 439, 848 N.E.2d 837. Similarly, we ordered a second indefinite suspension to be served consecutively in <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. King, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 95, 2006-Ohio-1932, 846 N.E.2d 37, because of the serious nature of the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">{\u00b6 33} Respondent has not failed to comply with our previous indefinite suspension order or his treatment regime; however, the misconduct involved in this case is serious and gives further indication that respondent presents a considerable threat to the public and cannot be permitted to return too soon to the practice of law. The combination of respondent\u2019s abandonment of his duties to his incompetent ward and the significance of his prior disciplinary record, which includes acts so egregious that the board recommended that he be disbarred, far outweigh the evidence of good character and cooperation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>board was thus justified in recommending a sanction that further delays respondent\u2019s possible return to the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">{\u00b6 34} Respondent is therefore indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio, and this indefinite suspension shall run consecutively to the indefinite suspension that respondent is currently serving. In addition to the requirements of Gov.Bar R. V(10), respondent must in any petition he files for reinstatement (1) show that he has successfully completed an OLAP-approved alcohol- and drug-abuse treatment program and that he can return to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law and (2) establish his compliance with a payment plan, approved by the OLAP monitor, for making $44,101.06 in restitution to the appropriate insurance companies. If respondent is reinstated, he shall be placed on probation for three years and be required to (1) continue treatment for his substance-abuse problem under the supervision of an OLAP monitor, (2) submit to testing as directed by the OLAP monitor to ensure sobriety, (3) report quarterly to the OLAP monitor on his treatment progress and his compliance with his payment plan, (4) follow the OLAP monitor\u2019s recommendations as to appropriate case management, client communication, and financial responsibility in his practice, and (5) refrain from any further misconduct.
