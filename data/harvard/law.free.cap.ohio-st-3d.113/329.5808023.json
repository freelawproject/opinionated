Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">{\u00b6 1} The question before the court is whether minor misdemeanor disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) is a lesser included offense of domestic violence under Shaker Heights Codified Ordinances (\u201cS.H.C.O.\u201d) 737.14(c) and R.C. 2919.25(C). We hold that it is and therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">II. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">{\u00b6 2} Several years ago, appellant, Ervin B. Mosely Jr., and the victim, Ayana Al-Jeleel, had a son. Al-Jeleel had residential custody of their son, but Mosely had visitation rights. Recently, while playing with his then four-year-old son, Mosely noticed welt marks on his back and legs. Mosely called Al-Jeleel and accused her of abusing their son. Al-Jeleel testified that during the call, Mosley threatened to cause her bodily harm or to kill her. Mosely denied threatening any harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee, the city of Shaker Heights, charged Mosely with domestic violence in violation of S.H.C.O. 737.14(c). The trial judge found him not guilty of domestic violence, but guilty of the lesser included offense of persistent disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(1), a fourth-degree misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-15\">{\u00b6 4} The Eighth District Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred in holding that persistent disorderly conduct is a lesser included offense of domestic violence. However, the court of appeals did conclude that minor misdemeanor disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) is a lesser included offense of domestic violence. Accordingly, the court modified Mosely\u2019s conviction to minor misdemeanor disorderly conduct and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>{\u00b6 5} This cause is now before this court pursuant to our acceptance of Mosely\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 6} Mosely alleges that minor misdemeanor disorderly conduct is not a lesser included offense of domestic violence. Our first step is to examine the ordinance and statutes involved. The city charged Mosely with violating S.H.C.O. 737.14(c), which states, \u201cNo person, by threat of force, shall knowingly cause a family or household member to believe that the offender will cause imminent physical harm to the family or household member.\u201d Because this language is identical to that found in R.C. 2919.25(C), our analysis herein will apply to this provision as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cDisorderly conduct\u201d is defined in various ways under R.C. 2917.11.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court of appeals found Mosely guilty of disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(1), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201cNo person shall recklessly cause inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another,\u201d by \u201c[e]ngaging in fighting, in threatening harm to persons or property, or in violent or turbulent behavior.\u201d Disorderly conduct is a minor misdemeanor, unless the offender engages in certain additional conduct, such as ignoring a request to cease and desist, in which case the offense becomes a fourth-degree misdemeanor. See R.C. 2917.11(E)(1), (2), and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 9} We now look to the test for determining when an offense may be a lesser included offense of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">A. The <em>Deem </em>Test</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 10} Ohio law permits a trier of fact to consider three types of lesser offenses when determining a defendant\u2019s guilt: \u201c(1) attempts to commit the crime charged, if such an attempt is an offense at law; (2) inferior degrees of the indicted offense; or (3) lesser included offenses.\u201d <em>State v. Deem </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294, paragraph one of the syllabus, construing R.C. 2945.74 and Ohio Crim.R. 31(C). In this case, we are concerned with lesser included offenses only. \u201cAn offense may be a lesser included offense of another if (i) the offense carries a lesser penalty than the other; (ii) the greater offense cannot, as statutorily defined, ever be committed without the lesser offense, as statutorily defined, also being committed; and (iii) some element of the greater offense is not required to prove the commission of the lesser offense.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 11} In determining whether an offense is a lesser included offense of the charged offense, \u201c \u2018the evidence presented in a particular case is irrelevant to the determination of whether an offense, as statutorily defined, is necessarily included in a greater offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 26, 759 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>N.E.2d 1240, quoting <em>State v. Kidder </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 513 N.E.2d 311; see, also, <em>State v. Koss </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 213, 218-219, 551 N.E.2d 970. However, the evidence in a particular case is relevant in determining whether a trial judge should instruct the jury on the lesser included offense. If the evidence is such that a jury could reasonably find the defendant not guilty of the charged offense, but could convict the defendant of the lesser included offense, then the judge should instruct the jury on the lesser offense. <em>State v. Shane </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 630, 632-633, 590 N.E.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">{\u00b6 12} Both parties and the court of appeals have noted that the appellate districts are divided on whether disorderly conduct, as a minor misdemeanor, is a lesser included offense of domestic violence. Indeed, the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Eleventh, and Twelfth District Courts of Appeals have held that disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11 is a lesser included offense of domestic violence under R.C. 2919.25(A) or (B). See <em>State v. Stuber </em>(3d Dist. 1990), 71 Ohio App.3d 86, 593 N.E.2d 48; <em>State v. Wilhelm </em>(Aug. 5, 1996), 4th Dist. No. 95CA2123, 1996 WL 447957; <em>State v. Hunt </em>(Mar. 18, 1996), 5th Dist. No. 95CA0226, 1996 WL 132268; <em>State v. Kutnar </em>(Sept. 30, 1999), 11th Dist. No. 98-L-117, 1999 WL 960943; and <em>State v. Burgess </em>(12th Dist. 1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 584, 607 N.E.2d 918. But the Second and Seventh District Courts of Appeals have held that it is not. See <em>State v. Schaefer </em>(Apr. 28, 2000), 2nd Dist. No. 99 CA 88, 2000 WL 492094, and <em>State v. Blasdell, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 423, 2003-Ohio-6392, 801 N.E.2d 853 (7th Dist.). The disagreement in these cases arises from the second prong of the <em>Deem </em>test regarding lesser included offenses, i.e., whether commission of the greater offense always also results in the commission of the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">{\u00b6 13} We now proceed to apply <em>Deem </em>to determine whether minor misdemeanor disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) is a lesser included offense of domestic violence under S.H.C.O. 737.14(c) and R.C. 2919.25(C). Because the second prong of the <em>Deem </em>test is the disputed issue in this case, we will address it last.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">1. Disorderly Conduct Carries a Lesser Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">{\u00b6 14} The court of appeals modified Mosely\u2019s conviction from persistent disorderly conduct, a fourth-degree misdemeanor under R.C. 2917.11(E)(3)(a), to disorderly conduct, a minor misdemeanor. See R.C. 2917.11(E)(2). Domestic violence under S.H.C.O. 737.14(c) is a first-degree misdemeanor, and under R.C. 2919.25(C) it ranges from being a fourth-degree misdemeanor to a first-degree misdemeanor, depending on the defendant\u2019s criminal history.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, disorderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A) provides a lesser penalty than does domestic violence under S.H.C.O. 737.14(c) and R.C. 2919.25(C). Therefore, disorderly conduct satisfies the first prong of the <em>Deem </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">2. Domestic Violence Requires an Additional Element</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 15} Domestic violence must be committed against \u201ca family or household member.\u201d S.H.C.O. 737.14(c); R.C. 2919.25(C). Disorderly conduct does not require that there be any type of relationship between the perpetrator and the victim. See R.C. 2917.11. Therefore, under the domestic-violence provisions herein, the element that the victim must be \u201ca family or household member\u201d is not required to prove the offense of disorderly conduct. Thus, disorderly conduct satisfies the third prong of the <em>Deem </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">3. Committing Domestic Violence Always Results in Committing Disorderly Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 16} Mosely makes two arguments why committing domestic violence does not always result in committing disorderly conduct. His first argument is that it is possible for an offender to commit domestic violence, i.e., cause or attempt to cause physical harm without also causing \u201cinconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to the victim.\u201d The cases that have adopted this reasoning cite a scenario in which the perpetrator throws an object at the victim who is not looking at the perpetrator, but misses the target, and thus the victim suffers no inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. <em>State v. Blasdell, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 423, 2003-Ohio-6392, 801 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 21, citing <em>State v. Schaefer, </em>Greene App. No. 99 CA 88, 2000 WL 492094.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 17} We find both <em>Schaefer </em>and <em>Blasdell </em>distinguishable because in those cases, the state charged the defendant with domestic violence under R.C. 2919.25(A), which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.\u201d In the instant case, the city charged Mosely under S.H.C.O. 737.14(c), which provides that \u201c[n]o person, by threat of force, shall knowingly cause a family or household member <em>to believe </em>that the offender will cause <em>imminent physical harm </em>to the family member or household member.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See, also, R.C. 2919.25(C) (with identical language). Pursuant to this language, the family member <em>must be aware </em>of the offender\u2019s threat and of the offender\u2019s intent to cause him or her <em>imminent harni. </em>Thus, under S.H.C.O. 737.14(c) and R.C. 2919.25(C), an offender cannot \u201cby threat of force * * * knowingly cause a family or household member to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>that the offender will cause imminent physical harm to the family or household member\u201d without also recklessly causing the family or household member \u201cinconvenience, annoyance, or alarm.\u201d R.C. 2917.11(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 18} Relying on the reasoning in <em>State v. Neal </em>(Sept. 1, 1998), 10th Dist. No. 97APA12-1676, 1998 WL 614628, Mosely also argues that committing domestic violence never results in committing disorderly conduct because the elements of the two crimes differ in nature. In <em>Neal, </em>the court held that disorderly conduct was not a lesser included offense of assault. The court reasoned that annoyance and alarm are \u201cmental states and therefore, are not part of the concept of physical harm set forth in the assault statute.\u201d Id. Relying on <em>Neal, </em>and likening assault to domestic violence, Mosely argues that committing domestic violence will never result in the offender also committing disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 19} We conclude that distinguishing between the \u201cphysical\u201d elements of domestic violence under S.H.C.O. 737.14(c) and the \u201cmental\u201d elements of disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) is immaterial for purposes of the <em>Deem </em>analysis. The second prong of the <em>Deem </em>test merely states that an offense is lesser included if \u201cthe greater offense cannot, as statutorily defined, ever be committed without the lesser offense, as statutorily defined, also being committed.\u201d <em>Deem, </em>40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294, at paragraph three of the syllabus. Thus, we agree with the court in <em>State v. Burgess, </em>which stated that \u201c \u2018 \u201cit is not significant that the common elements of these two offenses were not stated in identical language in the statutes, because these common elements are implicit in the conduct that constitutes the offenses.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Burgess, </em>79 Ohio App.3d at 588, 607 N.E.2d 918, quoting <em>State v. Amos </em>(Jan. 15, 1988), Lake App. No. 12-088, 1988 WL 4622, quoting <em>State v. Roberts </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 253, 255, 7 OBR 333, 455 N.E.2d 508. Thus, if a person commits an act, even a physical one, against a victim, and that act causes the victim to experience inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, then the second prong in <em>Deem </em>is satisfied irrespective of the differing nature of the elements of the crimes at issue. Accordingly, we hold that domestic violence cannot be committed under S.H.C.O. 737.14(c) and R.C. 2919.25(C) without disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) also being committed. As a result, disorderly conduct satisfies the second prong of the <em>Deem </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 20} Thus, disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) satisfies all three prongs of the <em>Deem </em>test. Accordingly, we hold that minor misdemeanor disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(1) is a lesser included offense of domestic violence under S.H.C.O. 737.14(c) and R.C. 2919.25(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">{\u00b6 21} In the instant case, only three witnesses were called at trial: Mosely, Al-Jeleel, and Rita Pearson, Mosely\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. AI-Jeleel testified that Mosely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>had called her at work and accused her of physically abusing their son, Ervin. She testified: \u201c[Mosely] called me a bitch. He said, Pm going to F you up because [Ervin] has marks on him, and I was not able to tell him where the marks came from. He told me that he was going to kill me.\u201d Al-Jeleel testified that Mosley\u2019s call caused her to fear for her safety. Nevertheless, Al-Jeleel told Mosely that she would be over to pick up their son the next day. In fact, AIJeleel did pick up her son from Mosely the next day without being assaulted.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ASv\">C. Randolph Keller, Shaker Heights Chief Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AHF\">Christopher R. Fortunato, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 22} Mosely admitted that he was upset and that he used an \u201cunpleasant tone\u201d during his conversation with-Al-Jeleel. However, he denied threatening Al-Jeleel with physical harm or death. He also testified that, subsequent to the call, he continued to visit Al-Jeleel\u2019s home periodically. Pearson, who was Mosely\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, essentially corroborated his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 23} From this evidence, we conclude that it is possible that a trier of fact could find Mosely not guilty of threatening Al-Jeleel to the degree that she believed that Mosely was going to cause her imminent harm, but guilty of threatening her to the extent that he recklessly caused Al-Jeleel inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm. As a result, we hold that a trier of fact could conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support a domestic-violence conviction, but sufficient evidence to support disorderly-conduct conviction. <em>Shane, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 632-633, 590 N.E.2d 272. Thus, the court of appeals did not err in modifying Mosely\u2019s conviction to disorderly conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sadler, Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges
