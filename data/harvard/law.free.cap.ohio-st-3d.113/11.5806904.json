For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">{\u00b6 2} Matthew Pasquale, son of Russell and Toni Pasquale, was struck by a motorcycle driven by Robert Gersten and later died of the injuries sustained in the collision. Gersten was riding his motorcycle, a motocross bike, on a dirt track created and owned by Russell Pasquale. The dirt track contained a series of jumps and dirt mounds. Gersten was making a jump when he struck Matthew Pasquale, who was playing on the downhill side of the jump, apparently unbeknownst to Gersten.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">{\u00b6 3} The Pasquales carried two insurance policies from State Auto: a personal automobile policy and a business automobile policy. The personal automobile policy was issued to named insureds Russell and Toni Pasquale and provided uninsured- and underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage with limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. The business automobile policy was issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>to Russell Pasquale, d.b.a. Pasquale Landscaping, and provided UM coverage with a single limit of $300,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b64} Following the accident, the Pasquales received $12,500 from Gersten\u2019s carrier with State Auto\u2019s consent. State Auto reserved its right to contest any claim for UM coverage under its policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 5} The parties stipulated to the facts of the accident and to the terms of the insurance policies. The parties further stipulated that the motocross bike was an \u201coff-highway motorcycle as the term is defined by R.C. 4519.01(1)\u201d and that the claim at issue is governed by R.C. 3937.18 as amended by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261, 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2372, eff. Sept. 3,1997 (\u201cH.B. 261\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 6} The Pasquales submitted a UM claim to State Auto under both policies. State Auto denied the claims and filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment seeking a determination whether the Pasquales were entitled to UM coverage under either policy. In support of its argument, State Auto relied on a provision in both of the Pasquales\u2019 policies precluding recovery: the provision expressly restricted the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d (defined to include underinsured motor vehicles) to exclude vehicles \u201c[djesigned for use mainly off public roads while not on public roads.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">{\u00b6 7} The Pasquales opposed State Auto\u2019s motion for summary judgment and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The Pasquales did not dispute that the motorcycle was an off-road vehicle but argued that the off-road-vehicle exclusion in the State Auto insurance policies was an invalid restriction of UM coverage as required by R.C. 3937.18 as amended by H.B. 261.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court granted State Auto\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the Pasquales\u2019 motion. In awarding summary judgment to State Auto, the trial court held that motor-vehicle liability policies need not cover any vehicles except motor vehicles operated on highways. The trial court reviewed the purpose of the UM statute: \u201c \u2018[T]he financial responsibility laws and the UIM statute are related in purpose and * * * the General Assembly intended them both to apply only to policies that insure against liability arising from the ownership or operation of \u201cvehicles\u201d that can be used for transportation on the highway.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Auto. Ins. Co. v. Pasquale </em>(Dec. 12, 2003), Lake C.P. No. 02 CV 001655, quoting <em>Delli Bovi v. Pacific Indemn. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 343, 345, 708 N.E.2d 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The trial court concluded, \u201cSince liability insurance need only cover motor vehicles operated on highways and, since uninsured motorist coverage is intended to provide reciprocal or the mutual equivalent of automobile liability coverage and because motor vehicles that are not intended to be operated on highways need not be covered by liability insurance, excluding such vehicles from UM/UIM coverage does not violate the public policy behind R.C. 3937.18.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">{\u00b6 10} In a split decision reversing the trial court, the court of appeals held that the trial court erred when it relied on the purpose of the UM statute as articulated in <em>Davidson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 262, 269, 744 N.E.2d 713, because the <em>Davidson </em>court was interpreting an earlier version of R.C. 3937.18, which was no longer controlling law. <em>State Auto. Ins. Co. v. Pasquale, </em>163 Ohio App.3d 381, 2005-Ohio-4897, 837 N.E.2d 1249, at \u00b670.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">{\u00b6 11} In 1997, H.B. 261 amended R.C. 3937.18 and set forth specific circumstances in which UM coverage could be excluded. The court of appeals held that the exclusion in the State Auto insurance policies was invalid because the exclusion failed to \u201cfall into one of the specified \u2018excludable\u2019 categories set forth under R.C. 3937.18(J) as it was written at the time of H.B. 261.\u201d <em>State Auto. Ins. Co., </em>163 Ohio App.3d 381, 2005-Ohio-4897, 837 N.E.2d 1249, at \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">{\u00b6 12} The court of appeals also held that the motocross bike driven by Gersten did not meet the requirements for exclusion under R.C. 3937.18(E). Id. at \u00b6 61. R.C. 3937.18(E) defined four classes of vehicles that could be excluded from UM coverage and did not include \u201coff-highway motorcycle.\u201d Therefore, because the exclusions found in R.C. 3937.18(J) and (E) did not expressly exclude off-road vehicles from UM coverage, the court of appeals found the exclusion in the State Auto policies to be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">{\u00b6 13} The question presented is whether an express exclusion of off-road vehicles from UM coverage in an automobile liability insurance policy is valid under R.C. 3937.18 as amended by H.B. 261. We conclude that UM coverage under R.C. 3937.18 as amended by H.B. 261 does not apply to motor vehicles designed for off-road use. Therefore, a provision in an insurance policy excluding vehicles \u201cdesigned for use mainly off public roads while not on public roads\u201d from UM coverage is valid under R.C. 3937.18 as amended by H.B. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">{\u00b6 14} We first consider the statutory definitions of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and \u201coff-highway motorcycle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">{\u00b6 15} While H.B. 261 was in effect, R.C. 4501.01(B) provided the general definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for nine chapters of R.C. Title 45 and for the penal laws:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(B) \u2018Motor vehicle\u2019 means any vehicle, including manufactured homes and recreational vehicles, that is propelled or drawn by power other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>muscular power or power collected from overhead electric trolley wires * * *.\u201d 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 210, 147 Ohio Laws, Part 1, 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">{\u00b6 17} There followed a list of exceptions, which did not specifically include off-road vehicles or \u201coff-highway motorcycle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cOff-highway motorcycle\u201d was specifically defined in R.C. 4519.01 when the definition was added to the statute by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 611, 147 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4772, 4795, effective July 1, 1999. Although the definition is not controlling, the parties have stipulated that Gersten\u2019s motocross bike was an \u201coff-highway motorcycle\u201d as that term is defined by R.C. 4519.01(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">(\u00b6 19} \u201c(I) \u2018Off-highway motorcycle\u2019 means every motorcycle, as defined in section 4511.01 of the Revised Code, that is designed to be operated primarily on lands other than a street or highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 20} These statutes support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the motocross bike at issue in this case is not a general \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Former R.C. 3937.18 as amended by H.B. 261 did not define \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d We have previously considered different statutory definitions of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and their application to other statutes. <em>Delli Bovi v. Pacific Indemn. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 343, 345, 708 N.E.2d 693. While not dispositive, other statutes are helpful in determining the meaning of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as it is used in R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. Title 45 is labeled \u201cMotor Vehicles \u2014 Aeronautics\u2014Watercraft.\u201d In R.C. Chapter 4501, R.C. 4501.01 lists the general definitions of terms, and R.C. 4501.01(B) provides a general definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Later in the title, R.C. Chapter 4519, which governs specified off-road vehicles, includes its own definitions section in R.C. 4519.01, and 4519.01(1) defines \u201coff-highway motorcycle\u201d as used in that chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">{\u00b6 22} The specific definition of \u201coff-highway motorcycle\u201d in R.C. Chapter 4519 (a chapter addressing various off-road vehicles) is evidence that the General Assembly distinguishes an \u201coff-highway motorcycle\u201d from the general definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">{\u00b6 23} Second, we are required to interpret the specific UM statute at issue in this case. R.C. 3937.18 as amended by H.B. 261 provided for UM coverage and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(A) No automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state * * * unless both of the following coverages are offered to persons insured under the policy for loss due to bodily injury or death suffered by such insureds:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">{\u00b6 gg} \u00ab* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>{\u00b6 26} \u201c(2) Underinsured motorist coverage, which shall be in an amount of coverage equivalent to the automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage and shall provide protection for insureds thereunder against loss for bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, suffered by any person insured under the policy * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c(J) The coverages offered under division (A) of this section * * * may include terms and conditions that preclude coverage for bodily injury or death suffered by an insured under any of the following circumstances:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(1) While the insured is operating or occupying a motor vehicle owned by, furnished to, or available for the regular use of a named insured * * * if the motor vehicle is not specifically identified in the policy under which a claim is made * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(2) While the insured is operating or occupying a motor vehicle without a reasonable belief that the insured is entitled to do so * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(3) When the bodily injury or death is caused by a motor vehicle operated by any person who is specifically excluded from coverage for bodily injury liability in the policy * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(K) As used in this section, \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 and \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 do not include any of the following motor vehicles:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(1) A motor vehicle that has applicable liability coverage in the policy under which the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages are provided;</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(2) A motor vehicle owned by, furnished to, or available for the regular use of a named insured, a spouse, or a resident relative of a named insured;</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(3) A motor vehicle owned by a political subdivision * * *;</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(4) A motor vehicle self-insured within the meaning of the financial responsibility law of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">{\u00b6 37} Unfortunately, the General Assembly did not define \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for the purposes of applying R.C. 3937.18. Therefore, we will consider the purpose of the statute. <em>Delli Bovi, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 345, 708 N.E.2d 693. We agree with the trial court and the dissenting opinion in the court of appeals, which both quoted our discussion in <em>Davidson of </em>the purpose of R.C. 3937.18: \u201c[W]e have found that \u2018the financial responsibility laws and the UIM statute are related in purpose and that the General Assembly intended them both to apply only to policies that insure against liability arising from the ownership or operation of \u201cvehicles\u201d that can be used for transportation on the highway.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davidson, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 269, 744 N.E.2d 713, quoting <em>Delli Bovi, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 345, 708 N.E.2d 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Though <em>Davidson </em>considered an earlier version of R.C. 3937.18, the purpose of the UM statute remains the same. \u201cSuch limitation [of coverage to damages caused by highway vehicles] is logical since the purpose of the UM/UIM statute is the protection of those using the highways from injury caused by other users of the highways who have no or inadequate liability coverage.\u201d <em>State Auto. Ins. Co., </em>163 Ohio App.3d 381, 2005-Ohio-4897, 837 N.E.2d 1249, at \u00b6 74 (Grendell, J., dissenting), citing <em>Cincinnati Indemn. Co. v. Martin </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 604, 608, 710 N.E.2d 677, and <em>Martin v. Midwestern Group Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 478, 480, 639 N.E.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 39} The language of former R.C. 3937.18(J) and (K) supports our decision to reverse the court of appeals. \u201cFormer R.C. 3937.18(J) addressed certain <em>circumstances </em>where a policy could exclude * * * [UM] coverage for an insured. Former R.C. 3937.13(K) excluded certain <em>tortfeasors\u2019 vehicles </em>from being considered uninsured or underinsured.\u201d (Emphasis sic; footnote omitted.) <em>Kyle v. Buckeye Union Ins. Co., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 170, 2004-Ohio-4885, 814 N.E.2d 1195, at \u00b61.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 40} Former R.C. 3937.18(J) declared that UM coverage may be precluded by contract when insureds operate or occupy a vehicle owned by another insured under the same contract, when the insured knowingly operates a vehicle without permission, or when injury or death is caused by a person who is specifically excluded from liability coverage under the contract. Though this section provides for circumstances under which UM coverage may be excluded, this section is not applicable to the facts of this case. Here, the injury was allegedly caused by Gersten on his motocross bike \u2014 no Pasquale family member was operating or occupying any vehicle when Matthew Pasquale was killed. Further, Gersten was not specifically excluded under the Pasquale policies. Therefore, R.C. 3937.18(J) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 41} Former R.C. 3937.18(E) is at issue in this case because the question is whether a certain tortfeasor\u2019s vehicle, here Gersten\u2019s off-road motorcycle, may be excluded from the class of uninsured or underinsured vehicles. While off-road motorcycles are not specifically enumerated in R.C. 3937.18(E), all four of the specific exclusions found in subsection (E) address only motor vehicles designed for use on public roads. When the General Assembly enacted subsection (E), its purpose was to exclude certain motor vehicles that would otherwise be included under UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 42} We conclude that the absence of any off-road vehicles from subsection (E) is consistent with our conclusion that R.C. 3937.18 applies only to vehicles designed for use on public roads: the General Assembly omitted golf carts, go-carts, and dirt bikes from the exceptions in subsection (E) because these vehicles are not covered by the UM statute. Therefore, the absence of an off-road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>motorcycle from the list of excluded vehicles in subsection (K) does not require that the off-road motorcycle be included. Rather, the off-road motorcycle need not be expressly excluded because it was not included in R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">{\u00b6 43} In conclusion, the R.C. Title 45 definitions of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and \u201coff-highway motorcycle\u201d are evidence that \u201coff-highway motorcycle\u201d is not included in the general definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Further, given the purpose of the UM statute, the statutory language in R.C. 3937.18 need not expressly exempt off-road vehicles such as golf carts and dirt bikes, because those vehicles are not designed for highway use and therefore were not contemplated by the statute. For the stated reasons, we hold that an insurance policy may exclude off-road vehicles from uninsured- and underinsured-motorist coverage under former R.C. 3937.18 as amended by 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 44} Here, Pasquale\u2019s insurance policy from State Auto did not provide UM coverage for damages caused by owners or operators of motor vehicles \u201c[d]e-signed for use mainly off public roads while not on public roads.\u201d An insurance policy exclusion of off-road vehicles from UM coverage is valid under R.C. 3937.18 as amended by H.B. 261. Therefore, the Pasquales are not entitled to recover under their claims for UM coverage asserted against State Auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-9\">Carr, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b145-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b145-11\">Donna J.

No sentient person in the state believes that. Moreover, I am concerned that the decision would also allow a policy to disallow UM coverage even when a motor vehicle designed for off-road use is used on public roads, private roads, or other public space, such as a parking lot. That is contrary to the intent of the General Assembly. See <em>Delli Bovi v. Pacific Indemn.
