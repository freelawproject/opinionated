Because this claim is not cognizable in an extraordinary-writ action, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 2} A grand jury indicted appellant, Donald Ketterer, for aggravated murder with three death specifications, as well as for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, grand theft of a motor vehicle, and burglary. Ketterer waived his right to a jury trial and pleaded guilty to the charges before a three-judge panel. Appellee, Butler County Common Pleas Court Judge Patricia S. Oney, was one of the three judges. After receiving the evidence presented, the panel found Ketterer guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 3} Following a penalty-phase hearing, the three-judge panel sentenced Ketterer to death on the aggravated-murder charge and to prison terms and fines for the remaining felonies. On appeal, we affirmed the judgment, including the death sentence. <em>State v. Ketterer, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 4} In December 2004, Ketterer filed a petition for postconviction relief in the trial court. In April 2005, Ketterer filed a motion to reconvene the three-judge panel that sentenced him to death, for the purpose of ruling on his petition. In April 2006, Judge Oney denied Ketterer\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 5} Ketterer subsequently filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Butler County for a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Oney from ruling on his petition for postconviction relief. Ketterer claimed that R.C. 2945.06 vests the three-judge panel that sentenced him to death with exclusive jurisdiction over the petition. In October 2006, the court of appeals granted Judge Oney\u2019s motion to dismiss Ketterer\u2019s prohibition complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 6} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. \u201cAn alleged violation of R.C. 2945.06 is not cognizable in an extraordinary writ action and may be remedied only in a direct appeal from a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>Kirklin v. Enlow </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 455, 732 N.E.2d 982 (affirming dismissal of prohibition complaint); see, also, cases cited in <em>Kirklin </em>at 455-456, 732 N.E.2d 982. \u201cThe failure of a court to convene a three-judge panel, as required by R.C. 2945.06, does not constitute a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction that renders the trial court\u2019s judgment void ab initio and subject to collateral attack\u201d by extraordinary writ. <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, syllabus; see, also, <em>In re J.J., </em>111 Ohio St.3d 205, 2006-Ohio-5484, 855 N.E.2d 851, \u00b6 12. Ketterer, has an adequate remedy by way of appeal from a ruling by Judge Oney on his petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-11\">Mover, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AcN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>David H.
