Kinstle has filed an affidavit with the clerk of this court under R.C. 2701.03 seeking the disqualification of Judge Richard K. Warren from acting on any further proceedings in case Nos. CV-2005-430, CV-2005-435, CV-2005-543, and CV-2005-682 in the Court of Common Pleas of Allen County. (Kinstle also seeks the judge\u2019s disqualification in case Nos. CR-2005-154, CV-2005-938, and CV-2005-978, but those cases are closed, and my statutory authority to order disqualification of judges extends only to those situations in which \u201ca proceeding [is] pending before the court.\u201d R.C. 2701.03(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">{\u00b6 2} Kinstle contends that the judge is a shareholder in a bank that allegedly has an interest in the outcome of the cases listed in the caption above, and Kinstle argues that the judge therefore should be disqualified from presiding over any further proceedings in those cases. Kinstle also alleges that the judge has failed to rule promptly on some pending matters. In addition, he contends that the judge should be disqualified because the county clerk of courts is a defendant in one of the cases, and he states that he intends to call the judge as a witness in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Warren has responded in writing to the affidavit. He acknowledges that he does own stock in a bank as described in the affidavit, although that bank is evidently not a party to any of the cases. The judge states that his ownership stake in the bank will not affect his decisions, and he contends that he holds no preconceived ideas about the cases and is able to preside fairly and impartially.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">{\u00b6 4} I find no basis for ordering the disqualification of Judge Warren. To be sure, Canon 3(E)(1)(c) of the Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct directs judges to step aside from those cases in which they have \u201can economic interest in the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding,\u201d or in which they hold any other interest \u201cthat could be substantially affected by the proceeding.\u201d The record before me, however, does not provide compelling evidence that Judge Warren\u2019s ownership of shares in a particular bank would cause a \u201creasonable and objective observer\u201d to \u201charbor serious doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Lewis, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1239, 2004-Ohio-7359, 826 N.E.2d 299, \u00b6 8. The bank is not alleged to be a party to the cases, the value of the judge\u2019s holdings is not provided in the affidavit, and any possible litigation-related impact on the bank itself or its stock value is not explained in the affidavit. I cannot conclude on this record that any substantial economic interest of Judge Warren is likely to be affected by the outcome of the cases in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cAs for the judge\u2019s alleged failure to provide timely rulings on motions, that concern is not one that can be addressed through an affidavit of disqualification.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Eyster, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 1246, 2004-Ohio-7350, 826 N.E.2d 304, \u00b6 4. There is no evidence in the record before me to suggest that any delay in the issuance of the judge\u2019s rulings is the result of bias or prejudice against Kinstle, and a party\u2019s disagreement or dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s rulings of law, without more, does not demonstrate bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Murphy </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 605, 606, 522 N.E.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 6} Nor does the county clerk of courts\u2019 status as a party in one of the cases compel the judge\u2019s disqualification. The clerk and the judge are independently elected officials who run separate offices, and neither has supervisory authority over the other. Judges are \u201celected to preside fairly and impartially over a variety of legal disputes, including those involving public officials.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Villanueva </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 1277, 1278, 657 N.E.2d 1372. No information in the affidavit suggests that Judge Warren cannot serve fairly and impartially despite the clerk\u2019s role in one of the cases, and the judge has offered assurances that he holds no preconceived views about the proper outcome of the issues before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 7} The fact that Kinstle hopes to call the judge as a witness does not compel the judge\u2019s disqualification either. I have declined to establish a rule \u201crequiring disqualification of a judge based solely on suppositions that the judge may be called as a witness or allegations that the judge possesses evidence material to the case.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Gorman </em>(1993), 74 Ohio St.3d 1251, 657 N.E.2d 1354. To be sure, under Canon 3(E)(l)(d)(v) of the Ohio Code of Judicial Conduct, a judge who knows that he or she is \u201clikely to be a material witness in the proceeding\u201d must step aside, but \u201c[w]here the evidence concerning the transactions in issue may be obtained from witnesses other than the trial judge, then the trial judge is not such a material witness as to require a disqualification.\u201d <em>Bresnahan v. Luby </em>(1966), 160 Colo. 455, 458, 418 P.2d 171. Mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>\u201c[familiarity with the circumstances surrounding the trial does not render the judge a material witness.\u201d Id. See, also, <em>Wingate v. Mach </em>(Fla.1934), 117 Fla. 104, 108, 157 So. 421 (a material witness is one who is able to give testimony about a fact \u201cabout which no other witness might testify\u201d); <em>Coleman v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 428, 435, 633 P.2d 624 (\u201cthe post-conviction court judge should only recuse himself if the petitioner shows that the judge is the source of material evidence otherwise unobtainable\u201d); <em>Robison v. State </em>(Okla.Crim.App.1991), 818 P.2d 1250, 1252 (trial judge was not required to disqualify himself from a postconviction hearing where his testimony would have been \u201ceither cumulative * * * or immaterial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">{\u00b6 8} If Judge Warren concludes that he is likely to be material witness in the proceedings, he can and should disqualify himself as Canon 3(E)(l)(d)(v) directs. On the record before me, however, I cannot conclude that the judge possesses knowledge that he is likely to be such a witness, and the information in the affidavit itself would not lead an objective, reasonable observer to harbor serious doubts about Judge Warren\u2019s ability to decide the cases impartially. \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">{\u00b6 9} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The cases may proceed before Judge Warren.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
