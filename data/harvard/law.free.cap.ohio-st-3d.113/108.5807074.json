After reviewing the history of this case and the relevant statutory authority, we affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">{\u00b62} On September 10, 2003, Kim Cunningham pleaded guilty to theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02, a felony of the fifth degree, and the trial court sentenced her to community control, placing her on electronic home detention for 60 days. On December 9, 2003, the trial court entered an order finding that Cunningham had violated the terms of her community control by being out of range of her electronic home-detention monitor, and it therefore imposed a one-year sentence of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">{\u00b6 3} Two months later, Cunningham filed a motion for judicial release in accordance with R.C. 2929.20(B)(1)(a). However, before the trial court ruled on that motion, Cunningham filed a motion to withdraw it, which the trial court granted. Thereafter, on June 18, 2004, Cunningham filed a second motion for judicial release. During the pendency of that second motion for judicial release, Cunningham moved to reinstate her first motion for judicial release, which she had withdrawn. The trial court granted that motion, and, after a hearing, it modified her sentence of incarceration to a four-year period of community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>control. The prosecuting attorney then appealed the court\u2019s order granting judicial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 4} Prior to oral argument in the court of appeals, the court, sua sponte, raised the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s order modifying the sentence constituted a final, appealable order. In a split decision, the appellate court dismissed the state\u2019s appeal for lack of a final, appealable order, holding that R.C. 2953.08(B) did not grant the state the right to appeal in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 5} The state has now appealed that decision to this court, urging that it has a right to appeal pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(B)(2) from orders granting judicial release pursuant to R.C. 2929.20 that are contrary to law. We granted discretionary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 6} The right of a prosecuting attorney to appeal a sentence is provided by R.C. 2953.08(B):</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(B) In addition to any other right to appeal and except as provided in division (D) of this section, a prosecuting attorney * * * may appeal as a matter of right a sentence imposed upon a defendant who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony or, in the circumstances described in division (B)(3) of this section the modification of a sentence imposed upon such a defendant, on any of the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(2) The sentence is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(3) The sentence is a modification under section 2929.20 of the Revised Code of a sentence that was imposed for a felony of the first or second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2953.08(B)(3) grants the state a right to appeal if a court modifies a sentence imposed for a felony of the first or second degree. Cunningham\u2019s conviction here, however, is for theft, a felony of the fifth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">{\u00b6 12} The prosecuting attorney contends that R.C. 2953.08(B)(2) authorizes an appeal from modification of any sentence that is contrary to law, and urges that the modification of sentence granting judicial release to Cunningham violated R.C. 2929.20(B)(1)(a) because Cunningham did not file her motion seeking judicial release in a timely manner; in addition, the prosecutor argues that the court had no authority to reinstate Cunningham\u2019s withdrawn motion for judicial release and, therefore, that the court acted contrary to law in granting judicial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">{\u00b6 13} Cunningham claims that R.C. 2953.08(B)(3) precludes appellate review of <em>any </em>sentence modification involving any third-, fourth-, or fifth-degree felony. Thus, we are confronted with a question of statutory interpretation concerning whether R.C. 2953.08(B)(2) authorizes the prosecuting attorney to appeal as contrary to law the modification of a criminal sentence granting judicial release for a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree, or whether R.C. 2953.08(B)(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>precludes the prosecuting attorney from doing so because it expressly grants the right to appeal only the modification of sentences imposed for felonies of the first or second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2929.20 restricts the time within which an eligible offender may file a motion for judicial release. It reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(B) Upon the filing of a motion by the eligible offender or upon its own motion, a sentencing court may reduce the offender\u2019s stated prison term through a judicial release in accordance with this section. * * * An eligible offender may file a motion for judicial release with the sentencing court within the following applicable period of time:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(l)(a) Except as otherwise provided in division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of this section, if the stated prison term was imposed for a felony of the fourth or fifth degree, the eligible offender may file the motion not earlier than thirty days or later than ninety days after the offender is delivered to a state correctional institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 17} Further, R.C. 2929.20(B)(2) pertains to first-, second-, and third-degree felonies, and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[I]f the stated prison term was imposed for a felony of the first, second, or third degree, the eligible offender may file the motion not earlier than one hundred eighty days after the offender is delivered to a state correctional institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">{\u00b6 19} What is immediately apparent from the foregoing code sections is that the General Assembly has imposed time parameters for eligible offenders to file for a modification of sentence seeking judicial release. It does not appear to be an oversight that the General Assembly excluded felonies of the third, fourth, or fifth degree from R.C. 2953.08(B)(3), which authorizes a prosecuting attorney to appeal modification of a sentence imposed for a felony of the first or second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">{\u00b6 20} First, the plain language of R.C. 2953.08(B)(3) does not include any reference to a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree. By including only felonies of the first and second degree within the text of (B)(3), the General Assembly has excluded all other felony offenses of a lesser degree because \u201cthe express inclusion of one thing implies the exclusion of the other.\u201d <em>Myers v. Toledo, 110 </em>Ohio St.3d 218, 2006-Ohio-4353, 852 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b624.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">{\u00b6 21} Next, in establishing time parameters within which to file motions for judicial release pursuant to R.C. 2929.20, the General Assembly established two different time periods: one for filing a motion for judicial release involving felonies of the first, second, and third degree, R.C. 2929.20(B)(2); and a separate time period for felonies of the fourth and fifth degree, R.C. 2929.20(B)(1). But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>when it authorized the prosecuting attorney to appeal a modification of sentence, it limited the right to sentence modifications involving only felonies of the first and second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, we recognize that the state, relying on R.C. 2953.08(B)(2), contends that it has a right to appeal a sentence modification that is contrary to law. Here, it urges that the court acted contrary to law in permitting Cunningham to reinstate a motion that had been withdrawn and that would have been untimely if it were refiled. A careful examination of R.C. 2953.08(B)(2), however, reveals that it does not refer to the <em>modification </em>of a sentence; rather, it authorizes the prosecuting attorney to appeal, as a matter of right, a <em>sentence </em>imposed on a defendant on the grounds that \u201c[t]he sentence is contrary to law.\u201d Thus, it does not apply to a modification of a sentence that is allegedly contrary to law. See <em>State v. Raitz, </em>6th Dist. No. L-03-1118, 2003-Ohio-5687, 2003 WL 22417222, \u00b6 13. The state argues that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to reinstate Cunningham\u2019s first motion for judicial release and as a result that modification is contrary to law. The state argues in the alternative that if the trial court had the jurisdiction to reinstate the motion, it abused its discretion in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 23} We have stated that \u201c}a]ny attempt by a court to disregard statutory requirements when imposing a sentence renders the attempted sentence a nullity or void.\u201d <em>State v. Beasley </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 74, 75, 14 OBR 511, 471 N.E.2d 774. In <em>Beasley, </em>we reasoned that \u201c \u2018[cjrimes are statutory, as are the penalties therefor, and the only sentence which a trial judge may impose is that provided for by statute * * *.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Colegrove v. Burns </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 437, 438, 25 O.O.2d 447, 195 N.E.2d 811. Thus, a trial court may grant judicial release and modify a sentence only as provided for by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 24} Based upon the narrow facts of this case, however, the trial court did not disregard statutory requirements in modifying Cunningham\u2019s sentence. Cunningham complied with the time parameters in R.C. 2929.20(B)(1)(a) in filing her original motion on February 20, 2004, vesting the trial court with jurisdiction at that time. And, where \u201c \u2018jurisdiction has attached},] the right to hear and determine is perfect},] and the decision of every question thereafter arising is but the exercise of the jurisdiction thus conferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tari v. State </em>(1927), 117 Ohio St. 481, 491, 159 N.E. 594, quoting <em>Sheldon\u2019s Lessee v. Newton </em>(1854), 3 Ohio St. 494, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">{\u00b6 25} Because the trial court had jurisdiction through Cunningham\u2019s initial motion for judicial release, it also had \u201cinherent authority and wide discretion in exercising its duty to administer proceedings,\u201d <em>State v. Boddie </em>(Sept. 6, 2001), 3d Dist. No. 1-2000-72, 2001 WL 1023107, citing <em>Royal Indemn. Co. v. J.C. Penney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>Co., Inc. </em>(1986), 27 Ohio St.3d 31, 33-36, 27 OBR 447, 501 N.E.2d 617, which includes the ability to reinstate a withdrawn motion. In addition, the court\u2019s decision \u201cwill not be disturbed absent a showing that the court abused that discretion.\u201d Id. We have defined an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d as an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable use of discretion, <em>State v. Hancock, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d 1032, \u00b6 130, or as a \u201c \u2018view or action \u201cthat no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Wilms v. Blake </em>(1945), 144 Ohio St. 619, 624, 30 O.O. 220, 60 N.E.2d 308, quoting <em>Long v. George </em>(1937), 296 Mass. 574, 579, 7 N.E.2d 149, quoting <em>Davis v. Boston Elevated Ry. Co. </em>(1920), 235 Mass. 482, 497, 126 N.E. 841.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AL_\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Steven Gall, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 26} Given the facts before us, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in this case. Significantly, the court did not rule on the second, untimely motion for judicial release filed on June 18, 2004. Instead, it reinstated Cunningham\u2019s timely filed motion. The court did not act arbitrarily or otherwise ignore the language of the statute. Therefore, where an eligible inmate has timely filed a motion seeking judicial release pursuant to R.C. 2929.20 involving a felony of the fifth degree, but later withdraws that motion, an order of the trial court reinstating that motion is not an abuse of discretion, and a judgment entry granting it is not contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 27} Since it is our responsibility to interpret the law, and not to make it, we are constrained by the language used in R.C. 2953.08 to conclude that the General Assembly has granted the prosecuting attorney a limited right to appeal the modification of a sentence granting judicial release for a felony of the first or second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 28} Accordingly, R.C. 2953.08(B)(2) does not authorize a prosecuting attorney to appeal the modification of a sentence granting judicial release for a felony of the third, fourth, or fifth degree. We therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals dismissing the state\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-10\">Moyer, C.J., Carr, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b241-11\">Donna J.
