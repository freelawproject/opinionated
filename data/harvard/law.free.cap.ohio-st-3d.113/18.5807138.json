Tara\u2019s parents, appellees Gina and Thomas Fehrenbach (\u201cFehrenbachs\u201d) eventually sued appellants, Tara\u2019s pediatrician Kathryn O\u2019Malley, M.D., and O\u2019Malley\u2019s employer, Suburban Pediatric Associates (collectively, \u201cDr. O\u2019Malley\u201d), alleging medical negligence in failing to correctly diagnosis and treat the meningitis. The Fehrenbachs sued both as Tara\u2019s guardian and in their own right for loss of consortium and other claims. They do not dispute that the accrual date for Tara\u2019s injuries was not later than December 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">{\u00b6 3} The Fehrenbachs filed their complaint in January 1997, over five years after their claims accrued. Upon Dr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, the trial court found that the claims for loss of consortium and medical expenses were barred by the statute of limitations and entered judgment on these claims for O\u2019Malley. After a jury trial on the other issues, the Fehrenbachs appealed the summary judgment in conjunction with other alleged errors. The court of appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that \u201cthe interests of Tara and her parents were \u2018joint and inseparable\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cthe tolling provisions of R.C. 2305.16 inure to the benefit of parents pursuing a claim for loss of consortium and medical expenses.\u201d <em>Fehrenbach v. O\u2019Malley, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 80, 2005-Ohio-5554, 841 N.E.2d 350, \u00b6 66 and 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">{\u00b6 4} We accepted Dr. O\u2019Malley\u2019s discretionary appeal and recognized that a conflict exists on the issue certified by the First District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2305.113(A) requires an action alleging medical malpractice to be filed within one year after the cause of action accrued. The limitations period is tolled during the plaintiffs minority. R.C. 2305.16. There is no question that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Tara may assert the tolling provision. The tolling provision also states that \u201c[w]hen the interests of two or more parties are joint and inseparable, the disability of one shall inure to the benefit of all.\u201d R.C. 2305.16. The Fehrenbachs argue that because their claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the claim of Tara, her claim and their claims are joint and inseparable, and they, like Tara, should be able to take advantage of the tolling provision. Dr. O\u2019Malley counters that in Ohio, loss of consortium is a recognized as a separate and distinct claim, and therefore the Fehrenbachs\u2019 claim is time-barred under <em>Grindell v. Huber </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 71, 57 O.O.2d 259, 275 N.E.2d 614, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 6} We begin our analysis by reviewing the nature of a parent\u2019s loss-of-consortium claim. In <em>Gallimore v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 244, 617 N.E.2d 1052, paragraph one of the syllabus, this court held, \u201cA parent may recover damages, in a derivative action against a third-party tortfeasor who intentionally or negligently causes physical injury to the parent\u2019s minor child, for loss of filial consortium. Consortium includes services, society, companionship, comfort, love and solace.\u201d Previous to that holding, we had limited a parent\u2019s recovery to loss of services and medical expenses, recognizing the claims as separate and distinct from the child\u2019s claim for injury. We held: \u201c \u2018Where a defendant negligently causes injury to \u00e1 minor child, that single wrong gives rise to two separate and distinct causes of action: an action by the minor child for his personal injuries and a derivative action in favor of the parents of the child for the loss of his services and his medical expenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grindell v. Huber, </em>28 Ohio St.2d at 74, 57 O.O.2d 259, 275 N.E.2d 614, quoting <em>Whitehead v. Gen. Tel. Co. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 108, 49 O.O.2d 435, 254 N.E.2d 10, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 7} <em>Gallimore </em>also recognized a minor child\u2019s right to an action for loss of consortium for an injury to a parent. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. We were later asked to address whether a minor child\u2019s claim for parental loss of consortium should be joined with the parent\u2019s claim for damages caused by the injury and whether the filing of the minor child\u2019s claim was outside the statute of limitations because it had not originally been joined with the parent\u2019s claim. We held:</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c \u2018 \u201cThis problem has been dealt with in other jurisdictions by requiring joinder of all minors\u2019 consortium claims with the injured parent\u2019s claim whenever feasible. * * * We believe that this is a sensible solution to the problem and hold that a child\u2019s loss of parental consortium claim must be joined with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>injured parent\u2019s claim whenever feasible.\u201d \u2019 (Emphasis added.) Id. <em>[High v. Howard </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 82] at 94-95, 592 N.E.2d [818 (Resnick, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Farley v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(Feb. 21, 1992), Lucas App. No. L-90-323, 1992 WL 32111],</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cWe find nothing in the record before us to show that joinder of [the minor child\u2019s] cause of action for loss of parental consortium to her mother\u2019s cause of action is not just and feasible. Moreover, since the statute of limitations for [the child\u2019s] <em>independent </em>cause of action for loss of parental consortium is majority plus four years (see R.C. 2305.09), there is no statute-of-limitations problem.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Coleman v. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 492, 494, 660 N.E.2d 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 10} We observed that requiring a minor child to join with the parent in asserting a loss-of-parental-consortium claim would limit the possibility of multiple cases and divergent outcomes. Id. at 493-494, 660 N.E.2d 424. We also recognized that the minor child\u2019s claim was independent of the parent\u2019s claim, thereby allowing the minor child to take advantage of the tolling provisions. Id. at 494, 660 N.E.2d 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">{\u00b6 11} The independent nature of the loss-of-consortium claim is based on control and ownership of the claim. In determining whether a husband\u2019s waiver of his claim terminated a wife\u2019s loss-of-consortium claim, we held, \u201cThe right is her separate and personal right arising from the damages she sustains as a result of the tortfeasor\u2019s conduct. The right of the wife to maintain an action for loss of consortium occasioned by her husband\u2019s injury is a cause of action which belongs to her and which does not belong to her husband.\u201d <em>Bowen v. Kil-Kare, Inc. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 84, 92, 585 N.E.2d 384. Because the loss-of-consortium claim belongs not to the person suffering a physical injury but to another, it is independent, and while the claim may be \u201cseparate\u201d in the sense that it is a distinct and individual claim, it is a derivative action, arising from the same occurrence that produced the alleged injury to the other familial party.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">{\u00b6 12} This understanding of the nature of a loss-of-consortium claim comports with the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure. Civ.R. 19.1, dealing with compulsory joinder, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(A) Persons to be joined</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in the action, except as provided in division (B) of this rule, if the person has an interest in or a claim arising out of the following situations:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>{\u00b6 15} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(3) Personal injury or property damage to a minor and a claim of the parent or guardian of the minor for loss of consortium or expenses or property damage if caused by the same wrongful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 17} Thus, under the Civil Rules, if a minor filed a complaint seeking damages for injury and the parents have a loss-of-consortium claim, the parents\u2019 claim must be filed at the same time as the filing of the child\u2019s complaint. Our case law requires that if a parent has a claim for injury and the minor child has a claim for loss of consortium, the minor child\u2019s complaint must be filed at the same time as the filing of the parents\u2019 complaint. <em>Coleman, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 494, 660 N.E.2d 424. Requiring joinder in these cases promotes judicial economy and limits the possibility of conflicting outcomes. The 1970 Staff Notes to Civ.R. 19.1 clearly and concisely state the rationale supporting compulsory joinder:</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cRule 19.1 extends the Rule 19 philosophy by requiring a person with a separate claim to join his claim with that of another person even though under substantive law there may be two independent claims which might be pursued separately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cCurrent [i.e., pre-Rule] practice allows plaintiffs, at their option, to separately pursue these claims. When these claims are separately prosecuted defendant is required to defend twice. Much evidence must be repeated and there is useless expenditure of, <em>inter alia., </em>court time. Furthermore, since the claims are related, difficult questions of collateral estoppel and res adjudicata often arise. Frequently, the results are inconsistent and not compatible. Consequently, Rule 19.1 is designed to obviate these problems and to serve the interests of society and of the parties by requiring disposition of the related claims in one action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 20} This reasoning is especially apropos when applied to the facts of this case. Requiring the Fehrenbachs to litigate their loss-of-consortium claim within one year of their injury and allowing Tara many years to bring her claim subjects the defendants to multiple lawsuits and potentially conflicting and inconsistent results. By allowing the statute of limitations on the parent\u2019s claim to be tolled during the child\u2019s infancy, piecemeal litigation and its inherent problems can be avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">{\u00b6 21} The final question to be reviewed is the application of the word \u201cinterests\u201d in R.C. 2305.16 (\u201cWhen the interests of two or more parties are joint and inseparable, the disability of one shall inure to the benefit of all\u201d). When a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>statute does not define or modify a word, we will apply the term in its normal customary meaning. <em>Chari v. Vore </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 327, 744 N.E.2d 763. \u201cInterest\u201d means \u201c[a] legal share in something.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 828. The Fehrenbachs have a legal share in Tara\u2019s claim. The Fehrenbachs\u2019 damages and Tara\u2019s physical injury both derive from the same alleged facts and wrongful acts of defendants. While the Fehrenbachs\u2019 claim remains independent and separate in the sense that they alone control it, their claim is \u201cjoint and inseparable\u201d from Tara\u2019s claim because the Fehrenbachs cannot recover damages from defendants if defendants are found not to be liable for Tara\u2019s injury.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ap6\">Lindhorst &amp; Dreidame, Michael F. Lyon, and Bradley D. McPeek, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A7\">John H. Metz, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A2H\">Paul W. Flowers Co., L.P.A., and Paul W. Flowers, urging affirmance for amicus curiae, Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 22} Considering the strong policy reflected in the Civil Rules and our precedent in favor of joinder and limiting piecemeal litigation, combined with the plain meaning of the word \u201cinterests\u201d as found in the statute, we answer the certified question in the affirmative. We hold that because a parent\u2019s claim for loss of consortium against a third party for injuries to the parent\u2019s minor child is an interest that is \u201cjoint and inseparable\u201d from the child\u2019s own claim for purposes of R.C. 2305.16, the parent\u2019s claim may be tolled during the child\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 23} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-8\">Shaw, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b151-9\">Stephen R.
