We conclude that R.C. 4905.61 is a penalty statute and that the one-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.11 applies to it. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 2} The appellees in these consolidated actions, Discount Cellular, Cleveland Mobile Radio Sales, Inc., and Tele-Trak (collectively, \u201cCleveland Mobile\u201d), are cellular-telephone-service resellers. Their business includes the purchase of wholesale cellular telephone service and the rebranding and marketing of that service for retail resale to the public. Appellants, Ameritech Mobile Communications, Inc., and Cincinnati SMSA Limited Partnership (collectively, \u201cAmeritech\u201d), AirTouch Cellular Eastern Region, L.L.C., and Verizon Wireless, a.k.a. New Par (collectively, \u201cVerizon\u201d), provide wholesale and retail cellular telephone service.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 3} In December 2003, Discount Cellular filed a complaint against Ameritech in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Six weeks later, in February 2004, Cleveland Mobile filed a complaint against Verizon, Ameritech, and Air-Touch Cellular Eastern Region, L.L.C., in the same court. In both actions, the appellees sought treble damages under R.C. 4905.61, which provides: \u201cIf any public utility or railroad does, or causes to be done, any act or thing prohibited by Chapters 4901., 4903., 4905., 4907., 4909., 4921., 4923., and 4925. of the Revised Code, or declared to be unlawful, or omits to do any act or thing required by such chapters, or by order of the public utilities commission, such public utility or railroad is liable to the person, firm, or corporation injured thereby in treble the amount of damages sustained in consequence of such violation, failure, or omission. Any recovery under this section does not affect a recovery by the state for any penalty provided for in such chapters.\u201d In support of their claims, the appellees relied on an order by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, <em>In re Complaint of Westside Cellular, Inc. v. New Par Cos., </em>PUCO No. 93-1758-RC-CSS, Jan. 18, 2001 <em>(\u201cCellnet </em>\u201d), that had found that Ameritech and Verizon had violated commission orders and portions of R.C. Chapter 4905 by engaging in unlawful discriminatory pricing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In three separate cases, we affirmed the commission\u2019s order but found that the unlawful acts had occurred from 1993 though 1998 rather than from 1995 through 1998, as the commission had found. <em>Westside Cellular, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 165, 2002-Ohio-7119, 781 N.E.2d 199, \u00b6 10; <em>Cincinnati SMSA Ltd. Partnership v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 282, 2002-Ohio-7235, 781 N.E.2d 1012, \u00b6 2; <em>New Par v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 277, 2002-Ohio-7245, 781 N.E.2d 1008, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Ameritech and Verizon moved to dismiss the appellees\u2019 complaints, arguing that the claims are barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.11, which governs actions involving statutes \u201cfor a penalty or forfeiture.\u201d Appellees opposed the motions, arguing that the six-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.07 applies because R.C. 4905.61 is a remedial statute. The court of common pleas granted the motions to dismiss, finding that the statute was penal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 5} The court of appeals reversed. It held that R.C 4905.61 is a remedial statute because the statute is intended to address individual wrongs and refers to \u201cdamages\u201d rather than to a \u201cpenalty\u201d or \u201cforfeiture.\u201d It thus concluded that the six-year statute of limitations applied and that the claims had been dismissed improperly by operation of the one-year statute of limitations. <em>Discount Cellular, Inc. v. Ameritech-Mobile Communications, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 85618, 2005-Ohio-5437, 2005 WL 2589998; <em>Cleveland Mobile Radio Sales, Inc. v. Verizon Wireless, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 85620, 2005-Ohio-5439, 2005 WL 2600635. We accepted discretionary jurisdiction over both cases and sua sponte consolidated them for briefing, argument, and decision. <em>Cleveland Mobile Radio Sales, Inc. v. Verizon Wireless, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1508, 2006-Ohio-1329, 844 N.E.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 4905.61, the treble-damages statute, does not contain a statute of limitations. Accordingly, we turn to R.C. Chapter 2305 to determine the appropriate limitations period. See <em>Cosgrove v. Williamsburg of Cincinnati Mgt. Co., Inc. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 281, 282, 638 N.E.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2305.07 provides: \u201c[A]n action upon * * * a liability created by statute other than a forfeiture or penalty * * * shall be brought within six years after the cause thereof accrued.\u201d In contrast, R.C. 2305.11(A) provides for a one-year statute of limitations for \u201can action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture.\u201d As the court of appeals noted in considering which statute of limitations applies, the salient question is whether R.C. 4905.61 \u201ccreates a statutory liability or whether it is a \u2018statute for a penalty,\u2019 i.e., whether it is a remedial statute or a penalty statu[t]e.\u201d <em>Discount Cellular, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 85618, 2005-Ohio-5437, 2005 WL 2589998, \u00b6 8, citing <em>Cosgrove, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 283, 638 N.E.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">{\u00b6 8} In concluding that the statute was governed by the six-year statute of limitations, the court of appeals relied primarily on our decision in <em>Rosette v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 296, 2005-Ohio-1736, 825 N.E.2d 599. There, we concluded that R.C. 5301.36(C) is a remedial statute and thus subject to the six-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.07. <em>Rosette, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 296, 2005-Ohio-1736, 825 N.E.2d 599, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Our holding in <em>Rosette </em>was based on the plain language of that statute, which provides, \u201c[A] mortgagor may recover, in a civil action, damages of two hundred and fifty dollars\u201d if a mortgagee failed to record the satisfaction of a residential mortgage with the county recorder within ninety days of satisfaction. See R.C. 5301.36(C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, we focused expressly on the clear statutory language and the fact that had the General Assembly intended to do so, it could have used the term \u201cforfeiture\u201d or \u201cpenalty\u201d rather than \u201cdamages\u201d in the statute. <em>Rosette, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 296, 2005-Ohio-1736, 825 N.E.2d 599, \u00b6 13-14. We reasoned that in enacting the statute and choosing the particular words that were codified in it, the legislature intended to provide a remedy to an aggrieved individual mortgagor rather than to impose a penalty upon the wrongdoing mortgagee. We held that to conclude that the General Assembly had intended to create a penalty in R.C. 5301.36(C) rather than to provide for damages, we would be required to ignore the plain term \u201cdamages\u201d in the statutory language and to insert the term \u201cpenalty\u201d or \u201cforfeiture\u201d into the statute. We declined to do so, noting that the legislature has used the latter terms in other statutes and could have used them again if it so intended. <em>Rosette </em>at \u00b6 14, quoting R.C. 1321.56 (\u201c \u2018Any person who willfully violates section 1321.57 of the Revised Code shall <em>forfeit </em>to the borrower the amount of interest paid by the borrower\u2019 \u201d [emphasis added in Rosette]) and R.C. 149.351(B)(2) (\u201c \u2018any person who is aggrieved by the removal, destruction, mutilation, or transfer of * * * a [public] record, may commence * * * [a] civil action to recover a <em>forfeiture </em>in the amount of one thousand dollars for each violation\u2019 \u201d [emphasis added in Rosette]).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">{\u00b6 10} In the instant cases, the court of appeals held that the analysis in <em>Rosette </em>applied \u201cequally\u201d to the analysis here. <em>Discount Cellular, Inc., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 85618, 2005-Ohio-5437, 2005 WL 2589998, \u00b6 14. It concluded that the General Assembly chose the word \u201cdamages\u201d rather than \u201cpenalty\u201d or \u201cforfeiture\u201d to describe the liability to be imposed on a public utility for violation of R.C. Chapter 4905 and that that language \u201cindicates that the statute was not intended to inflict a penalty, but rather, allow an aggrieved party to recover damages.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14-15. It then concluded that R.C. Chapter 4905 was primarily remedial and that the six-year statute of limitations applied. Id. at \u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">{\u00b6 11} In reviewing that decision, we begin with familiar law.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 12} In construing a statute, the reviewing court must ascertain the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. <em>Rosette, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 296, 2005-Ohio-1736, 825 N.E.2d 599, \u00b6 12. To determine the intent of a statute, a court looks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the language of the statute, giving effect to the words used. <em>Rice v. CertainTeed Corp. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 417, 419, 704 N.E.2d 1217. A court is neither to insert words that were not used by the legislature nor to delete words that were used. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">{\u00b6 13} In considering the language of R.C. 4905.61, the court of appeals focused on the term \u201cdamages\u201d without also noting the modifying word \u201ctreble.\u201d R.C. 4905.61 provides that if a public utility violates certain laws, \u201csuch public utility * * * is liable to the person, firm, or corporation injured thereby in treble the amount of damages sustained in consequence of such violation, failure, or omission.\u201d See <em>Rice, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 420, 704 N.E.2d 1217. The court of appeals failed to give due consideration to the meaning of \u201cdamages\u201d as modified by \u201ctreble.\u201d We believe that the court missed an important distinction between the statute at issue here and the one at issue in <em>Rosette.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 14} The statute at issue in <em>Rosette, </em>R.C. 5301.36(C), expressly provided for \u201cdamages of two hundred fifty dollars.\u201d Consequently, that damages provision is more akin to stipulated or liquidated damages than to punitive damages. See <em>Lake Ridge Academy v. Carney </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 376, 382, 613 N.E.2d 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 15} Unlike R.C. 5301.36(C), R.C. 4905.61 contains a treble-damages provision. That fact alone is not dispositive, however, see <em>Rice, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 421, 704 N.E.2d 1217, and <em>Cosgrove, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 289, 638 N.E.2d 991, particularly given that the statute\u2019s treble-damages provision has a compensatory side that serves remedial purposes as well as \u201cpunitive objectives.\u201d <em>Cook Cty. v. United States ex rel. Chandler </em>(2003), 538 U.S. 119, 130, 123 S.Ct. 1239, 155 L.Ed.2d 247. See, also, <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc. </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 614, 635-636, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444, citing <em>Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc. </em>(1977), 429 U.S. 477, 485-486, 97 S.Ct. 690, 50 L.Ed.2d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 16} In undertaking the inquiry into whether the statute is remedial or punitive, it is not possible to determine the precise \u201ctipping point between payback and punishment.\u201d <em>Cook Cty., </em>538 U.S. at 130, 123 S.Ct. 1239, 155 L.Ed.2d 247. Rather, we are guided by the particular statute at issue in the litigation and its context. Id.; see, also, <em>Rice, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 421, 704 N.E.2d 1217. Furthermore, we must determine whether the primary purpose of the statute is to penalize or to remedy and compensate. <em>Cosgrove, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 288, 638 N.E.2d 991, citing <em>Porter v. Household Fin. Corp. of Columbus </em>(S.D.Ohio 1974), 385 F.Supp. 336, 342. In making that determination, we must not focus solely on the statute\u2019s ultimate goals or effect. Instead, we look to the methods used by the General Assembly to accomplish the goals and overall purpose of the statutory scheme. <em>Rice, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 419-420, 704 N.E.2d 1217; <em>Cosgrove, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 284, 288, 638 N.E.2d 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>{\u00b6 17} R.C. Title 49 reflects a comprehensive statutory regime that governs the business activities of public utilities. In addressing the nature of R.C. 4905.61, however, we note that it differs from R.C. Chapter 4112, which governs the practice of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission and through which an aggrieved may seek redress through a variety of remedies. See, e.g., <em>Cosgrove, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 288-289, 638 N.E.2d 991 (Resnick, J., concurring). R.C. 4905.61 is more narrowly tailored, and like other sections in the statutes that constitute R.C. Title 49, it compels public utilities to comply with the regulatory rubric through the imposition of penalties or forfeitures. See, e.g., R.C. 4905.54 (imposing a fine of up to $10,000 for a statutory violation or noncompliance with a commission order) and 4905.57 and 4905.59 (governing actions for forfeitures). These provisions do not offer a mechanism for consumers to pursue relief against utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">{\u00b6 18} Moreover, R.C. 4905.61 is very specific. It appears to be the only mechanism through which the legislature permits an injured party to obtain damages after liability is found by the commission. The statute thus furthers the legislature\u2019s goal of ensuring compliance with the statutes governing public utilities and with commission orders. And notably for our purposes, in so doing, the statute does not simply compensate an injured party with an award for actual damages but, rather, incorporates a treble-damage-award provision <em>and </em>provides that any recovery by a private plaintiff pursuant to it does not preclude the state from seeking additional penalties under R.C. 4905.99. Thus, the statute was designed to augment enforcement of the law and to deter violations through penalties rather than to simply compensate consumers for violations. See <em>Lahke v. Cincinnati Bell, Inc. </em>(1981), 1 Ohio App.3d 114, 117, 1 OBR 420, 439 N.E.2d 928 (\u201cwe conceive that the provision for private recovery of treble damages for statutory violations * * * aids in [the] enforcement [of commission orders] by furnishing another incentive for the utility company to operate in accordance with [the commission\u2019s] dictates\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 19} Based on these and other factors, we conclude that the statute was intended to penalize public utilities for failing to comply with their statutory obligations. That conclusion is in accord with the decision of the only other court of appeals to consider the issue presented herein, <em>Usternal v. Gem Boat Serv., Inc., </em>Ottawa App. No. 91-OT-051, 1992 WL 337600, *3. Other Ohio courts have concluded that the treble-damages provision in this statute was designed to deter utilities from ignoring the commission\u2019s authority and the requirements set forth in R.C. Title 49. See <em>Lahke, </em>1 Ohio App.3d at 117, 1 OBR 420, 439 N.E.2d 928; <em>Fed. Res. Bank of Cleveland v. Purolator Courier Corp. </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 296, 300-302, 13 OBR 362, 469 N.E.2d 542, fn. 5. See, also, <em>French v. Dwiggins </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 32, 35-36, 9 OBR 123, 458 N.E.2d 827 (noting that the mandatory treble-damages provision in R.C. 1345.09(B) was intended by the General Assembly as a penalty for misconduct and as a deterrent).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Because we conclude that the statute was designed to deter public utilities from committing regulatory violations and to punish them for failing to comply with the provisions set forth in R.C. Chapter 49, we also conclude that the legislature\u2019s primary intent in enacting R.C. 4905.61 was to provide \u201ca statute for a penalty.\u201d R.C. 2305.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">{\u00b6 21} Our conclusion is consistent with the nature of this particular statute, which requires, as a prerequisite to filing suit, a prior determination by the Public Utilities Commission that the utility violated a designated public utilities statute or commission order. R.C. 4905.61; <em>Milligan v. Ohio Bell Tel. Co. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 191, 10 O.O.3d 352, 383 N.E.2d 575, paragraph one of the syllabus. Given that the statute requires a prior finding of a violation, a plaintiff in a claim brought pursuant to R.C. 4905.61 need only show causation and damages flowing from the adjudicated violation. No reason exists to allow for the longer (six-year) statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.07. See <em>Liddell v. SCA Servs. of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 6, 10, 635 N.E.2d 1233 (statutes of limitations are designed to ensure fairness to a defendant, to foster prompt prosecution of causes of action, to avoid fraudulent or \u201cstale\u201d claims, and to avoid inconvenience resulting from delay). Accordingly, R.C. 4905.61 is subject to the one-year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2305.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b528-6\">Moyer, C.J., Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b528-7\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">. \u201c[B]efore a Court of Common Pleas has jurisdiction to hear a complaint for treble damages under R.C. 4905.61, there first must be a determination by the commission that a violation has in fact taken place.\u201d <em>Milligan v.

Finally, the majority apparently wants to reverse <em>Rosette v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 296, 2005-Ohio-1736, 825 N.E.2d 599, but won\u2019t because of the unctuous three-part test set forth in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cTreble damages\u201d is not a secret code word. Even though the majority uses the term \u201ctreble damages,\u201d R.C. 4905.61 does not; it uses the approximate equivalent \u201ctreble the amount of damages.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 419 (treble damages are \u201c[d]amages that, by statute, are three times the amount that the fact-finder determines is owed\u201d). There is no mysterious intent behind the General Assembly\u2019s use of \u201ctreble the amount of damages.\u201d I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>assume that the General Assembly intended the term to have its normal and ordinary meaning. I would not, as the majority opinion does, add the word \u201cpenalty\u201d to the definition of \u201ctreble the amount of damages.\u201d Neither would I delete \u201cthe amount of,\u201d as the majority does. To do either violates the most elementary principle of statutory construction, which is to give effect to the words used and not delete words used or insert words not used. <em>Rice v. CertainTeed Corp. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 417, 419, 704 N.E.2d 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 24} Not only does the majority insert words into and delete words from R.C. 4905.61, it also misconstrues the context in which \u201ctreble the amount of damages\u201d is used. The majority opinion correctly states that R.C. Title 49 \u201creflects a comprehensive statutory regime that governs the business activities of public utilities\u201d and \u201ccompels public utilities to comply with the regulatory rubric through the imposition of penalties and forfeitures.\u201d See, e.g., R.C. 4905.54, 4905.57, and 4905.59. As far as the majority and I can tell, there is only one provision in R.C. Title 49 that allows an injured party to obtain damages: R.C. 4905.61. Most people would take the General Assembly\u2019s sole' use of \u201cdamages,\u201d surrounded by a sea of penalties and forfeitures, as proof positive that the General Assembly intended the damages, whether trebled or not, to be damages and not a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 25} The majority is not so intrepid as that. Instead, it points to a separate sentence in R.C. 4905.61, which states, \u201cAny recovery under this section does not affect a recovery by the state for any penalty provided for in such chapters\u201d and concludes that R.C. 4905.61 \u201cwas intended to penalize public utilities for failing to comply with their statutory obligations.\u201d I agree that the penalty provision of R.C. 4905.61 was intended to penalize public utilities, but am not creative enough to conclude that the General Assembly intended the damages provision to do anything other than what damages do: compensate an injured party. Perhaps if I, as the majority opinion does, gratuitously called the penalty provision of R.C. 4905.61 an \u201cadditional\u201d penalty, I could convince myself that damages are penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">{\u00b6 26} I conclude that the General Assembly used the phrase \u201ctreble the amount of damages\u201d not to impose a penalty, but to give injured parties an incentive to pursue cases that would otherwise be too small to justify the expense of legal action. This conclusion is sensible and doesn\u2019t require the legalistic contortions necessary to transform \u201ctreble the amount of damages\u201d into \u201ca penalty equal to three times damages.\u201d This conclusion also allows me to assume that the General Assembly knows the difference between damages and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Rosette, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 296, 2005-Ohio-1736, 825 N.E.2d 599, \u00b6 13-14, this court stated:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A7h\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Tricarichi &amp; Carnes, L.L.C., and Carla M. Tricarichi; and Randy J. Hart and Mark Griffin, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe statutory language is clear: R.C. 5301.36(C) expressly provides that a mortgagor \u2018in a civil action\u2019 may sue for \u2018damages.\u2019 To conclude that R.C. 5301.36(C) creates a penalty, this court would have to delete the term \u2018damages,\u2019 a word used by the legislature, and insert the term \u2018penalty\u2019 or \u2018forfeiture,\u2019 words not chosen by the legislature. Doing so would flout our responsibility to give effect to the words selected by the legislature in enacting a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cClearly, the General Assembly could have used the term \u2018penalty\u2019 or \u2018forfeiture\u2019 if it had intended R.C. 5301.36(C) to create an action for a penalty or forfeiture. Indeed, the legislature has used such penalty/forfeiture language in other statutes. See R.C. 1321.56 (\u2018[a]ny person who willfully violates section 1321.57 of the Revised Code shall <em>forfeit </em>to the borrower the amount of interest paid by the borrower\u2019); see, also, R.C. 149.351(B)(2) (providing that any person aggrieved by the removal, destruction, transfer, or mutilation of a public record may bring a civil action to recover a <em>forfeiture </em>in the amount of one thousand dollars for each violation\u2019). (Emphasis added.) To presume that the legislature meant \u2018penalty\u2019 or \u2018forfeiture\u2019 when it used the term \u2018damages\u2019 is to presume imprecision on the part of the General Assembly. We decline to make such a presumption in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">{\u00b6 30} In short, less than two years ago, a majority of this court said essentially what I have said today. Today, a majority of this court reaches a contrary conclusion, though it does not reverse <em>Rosette. </em>(The liquidated damages of <em>Rosette </em>serve the same purpose as \u201ctreble the amount of damages\u201d in this case: to give injured parties an incentive to pursue cases that would otherwise be too small to justify the expense of legal action.) Blind adherence to the absurd concept that this court cannot review and reverse its own reasoning whenever its prior reasoning is easy to apply, as stated in <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, paragraph one of the syllabus, will result in many opinions being effectively, but not explicitly, overruled. Cases like <em>Rosette </em>will live in limbo, good law for all intents and purposes, but in reality, legal traps ready to ensnare even vigilant attorneys. It doesn\u2019t make sense. If a majority of this court determines that one of its prior decisions should be overruled, it should overrule the prior decision. To do otherwise is to abdicate its role as a court of last resort. Still, I would hope that when this court overrules decisions, it will have better reasons for such action than it does today.
