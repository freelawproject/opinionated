We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">{\u00b6 2} RMS of Ohio, Inc., provides in-home personal-care services to clients who are mentally handicapped or developmentally disabled. The bureau uses a manual of business-classification codes to determine workers\u2019 compensation premiums. The manual is prepared by the National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. (\u201cNCCI\u201d). Prior to July 2000, RMS was classified under manual classification code 8861, which covers \u201cWelfare Social Service Organizations Professional Employees,\u201d and code 9110, which covers \u201cWelfare Social Service Organizations Non-Professional Employees.\u201d A bureau audit of payroll records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>from July 2000 through June 2002 resulted in the reclassification of RMS under code 8835, \u201cNursing-Home Health, Public and Traveling \u2014 all employees.\u201d Code 8835 requires a higher workers\u2019 compensation premium. RMS objected, but the bureau\u2019s Adjudicating Committee upheld the reclassification, noting, among other things, that RMS was not a welfare or charitable organization covered by codes 8861 and 9110.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">{\u00b6 3} That order was affirmed by the bureau\u2019s administrator\u2019s designee.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">{\u00b6 4} RMS filed a mandamus action in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the bureau abused its discretion in reclassifying the nature of its business. RMS conceded that it did not provide services to individuals in a group-home setting and that it was not a charitable or welfare organization, which is what code classifications 8861 and 9110 cover. It acknowledged that its services were instead rendered at the homes of its individual clients, but it argued that location should not be dispositive, since the actual duties, and hence the risks, were similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">{\u00b6 5} The court of appeals was not persuaded. Stressing the long-standing deference afforded the agency in classifying occupations and industries, the court denied the writ. This appeal as of right followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">{\u00b6 6} We have long recognized the challenges involved in establishing premium rates for workers\u2019 compensation coverage and have repeatedly confirmed the deference due the agency in these matters. <em>State ex rel. Reaugh Constr. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1928), 119 Ohio St. 205, 209, 6 Ohio Law Abs. 694, 162 N.E. 800; <em>State ex rel. McHugh v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 143, 149, 23 O.O. 361, 42 N.E.2d 774; <em>State ex rel. Minutemen, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 158, 161, 580 N.E.2d 777; <em>State ex rel. Progressive Sweeping Contrs., Inc. v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 393, 395, 627 N.E.2d 550. Deference is required \u201cin all but the most extraordinary circumstances,\u201d with judicial intervention warranted only when the agency has acted in an \u201carbitrary, capricious or discriminatory\u201d manner. <em>Progressive Sweeping, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 395-396, 627 N.E.2d 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">{\u00b6 7} The rate-making process starts with \u201cclassifying] occupations or industries with respect to their degree of hazard.\u201d R.C. 4123.29(A)(1). The goal is to \u201cassign the one basic classification that best describes the business of the employer within a state.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-08(D). It is an undertaking, however, in which \u201cabsolute precision * * * is often impossible.\u201d <em>Progressive Sweeping, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 395, 627 N.E.2d 550. Accordingly, we are \u201creluctant to find an abuse of discretion merely because the employer\u2019s actual risk does not precisely correspond with the risk classification assigned.\u201d Id. at 396, 627 N.E.2d 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>{\u00b6 8} The bureau\u2019s decision to reclassify RMS\u2019s operations from codes 8861 and 9110 to 8835 is not an abuse of discretion. Codes 8861 and 9110 apply to \u201ccharitable or welfare organizations.\u201d RMS is not a charitable or welfare organization. Moreover, the scope provision of codes 8861 and 9110 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cCodes 8861 and 9110 are applicable to <em>institutions </em>that provide charitable or welfare assistance for clients such as needy persons; mentally, physically or emotionally handicapped persons; abused spouses; and those who may be working off drug- or alcohol-related sentences. Charitable or welfare organizations may offer these individuals sleeping accommodations, meals, counseling, education, training and employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 10} In addition:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe following typify operations of a charitable or welfare nature that are contemplated by Codes 8861 and 9110;</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c1. Homes for youths or physically, mentally or emotionally handicapped clients: House \u2018parents\u2019 or counselors may live with a limited number of clients in a <em>group home. </em>* * * The clients are taught how to live with one another and perform daily living chores such as laundry, housekeeping and meal preparation. The clients may be sent to another location during the day to work, receive occupational and/or scholastic training or receive medical or psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c2. Temporary <em>shelters </em>for abused persons: These homes provide temporary shelter and food for those involved in physically or mentally abusive or antagonistic relationships. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c3. <em>Halfway houses: </em>These operations provide rehabilitation services to those who have recently left institutional life and require a period of readjustment to the outside world.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c4. <em>Rescue missions: </em>These operations may provide food and shelter for transient clients who may only be in need of a hot meal or temporary shelter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">{\u00b6 16} RMS does not operate group homes, temporary shelters, halfway houses, or rescue missions, nor does it service them. In contrast, No. 8835\u2019s scope provision reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cCode 8835 is assigned to both public and privately owned enterprises engaged in furnishing nursing or health care services <em>in the homes of individual patients. </em>The employees rendering such services are mostly registered nurses or licensed practical nurses. Employees of this nature are principally engaged in administering medications and injections, checking vital signs of patients, giving physical therapy treatments, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe assignment of the homemaker service classification, Code 8835, is also applicable to both public and nonprofit-making organizations engaged in providing homemaker services. The services typically provided include preparation of meals, performing light housekeeping chores, providing child care and companionship for the infirm or elderly as well as a degree of nursing services or other physical assistance as needed by these individuals.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 19} RMS provides homemaker services in the homes of individuals. Contrary to RMS\u2019s assertions, the fact that it does not provide nursing or medical services is not dispositive, considering the inclusion of nonmedical home care in classification 8835\u2019s scope language.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 20} RMS insists that the only distinction between codes 8861 and 9110 and code 8835 is the work location \u2014 -private home versus group home. According to RMS, this distinction renders reclassification an abuse of discretion because it is based on location and not on occupational hazard. This analysis, however, assumes that the hazard is the same in both settings, but this is something RMS has not established. The NCCI classifications used by the bureau reflect decades of experience in industrial classification. For the same period of time, this court has reiterated, \u201cThe experience of men, expert in this department of investigation, whose reports are founded upon experience touching the various hazards of industries and occupations should be given important consideration.\u201d <em>Reaugh Constr., </em>119 Ohio St. at 209, 6 Ohio Law Abs. 694, 162 N.E. 800. Legitimate reasons exist, based upon industrial experience, for creating distinct classifications for work performed in a private versus an institutional setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 21} An institutional setting must meet local and/or state safety codes in order to remain open: burned-out lights are promptly replaced, walks are shoveled, and stairs and hallways are debris-free. A group setting reasonably requires that the caregiver has assistance nearby should difficulty arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b6 22} None of these more favorable conditions is guaranteed in a private residence. Thus, there is reasonable justification for classifying group-home services and private-residence services differently and assigning a higher risk to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 23} RMS\u2019s position is not advanced by its claim that others performing similar services remain under codes 8861 and 9110. RMS relies on the testimony of Gary Brown, a certified public accountant. His testimony was accorded little weight by the bureau, and it is within the bureau\u2019s sound discretion to determine how much weight to give to such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">{\u00b6 24} RMS lastly criticizes the bureau for not adequately explaining its decision, as required by <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 204, 567 N.E.2d 245. Upon review, we conclude that the order does minimally satisfy <em>Noll. </em>The order states that RMS is not a charitable or welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>organization, which is what codes 8861 and 9110 encompass. The order, though brief, does provide justification for reclassification. We do not therefore conclude that the order is so defective as to warrant its vacation and return to the bureau for further consideration.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5J\">Gibson Law Office Co., L.P.A., and J. Miles Gibson, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVc\">Marc Dann, Attorney General, and Gerald H. Waterman, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">{\u00b6 25} To prevail in mandamus, RMS must show a clear legal right to inclusion in codes 8861 and 9110, and it does not do so. <em>State ex rel. Pressley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 141, 40 O.O.2d 141, 228 N.E.2d 631, paragraph ten of the syllabus. The bureau\u2019s reclassification was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 26} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-7\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
