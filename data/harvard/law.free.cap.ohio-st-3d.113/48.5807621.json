In March 1999, respondent was appointed acting judge in the East Cleveland Municipal Court. He served in that capacity until January 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">{\u00b6 2} On December 5, 2005, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent with three counts of professional misconduct for violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct and the Code of Professional Responsibility. Respondent answered the complaint with admissions and denials, but later stipulated to most of the charges against him and the underlying facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">{\u00b6 3} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause, and although he had notice of the proceeding, respondent chose not to attend. The panel made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation, all of which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b176-16\">{\u00b6 4} Count I alleges that respondent acted improperly in issuing a contempt order. Count II recounts respondent\u2019s conviction of a misdemeanor drug charge. Count III alleges that respondent grossly exceeded the bounds of professionalism during an argument with opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 5} According to the stipulations, James C. Portis accompanied his nephew on June 24, 2004, to proceedings in respondent\u2019s courtroom. After the proceedings concluded, Portis and the nephew left the courtroom, apparently with instructions to pay assessed fines and costs. Portis learned from a court cashier that an additional $200 fee was due. During their exchange, Portis allegedly said to the cashier that \u201cjudges can be crooks, too.\u201d Portis then left the courthouse to wait outside for his nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 6} Within 15 minutes or so, the court cashier had reported to respondent that Portis had made a remark implicating respondent\u2019s integrity as a member of the judiciary. Respondent instructed police officers to arrest Portis. The officers took Portis into custody and kept him in police lockup for approximately three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 7} Around 3:00 p.m., officers brought Portis back to respondent\u2019s courtroom, where respondent accused him of indirect contempt of court. The transcript documents the following exchanges between respondent and the court cashier and then respondent and Portis:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThis was indirect contempt. I did not hear it. So, that way, we\u2019re going to have to have a hearing on it. I\u2019ll set a bond today. You\u2019ll have to come back for a hearing. But since you\u2019ll be making the charge, I need to hear what you heard so I can determine if that\u2019s contempt or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">{\u00b6 9} The cashier then described the interchange with Portis: \u201cThis gentleman came to the window, said, \u201c \u2018Give me the amount so that I can, uh, pay you all.\u2019 I then said to him, \u2018You\u2019re not paying me, you\u2019re paying the city.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">{\u00b6 10} According to the cashier, Portis then stated, \u201cThe judge is a crook.\u201d At this point, the cashier\u2019s supervisor intervened.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">{\u00b6 11} Portis entered a not guilty plea and stated, \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cWell * * * let me explain it to you. If I had heard it myself, I could have made a determination that it\u2019s contempt, if you say something disrespectful in front of the Court. \u2018The judge\u2019 being \u2018the Court.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c * * * Since you didn\u2019t say it to my face, these witnesses here, they\u2019re the charging witnesses. They are Officers of the Court. They heard you say it. So what I have to do is, I am going to enter a plea of not guilty; you\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t do it. Set it down for trial. Have you post a bond, come back for the trial, you can have your lawyer, you can have witnesses and the like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">{\u00b6 15} Respondent continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201cYou can be represented by counsel. If you can\u2019t afford counsel, we\u2019ll have a public defender to represent you. They will * * * have a hearing, just as if it was a trial. You\u2019ll get a chance to prove whether you\u2019re guilty or not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 17} Portis responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cYour honor, what I\u2019m trying to figure out is thaN-how is that \u2014 how, by me making a statement \u2014 making a statement, not meaning any harm, how am I doing you any harm if\u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">{\u00b6 19} Respondent answered:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful to the judicial process and to the Court at large. If you\u2019re going to stand in the hallway, and there are other citizens there, and you\u2019re going to stand up and say, \u2018The Judge is a crook,\u2019 in front of other people, you have no \u2014 If you have evidence to support that and prove that, you bring it to court with you when we have the trial. That is what is disrespectful. If you have your thoughts, your comments, you want to say them to yourself, you keep them to yourself. But if you are coming to this Court, we have certain rules and procedures that we follow. You breached those by opening your mouth in the way (unintelligible) and saying the terms and statements that you did. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to try to prove against you. You can- \u2014 -you can be sentenced up to a 180 days in jail and $1,000 fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">{\u00b6 21} When Portis again indicated that he didn\u2019t understand why he was arrested, respondent stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cFor what you said when you were at the window. What you said in\u2014 in this young \u2014 young lady\u2019s presence. When you said the Judge was a crook. That\u2019s why you\u2019re standing there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">{\u00b6 23} Portis indicated that he then understood why he was in custody and before respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">{\u00b6 24} Respondent then stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s \u2014 That\u2019s defamation. You shouldn\u2019t go around calling people something that they\u2019re not, unless you can prove it. You can\u2019t defame my character in front of other people and say I\u2019m a crook, unless you can prove it. That\u2019s defamation. You don\u2019t have any right to say those things about me, or anybody.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cNow, if you\u2019re too dense to understand that, maybe your lawyer will be able to explain it to you. Do you understand?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">{\u00b6 27} At the end of the proceeding, Portis pleaded no contest, was fined $500, and was assessed $69 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">{\u00b6 28} Portis later filed a grievance with relator. In responding to relator\u2019s inquiries about the events leading to the Portis contempt citation, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>respondent twice represented that he had actually heard Portis utter the offending \u201cthe judge is a crook\u201d statement. Compounding these false statements, respondent further explained that it was because of this direct contempt that Portis was immediately placed in custody. Also contrary to actual events, respondent on one occasion reported to relator that Portis had pleaded no contest to contempt but had not been fined and had been released on time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">{\u00b6 29} In addition, respondent concedes without explanation that he wrongly advised Portis that Portis had the burden of proving his innocence of the contempt charge. Respondent also had no explanation for why he admonished Portis with the threat \u201cThat\u2019s what we are going to try and prove against you,\u201d impheating his own partiality in the process. Finally, respondent acknowledged that he had insulted Portis by suggesting that he was \u201ctoo dense to understand\u201d the contempt charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">{\u00b6 30} The parties stipulated and the board found that by citing Portis for contempt and misrepresenting the incident to relator, respondent had violated Canon 2 (a judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 3(B)(4) (a judge shall be patient, dignified, and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity); and Canon 4 (a judge shall avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety in all of the judge\u2019s activities); and DR 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">{\u00b6 31} Around December 7, 1999, respondent was indicted for a felony offense of possession of drugs, a violation of R.C. 2925.11. The indictment charged that on April 18,1999, respondent had in his possession five grams or less of cocaine, a Schedule II drug. On January 25, 2000, respondent pleaded guilty to attempted possession of drugs in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2925.11, a first-degree misdemeanor. Respondent was sentenced to three months\u2019 incarceration, all suspended, placed on six months\u2019 probation, and ordered to submit to regular drug testing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">{\u00b6 32} The parties stipulated and the board found that respondent\u2019s illegal conduct and conviction violated Canon 1 (a judge shall uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary), Canon 2, and Canon 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\n<em>Count III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 33} On February 25, 2005, while acting as plaintiffs counsel in a case before Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge John D. Sutula, respondent attended a final pretrial hearing. At some point before, after, or during that proceeding, respondent accused a defense counsel on multiple occasions of being a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d Immediately after the hearing, respondent accosted another defense counsel in the courtroom and in the hallway outside. Loudly and repeatedly, respondent taunted the second defense counsel with invectives, including profanities and racial slurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 34} The parties stipulated and the board found that respondent\u2019s use of profanity to berate opposing counsel during and in the vicinity of court proceedings violated DR 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">{\u00b6 35} In recommending a sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the board weighed the mitigating and aggravating factors of respondent\u2019s case. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">{\u00b6 36} Adopting the panel\u2019s report, the board found that in misrepresenting events leading up to and after the Portis contempt citation, respondent had submitted false statements during the disciplinary process, an aggravating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(f). The board found as a mitigating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(\u00e1) that respondent had no prior disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">{\u00b6 37} Relator argued that respondent\u2019s failure to appear at the hearing constituted another aggravating factor and proposed that respondent receive a two-year suspension, with a conditional stay of six months. The board recommended a one-year suspension, and in doing so, accepted the panel\u2019s recommendation and explanation for that sanction:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe panel was primarily concerned with Count Two of the complaint in which Respondent entered a plea of guilty to \u2018attempted possession of drugs,\u2019 a first degree misdemeanor. That offense was the result of an amendment to an indictment for possession of drugs, \u2018to wit: Cocaine, a Schedule II drug in the amount of five grams or less.\u2019 Since Respondent did not appear at the hearing, or cause any evidence to be submitted on his behalf including any character witnesses, the panel could not formulate any conclusion whether the drug possession was indicative of a major drug problem or an isolated incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe panel recommends that Respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">{\u00b6 40} We agree that respondent violated Canons 1, 2, 3(B)(4), and 4, and DR 1-102(A)(5) and 1-102(A)(6), as found by the board. The recommended sanction, however, is too lenient for respondent\u2019s egregious misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">{\u00b6 41} Contempt power is properly used \u201cto secure the dignity of the courts and the uninterrupted and unimpeded administration of justice.\u201d <em>Windham Bank v. Tomaszczyk </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 55, 56 O.O.2d 31, 271 N.E.2d 815, paragraph two of the syllabus. But here, it is obvious that respondent used this power merely to intimidate and demean Portis. This grave abuse of the contempt power \u201cnot only throws doubts on respondent\u2019s impartiality, but also weakens the public\u2019s perception of the integrity of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Karto </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 109, 114, 760 N.E.2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cIt is of utmost importance that the public have confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Allen </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 494, 495, 684 N.E.2d 31. Indeed, the judicial disciplinary system exists to guarantee \u201cthe evenhanded administration of justice, and maintain and enhance public confidence in the integrity of this institution.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. O\u2019Neill, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 204, 2004-Ohio-4704, 815 N.E.2d 286, \u00b6 33. Because respondent\u2019s abuse of the contempt powers seriously undermined these goals, an equally serious sanction must follow for the public\u2019s protection and as a deterrent to such subversive conduct in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">{\u00b6 43} Moreover, although neither the panel nor the board emphatically denounced respondent\u2019s false accounts of the events underlying the Portis contempt citation, we find these untruths intolerable. Respondent did not offer any reason for these inaccurate explanations, a fact that suggests to us that they were made intentionally to mislead relator, and not by some mistake. Such falsehoods certainly exacerbate the misconduct committed in this case. Accord <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Farmer, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 137, 2006-Ohio-5342, 855 N.E.2d 462, \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">{\u00b6 44} That a lawyer who once served as a member of the judiciary in this state would submit dishonest or misleading information during a disciplinary investigation to cover up his misuse of judicial authority is an affront to our entire legal and disciplinary system. When such conduct is considered in addition to respondent\u2019s drug use, berating of counsel, and use of profanities and racial slurs, a one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>year suspension is simply insufficient for misconduct of this magnitude. Respondent is therefore indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Abo\">Jonathan E.
