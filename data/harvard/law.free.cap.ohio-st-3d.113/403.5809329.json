We conclude that constitutional protections of the Fourth Amendment were not violated by the police action in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">{\u00b6 2} Lacina Batchili was convicted after a jury trial of one count of theft and one count of receiving stolen property. The evidence produced at trial resulted from a traffic stop on the Ohio Turnpike on January 29, 2003. Before trial, Batchili had unsuccessfully moved to dismiss all evidence resulting from the warrantless detention and arrest. Batchili appealed his conviction, arguing in part that the evidence should have been suppressed because it was found during a routine traffic stop that became an unconstitutionally lengthy search and seizure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">{\u00b6 3} Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper Stacey Arnold testified that prior to the stop, she had decided to follow the van that Batchili was driving. After observing Batchili commit a marked-lanes violation, see R.C. 4511.33, she activated her overhead emergency lights to signal Batchili to pull over. He did not do so for two miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">{\u00b6 4} Trooper Arnold observed that Batchili\u2019s van had tinted windows and a cargo hold containing boxes in disarray, which were covered with blankets. She asked for and received Batchili\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration, which indicated that Batchili did not own the vehicle. Batchili gave conflicting answers as to who owned the vehicle, did not make regular eye contact, and had shaking hands. In addition, Trooper Arnold smelled deodorizer in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">{\u00b6 5} Trooper Arnold returned to her cruiser to check the validity of the driver\u2019s license and to determine whether there were any warrants against Batchili. She also called for backup from her partner, Trooper Aejo Romero, whom she asked to conduct a \u201cwalk around with the canine\u201d to detect drugs. Trooper Romero arrived, and the dog immediately alerted on the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Because of the dog\u2019s response, the troopers conducted a warrantless search of the van, in which they found boxes of pirated videotapes and DVDs, but no drugs. Batchili was then arrested and later indicted on one count of theft, one count of receiving stolen property, one count of trademark counterfeiting, one count of money laundering, and one count of forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 7} The Sixth District Court of Appeals agreed with Batchili\u2019s argument that the evidence should have been suppressed. <em>State v. Batchili, </em>6th Dist. No. L-04-1039, 2005-Ohio-6001, 2005 WL 3008917. It held that the state did not present evidence of \u201cspecific and articulable facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity beyond that which prompted the stop.\u201d Id., \u00b6 14. As a result, the court held that the search violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution because \u201c[n]one of those factors [that had concerned the state trooper], <em>when considered alone, </em>would be sufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 8} The legality of the traffic stop is not disputed. The officers\u2019 suppression-hearing testimony that Batchili was pulled over for a marked-lane violation is uncontroverted and served as the lawful basis for the stop. <em>Dayton v. Erickson </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 3, 665 N.E.2d 1091, syllabus. The focus of the inquiry, therefore, is whether there was an illegally prolonged detention of Batchili, given the trooper\u2019s observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 9} The Sixth District\u2019s opinion strays from clearly established precedent in three ways. First, it fails to conduct any analysis as to whether the length of the stop was impermissible before the dog arrived at the scene of the stop. Second, it misapplies the \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion\u201d standard to conclude that the request for the dog was unconstitutional.' Finally, it describes the failure to issue a citation for the marked-lane violation as a troubling factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">{\u00b6 10} The Sixth District found merit in Batchili\u2019s assertion that Trooper Arnold did not have sufficient cause to prolong the traffic stop until another trooper responded with the dog and that Batchili\u2019s continued detention for that purpose constituted an illegal seizure. The essential argument is that the arrival of the canine unit took longer than it should have taken Trooper Arnold to write a traffic citation for a marked-lane violation. However, the Sixth District never analyzed whether the length of the stop prior to the dog\u2019s alert was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">{\u00b6 11} The Fourth Amendment imposes a reasonableness standard upon the exercise of discretion by government officials. <em>Delaware v. Prouse </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 648, 653-654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660. \u201cThus, the permissibility of a particular law enforcement practice is judged by balancing its intrusion on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u201d Id. at 654, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660. To justify a particular intrusion, the officer must demonstrate \u201cspecific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">{\u00b6 12} The facts of this case ax*e almost directly aligned with those of the Twelfth District Court of Appeals case <em>State v. Howard, </em>Preble App. Nos. CA2006-02-002 and CA2006-02-003, 2006-Ohio-5656, 2006 WL 3059799, \u00b6 15, which held, \u201c[W]hen detaining a motorist for a traffic violation, an officer may delay the motorist for a time period sufficient to issue a ticket or a warning. <em>State v. Keathley </em>(1988), 55 Ohio App.3d 130, 131 [562 N.E.2d 932], This measure includes the period of time sufficient to run a computer check on the driver\u2019s license, registration, and vehicle plates. <em>State v. Bolden, </em>Preble App. No. CA2003-03-007, 2004-Ohio-184 [2004 WL 77617], \u00b6 17, citing <em>Delaware v. Prouse </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 648, 659, 99 S.Ct. 1391 [59 L.Ed.2d 660]. \u2018In determining if an officer completed these tasks within a reasonable length of time, the court must evaluate the duration of the stop in light of the totality of the circumstances and consider whether the officer diligently conducted the investigation.\u2019 <em>State v. Carlson </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 585, 598-599 [657 N.E.2d 591], citing <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 521-522 [605 N.E.2d 70], and <em>U.S. v. Sharpe </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 675, 105 S.Ct. 1568 [84 L.Ed.2d 605].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 13} The record establishes that at the time the dog alerted, eight minutes and 56 seconds into the stop, Trooper Arnold was still waiting for the results of the criminal-background check. She further testified that it would take her approximately five to ten minutes to issue a warning, and anywhere from ten to 20 minutes to issue an actual citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 14} There simply is no evidence to suggest that Batchili\u2019s detention for the traffic violation was of sufficient length to make it constitutionally dubious. A traffic stop is not unconstitutionally prolonged when permissible background checks have been diligently undertaken and not yet completed at the time a drug dog alerts on the vehicle. There is no showing that the detention was delayed so that the dog could conduct its search, and therefore, there was no constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">{\u00b6 15} Moreover, assuming the detention <em>was </em>actually prolonged by the request for a dog search, \u201cthe detention of a stopped driver may continue beyond [the normal] time frame when additional facts are encountered that give rise to a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity beyond that which prompted the initial stop. <em>State v. Myers </em>(1990), 63 Ohio App.3d 765, 771 [580 N.E.2d 61]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>State v. Venham </em>[1994], 96 Ohio App.3d [649,] 655 [645 N.E.2d 831].\u201d <em>Howard, </em>2006-Ohio-5656, 2006 WL 3059799, at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 16} It is here that the Sixth District\u2019s reasoning takes a drastic turn from established law. It noted that an extended investigation must be justified by an \u201cobjective manifestation that the person stopped is, \u2018or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Batchili, </em>2005-Ohio-6001, 2005 WL 3008917, \u00b6 11, quoting <em>United States v. Cortez </em>(1981), 449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 17} It failed to note, however, that the \u201creasonable and articulable\u201d standard applied to a prolonged traffic stop encompasses the totality of the circumstances and that a court may not evaluate in isolation each articulated reason for the stop. <em>United States v. Arvizu </em>(2002), 534 U.S. 266, 274, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 18} The Sixth District here did exactly what the United States Supreme Court prohibited in <em>Arvizu-. </em>it substituted its own judgment as to each of the reasons listed supporting Trooper Arnold\u2019s justification for her articulable suspicion and concluded that because each had an innocent explanation, her suspicion was not reasonable. <em>Batchili, </em>2005-Ohio-6001, 2005 WL 3008917, \u00b6 14. The court even concluded, \u201c[N]one of those factors, <em>when considered alone, </em>would be sufficient to support a finding of reasonable suspicion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 19} <em>Terry </em>\u201cprecludes this sort of divide-and-conquer analysis.\u201d <em>Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740. The \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion\u201d analysis is based on the <em>collection </em>of factors, not on the individual factors themselves. Here, Trooper Arnold listed a number of causes for suspicion (failure to stop for two miles, nervous interaction, multiple statements as to who owned the vehicle, tinted windows, cargo compartment in disarray and with blankets covering boxes, and a vehicle smelling of deodorizer), which cumulatively provided a sufficient reason for additional detention for the purposes of a canine walk-around. Therefore, even if the length of the detention had been unreasonable for the sole purpose of issuing the citation, Trooper Arnold was justified in extending the stop for a canine search.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">{\u00b6 20} The Sixth District also noted that it was \u201ctroubled\u201d that Trooper Arnold never cited Batchili for the traffic offense that prompted the stop. <em>Batchili, </em>2005-Ohio-6001, 2005 WL 3008917, \u00b6 15. This observation suffers from logical and legal difficulties. First, Trooper Arnold was interrupted by the dog alert while receiving the criminal-background check. The failure to issue a traffic citation when there is an indication of a potentially far more significant crime is easily excused when more pressing issues are being addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">{\u00b6 21} Further, as two other districts have recognized, the constitutionality of a prolonged traffic stop does not depend on the issuance of a citation. <em>State v. Carlson </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 585, 596-597, 657 N.E.2d 591; <em>Keathley, </em>55 Ohio App.3d at 132, 562 N.E.2d 932. This reasoning is well supported by our prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>holding: \u201cWhere a police officer stops a vehicle based on probable cause that a traffic violation has occurred or was occurring, the stop is not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution * * <em>Dayton v. Erickson, 76 </em>Ohio St.3d 3, 665 N.E.2d 1091, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">{\u00b6 22} There has been no challenge to the probable cause regarding the stop. As discussed above, the canine walk-around was not the product of an unreasonably long detention relating to the ultimate issuance of the citation. Even if the traffic stop had been prolonged, reasonable suspicion under the totality of the circumstances justified the ongoing detention. Therefore, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the matter is remanded for consideration of Batchili\u2019s remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-6\">Moyer, C.J., Walsh, Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b536-7\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b536-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J., would dismiss the cause as having been improvidently accepted.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b536-9\">James E.

A review of the arresting trooper\u2019s testimony suggests that if this was a routine traffic stop, we should all be very afraid.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">{\u00b6 24} Trooper Arnold testified that she was parked at mile marker 53 on the Ohio Turnpike when a van driven by Lacina Batchili passed her. The trooper testified that the van was not in violation of any traffic laws when it passed her and that nothing about the van attracted her attention. For no reason other than \u201c[bjecause I wanted to,\u201d the trooper decided to leave her parked position and drive on the highway to observe traffic. The trooper caught up with the van driven by Batchili as the van approached mile marker 55. Based on her stationary starting position and the van\u2019s speed of approximately 65 miles per hour, the trooper testified she would have had to travel in excess of 100 miles per hour, possibly as fast at 120 miles per hour, to catch up to the van by mile marker 55. When asked whether she often left a stationary starting position and drove that fast to observe traffic when no violation had occurred, the trooper responded: \u201cIt happens quite frequently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>{\u00b6 25} After catching up with the van driven by Batchili, the trooper observed the van \u201cdrift over the dotted center line by approximately the width of the driver\u2019s side tires. * * * The vehicle then drifted back into the driving lane proceeding eastbound.\u201d Drifting across a marked lane on a roadway can be a violation of R.C. 4511.33(A)(1), which states, \u201cA vehicle or trackless trolley shall be driven, as nearly as is practicable, entirely within a single lane or line of traffic and shall not be moved from such lane or line until the driver has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 26} First, there is no indication in the record that the van\u2019s drifting across the center line was unsafe. If there was little or no traffic, the drifting would not have endangered anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 27} Second, it\u2019s a bit ironic that a trooper would drive over 100 miles per hour for no apparent reason, behavior that is surely more unsafe than an inadvertent lane drift, and then pull over a driver for a de minimis violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">{\u00b6 28} Third, imagine if every driver (or even ten percent of them) who drifted across a lane were pulled over. There would be no time for troopers to do anything else. Traffic and commerce would move more slowly, courts would be more crowded, and the residents of this state would not be safer.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">{\u00b6 29} It is inconceivable to me that this court would sanction the trooper\u2019s conduct in this case. The trooper never mentioned a reason for pulling over the van besides the putative violation of R.C. 4511.33. Had the trooper noticed a pattern of erratic lane changes, the traffic stop would have been warranted. Had the trooper articulable reasons to be suspicious of the van or its driver, the traffic stop would have been warranted. I respect Trooper Arnold and her dedication to duty. According to Ohio State Highway Patrol media releases, she has a tremendous record of felony arrests. I suspect that her instincts told her something was amiss, but instincts are not enough to justify a pretextual traffic stop. And given the de minimis nature of the possible violation and the trooper\u2019s failure to cite Batchili for violating R.C. 4511.33,1 am forced to conclude that this traffic stop was a pretext and, therefore, that the traffic stop was unreasonable. Consequently, there is no need to determine whether the length of the detention was unreasonable because the traffic stop itself was unjustified. I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, though for reasons different from those discussed by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>Blue Ash v. Kavanagh, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 67, 2007-Ohio-1103, 862 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 30, this court sanctioned the deployment of a drug-sniffing dog whenever a driver is pulled over and his or her license or registration has expired. In this case, this court sanctions the deployment of a drug-sniffing dog <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>whenever a driver drifts across a marked lane. I wonder what this court will sanction next. I dissent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ax-1\">Julia R. Bates, Lucas County Prosecuting Attorney, and Kevin A.
