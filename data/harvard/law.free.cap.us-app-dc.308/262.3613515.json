We do not address these challenges, however, because we conclude that subsequent congressional action has rendered the dispute moot. Petitioners American Mining Congress and The Fertilizer Institute also challenge the so-called \u201cBevill mixture rule,\u201d promulgated under the same authority, which we vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">RCRA provides a comprehensive scheme for handling solid wastes. As part of this regime, Subchapter III, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6921-6939b (1988 &amp; Supp. IV 1992) (\u201cSubtitle C\u201d), subjects hazardous wastes to stringent eradle-to-grave regulation. The statute defines \u201chazardous waste\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmHS\">a solid waste, or combination of solid wastes, which because of its quantity, concentration, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteristics may\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-15\">(A) cause, or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">(B) pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise managed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6903(5) (1988). Subtitle C also established a two-step process for the identification of hazardous wastes: The EPA would first promulgate criteria for identifying the \u201ccharacteristics\u201d of hazardous waste, \u201ctaking into account toxicity, persistence, and degradability in nature, potential for accumulation in tissue, and other related factors such as flammability, corrosiveness, and other hazardous characteristics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6921(a) (1988). Then, on the basis of those criteria, the EPA would \u201cpromulgate regulations identifying the characteristics of hazardous waste, and listing particular hazardous wastes (within the meaning of section 6903(5) of this title), which shall be subject to the provisions of [Subtitle C].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6921(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">Pursuant to this mandate, the EPA issued proposed rules in 1978. 43 Fed.Reg. 58,946 (1978). In that proposal, the EPA stated that it would identify hazardous wastes on the basis of the following characteristics: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity and toxicity. 43 Fed.Reg. at 58,950, 58,955-57. Wastes displaying any of these characteristics were to be listed, as were wastes that independently satisfied the statutory definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u201chazardous waste\u201d contained in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6903(5). 43 Fed.Reg. at 58,955, col. 2. A listed waste would remain subject to Subtitle C regulation until it was certified to the EPA that the waste was \u201cnon-hazardous according to the results of each characteristic or property tested.\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. at 58,953, col. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The EPA issued its final rule on May 19, 1980,- in which it published a list of some 400 hazardous wastes. 45 Fed.Reg. 33,084, 33,-122-27 (1980). The final rule also promulgated the \u201cmixture\u201d and \u201cderived-from\u201d rules. The mixture rule provided that a solid waste would be treated as hazardous if \u201c[i]t is a mixture of solid waste and one or more [listed] hazardous wastes____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33,119, col. 3. The derived-from rule provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">[a]ny solid waste generated from the treatment, storage, or disposal of a hazardous waste, including any sludge, spill residue, ash, emission control dust or leachate (but not including precipitation run-off) is a hazardous waste.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">45 Fed.Reg. at 33,120, col. 1. Thus a substance that was mixed with a listed hazardous waste or derived from a hazardous waste was to be regulated as a hazardous waste regardless of whether the mixture or derivative actually \u201c[p]ose[d] a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment____\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6903(5). Any mixture or derived-from waste, however, could escape Subtitle C regulation through a \u201cdelisting\u201d process. <em>See </em>45 Fed.Reg. at 33,-116, col. 3 (waste may be delisted if demonstrated that it is non-hazardous \u201cbased on the results of specific tests for each of the hazardous properties for which the waste was listed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">The initial promulgation of the mixture and derived-from rules was challenged on both substantive and procedural grounds. On December 6, 1991, we vacated both rules because the EPA had \u201centirely failed to comply with [the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s] notice-and-eomment requirements____\u201d <em>Shell Oil Co. v. EPA </em>950 F.2d 741, 752 (D.C.Cir.1991). As we disposed of the case on procedural grounds, we did not determine whether the EPA had exceeded its authority under RCRA in issuing the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">On March 3, 1992, the EPA issued an \u201cinterim final rule,\u201d reinstating the vacated mixture and derived-from rules under authority of the APA\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d exception, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(B), which permits the issuance of a rule without notice and prior opportunity for comment on a finding that such are \u201cimpractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\u201d 57 Fed.Reg. 7,628, 7,628-29 (1992). In doing so, the EPA sought to obtain \u201cthe time to sort through more fully the implications of alternative regulatory approaches and understand the scope and effect of current Subtitle C rules.\u201d 57 Fed.Reg. at 7,630, col. 3. The EPA promised to publish options for modifying or replacing the rules by April 28,1992; and it included a provision terminating the interim final rules on April 28, 1993 (\u201csunset provision\u201d). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">The promised revisions were issued on May 20, 1992. These included a \u201cHazardous Waste Identification Rule\u201d (\u201cHWIR\u201d) that would effect \u201cmodifications to the RCRA regulatory framework which will address over-regulatory situations created by the \u2018mixture\u2019 and \u2018derived-from\u2019 rules.\u201d 57 Fed.Reg. 21,-450, 21,452, col. 1 (1992). In the HWIR, the EPA conceded that the mixture and derived-from rules were overinclusive, resulting in a regime where \u201cmillions of tons of mixtures and derived-from residuals that must be managed as hazardous waste [under Subtitle C] because of their history (i.e., what they were mixed with or derived-from) may actually pose quite low hazards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21,451, col. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-16\">Five months later, on October 6, 1992, Congress adopted an amendment to an EPA appropriations bill that reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVA\">EPA shall promulgate revisions to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv) [the mixture rule] and (c)(2)(i) [the derived-from rule] of 40 CFR 261.3, as reissued on March 3, 1992, by October 1, 1994, but any revision to such paragraphs shall not be promulgated or become effective prior to October 1, 1993. Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of 40 CFR 261.3 [the \u201csunset provision\u201d], as reissued on March 3,1992, paragraphs (a)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(i) of such regulations shall not be terminated or withdrawn until revisions are promulgated and become effective in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>accordance with the preceding sentence. The deadline of October 1, 1994 shall be enforceable under section 7002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Pub.L. No. 102-389, 106 Stat. 1571, 1602 (Oct. 6, 1992) (\u201cChafee Amendment\u201d). The EPA contends that this amendment codifies the mixture and derived-from rules, mooting petitioners\u2019 challenges thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Three weeks later, the EPA issued notices announcing its withdrawal of the HWIR proposal and rescission of the sunset provision. 57 Fed.Reg. 49,280, 49,280, col. 1 (1992) (withdrawing HWIR proposal); 57 Fed.Reg. 49,278, 49,278, col. 1 (withdrawing the sunset provision). In both notices, the EPA announced its intent to promulgate revisions to the mixture and derived-from rules within 12 to 24 months. 57 Fed.Reg. at 49,278, col. 2; 57 Fed.Reg. at 49,280, col. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">We are also asked to review the EPA\u2019s treatment of wastes consisting of a mixture of a \u201cBevill waste\u201d and one or more hazardous wastes. Bevill wastes are derived from the extraction, beneficiation, and processing of ores and minerals and are exempted from Subtitle C regulation by virtue of the Bevill Amendment to RCRA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6921(b)(3)(A)(ii) (1988). <em>See generally Horsehead Resource Dev. Co. v. Browner, </em>16 F.3d 1246 (D.C.Cir.1994). In 1989, the EPA promulgated regulations determining which mineral processing wastes qualified as Bevill wastes. At the same time, the agency issued what petitioners refer to as the \u201cBevill mixture rule.\u201d The \u201cBevill mixture rule\u201d had two distinct provisions that are relevant here. One provision described how mixtures of Bevill wastes and characteristic wastes were to be treated, while the other declared that mixtures of Bevill wastes and listed wastes were governed by the Subtitle C mixture rule. 54 Fed.Reg. 36,592, 36,622-23, 36,641 (1989). The Bevill mixture rule was contested in <em>Solite Corp. v. EPA, </em>952 F.2d 473 (D.C.Cir.1991), where we concluded that, because the EPA had assumed the validity of the Subtitle C mixture rule in \u201cextending [it] to the Bevill context,\u201d our decision in <em>Shell Oil </em>vacating and remanding the Subtitle C mixture rule required us to vacate and remand the Bevill mixture rule as well. <em>Id. </em>at 493-94. In the interim final rule, the EPA repromulgated the characteristic waste provision of the Bevill mixture rule as well as the Subtitle C mixture and derived-from rules. 57 Fed.Reg. 7,628-32. Petitioners American Mining Congress and The Fertilizer Institute (\u201cBevill petitioners\u201d) challenge that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">The EPA\u2019s regulations are to be upheld so long as they are not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1988). Therefore, if an agency has acted within its authority and presents a rational basis for its actions, we must affirm. <em>See KCST-TV, Inc. v. FCC, </em>699 F.2d 1185, 1191 (D.C.Cir.1983). Before investigating whether the EPA has met those standards, we must consider its mootness argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-14\">A. Challenge to the Subtitle C Mixture and Derived-from Rules</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">A \u201ccourt is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare, for the government of future cases, principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it.\u201d <em>California v. San Pablo &amp; Tulare R.R. Co., </em>149 U.S. 308, 314, 13 S.Ct. 876, 878, 37 L.Ed. 747 (1893). In enacting the Chafee Amendment, Congress mandated that \u201cparagraphs (a)(2)(iv) [the mixture rule] and (c)(2)(i) [the derived-from rule] shall not be terminated or withdrawn until revisions are promulgated and become effective.\u201d Pub.L. No. 102-389, 106 Stat. at 1603. Thus, we must examine whether Congress has rendered the case moot by precluding us from granting petitioners the relief they seek \u2014 an order vacating the interim rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">Petitioners argue that we may disregard the Chafee Amendment because it speaks only to the agency, not to the courts. The relevant language of the statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqi\">EPA shall promulgate revisions to [the Subtitle C mixture and derived-from rules] as reissued on March 3, 1992, by October 1, 1994, but any revisions to such paragraphs shall not be promulgated or be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>come effective prior to October 1, 1993. Notwithstanding [the \u201csunset provision\u201d], as reissued on March 3, 1992, [the mixture and derived-from rules] <em>shall not be terminated or withdrawn </em>until revisions are promulgated and become effective in accordance with the preceding sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">106 Stat. at 1602-03 (emphasis added). The key phrase is \u201cterminated or withdrawn.\u201d Petitioners contend that courts do not \u201cterminate\u201d or \u201cwithdraw\u201d regulations, they only \u201creview\u201d and \u201cvacate\u201d them. Under this interpretation, the \u201cterminated or withdrawn\u201d phrase speaks only to the agency; and its sole effect is to override the sunset provision and require the EPA to promulgate revisions to the Subtitle C mixture and derived-from rules by October 1, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We believe that the Chafee Amendment does more than that. We read its language as binding us as well as the agency. By precluding termination of the regulations, Congress expressed a firm intent that the two rules remain in effect until October 1, 1994, when they will be replaced by new rules that the EPA is to issue by that date. That purpose would be frustrated if courts remained free to vacate the interim final rule before the new rules came into effect, thereby creating the regulatory gap the Chafee Amendment was enacted to prevent. <em>Cf. Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Soc\u2019y, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 112 S.Ct. 1407, 1414, 118 L.Ed.2d 73 (1992) (rejecting argument that Congress in an appropriations act spoke only to the agency: \u201cA statutory directive binds <em>both </em>the executive officials who administer the statute <em>and </em>the judges who apply it in particular cases\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Because we are precluded from offering petitioners the relief they seek, their challenge to these rules is moot. <em>Nevada v. Watkins, </em>943 F.2d 1080, 1083-87 (9th Cir.1991) (state challenge of Secretary of Energy\u2019s decision to examine the possibility of situating a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain mooted by congressional action requiring the Secretary to conduct further investigations only at Yucca Mountain and eliminating his authority to consider other potential sites).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">We turn, then, to the Bevill petitioners\u2019 challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">B. Challenges to EPA Treatment of Mixtures of Bevill and Hazardous Wastes</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">The EPA addressed the problems arising out of the Bevill Amendment in a final rule issued on September 1,1989. 54 Fed.Reg. at 36,592. It dealt with Bevill/characteristic waste mixtures by revising the definition of hazardous waste in section 261.3 of its regulations. As revised and subsequently reissued, the definition distinguishes between two kinds of Bevill/characteristic waste mixtures. The first deals with a Bevill waste that is mixed with a waste that \u201cexhibits any of the characteristics of hazardous waste.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 261.3(a)(2)(i). The resulting mixture will be subject to Subtitle C regulation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ2\">if it exhibits a characteristic that would not have been exhibited by the excluded [e.g., Bevill] waste alone if such mixture had not occurred or if it continues to exhibit any of the characteristics exhibited by the non-excluded wastes prior to mixture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.3(a)(2)\u00ae. The second deals with a Bevill waste that is mixed with a listed waste that is listed \u201csolely because it exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste.\u201d This mixtee will be subject to Subtitle C regulation unless \u201cthe resultant mixture no longer exhibits any characteristic of hazardous waste ... for which the hazardous waste ... was listed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 261.-3(a)(2)(iii). With regard to mixtures of Bevill and listed wastes, the EPA concluded that it would stand by the position it had taken in its April 17, 1989, notice of proposed rule-making; namely, that they would be governed by the Subtitle C mixture rules. 54 Fed.Reg. at 36,623.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">These provisions, which deal, respectively, with Bevil/characteristic waste and Bevill/listed waste mixtures, together constitute the \u201cBevill mixture rule\u201d that we vacated in <em>Solite, </em>952 F.2d at 493-94, and that the EPA reissued in the interim final rule. The Bevill petitioners object to its reissuance on both procedural and substantive grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">In <em>Solite, </em>we vacated the Bevill mixture rule on the ground that it assumed the validity of the Subtitle C mixture rule, which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>had vacated in <em>Shell Oil. </em>stated that In doing so, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-3\">[i]f the EPA desires to and successfully does repromulgate the Subtitle C rule, it will similarly be able to repromulgate the Bevill rule, and attempt to justify the latter by reference to the former. Alternatively, the Agency may wish to justify the Bevill rule on independent grounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><em>Solite, </em>952 F.2d at 493-94. In its interim final rule, the agency justified its reinstatement of the Bevill mixture rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV1\">The <em>[Solite </em>] court\u2019s opinion did not explicitly address the status of EPA\u2019s rule change regarding the application of the hazardous waste characteristics to mixtures of Bevill-exempt wastes. The court in <em>Shell Oil </em>vacated the \u201cmixture rule\u201d of 40 CFR \u00a7 261.3(a)(2)(iv), which addresses mixtures of listed wastes and other solid wastes. Thus, to the extent that the <em>Solite </em>court addressed mixtures involving listed and Bevill wastes, today\u2019s actions will reinstate the affected rules. <em>However, since the </em>Shell Oil <em>court did not address mixtures of characteristic and Bevill wastes, that part of the decision by the </em>Solite <em>court appears to be in error.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">57 Fed.Reg. at 7,631 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Bevill petitioners contest what they describe as the \u201csummary repromulgation\u201d of the Bevill mixture rule on two procedural grounds: First, they assert that the rule was issued without the prior notice and opportunity for comment and without the reasoned explanation required by the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b) &amp; (c); and second, they maintain that the EPA did not demonstrate that it had good cause to dispense with prior notice and comment, as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(B). We consider this argument as it applies to each provision of the Bevill mixture rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">1. <em>The Bevill/Characteristic Waste Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The Bevill petitioners acknowledge that the EPA had provided notice and secured comment before the initial issuance of the Bevill/characteristie waste provision in 1989. They assert, nevertheless, that intervening events required a fresh opportunity for comment. The EPA responds, in its brief, that it was not required to reopen notice and comment proceedings because the comments received in response to its April 17, 1989, notice of proposed rulemaking remain fresh and relevant enough to satisfy the requirements of the APA. The agency maintains, further, that because it had fully explained its reasons for promulgating this provision at the time of its original issuance, there was no need for it to reiterate them in the interim final rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">We agree with petitioners that the EPA\u2019s repromulgation of the Bevill/charaeteristic waste provision was procedurally flawed. In <em>Action on Smoking and Health v. CAB, </em>699 F.2d 1209 (D.C.Cir.1983), we vacated a Civil Aeronautics Board regulation that rescinded three earlier rules because the agency had failed to provide an adequate statement of its action\u2019s \u201cbasis and purpose,\u201d as required by the APA. <em>Id. </em>at 1217-19. When the CAB repromulgated the regulation without satisfying APA rulemaking requirements, we again vacated the rule. <em>Action on Smoking and Health v. CAB, </em>713 F.2d 795 (D.C.Cir.1983) <em>(\u201cASH\u201d). </em>In doing so, we reminded the agency that \u201c[t]o \u2018vacate,\u2019 ... means to \u2018annul; to cancel or rescind; to declare, to make, or to render, void; to defeat; ... to set aside,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 797, and that if it wished to rescind the three earlier rules, it would have to do so through a new rulemaking. <em>Id. </em>at 798. In <em>Solite, </em>we vacated the original Bevill mixture rule. Accordingly, to repromulgate the rule, the EPA must comply with the applicable provisions of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">This does not necessarily require the EPA to \u201cstart from scratch\u201d and initiate new notice and comment proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 800. The APA\u2019s good cause exception may be invoked on a finding \u201cthat notice and public procedure thereon are ... unnecessary.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(B) (1988). If the original record is still fresh, a new round of notice and comment might be unnecessary. Such a finding, however, must be made by the agency and supported in the record; it is not self-evident. \u201cAlthough the Administrative Procedure Act does not establish a \u2018useful life\u2019 for a notice and comment record, clearly the life of such a record is not infinite.\u201d <em>ASH, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>713 F.2d at 800. New information relevant to the agency\u2019s decisionmaking might well have come to light after the original notice and comment proceedings and before the repromulgation of the rule. Because the EPA neither initiated a new rulemaking nor invoked the APA\u2019s good cause exception in the record, we again vacate the Bevill/characteristic waste provision of the Bevill mixture rule and do not reach petitioners\u2019 substantive objections to the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">2. <em>Bevill/Listed Wastes Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The EPA maintains that the Bevill/listed wastes provision, which applies the Subtitle C mixture rule to mixtures of Bevill and listed wastes, is nothing more than an interpretation of that rule and is therefore exempt from the APA\u2019s requirements. We agree that in construing the mixture rule to encompass such wastes, the EPA did not \u201ccreate law\u201d; rather, it made a \u201cstatement ] as to what [it] thinks the ... regulation means.\u201d <em>Gibson Wine Co., Inc. v. Snyder, </em>194 F.2d 329, 331 (D.C.Cir.1952); <em>Cabais v. Egger, </em>690 F.2d 234, 238 (D.C.Cir.1982) (same). Such interpretations are not subject to the APA\u2019s notice and hearing requirements. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(A). Because the interpretation preceded the adoption of the Chafee Amendment, it was effectively enacted into law as part of the Subtitle C mixture rule. <em>See Public Citizen, Inc. v. FAA, </em>988 F.2d 186, 194 (D.C.Cir.1993) (\u201cCongress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it reenacts a statute without change.\u201d). Therefore, the Bevill petitioners\u2019 challenge to this provision of the Bevill mixture rule is moot for the same reason as is their challenge to the Subtitle C mixture and derived-from rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We hold that petitioners\u2019 challenges to the Subtitle C mixture and derived-from rules, including the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the former to apply to mixtures of Bevill and listed wastes, are moot because the Chafee Amendment has enacted those rules as so interpreted into law. We vacate the provision of the Bevill mixture rule concerning Bevill/eharacteristie waste mixtures because the provision was reissued without compliance with the rulemaking requirements of the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
