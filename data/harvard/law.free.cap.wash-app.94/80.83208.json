Karpenski appeals his convictions for first degree rape of a child and first degree child molestation. Holding that a child witness was incompetent to testify at trial and that hearsay was erroneously admitted, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Z was born on June 9, 1989. His mother, MM, was single and employed. As a result, her parents, Z\u2019s maternal grandparents, have been heavily involved in raising him.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">At all times relevant here, Z told imaginary stories containing vivid detail. He falsely claimed, for example, that he had spoken with his deceased uncle, that his mother had won $10,000, and that he had gone skydiving. In the skydiving story, \u201che even had the colors of the parachute.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to his mother, he sometimes went \u201cfor months believing his stories.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3According to his grandmother,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-11\">. . . [H]e always exaggerates. He always insists\u2014that\u2019s a normal thing for him. \u2014Much more so than I would think most kids. I was a day care director for five years and I\u2019ve been around children ages one to six, and I never encountered\u2014I mean, kids tell stories, but you usually know\u2014you can usually tell them that\u2019s not real and they\u2019ll accept that. Z does not accept it.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">In May 1992, Z\u2019s mother began dating Karpenski. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>1993, she became pregnant with Karpenski\u2019s child. In April 1994, she gave birth to Matthew, Z\u2019s half brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In June 1994, MM, Z and Matthew moved into Karpenski\u2019s house. Z slept in a sleeping bag on the living room couch \u201cfor like . . . two nights,\u201d until his and Matthew\u2019s bedroom was ready for occupancy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In July 1995, an Oregon family with twin six-year-old sons was visiting for a week in Karpenski\u2019s neighborhood. Z and the twins played together each day. One afternoon, the twins\u2019 mother told her husband, the twins\u2019 father, that the twins and Z were playing in the bushes with their pants down. The record does not show what, if anything, the mother actually saw the three boys doing; she never testified, and the twins\u2019 father, who did testify, did not know whether his wife had actually seen what she was describing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">In any event, the father reacted by calling the twins inside and asking what they were doing. The twins said that Z was showing them \u201chow to put his pee-pee in their bottom.\u201d Understandably disturbed, the father \u201ccaught Z, he was walking by or something,\u201d and asked \u201cwho showed him how to put his pee-pee in a bottom.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At first, Z said \u201cit didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Then, Z said \u201che learned it from [the twins].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The father retorted, \u201cMy boys could not have shown you because they don\u2019t know\u201d about such things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>and asked again, \u201cHow did you learn it?\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At that point Z finally said, \u201cWell, my mom\u2019s boyfriend spends the night at my mom\u2019s house. I sleep in the living room in my sleeping bag, and he comes in the middle of the night and tears my clothes off.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The twins\u2019 parents did not pursue the matter with any of the boys. They did, however, write a letter to Z\u2019s mother, whom they had not met. Then they returned to Oregon with their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">When Z\u2019s mother received the twins\u2019 parents\u2019 letter, she asked Z \u201cif this was true and he said no.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She \u201ccouldn\u2019t go talk to . . . the lady that wrote [the letter], because they were gone . . . back to Oregon where they lived.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She asked R, a neighbor whose daughter often played with Z, whether R knew of any sex play between the children. R did not, but R had heard Z say he did not want to go home \u201cbecause Tom was there.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Apparently linking the letter to what she had heard Z say, R \u201casked [MM] to take [Z] to the hospital and to get him out of [Karpenski\u2019s] house.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> MM chose not to comply, so R called Z\u2019s maternal grandmother and Child Protective Services (CPS).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The grandmother reacted to R\u2019s call by speaking with Z. According to her later testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">A: ... [R] told me that supposedly [Z] had talked to a man neighbor, the father of the twins, about Tom abusing him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">A: . . . Z told me, no, he didn\u2019t talk to a man, he talked to their mommy. And I said, \u201cDid you see a man?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Q: And did he say what he told the mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">A: He told the mother that the little boys wanted him, the twins, wanted him to play go to the kissing fort and play pee-pee in the butt. And I . . . asked him at that time, \u201cDid you do that?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, I went and talked to their mommy.\u201d And then . . . his mother called him home.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">CPS reacted to R\u2019s call by requiring MM to remove Z from Karpenski\u2019s house. Thus, on or about July 28, 1995, MM, Z, and Matthew moved to MM\u2019s parents\u2019 house. CPS also required MM to take Z to mental health counseling, which apparently lasted for a few weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In September 1995, Z started the first grade. \u201c[W]hen his teacher asked him what he did over summer vacation,\u201d he said, according to his mother, that he and his little brother \u201cwent to Hawaii, and the warm water was splashing on his legs and.they were . . . eating pineapple, and the trees were whispering in the wind and it was so warm . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> According to his grandmother,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">He told us ... , and he relayed this to his teacher also, that he had been to Hawaii, very vividly that he\u2019d been to Hawaii, down to the fact that he described the feel of the water on his feet, the smell, the plane trip. He\u2019s never been in a plane. And it was very hard to convince him that he didn\u2019t do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">There ha[ve] been times when we\u2019ve been in the car riding somewhere and he\u2019ll insist that he\u2019s done something, he\u2019s either been in a plane or he\u2019s jumped off a cliff or whatever, and we\u2019ve had to tell him, no, you didn\u2019t do that, and he gets very angry and says yes, he did, that he\u2019s done it and we just don\u2019t remember it.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>:i</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">When the first grade teacher learned that Z had not actually been to Hawaii, she referred him to the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>psychologist, who in turn referred him to mental health counseling. The counseling apparently lasted until spring.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">On November 14, 1995, Z\u2019s mother and maternal grandfather took him to the county courthouse for an interview with a child interviewer employed by the Pierce County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. As they left the grandparents\u2019 house, Z\u2019s mother told him, according to her, \u201cthat somebody was going to be asking him questions about Tom,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and \u201che had to tell them the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">Upon arriving at the courthouse, the mother and grandfather spent 15 minutes in conference with the child interviewer while Z played in a separate room. At the end of that time, the interviewer directed the mother and grandfather to wait outside while she interviewed Z. During the conference, according to the child interviewer, both the mother and grandfather made it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-6\">very clear . . . that to them these allegations were not true, and the information that they provided me was kind of a background about how some neighbors had come up to [Z\u2019s mother] and indicated that . . . her boyfriend at the time was a child molester.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The interviewer spoke with Z for about 35 minutes. No one else was present. She did not tape the interview, or seek consent to tape it, in accordance with a policy of her office.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> She took notes that she destroyed after typing a report, again in accordance with a policy of her office.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Near the beginning of the interview, the interviewer asked three simple questions designed to show whether Z understood the difference between the truth and a lie. The first was whether she would be telling the truth or lying if she were to claim that she was a boy. The second was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>whether she would be telling the truth or lying if she told Z his hair was on fire. The third was whether a truth or a lie was better. Z\u2019s responses are not in the record, but we assume he answered appropriately.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">After these preliminaries, the interviewer began to explore whether Z had been sexually abused. Her questions and Z\u2019s answers were as follows: (1) The interviewer asked \u201cif anything had ever made [Z] feel uncomfortable.\u201d Z said, \u201cOne time when I was in my bed in my sleeping bag at home, I got my [bottom] wet and Tom came in and wiped my [bottom].\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Z explained, in child\u2019s terms, that he had defecated, neglected to clean his anus, and awakened while Karpenski \u201cwas wiping him with toilet paper underneath his clothing.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (2) The interviewer did not consider this \u201csomething sexual in nature,\u201d so she \u201cpress[ed] Z further\u201d by asking \u201cif Tom had ever done anything to make him feel unsafe.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Z answered, \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (3) The interviewer \u201cexplained to Z that someone thought something might have happened to make him feel unsafe,\u201d and \u201casked if they got that right or if they got that mixed up.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Z responded, \u201cWhat were they talking about?\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (4) The interviewer \u201ctold [Z] that I meant anything that made him feel unsafe,\u201d and Z said, \u201cI can\u2019t remember it all because my mom only told me that one thing.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> (5) The interviewer \u201casked if his mom told him about what happened with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Tom,\u201d and Z said, \u201cYes, [when we] were about to go.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Clarifying, the interviewer asked if Z was talking about \u201ctoday, meaning the day of the interview,\u201d and Z said, \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (6) The interviewer asked if Z \u201chad said he couldn\u2019t remember all of the things that happened with Tom,\u201d and Z replied, \u201cNo, he can\u2019t remember all of them.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> (7) The interviewer asked if Z would tell her \u201cabout one thing,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and Z said, \u201cOnly that just one thing,\u201d adding, \u201cI can\u2019t remember all of them.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (8) The interviewer \u201ctold Z that someone thought he told them about some other things that happened with Tom,\u201d and \u201casked if they got that right or if they were mixed up.\u201d Z said, \u201cRight.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> (9) The interviewer asked \u201cwhat else Tom did.\u201d Z said, \u201cThat\u2019s an \u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> (io) The interviewer \u201casked Z if he told anyone else about things Tom did,\u201d and Z said, \u201cNo.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> (11) The interviewer \u201ctold Z that someone thought he told them about some things that happened with Tom without th\u00e9 toilet paper,\u201d and \u201casked if they got that right or if they were mixed up.\u201d Z said, \u201cYes.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (12) The interviewer \u201casked Z what else Tom did,\u201d and Z said, \u201cOne thing. He took his private area and put it in my butt. He made me upset. That\u2019s one thing he did.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Immediately following this twelfth response, the interviewer began to question about when and how the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>abuse had occurred. She started \u201cby trying to ascertain\u201d if \u201cthe toilet paper incident . . . was on the same day or a different day.\u201d Z \u201csaid [the abuse] was after Tom had flushed the toilet paper.\u201d He \u201cwent on to describe that he was in the living room still and that Tom was sitting in a chair and that he apparently was laying down and he put his private in his butt.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> When the interviewer \u201casked [Z] to explain how that happened,\u201d Z \u201cdemonstrated by getting down and laying, moving forward off the chair and putting both hands on either side of Z and basically laying over him.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Z said \u201cthat Tom was wearing a robe at that time, and that his [Tom\u2019s] private went up inside his [Z\u2019s] body and it stayed still.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> When the interviewer asked \u201cwhether this had happened on one occasion or more than once,\u201d Z said, \u201cOne time.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> When the interviewer sought to establish a \u201ckind of a general time frame,\u201d however, Z</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">indicated that it had happened more than one time. He described that it had happened when he was in first grade and before first grade. And he said that he was five when it happened. He also\u2014when I asked him if anything happened in kindergarten, he said no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">Q: Was he indicating to you that it had happened more than one time or just one time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">A: He said one time. His answer would always\u2014usually would say more than one thing like first grade and before first grade, and the impression was more than one, but when I asked him he said one time.[<footnotemark>44</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Inexplicably, Z also said the abuse had occurred, \u201cTonight after school.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Attempting to obtain more details, the interviewer asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>whether Karpenski had used his \u201cprivate\u201d to touch any part of Z other than his \u201cbutt,\u201d and Z \u201cnever said anything about having Tom\u2019s private touch his private.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The interviewer asked whether Karpenski \u201cever touched [Z] with anything besides his private,\u201d and Z said no,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Karpenski had kept his hands at his sides.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Lastly, the interviewer asked whether Karpenski\u2019s \u201cprivate was hard like a stick\u201d or \u201csoft like a worm,\u201d and Z said, \u201cHard, kind of medium.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Because the interview was not videotaped, the record does not actually depict Z\u2019s nonverbal manifestations. According to the interviewer\u2019s oral testimony, Z\u2019s \u201cbody language\u201d changed \u201cduring the time that he was talking about the event with Tom.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> \u201c[H]e stopped coloring\u201d and \u201che was very near tears most of that portion of the interview . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> \u201c[H]e never started crying, but he spoke very softly.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Near the end, he \u201ckind of said that he had found the solution,\u201d which was \u201cmov[ing] to his grandparents\u2019 so it couldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AS3\">After the interview, MM, Z, and Z\u2019s grandfather returned to the grandparents\u2019 house. According to the grandmother, Z</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">didn\u2019t say anything when he came home, but at night when I put him to bed I always read to him. And after we read our story, ... he said, \u201cDo you want to know what they asked me today?\u201d And I said, \u201cNo.\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, they said Tom hurt me.\u201d I said, \u201cDid Tom ever hurt you? Has he ever been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>mean to you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, what happened?\u201d \u201cWell, he touched me and then he put pepper in my ear.\u201d And I said, \u201cPepper in your ear?\u201d And he said, \u201cYeah, red pepper in my ear.\u201d And I looked at him and just kind of, okay, and dropped it. And that was all that was said.[<footnotemark>54</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">On November 22, 1995, MM took Z to a sexual assault center for physical examination. The doctor spoke with Z alone, after asking MM to wait outside. When the doctor asked Z if anyone had ever touched him or made him feel uncomfortable, Z shook his head yes, then said \u201cTom.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> When the doctor asked what Tom had done to Z, Z said, \u201cHe touched me.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> When the doctor asked when Tom had touched him, Z said, \u201cA long time ago.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> When the doctor asked if Z was feeling safe now, he shook his head yes and said, \u201cYes, I\u2019m at grandma\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> When the doctor asked whether Tom had touched him one time or more than one time, Z said one time.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> When the doctor asked where Tom had touched him, Z pointed to his bottom.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> When the doctor asked how the touching had felt, Z said it felt \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> When the doctor asked whether it had hurt, Z again said it \u201cwas uncomfortable.\u201d When the doctor asked if Tom had touched him on his skin or on his clothes, Z said, \u201cOn my skin.\u201d When the doctor asked if the touching had occurred on the outside of his body or the inside, Z said inside.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> When the doctor asked if Z knew what had touched him, he said he couldn\u2019t tell. When the doctor asked whether anyone else had ever touched him or made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>him feel uncomfortable, Z said no. Overall, the doctor perceived Z to be saying \u201cthat the touching had happened on his bottom, on his skin, and that he didn\u2019t know what it was that had done the touching.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The doctor had MM return to the room for the physical portion of the examination. The doctor concluded that Z\u2019s anus and genitals were normal, and that \u201c[i]t was actually a pretty normal exam.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> She testified at trial, however, that a normal physical examination is \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with anal intercourse, and that \u201ceven after anal intercourse, there are very few findings.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In late November or early December 1995, MM and Matthew moved back to Karpenski\u2019s house. Z continued to five with his maternal grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">On January 18, 1996, the State charged Karpenski with one count of first degree rape of a child in violation of RCW 9A.44.073.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Around April 1996, at the suggestion of Z\u2019s mental health counselor, MM began \u201creality checking\u201d with Z. According to MM, this involved \u201cexercises we do with Z when he\u2019s telling us a story and we\u2019re not really sure.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">On October 8, 1996, the child interviewer and a deputy prosecutor again interviewed Z. This interview was in preparation for trial, which was to begin on October 17, 1996. Once again, MM was directed to remain outside.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> After the deputy prosecutor had Z answer some simple questions about the difference between the truth and a lie, he \u201cquestioned [Z] about the touching that happened.\u201d According to the interviewer, Z did not start, as he had before, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>by saying he could not remember.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> On the contrary, \u201cactually, he described an incident with Tom\u2019s hands on his private\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark>; more specifically, he now claimed, for the first time, \u201cthat Tom\u2019s hands had touched his private, and indicated his front private, his genital area.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Because Z had expressly \u201csaid that never happened\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> during the \u201cforensic interview\u201d held eleven months earlier, the deputy prosecutor followed up by \u201cask[ing] him some questions about other kinds of touching.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Z responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d which prompted the child interviewer to intervene and ask \u201cif he had told me about some other things that happened.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Z said yes, but that he did not want to talk about those things.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Soon, however, he again described an anal rape\u2014although much differently from before. When the prosecutor asked, \u201cWhat did [Tom] touch your back private or your butt with?\u201d Z said, \u201cWith a coat hanger\u201d that \u201cfelt cold.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">On October 16, 1996, the day before trial was to start, the State amended the information to add a count charging first degree child molestation. The new count was based on the allegation of fondling that Z had first made in the October 8 interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On the morning of October 17, 1996, the trial court held a brief competency hearing. Z was the only witness, and he was not asked about the events in dispute. He answered appropriately when asked whether it would be the truth or a lie to say he was a donkey, and whether it would be the truth or a lie to say a pink elephant was in the back of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>courtroom. He expressly promised to tell the truth without making up stories, but then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">Q: [Z], you said you were seven years old; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">Q. Do you remember when your brother, Matthew, was born?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">A.

Okay.[<footnotemark>76</footnotemark>:i</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">At the end of the competency hearing, the trial court rendered a somewhat confusing oral opinion in which it found Z competent. Quoted in its entirety, that oral opinion was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">Well, [Z] did testify as to an event that he could not possibly have.recalled. I mean, it\u2019s beyond understanding, as far as I\u2019m concerned, that he would be in the same room when his little brother, Matthew, was born. It is impossible for him to recall when he was born and what he looked like and what occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">It is apparent to me when [Z] was testifying here regarding this that he was testifying as to dream versus reality. And I think that was confused and I don\u2019t think he is old enough to be able to separate that confusion, reality from fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">However, as far as his competency to testify and demonstrate a sufficient memory and to understand questions regarding an event, an actual event, that has been demonstrated here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">I\u2019m going to make a finding that he is competent to testify.[<footnotemark>77</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">This oral opinion is our only indication of the trial court\u2019s reasoning, for it chose not to enter written findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Following the competency hearing, the trial court held a hearsay hearing at which several witnesses testified, generally as set forth above. The court ruled, over Karpenski\u2019s objection, that Z\u2019s hearsay statements were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\">Following the hearsay hearing, the court commenced a jury trial. Z was the first witness. After he took the oath and responded to various preliminaries, he was asked what had happened. He replied, \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> He was then asked whether he remembered coming to the courthouse and talking to the child interviewer. He replied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>he did, and that Karpenski\u2019s \u201cfront private\u201d had touched his \u201cfront private,\u201d on \u201cthe skin,\u201d while he was out of his sleeping bag with his clothes on.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The prosecutor then reminded him that when he had talked to the child interviewer, \u201cshe thought that his private touched your back private. Did she get that right or did she get that mixed up?\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Z replied that she \u201cgot that right,\u201d and that his \u201cback private\u201d had been touched by Karpenski\u2019s \u201cfront private.\u201d He said that Karpenski\u2019s \u201cprivate\u201d had been \u201csoft as a worm\u201d at the time; that it had gone \u201cinside\u201d; and that it had \u201cstayed still\u201d rather than moving around.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> This had occurred during the night, while he was \u201cstill asleep,\u201d and not just pretending to be asleep.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The next morning, he said, he had informed his mother of what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The other witnesses at trial were MM, Z\u2019s maternal grandmother, R, the child interviewer, the doctor who had performed the physical, Z\u2019s mental health counselor, and Karpenski. Karpenski testified that he had not abused Z in any way. The mental health counselor said that he had not asked Z about sexual abuse; that he had not heard Z mention sexual abuse; but that he had, during therapy sessions, thought Z could tell the difference between reality and fantasy. The other witnesses testified essentially as set forth above. The grandmother added that Z had lived full-time with her since July 1995; that as a day care worker, she was trained to look for signs of sexual abuse in children; and that she had not seen any such signs with Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The jury convicted on both counts. According to Karpenski, he could not qualify for a SSOSA sentence because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>would not relinquish his claim of innocence. The trial court committed him to prison for seven and one half years.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Karpenski makes two major claims on appeal. In the first, he argues that the tried court erred by admitting Z\u2019s trial testimony, because Z was incompetent to be a witness. In the second, he argues that the trial court erred by admitting Z\u2019s various out-of-court statements, because they were unreliable and thus inadmissible hearsay. We consider each claim separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">I. COMPETENCY</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">As just noted, Karpenski\u2019s first claim is that the trial court erred by finding Z competent to testify at trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">Every person is competent to be a witness \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by statute or by court rule.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The statutes, rules and cases formulate competency in various ways. One formulation provides that a person \u201cshall not be competent to testify\u201d if he or she \u201cappear[s] incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts, respecting which [he or she is] examined, or of relating [such facts] truly.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> A second, similar formulation provides that a child shall not be competent to testify if he or she \u201cdo[es] not have the capacity of receiving just impressions of the facts about which [he or she is] examined or . . . do[es] not have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>capacity of relating [such facts] truly.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> A third formulation provides that a witness is competent if he or she \u201chas sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature and obligation of an oath,\u201d and if he or she possesses \u201c \u2018sufficient mind and memory to observe, recollect, and narrate the things he has seen or heard.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> A fourth formulation provides that the general test of competency is whether the witness \u201cunderstands the nature of an oath and is capable of giving a correct account of what he [or she] has seen and heard.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> A fifth formulation provides that a witness is competent if he or she \u201cha[s] the ability to understand the underlying events and relate them truthfully in court.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> A sixth formulation provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">The true test of the competency of a young child as a witness consists of the following: (1) an understanding of the obligation to speak the truth on the witness stand; (2) the mental capacity at the time of the occurrence concerning which he is to testify, to receive an accurate impression of it; (3) a memory sufficient to retain an independent recollection of the occurrence; (4) the capacity to express in words his memory of the occurrence; and (5) the capacity to understand simple questions about it.[<footnotemark>90</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Under any of these formulations, the competency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>a witness turns on three basic preliminary questions of fact.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> One is whether the witness, at the time of his or her in-court statement (i.e., his or her \u201ctestimony\u201d), is describing an event that he or she had the capacity to accurately perceive (or, in alternative terms, an event about which he or she could \u201creceive just impressions\u201d). Another is whether the witness, at the time of his or her in-court statement, is describing an event that he or she has the capacity to accurately recall. A third is whether the witness, at the time of his or her in-court statement, is describing an event that he or she has the capacity to accurately relate. The third question subdivides into at least the following: (a) whether the witness has the capacity to understand simple questions about the event; (b) whether the witness has the capacity to express in words his or her memory of the event; (c) whether the witness has the capacity to speak in the formal courtroom setting; (d) whether the witness has the capacity to distinguish truth from falsehood; and (e) whether the witness has the capacity to understand and carry out his or her obligation to speak the truth.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"> The dispositive question here is whether Z had the capacity to distinguish truth from falsehood.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> The trial court necessarily but implicitly resolved that question in favor of the State. We review the trial court\u2019s ruling under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the so-called \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> We can apply that standard rationally only if we first understand (A) the nature of the trial court\u2019s discretion and (B) the nature of our own discretion.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> Thus, we begin with those matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"> The trial judge decides preliminary questions of fact under ER 104(a).<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> In doing so, he or she does not always exercise the same kind of discretion. When dealing with some preliminary questions, the judge inquires whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of the needed fact.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> When dealing with other such questions, the judge inquires whether the evidence preponderates in favor of the needed fact.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> The difference is important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>because it controls whether the judge <em>may </em>reject inferences favorable to the proponent; the judge may not when inquiring whether the evidence is sufficient, but the judge may when inquiring whether the evidence preponderates.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">One question here, then, is whether a trial judge faced with a competency-related question of preliminary fact inquires (a) whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of that fact, or (b) whether the evidence preponderates in favor of that fact. In State <em>v. </em>Borland,<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> Division One addressed that question. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">Although the exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion must be based on the entire testimony, the court is entitled to select which portions have the greater persuasive value on the ultimate issue. There is probably no area of law where it is more necessary to place great reliance on the trial court\u2019s judgment than in assessing the competency of a child witness. The trial judge is in a position to assess the body language, the hesitation or lack thereof, the manner of speaking, and all the intangibles that are significant in evaluation but are not reflected in a written record.[<footnotemark>100</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">These remarks are not consistent with a trial judge\u2019s asking whether the evidence is sufficient, for a judge asking that is <em>not </em>\u201centitled to select which portions [of the evidence] have greater persuasive value.\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> These remarks are consistent with a trial judge\u2019s asking whether the evidence preponderates, for a judge asking that <em>is </em>\u201centitled to select which portions have the greater persuasive value.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that when a trial judge addresses a competency-related question of preliminary fact, he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>she has discretion to inquire whether the evidence preponderates in favor of that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\"> To identify the nature of the trial court\u2019s discretion is not, of course, to identify the nature of our own discretion on appeal. When a trial judge\u2019s function is to decide whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding, a reviewing court\u2019s function will be the same.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> When a trial judge\u2019s function is to decide whether the evidence preponderates, a reviewing court\u2019s function may or may not be the same. If the reviewing court\u2019s information is as good or better than the trial court\u2019s, the reviewing court will sometimes be permitted to substitute its own view, without deference to the trial court<footnotemark>103</footnotemark>; but if the reviewing court\u2019s information is not as good as the trial court\u2019s, the reviewing court will limit itself to deciding whether the evidence is sufficient to support what the trial court did.<footnotemark>104</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Another question here, then, is whether an appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>court reviewing a competency-related preliminary question of fact inquires whether the evidence is sufficient to support the ruling, or whether the evidence preponderates in favor of the ruling. If the trial judge\u2019s basis was entirely documentary, and the documents appear in the appellate record, the appellate court\u2019s information is as good as the trial court\u2019s, and the appellate court may substitute its own view of competency without deferring to the trial court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> But if the trial court saw and evaluated the witness in person, its information is better than the appellate court\u2019s, and the appellate court will limit itself to determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark> Regarding this last proposition, the Supreme Court recently said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">The determination of competency rests primarily with the trial judge who sees the witness, notices his manner, and considers his capacity and intelligence. These are matters that are not reflected in the written record for appellate review. Their determination lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of proof of a manifest abuse of discretion.[<footnotemark>107</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Finally, then, we come to the precise question posed by the so-called \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard: Taking the record in the light most favorable to the State, could a trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>reasonably find it to be more likely true than not true that Z was capable of distinguishing truth from falsity?</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The answer is no. At the outset of the competency hearing, Z took the oath and solemnly \u201cpromised to tell the truth about everything that happened.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> He also promised <em>not </em>to \u201cmake up any stories.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> Moments later, he was describing in vivid detail how he and his younger brother had been born at the same time. As the State notes on appeal, \u201cThis is impossible because Z is seven and his little brother is two.\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> As the trial court noted, this is \u201cimpossible\u201d because it is \u201cbeyond understanding\u201d that Z was in the room when his little brother was born.<footnotemark>111</footnotemark> No one suggests that Z was intentionally lying; it seems that he actually believed what he was saying, and that he was merely manifesting his long-standing, often-observed inability to distinguish what was true from what was not. The trial court expressly found that Z was \u201ctestifying] as to an event that he could not possibly have recalled\u201d; that he was \u201cconfused\u201d regarding \u201cdream versus reality\u201d; and that he was \u201cnot old enough to be able to separate that confusion.\u201d Inexplicably, however, it then concluded that Z was competent to testify. It is our opinion that the <em>only </em>reasonable view of this record is the one expressed by the trial court\u2014that Z lacked the capacity to distinguish truth from falsehood. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that Z was capable of distinguishing truth from falsity, and that Z was incompetent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">n. HEARSAY</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Karpenski\u2019s second claim is that Z\u2019s hearsay statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>to the twins\u2019 father in July 1995, to the child interviewer on November 14, 1995, and to the deputy prosecutor on October 8, 1996 were inadmissible under RCW 9A.44.120<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> and the federal confrontation clause. This is true, he contends, because \u201cZ\u2019s incompetence renders his hearsay statements unreliable,\u201d<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> and because the so-called <em>Ryan </em>factors were not shown by the State. To understand these contentions, we must first understand hearsay exceptions in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Under the rules of evidence and the federal confrontation clause, the proponent who wants to admit a hearsay statement must show \u201csufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark> The proponent may derive such indicia from the totality of circumstances \u201cthat surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief,\u201d<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> including the contents of the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>itself.<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> The proponent may not derive such indicia from circumstances that were not in existence at the time and place of the making of the statement, for that would allow an unreliable hearsay statement to be admitted merely \u201cby bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark> In short, the proponent must produce not only the hearsay statement itself, but also indicia of reliability that show, <em>as of the time the statement was made, </em>its probable reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Every hearsay exception recognized by the law of evidence describes circumstances thought to indicate, <em>in part, </em>that a hearsay statement probably was reliable when made.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> The description may be specific<footnotemark>119</footnotemark> or general,<footnotemark>120</footnotemark> but it invariably involves circumstances that surround the mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ing of the statement.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> If the description is general, the courts may try to make it more specific by listing circumstances thought to bear on reliability. For example, RCW 9A.44.120 states only \u201cthat the time, content, and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d<footnotemark>122</footnotemark> So, in <em>State v. Ryan,</em><footnotemark><em>123</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Washington Supreme Court held that when a trial court is applying RCW 9A.44.120, it should consider nine specific circumstances: (1) whether the child had a motive to lie; (2) the child\u2019s general character for veracity; (3) whether more than one person heard the child\u2019s statements<footnotemark>124</footnotemark>; (4) whether the child\u2019s statements were made spontaneously; (5) the timing of the declaration and the relationship between the declarant and the witness; (6) whether the statement contains an express assertion of past fact<footnotemark>125</footnotemark>; (7) whether cross examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tion could show the declarant\u2019s lack of knowledge<footnotemark>126</footnotemark>; (8) whether the,possibility of the declarant\u2019s faulty recollection is remote<footnotemark>127</footnotemark>; and (9) whether the circumstances surrounding the statement are such that there is no reason to suppose the declarant misrepresented the defendant\u2019s involvement.<footnotemark>128</footnotemark> Each of these circumstances is both nonexclusive<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><footnotemark>129</footnotemark> and nonessential.<footnotemark>130</footnotemark> Several are of doubtful validity,<footnotemark>131</footnotemark> but that is not important for purposes of this case; with or without them, we would reach the same result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Whether specific or general, the indicia of reliability that appear on the face of a hearsay exemption or exception are rarely \u201csufficient\u201d by themselves. As a general rule, such indicia must be accompanied by a showing that the declarant had personal knowledge when the statement was made, and, at least when the declarant is a young child not shown to be competent at trial, by a showing that the declarant was competent when the statement was made.<footnotemark>132</footnotemark> We turn, then, to personal knowledge and competence in the context of hears\u00e1y.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Even though a hearsay statement satisfies the criteria set forth on the face of a hearsay exemption or exception, it cannot be reliable if, at the time it was made, the declarant spoke or wrote without personal knowledge. Generally, then, the proponent must show that the circumstances surrounding the statement, coupled with the contents of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>statement itself, give rise to an inference of personal knowledge.<footnotemark>133</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Even though a hearsay statement falls within a hearsay exemption or exception, it cannot be reliable if, when it was made, the declarant was incompetent.<footnotemark>134</footnotemark> The competency of most declarants will not be in issue, just as the competency of most trial witnesses is not in issue. But when the competency of a declarant is in issue\u2014as, for example, when a young child is not shown to be competent at trial and the opponent voices a proper objection to the child\u2019s pretrial hearsay statement\u2014the proponent must demonstrate not only circumstances described on the face of a hearsay exception, but also circumstances showing that at the time of the hearsay statement the child was describing an event that the child had the capacity to accurately perceive; to accurately recall; and to accurately relate. It matters little whether these capacity-related circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>are called \u201celements of competency,\u201d \u201ccompetency-related preliminary facts,\u201d \u201cindicia of reliability,\u201d or \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d If any one of them is missing, the child\u2019s hearsay statement cannot be reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">At least twice, the Washington Supreme Court has held that the hearsay statement of a young child not shown to be competent at trial cannot be rehable if the record fails to show that the declarant was competent when the hearsay statement was made. In the first case, <em>Jenkins v. Snohomish County PUD No. </em>I,<footnotemark>135</footnotemark> Jonathan Jenkins, age seven, was injured by electricity after he and a friend, Lance Sinka, age six, climbed over the fence of a power substation. In deposition a year later, Lance gave a bizarre and inconsistent account of what he and Jonathan had done\u2014so bizarre and inconsistent as to demonstrate that he \u201cdid not [then] have a memory sufficient to retain an independent recollection of the occurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>136</footnotemark> When trial convened, Lance was unavailable to give in-court testimony, and the trial court admitted the deposition over the plaintiffs\u2019 objection. On appeal, however, the Supreme Court reversed. Even though the deposition met the facial requirements of the hearsay exception usually used for nonparty depositions,<footnotemark>137</footnotemark> Lance had lacked, at the time of the deposition, the capacity to accurately recall the events at issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In the second case, <em>State v. Ryan,</em><footnotemark><em>138</em></footnotemark><em> </em>two young children made hearsay statements alleging sexual abuse by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>fendant. Neither testified at trial, and neither was shown to be competent at trial. Although the trial court admitted the statements, the Supreme Court reversed for failure to determine the declarants\u2019 competency at the time the statements were made. The court said (with our interpretations in brackets):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">The declarant\u2019s competency [at the time of his or her hearsay statement] is a precondition to admission of his hearsay statements as are other testimonial qualifications [apparently referring to personal knowledge].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">The hearsay rule is merely an additional test or safeguard to be applied to testimonial evidence otherwise admissible. The admission of hearsay statements, by way of exception to the rule, therefore presupposes that the assertor possessed the <em>qualifications of a witness </em>... in regard to knowledge and the like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">(Footnote omitted.) 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1424, at 255 (rev. 1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">If the declarant was not competent at the time of making the statements, the statements may not be introduced through hearsay repetition.^<footnotemark>139</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Furthermore, the court applied its holding by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">The trial court did not determine whether the children were competent when they made the statements. If they were not, their statements must be excluded as being unreliable. [<footnotemark>140</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The court then remanded for further proceedings.<footnotemark>141</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">In a third case, <em>State v. Hunt,</em><footnotemark><em>142</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Division One recognized the concepts found in <em>Ryan </em>and <em>Jenkins, </em>but did not fully apply them due to an inadequate challenge below. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>The circumstaiitial guaranties of trustworthiness generally used to analyze the reliability of hearsay statements presuppose, in most instances, that the hearsay declarant possessed a certain degree of mental capacity throughout the relevant time period. If the requisite mental capacity is lacking, the time, manner, and circumstances of the making of the statement may well be irrelevant to a determination of reliability .... Here, however, S\u2019s mental capacity to receive accurate impressions of the occurrence and to relate them accurately at the time of the statement was never challenged below; nor do we find any evidence in the record to support such a challenge.[<footnotemark>143</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Neither <em>Jenkins </em>nor <em>Ryan </em>injected anything new or startling into the law of evidence. As the <em>Ryan </em>court noted, Wigmore said long ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">The hearsay rule is merely an additional test or safeguard to be applied to testimonial evidence otherwise admissible. The admission of hearsay statements, by way of exception to the rule, therefore presupposes that the assertor possessed the <em>qualifications of a witness </em>... in regard to knowledge and the likeJ<footnotemark>144</footnotemark>3</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Similarly, the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Evidence has said, \u201cIn a hearsay situation, the declarant is, of course, a witness, and neither [Rule 803] nor Rule 804 dispenses with the requirement of firsthand knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>145</footnotemark> The underlying ideas are that the judge should not forward to the jury any statement the jury could not rationally use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>and that the jury could not rationally use the statement of a declarant who spoke without personal knowledge or while incompetent\u2014regardless of whether the declarant was excited, speaking in a deposition, or within some other hearsay exception.<footnotemark>146</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Nothing we have said means that the hearsay statement of a young child is inadmissible merely because the child is incompetent to testify at trial.<footnotemark>147</footnotemark> A young child who lacks the capacity to remember from the time of event to the time of trial (often a period of months or years) may nonetheless have had the capacity to remember from the time of event to the time of his or her hearsay statement (often a period of minutes or hours).<footnotemark>148</footnotemark> A young child who lacks the capacity to relate the event in the formal courtroom setting may nonetheless have had the capacity to relate the event in an informal hearsay setting.<footnotemark>149</footnotemark> But a young child who lacks at trial the capacity to distinguish truth from falsehood probably also lacked that capacity when, at an even younger age, he or she made a hearsay statement; and a child who lacked the capacity to perceive the event when it occurred cannot later make a reliable statement about it, whether in court or outside of court. In short, the effect of incompetence at trial upon the reliability of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>hearsay statement varies according to <em>the reason </em>for the incompetence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Nothing we have said means that a proponent must <em>always </em>show, before admitting a child\u2019s hearsay statement, that the child was competent at the time of that statement. The only case we consider is that in which the child is not shown to be competent at trial. We do not consider any other kind of case, including that in which the child is properly found competent to testify at trial,<footnotemark>150</footnotemark> and that in which the child\u2019s trial testimony or hearsay statement is admitted without a specific objection from the opponent.<footnotemark>151</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Nothing we have said requires a trial judge to make inquiries more difficult than those he or she normally makes. To decide whether a declarant meets the terms of any hearsay exception\u2014for example, whether the declarant had a motive to lie or good general character for purposes of RCW 9A.44.120, or whether the declarant was excited for purposes of ER 803(2), or whether the declarant was an agent for purposes of ER 801(d)(2)(iii), or whether the declarant acted under a business duty for purposes of RCW 5.45.020\u2014the judge must examine the circumstances surrounding the hearsay statement. To decide whether a declarant was describing an event that he or she had the capacity to perceive, recall, and relate, the judge likewise must examine the circumstances surrounding the hearsay statement.<footnotemark>152</footnotemark> In examining such circumstances, the judge is not bound by the rules of evidence, except those with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>spect to privileges, so he or she has broad discretion to require or dispense with live witnesses, to use affidavits and other documents, to take into account the oral representations of counsel, and to employ any other procedure appropriate to the case.<footnotemark>153</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Although most Washington cases are in accord with what we have said, two Court of Appeals\u2019 cases warrant further attention. They are <em>State v. </em>Gribble<footnotemark>154</footnotemark> and <em>Dependency of </em>S.S.<footnotemark>155</footnotemark> For several reasons, we find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">First, <em>Gribble </em>and <em>S.S. </em>contravene <em>Ryan. </em>Each expressly noted <em>Ryan\u2019s </em>holding \u201cthat the child hearsay declarant must be shown to be competent at the time the [hearsay] statements are made.\u201d<footnotemark>156</footnotemark> Each then concluded the exact opposite: \u201cthat a finding of reliability through use of the <em>Ryan </em>factors is sufficient assurance of trustworthiness to make unnecessary an inquiry into testimonial competence at the time the hearsay statements are made.\u201d<footnotemark>157</footnotemark> This conclusion defies <em>Ryan </em>itself, for <em>Ryan </em>held that a trial court must consider <em>both </em>the <em>Ryan </em>factors and the declarant\u2019s compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>tence at the time of the statement. It also ignores the sketchy and incomplete nature of the <em>Ryan </em>factors, effectively transmuting them from flawed aids into a kind of mantra or chant. As <em>Ryan </em>itself makes clear, the <em>Ryan </em>factors were never intended to be exclusive, and they do not relieve a trial court of its duty to consider <em>all </em>factors that bear on reliability at the time of the statement, including but not limited to the declarant\u2019s ability to perceive, recall, and relate.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Second, <em>Gribble </em>and <em>S.S. </em>misunderstood the fundamental n\u00e1ture of most hearsay exceptions, including RCW 9A.44.120. After noting the <em>Ryan </em>court\u2019s holding \u201cthat the child hearsay declarant must be shown to be competent at the time the statements are made,\u201d <em>Gribble </em>and <em>S.S. </em>observe \u201c[t]here is no such requirement in the child hearsay statute,\u201d<footnotemark>158</footnotemark> and use that as a reason not to follow <em>Ryan. </em>Because the hearsay declarant is in effect a witness, however,<footnotemark>159</footnotemark> most hearsay exceptions require exactly what <em>Ryan </em>held: that a hearsay statement cannot be reliable enough for admission unless the declarant possessed the qualifications of a witness at the time the statement was made.<footnotemark>160</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Third, <em>Gribble </em>and <em>S.S. </em>misconstrued the holding of <em>State v. Doe.</em><footnotemark><em>161</em></footnotemark><em> </em>According to <em>Gribble </em>and <em>S.S., </em>the <em>Doe </em>court held that once a trial court has applied the <em>Ryan </em>factors, it need not consider additional factors that bear on whether the declarant was competent at the time of the hearsay statement.<footnotemark>162</footnotemark> In actuality, the <em>Doe </em>court held only that a trial court would not be relieved of its duty to consider whether a hearsay statement was reliable, merely because the declarant was incompetent to testify <em>at trial. </em>The <em>Doe </em>court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>did not address the factors that a trial court should examine when discharging that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the facts of this case. At the time of the trial, as discussed in section I, Z lacked the capacity to distinguish truth from falsehood. At the time of his hearsay statements, he was younger and less mature than he was at the time of trial. Thus, the <em>only </em>reasonable inference available from this record is that Z\u2019s lack of capacity at trial also existed when he made his various hearsay statements.<footnotemark>163</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">We confirm this logic by examining Z\u2019s various statements, and using them as a basis from which to infer his level of mental functioning at the time he made each particular statement.<footnotemark>164</footnotemark> When Z spoke to the twins\u2019 father, he denied any improper activity, then blamed it on the twins, then alleged that Karpenski \u201ccomes in the middle of the night and tears my clothes off.\u201d When Z spoke to the child interviewer, he made <em>eleven </em>responses that did not implicate Karpenski before making one that did; and in elaborating on the one that did, he said he had not been fondled by Karpenski\u2019s hands. When he spoke to his grandmother, he said that Karpenski had not hurt him or been mean to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>him, and that Karpenski had put red pepper in his ear. When he spoke to the prosecutor, he said in essence that Karpenski had fondled him on his \u201cfront private.\u201d When the interviewer stepped in and brought him back to the subject of anal rape, he said that Karpenski had engaged in that act with a coat hanger that felt cold. When he spoke under oath at the competency hearing, he made ludicrous statements about his brother\u2019s birth. When he spoke under oath at trial, he said that Karpenski\u2019s \u201cfront private\u201d touched his \u201cfront private,\u201d and that when Karpenski\u2019s \u201cfront private\u201d had touched his \u201cback private,\u201d Karpenski\u2019s \u201cfront private\u201d had penetrated his anus while \u201csoft as a worm.\u201d These and other impossibilities, together with the unrefuted testimony of his mother and grandmother, clearly show a boy who lacked the capacity to distinguish truth from falsehood at the time of his various hearsay statements. Accordingly, those statements could not be reliable, and the trial court erred by admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Although we have ruled on the basis of Z\u2019s competency at the time of his hearsay statements, we would reach the same result by applying the so-called <em>Ryan </em>factors. In order to apply those factors, however, we must assume a fact that clearly is not correct\u2014that at the time of his various hearsay statements, Z had the capacity, if he wanted to use it, to distinguish truth from falsehood.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Z\u2019s statement to the twins\u2019 father does not satisfy the <em>Ryan </em>factors. It came at a time when Z\u2019s character for truth-telling was questionable at best. It came after Z had been accosted by an adult he hardly knew, and who had just been told about highly upsetting conduct involving his own twins. It came after the adult had asked a question that assumed a fact no adult may have seen (\u201cwho showed [you] how to put [your] pee-pee in a bottom\u201d).<footnotemark>165</footnotemark> It came after Z had essentially tried to deny his way out, by claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the conduct had not occurred, then by blaming it on the twins. In sum, it came when Z\u2019s general character for truth-telling was poor; when he had every motive to lie (and did so, in at least two of his three statements); when he was not acting spontaneously (he had time to fabricate at least two of his three inconsistent responses); when he was heard by only one person (the twins\u2019 father); when he was expressly asserting past facts; and when the likelihood of faulty recollection or misrepresentation was extreme. None of the <em>Ryan </em>factors indicates reliability, and Z\u2019s statement to the twins\u2019 father was not admissible under RCW 9A.44.120.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Z\u2019s statements to the child interviewer and deputy prosecutor also fail to satisfy the <em>Ryan </em>factors. Each statement was made at a time when Z\u2019s character for truth-telling was questionable at best. The statement to the interviewer was made several months after the alleged incident, and the statement to the prosecutor was made over a year later. Each statement was made in an investigatory context, for forensic purposes. Each statement was heard by only one person; indeed, the mother and grandfather were made to wait in the hall. Neither statement was recorded, and at least with one statement the interviewer\u2019s original notes were destroyed. Each statement came after <em>numerous </em>equivocal responses, and each statement was accompanied by highly inconsistent responses demonstrating an extremely confused state of mind. Each shows an inability to relate even the basic facts that a six-year-old would usually know\u2014for example, whether the alleged sexual abuse happened on one or more than one occasion. Neither statement was spontaneous; each expressly asserted past facts; and the likelihood of faulty recollection or misrepresentation was extreme. None of the <em>Ryan </em>factors indicates reliability, and Z\u2019s statements to the interviewer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>and prosecutor were not admissible under RCW 9A.44.120.<footnotemark>166</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">III. MISCELLANEOUS</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">One matter not covered herein is the admissibility of Z\u2019s hearsay statement to the doctor. No error is assigned to that, and it does not appear that a specific objection was made at trial. If proper objection is made following remand, the trial court shall consider whether Z had the capacity to distinguish truth from falsehood at the time he spoke with the doctor, whether Z was aware he was speaking for medical diagnosis and treatment, and all other circumstances affecting the statement\u2019s reliability as of the time it was made.<footnotemark>167</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Karpenski\u2019s remaining assignments of error lack merit or will not arise again.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Houghton, J., concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-13\"> Report of Proceedings at 37 (Oct. 17, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-14\">Report of Proceedings at 36 (Oct. 21, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b115-15\">Report of Proceedings at 9 (Oct. 22, 23, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Report of Proceedings at 41 (Oct. 21, 1996); Report of Proceedings at 40 (Oct. 22, 23, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b116-10\"> The father testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">Q: [D]id she have a conversation with your two sons or did she see what was going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-12\">A: I\u2019m not positive if my sons told her or she saw.

This third factor supports a finding that the declarant\u2019s hearsay statement was <em>made, </em>but it says little or nothing about whether the declarant\u2019s hearsay statement was <em>true. </em>Its significance to the existence of indicia of reliability is minor at best.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"125\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\"> This sixth factor is drawn from <em>Dutton v.

At trial, the State offered B\u2019s statement to his cellmate, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for A, I wouldn\u2019t be in this now.\u201d The Supreme Court reasoned that if B were intending to implicate A falsely, he would have expressly asserted, \u201cA did it,\u201d rather than stating obliquely, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for A, I wouldn\u2019t be in this now.\u201d Thus, the Court felt, the absence of an express assertion of past fact tended to show that B\u2019s statement was reliable when made. This idea is of little use when applying RCW 9A.44.120, for most statements offered under that statute <em>are </em>express assertions of past fact. <em>See State v. Leavitt, </em>111 Wn.2d 66, 75, 758 P.2d 982 (1988); <em>In re Dependency of S.S., </em>61 Wn. App. 488, 498, 814 P.2d 204 (1991); <em>State v. Borland, </em>57 Wn.

Perhaps more importantly, it seems to be an alternative formulation of the conclusion to be reached, as opposed to a reason for reaching the conclusion; to say that a statement is not affected by faulty perception, recollection, or narration is simply to assert, using negative language, that the statement is reliable. <em>See Dependency of S.S., </em>61 Wn.

It is undisputed, however, that Z made false statements, some of them elaborate, on many occasions spanning the entire period at issue here\u2014for example, to his mother at home; to his grandmother at home; to his first grade teacher in school; to the twins\u2019 father either before or when he implicated Karpenski; to the child interviewer at the courthouse; and to the deputy prosecutor at the courthouse. These facts will not support an inference that Z\u2019s inability was due to the courtroom setting. Nor will they support an inference that Z\u2019s inability to tell the truth was due to mental illness or some other cause that was merely transient. The remaining inference is the one in the text: that Z\u2019s inability to distinguish truth from falsity was a result of his youth and immaturity (in other words, that he was so young he had not yet learned what it was to tell the truth).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"164\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">See <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 821, which notes that \u201cconsistent repetition\u201d is a factor surrounding the time and place of the making of a particular hearsay statement. The reasoning, apparently, is that a comparison of the various statements made by a declarant often will shed light on his or her mental functioning at the time of a particular statement. <em>Cf. State v. Williams, </em>79 Wn.

Karpenski, however, expressly and specifically objected to Z\u2019s statements as hearsay. One effect of that objection was to cast on the State the burden of showing that Z\u2019s statements were surrounded by \u201csufficient indicia of reliability,\u201d or, in alternative terms, that Z was reliable at the time of the statements. See RCW 9A.44.120. The State failed to do that, even though a pretrial hearing was held for that very purpose. Accordingly, it cannot be said that Karpenski failed to make a proper objection, or that the State lacked an opportunity to establish Z\u2019s reliability at the time of the statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"167\">\n<p id=\"b155-11\"> See ER 803(4); State <em>v.

Thus, Karpenski\u2019s conviction must be reversed. But I disagree with the majority\u2019s discussion and resolution of the issue of Z\u2019s competence at the time of the out-of-court statements. I would remand and allow the parties to litigate this issue fully before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>trial court. This would also require reexamination of the reliability of Z\u2019s out-of-court statements under the <em>Ryan </em>factors.<footnotemark>168</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Karpenski did not object to the out-of-court statements on the basis of Z\u2019s competence at the time of making the statements. Rather, in its trial brief the State raised the issue of admissibility of the out-of-court statements under RCW 9A.44.120. Karpenski then raised the issue of Z\u2019s competence in his trial brief, citing <em>State v. Allen, </em>70 Wn.2d 690, 692, 424 P.2d 1021 (1967), which dealt only with the competence of a witness <em>at trial. </em>And at the trial court hearing on competence and reliability of the statements, Karpenski made no specific objection to the admissibility of the statements on the basis of Z\u2019s competence at the time of making the statements. Because of this, the trial court did not rule on Z\u2019s competence at the time of the statements. Generally, on appeal a party may not challenge the admissibility of evidence on grounds not raised in the trial court. <em>State v. Guloy, </em>104 Wn.2d 412, 705 P.2d 1182 (1985). In spite of this procedurally flawed record, the majority considers the question of Z\u2019s competence at the time of the statements and then decides it on the record before us. This is inappropriate because the State has not had the opportunity to present evidence on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s reasoning in resolving the issue of Z\u2019s competence at the time of the out-of-court statements. The only question as to Z\u2019s competence arises from his apparent inability to distinguish truth from falsity. The majority reasons that this is a result of \u201chis youth and immaturity.\u201d<footnotemark>169</footnotemark> The majority then concludes that Z was even more youthful and immature at the time of the statements and therefore he was incompetent then and presumably at all times before the trial. But no evidence supports the statement that Z\u2019s incompetence resulted solely from his youth and immaturity. It is entirely conceivable that at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>least part of Z\u2019s difficulty with truth and falsity results from the situation he is in at the time, for example the courtroom setting as opposed to meeting with a trusted adult. Further, Z\u2019s difficulty with knowing the truth may be related to the emotional turmoil in his fife at the time. In short, Z may be competent at times and in certain settings and not competent at other times and in other settings.<footnotemark>170</footnotemark> We do not know because the State has not had the opportunity to fully develop and present evidence on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The majority supports its conclusion as to Z\u2019s competence at the time of the statements by analyzing the statements themselves. But this does not supply the missing information. The statements are inconsistent, not unusual with young victims, and the circumstances suggest that much of the questioning of Z was leading and suggestive. But the critical question with Z is whether at the time of statements he knew the difference between truth and falsity. If he did, then he was competent at the time. And no amount of analysis of the statements in this record can answer this question. This, again, is because the issue was not fully litigated in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Finally, because the <em>Ryan </em>factors overlap to some extent with the witness competence factors\u2014particularly Z\u2019s character for veracity and his ability to. understand truth and falsity\u2014the trial court on remand should re-evaluate the statements reliability in light of the evidence produced to establish his competence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"168\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\"><em> State v. Ryan, </em>103 Wn.2d 165, 203, 691 P.2d 197 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"169\">\n<p id=\"AY-\"><em> See supra </em>note 163 at 120.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"170\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The majority responds to this problem by arguing that the record does not support the conclusion that Z\u2019s difficulty is situational. <em>See supra </em>note 163 at 120. I agree. But the record also does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion that Z\u2019s difficulty is due only to youth and immaturity. Again, this is because the State has not had the opportunity to present evidence on the cause of Z\u2019s difficulty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
