The presentence report (\u201cPSI\u201d) prepared by the District Court\u2019s Probation Office enhanced Ramirez\u2019s base offense level of 8 by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based on his 2006 conviction in Georgia for enticing a child for indecent purposes, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-6-5(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After reducing his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>offense level to 21 for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), and fixing his criminal history category at V, the PSI calculated the Guidelines range at 70 to 87 months imprisonment. At sentencing, the District Court adopted this range, but granted a downward variance and sentenced Ramirez to a prison term of 54 months, with 2 months credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">Ramirez appeals his sentence, arguing, first, that the District Court erred in finding that his O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16 \u2014 6\u20145(a) conviction qualified as \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and enhancing his base offense level by 16 levels, and second, that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court failed to consider adequately that his \u00a7 16-6-5(a) conviction was based on a guilty plea entered pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-6\">We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d 953, 954 (11th Cir.2012). Section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that the base offense level for illegally re-entering the United States should be increased by 16 levels if the conviction that led to the initial deportation was a felony \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). Under \u00a7 2L1.2, \u201ca felony conviction qualifies as a crime of violence ... if either (1) the defendant was convicted of one of the enumerated offenses; or (2) the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force was an element of the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1326 (11th Cir.2010). Among the enumerated offenses that qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 is any conviction for an offense under federal, state, or local law that qualifies as the \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">Generally, to determine whether a prior conviction is a qualifying crime-of-violence offense for enhancement purposes, we first apply the categorical approach. <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1336; <em>see Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598-602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158-60, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (holding that the formal categorical approach requires the sentencing court to focus on the statutory definition of the offense, or the charging papers and jury instructions, to discern if the conviction substantially corresponded to a generic offense). We usually look only at the statute and judgment of conviction to determine whether the prior conviction is a qualifying offense. <em>Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d at 1336. If there is no ambiguity as to whether the offense qualifies as a predicate offense for enhancement purposes, we need \u201clook no further\u201d than those materials. <em>See id. </em>If, however, \u201cthe scope of acts criminalized by the statutory definition of the prior offense is broader than the generic definition of the enumerated offense, then, under the categorical approach, the prior conviction does not fall within the enumerated offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Garcia, </em>646 F.3d 778, 782-83 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-12\">In <em>United States v. Padilla-Reyes, </em>we looked to the ordinary and unambiguous meaning of the terms contained in the phrase \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d as used in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) and cross-referenced by the version of \u00a7 2L1.2 in effect at that time,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and concluded that such of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>fenses involve \u201ca perpetrator\u2019s physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment of a minor for a purpose associated with sexual gratification.\u201d 247 F.3d 1158, 1163 (11th Cir.2001). Based on that definition, we held that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1987), which proscribed \u201c[l]ewd, lascivious, or indecent assault or act[s] upon or in presence of child; sexual battery,\u201d constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and triggered the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). <em>Id. </em>at 1159, 1164. Although \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d now explicitly appears in the commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 as an enumerated crime-of-violence offense, rather than appearing by reference to \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) to define \u201caggravated felony,\u201d we apply the same definition to the term as we did when <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>was decided. <em>Cortes-Salazar, </em>682 F.3d at 956-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">This generic definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d from <em>Padilla-Reyes </em>has been interpreted broadly, as \u201c \u2018[m]isuse\u2019 or \u2018maltreatment\u2019 are expansive words that include many different acts.\u201d <em>Ramirez-Garcia, </em>646 F.3d at 784. Because the definition includes nonphysical misuse and maltreatment, we have applied it to underlying offenses that include solicitation and attempt. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1322, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that an alien was barred from a discretionary waiver of deportation under former Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) because his prior conviction under a Florida statute proscribing \u201csolicitation of a child who was 16-years-old to engage in a sexual battery\u201d constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), and noting that such solicitation represents nonphysical conduct committed for the purpose of sexual gratification); <em>Ramirez-Garcia, </em>646 F.3d at 780 (applying the definition, as used in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), to a North Carolina statute that criminalized the taking or attempted taking of \u201cany immoral, improper, or indecent liberties with any child,\u201d and the commission or attempted commission of \u201cany lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body ... of any child of either sex under the age of 16 years.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-7\">Section 16-6-5 of the Georgia Code criminalizes the enticing of a child for indecent purposes, and someone commits the offense \u201cwhen he or she solicits, entices, or takes any child under the age of 16 years to any place whatsoever for the purpose of child molestation or indecent acts.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-6-5(a). A person commits child molestation when he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-8\">(1) Does any immoral or indecent act to or in the presence of or with any child under the age of 16 years with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of either the child or the person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-9\">(2) By means of an electronic device, transmits images of a person engaging in, inducing, or otherwise participating in any immoral or indecent act to a child under the age of 16 years with the intent to arouse or satisfy the sexual desires of either the child or the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-6-4. The Georgia courts have interpreted the term \u201cindecent\u201d in the context of \u00a7 16-6-4 to be sufficient to \u201calert a defendant that he or she was being charged with committing an unlawful act with a lustful intent against a child\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch an act would inherently be for someone\u2019s sexual gratification.\u201d <em>Hammock v. State, </em>201 Ga.App. 614, 411 S.E.2d 743, 746 (1991). Likewise, in the context of \u00a7 16-6-5(a), the courts have recognized that the words \u201c \u2018indecent acts\u2019 ... are not so vague and undefined as to prevent a person from recognizing the conduct they forbid,\u201d namely, \u201cacting with the intent of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor.\u201d <em>State v. Marshall, </em>304 Ga.App. 865, 698 S.E.2d 337, 339 (2010). The courts largely base this interpretation on the fact that \u00a7 16-6-5 was enacted as part of a code chapter entitled \u201cSexual Of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>fenses,\u201d which alerts defendants to the fact that they are accused of acting with intent to engage in sexual misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 389-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">In <em>United States v. McGarity, </em>one of the defendants faced potential enhancements under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e) and 2252A(b)(l) for a prior conviction of \u00a7 16-6 \u2014 5(a). 669 F.3d 1218, 1261-63 (11th Cir. 2012). We noted that \u00a7 2251(e) applied an enhancement for a \u201cprior conviction ... under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, [or] abusive sexual <em>contact </em>involving a minor,\u201d and \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) applied an enhancement for \u201ca prior conviction ... under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual <em>conduct </em>involving a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262 (ellipses in original); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(e), 2252A(b)(l). In upholding the two sentence enhancements based on the defendant\u2019s prior conviction under \u00a7 16 \u2014 6\u2014 5(a), we relied on the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019s holdings in <em>Hammock </em>and <em>Marshall </em>that defined \u201cindecent\u201d in \u00a7 16 \u2014 6\u2014 5(a) as giving \u201cnotice to the defendant that \u2018he or she was being charged with committing an unlawful act with a lustful intent against a child.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGarity, </em>669 F.3d at 1262. We further stated that, by its nature, \u00a7 16-6-5(a) \u201cproscribes the solicitation of a minor to engage in sexual conduct or conduct which, by its nature, is a sexual offense against a minor.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">We conclude that a violation under \u00a7 16-6-5(a) fits within Padilla-Reyes\u2019s broad generic definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d that includes both physical and nonphysical misuse and maltreatment of a minor for the purposes of sexual gratification. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in concluding that the underlying conviction under \u00a7 16-6-5(a) categorically constituted a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-7\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to consider all factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment by balancing the proper factors unreasonably. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010). The factors that the court weighs are set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201c[A] district court commits a clear error in judgment when it weighs those factors unreasonably, arriving at a sentence that does not achieve the purposes of sentencing,\u201d as stated in that statute. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). These purposes include the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). The court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense committed and the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, the kinds of sentences available, the Guidelines range applicable to the defendant, Sentencing Commission policy statements, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities between defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct, and any need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-8\">A district court is required to \u201cevaluate all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when arriving at a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). The weight accorded to each factor, however, is \u201ca matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>Cir.2007) (citation omitted). \u201cWe do not reweigh relevant factors nor do we remand for re-sentencing unless the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence outside the range of reasonable sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1237 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\">An <em>Alford </em>plea is a guilty plea where the defendant maintains a claim of innocence to the underlying criminal conduct charged but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict him of the offense. <em>See Alford, </em>400 U.S. at 37-38, 91 S.Ct. at 167-68. \u201c[T]he collateral consequences flowing from an <em>Alford </em>plea are the same as those flowing from an ordinary plea of guilty\u201d so long as \u201cthe guilty plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among alternative courses of action open to the defendant, and a sufficient factual basis exists to support the plea of guilt.\u201d <em>Blohm v. C.I.R., </em>994 F.2d 1542, 1554 (11th Cir.1993) (citation omitted) (holding that a taxpayer was collaterally estopped from denying liability for civil fraud under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6653 for the same year he entered an <em>Alford </em>plea on a criminal tax fraud conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201). Under Georgia law, an <em>Alford </em>plea is \u201ca guilty plea and places the defendant in the same position as if there had been a trial and conviction by a jury.\u201d <em>Morrell v. State, </em>297 Ga.App. 592, 677 S.E.2d 771, 772 n. 3 (2009) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">As discussed in our resolution of the first issue, the District Court was correct in determining that a 16-level enhancement applied to Ramirez^Gonzalez\u2019s prior conviction for enticement of a minor. The fact that his conviction was based on an <em>Alford </em>plea is immaterial because the collateral consequences of an <em>Alford </em>plea are no different than those of an ordinary guilty plea. Although the court correctly applied the 16-level enhancement, it also issued a considerable downward variance to negate the potential sentencing disparities that could have resulted from the enhancement on these facts, evidencing the court\u2019s sound consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The resulting 52-months sentence was below the Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months, well below the maximum sentence of 20 years set by \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and overall, substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1271-15\">. Prior to the indictment in this case, Ramirez had been deported twice, in 2006 and 2011 (prior to the re-entry charged in this case). Immigration officials found him on September 26, 2012, while he was in the custody of the Georgia Department of Corrections servicing a sentence for DUI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1271-23\">. The \u00a7 16-6-5 (a) offense was charged in Count 1 of a three-count indictment. Count 2 charged false imprisonment, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-41, and Count 3 charged criminal trespass, in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-7-21. Ramirez was convicted of all three offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">.
