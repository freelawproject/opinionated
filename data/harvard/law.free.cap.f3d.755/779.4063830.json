Over his objection, the district court applied a sixteen-level crime-of-violenee (\u201cCOV\u201d) enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his Texas conviction of indecency with a child. The court sentenced within the guideline range to a forty-six-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Elizondo-Hernandez renews his contention that the court erred in applying the enhancement. He asserts that his indecency conviction is not a COV because the statute under which he was convicted, Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11, permits conviction where the victim is under seventeen years of age (as distinguished from under sixteen). He also contends that his conviction does not fit the generic contemporary definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d because the Texas statute does not require an age differential of at least four years between the victim and the perpetrator. As Elizondo-Hernandez concedes, these arguments are foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 548 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 512, 187 L.Ed.2d 365 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Elizondo-Hernandez raises a third argument: The indecency statute punishes conduct that does not constitute \u201cabuse\u201d within the meaning of \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d He asserts that the state-court documents cannot be used to narrow the basis of his conviction and that the least culpable act that gives rise to a violation of the indecency statute does not constitute \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d or otherwise constitute a COV under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Section 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) calls for a sixteen-level increase in the base level if the defendant previously was removed after being convicted of a COV. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The Application Notes, in relevant part, define a COV as (1) any specific enumerated offense, including \u201cforcible sex offenses (including where consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced), statutory rape, [and] sexual abuse of a minor[.]\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s characterization of an offense as a COV. <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Generally, courts employ a categorical approach when classifying a conviction for enhancement purposes, <em>see Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and \u201cthe analysis is grounded in the elements of the statute of conviction rather than a defendant\u2019s specific conduct,\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 549. If a statute has disjunctive subsections, we may apply a modified categorical approach to ascertain under which statutory subsection the defendant was convicted. <em>United States v. Miranda-Ortegon, </em>670 F.3d 661, 663 (5th Cir.2012). We may review \u201cthe statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). If the statute of conviction cannot be narrowed, we consider \u201cwhether the least culpable act constituting a violation of that statute constitutes\u201d a COV for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Moreno-Florean, </em>542 F.3d 445, 449 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">The state judgment specifies that Elizondo-Hernandez was convicted of a second-degree felony; utilizing that document, as we are permitted to do under the modified categorical approach, we deduce that he was convicted of the offense of indecency with a minor by contact, a viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>tion of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1). <em>See United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Carpenter v. State, </em>783 S.W.2d 232, 232 (Tex.App.-Dallas 1989, no writ). That offense is a COV for purposes of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Najera-Najera, </em>519 F.3d 509, 511-12 <em>&amp; </em>n. 2 (5th Cir.2008). This determination was not altered by <em>Rodriguez, </em>which created a new plain-meaning approach for offense categories that were not defined at common law, such as sexual abuse of a minor. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d at 549 &amp; n. 9. Indeed, after <em>Rodriguez </em>we have affirmed the imposition of an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) where the defendant had a conviction under a statute similar to the Texas statute at issue here. <em>See United States v. Chacon, </em>742 F.3d 219, 220 (5th Cir.2014). Elizondo-Hernandez has not established error in the imposition of the COV enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Elizondo-Hernandez also contends that the district court erred in treating his Texas conviction of indecency with a child as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) and that, accordingly, we should remand for entry of judgment under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). Elizondo-Hernandez is seemingly laboring under the misconception that the court sentenced him under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which provides for a maximum of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for an alien \u201cwhose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\u201d The judgment, however, makes no mention of \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and the sentence is within the ten-year statutory maximum in \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">In any event, Elizondo-Hernandez\u2019s claim that the court erred in treating his conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 21.11(a)(1) as an aggravated felony fails under <em>United States v. Velazquez-Overa, </em>100 F.3d 418, 422 (5th Cir.1996), in which we determined \u201ccategorically that indecency with a child involving sexual contact, under Section 21.11(a)(1) of the Texas Penal Code, is a [COV] within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. 16(b).\u201d To the extent that the court treated the Texas conviction as an aggravated felony, Elizondo-Hernandez has failed to show error. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
