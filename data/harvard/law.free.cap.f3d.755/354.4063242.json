PRADO, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Eritrean national, Petitioner Yohannes Ghirmay Milat (\u201cMilat\u201d) requests asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Mi-lat claims he fled Eritrea to escape an assignment within Eritrea\u2019s National Service program, which he asserts is a program of human trafficking and not a legitimate program of military conscription. The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Mi-lat\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal, but granted his application for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed. Milat petitions this Court for review, arguing that the BIA erred in denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal, and that the BIA should have reopened and remanded his case for the IJ to consider new evidence. For the reasons stated below, we deny Milat\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Milat\u2019s argument for asylum centers on his conditions of employment in Eritrea, so we begin by reviewing that history, which we draw from the administrative record. Milat studied journalism and mass communication at Asmara University. Just before graduation, he went to work for the Eritrean Ministry of Defense in what, Mi-lat claims, was supposed to be a temporary postgraduate internship. Milat wrote articles for the Defense Ministry\u2019s official magazine, and assisted with the videotaping of official meetings. Milat avers, \u201cIt was expected that all work I produced should be supportive of government policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">In March 2007, Milat learned that, because the government was closing Asmara University, he would officially graduate from Meinefe College. Milat says, \u2018When I heard that I would not be graduating from Asmara, I became very frustrated and angry at the government.\u201d Milat believed that the \u201cclosing of Asmara was the government[\u2019]s shameful attempt to control the thinking of university students by breaking up the college into smaller components that it could more easily control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">With the assistance of one of his college friends, Milat created a political cartoon in protest. \u201cThe design had a picture of Asmara University, a grave-cross, and a tomb. Its message was that the government was killing the university,\u201d Milat explains.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">After Milat showed the graphic to his colleagues, Milat\u2019s supervisor at the Defense Ministry, Lieutenant Colonel Asmer-om, found out about it. Fortunately for Milat, Milat\u2019s supervisor was also an Asmara University alumnus, and he was sympathetic to Milat\u2019s sentiments. But he warned Milat \u201cnot to do that anymore,\u201d and he told Milat \u201cthat next time he would have to report [Milat] to the higher authorities.\u201d There is no evidence Lieutenant Colonel Asmerom reported the political cartoon to the authorities, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Milat says he \u201cfound working for the Ministry of Defense morally and professionally reprehensible,\u201d because he \u201cdid not want to be used as a mouthpiece for the Ministry of Defense.\u201d On cross-examination before the IJ, however, Milat admitted that his job did not require him to kill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>or persecute other Eritreans. Milat looked forward to the end of his internship with the Defense Ministry, he said, because he would have \u201cpreferred ... to work as a fair, objective and non-partial journalist instead of [as] a propaganda writer who advocate[s] policies of [the] Eritrean government.\u201d Milat believed that his internship with the Ministry of Defense would end when he graduated from college in September 2007. Milat did not get his wish.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The Ministry of Defense informed Milat that he would be made a permanent member of the Defense Ministry as part of his National Service, and he would not be reassigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Milat presented the following evidence to the IJ to explain the Eritrean National Service program. According to a report Milat submitted to the IJ, U.S. Department of State, <em>2008 Human Rights Report: Eritrea </em>(Feb. 25, 2009),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Eritrean National Service is a compulsory conscription program for men between ages 18 and 50. It includes military and civilian jobs with open-ended terms. Some National Service members are assigned to civilian jobs while nominally kept in the military; these individuals continue to receive only their National Service salary, which is very low (Milat testified he received the equivalent of between five and ten U.S. dollars per month). Anything above that amount is forfeited to the government. These employees are unable to leave their jobs or take new employment. \u201cSecurity force personnel detained individuals for evading national service, generally for fewer than three days.... \u201d Further, \u201c[d]raft evaders often were used as laborers on government development projects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Milat also submitted a 2009 report, Human Rights Watch, <em>Service for Life: State Repression and Indefinite Conscription in Eritrea </em>(2009). This report covers many of the same topics as the 2008 State Department report, but it paints a much darker picture of general conditions in Eritrea. According to this report, \u201c[a] national network of jails and detention facilities holds those who try and avoid national service alongside political prisoners and those imprisoned solely for their religious beliefs. Torture, cruel[] and degrading treatment, and forced labor are routine.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[t]hose who try and flee the country are imprisoned or risk being shot on sight at the border. Refugees who fled ... and were forcibly repatriated have faced detention and torture upon return to Eritrea.\u201d National Service includes military service, but also deployment \u201cin what constitutes illegal forced labor.\u201d \u201cThose who try and evade national service are treated cruelly. Evaders are detained in terrible conditions, and heavy penalties are imposed on the families of those who evade service or flee the country.\u201d \u201cThe Eritrean government considers leaving the country without a valid exit visa a crime, and absconding from National Service is viewed as tantamount to treason.\u201d Thus, \u201cpunishments inflicted on asylum seekers who are forcibly returned are terrible, including torture and death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Rather than accept permanent assignment to the Defense Ministry, Milat refused to sign his mobilization forms. Instead, he contacted the Ministry of Education in an effort to obtain a different assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">A few months later, Milat was on his way home from work when he observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>military policemen outside his home questioning his family. Believing the police were there to arrest him for evading conscription, Milat ran away to stay with a friend. Milat then decided to flee the country. Milat left Eritrea with his national identification card, but without a passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Milat fears return to Eritrea because he believes his former supervisor, Lieutenant Colonel Asmerom, \u201cmust have informed t[he] government\u201d about his political cartoon critical of the government\u2019s decision to close Asmara University. Milat believes this because, he claims, \u201c[i]t is normal operating procedure for the superior to give a full report to the government regarding the person who has fled.\u201d He believes that the government \u201cnow considers [him] a political opponent of the regime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Milat\u2019s sister, Feven Ghirmay Milat, lived in Eritrea until recently. She testified before the IJ that, if her brother Milat returns to Eritrea, \u201c[h]e would be imprisoned and would encounter other problems.\u201d When asked to elaborate on what she meant by \u201cother problems,\u201d Milat\u2019s sister explained: \u201cIt\u2019s not only imprisonment that happens to people like that. Some of them are being killed and some of them have a lot of things that happen to a lot of people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Milat\u2019s brother, mother, and uncles remain in Eritrea. Milat testified that he still communicates with them. The IJ asked Milat why he had not submitted a letter from his mother as part of his asylum application, to corroborate his story about the police visit at his home, for example. Milat explained that he thought government officials might inspect the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">After he fled Eritrea, the Eritrean government furnished Milat with two passports \u2014 notwithstanding his belief that the Eritrean government considered him a political opponent. Milat obtained an Eritrean passport from the Eritrean embassy in Sudan. To obtain the passport, Milat signed a statement acknowledging he was aware of the consequences of leaving Eritrea without permission. Milat claims the Eritrean government keeps this statement on file to \u201cbe used against\u201d him if he returns; the statement, he says, shows \u201cthat you were a traitor.\u201d Milat used this passport to travel to the United Arab Emirates, where he lost the passport. Again, the Eritrean embassy provided him a passport, his second, and with this passport he traveled to South America. Milat also testified that the Eritrean government provided him copies of his birth certificate, university degree, and temporary certificate of graduation. On cross-examination, Milat explained that Eritrean government issued him these documents because it did not want its citizens going to the Ethiopian government to obtain these same documents. <em>See generally Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 111-12 (5th Cir.2006) (describing the history of tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia after the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Milat traveled from South America to Mexico, and then he entered the United States at or near Brownsville, Texas. The Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear in immigration court charging Milat as subject to removal as an alien present in the United States illegally in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i) (commonly referred to as section 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae of the Immigration and Nationality Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">After listening to testimony and considering the record, the IJ issued an oral decision denying Milat\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal, and granting his application for protection under the CAT. The IJ found that Milat did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>not establish past persecution within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d). The IJ observed that the evidence did not establish that the police\u2019s reason for the visit to the Milat\u2019s family home was to arrest him. The IJ also concluded Milat failed to show well-founded fear of persecution because his flight from Eritrea amounted to desertion \u2014 failure to fulfill his National Service obligation. Further, the IJ reasoned that there is no evidence Milat\u2019s supervisor reported his political cartoon to authorities, so there was no reason to conclude the knowledge of his political cartoon should be imputed to the government. Finally, the IJ concluded Milat had not shown that his conscription in the National Service would force him to participate in inhumane conduct as a journalist for the Ministry of Defense. The IJ did, however, grant his application for CAT relief based on the Eritrean government\u2019s practices and its appalling human rights record.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">On appeal, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s findings and denied Milat\u2019s request for remand so the IJ could consider new evidence. Milat timely petitioned for review to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We have jurisdiction to review legal claims raised in a petition for review of a BIA decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cHowever, a petitioner must exhaust all administrative remedies before appealing to this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing \u00a7 1252(d)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>Orellana-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 517 (5th Cir.2012).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review the factual findings for substantial evidence. <em>Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 536 (5th Cir.2009). Our review of factual findings is narrow in scope. We will not substitute our judgment for the factfinder\u2019s on credibility determinations. Orella<em>na-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518. And we will reverse for lack of substantial evidence only if we decide \u201cnot only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but also that the evidence <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538 (\u201c[W]e must defer to the BIA\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find otherwise.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Milat petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decision denying his asylum application and his application for withholding of removal, and he raises two issues. (A) Milat argues the BIA erred in concluding that Milat did not show persecution. Milat argues the BIA\u2019s error arises from its suppositions that the Eritrean government could lawfully prosecute him for evading conscription, and that Milat did not show persecution on account of his political opinions as expressed through a political cartoon. (B) Milat also argues the BIA should have remanded his case back to the IJ for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>consideration in light of newly discovered evidence concerning human rights violations in Eritrea. Because Milat does not challenge the IJ\u2019s ruling granting him relief under the CAT,- we do not review this decision. The government opposes the petition arguing any punishment Milat would receive on return to Eritrea \u201cwould be the result of his failure to reenlist in the Eritrean National Service,\u201d and not on account of a protected ground under the INA such as for his political opinion. The government also argues the BIA \u201cacted well within its considerable discretion in denying ... Milat\u2019s motion to remand.\u201d These issues are addressed in turn below.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">A. The BIA\u2019s Decision Denying Asylum and Upholding Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Milat challenges the BIA\u2019s decision denying his asylum application and denying his application for withholding of removal. Because \u201cthe failure to establish a well-founded fear for asylum eligibility also forecloses eligibility for withholding of removal,\u201d <em>Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518, we address Milat\u2019s asylum-application argument first. <em>See id. </em>(explaining \u201cthe asylum standard is more lenient than the standard for withholding of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u201cSection 208(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the Attorney General, in his discretion, to grant asylum to an alien who is a \u2018refugee\u2019 as defined in the Act....\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). The statute defines \u201crefugee\u201d as any person \u201cwho is unable or unwilling to return\u201d to the country of the person\u2019s nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of [1] race, [2] religion, [3] nationality, [4] membership in a particular social group, or [5] political opinion....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Thus, to obtain asylum, the applicant must demonstrate either past persecution or a reasonable, well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of the five enumerated factors. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Zamora-Morel v. I.N.S., </em>905 F.2d 833, 837 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">In this case, Milat argues he is unable or unwilling to return to Eritrea under only one of the protected factors\u2014 persecution on account of his political opinion. To demonstrate persecution \u201con account of\u2019 political opinion, the burden is on the alien to prove his \u201cpolitical opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i). \u201c[Although a statutorily protected ground need not be the only reason for harm, it cannot be \u2018incidental, tangential, superficial, or subordinate to another reason for harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shaikh v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 861, 864 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Milat argues he has suffered past persecution, and has a well-founded fear of future persecution, because he evaded his conscription into the Eritrean National Service and he will be punished if he returns. Thus, Milat\u2019s appeal turns in part on whether the Eritrean National Service, of itself, constitutes persecution on account of political opinion under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The parties disagree about the legal significance of Eritrean National Service and the Eritrean government\u2019s practices enforcing its conscription laws. Milat argues that courts distinguish between \u201ccircumstances whe[re] conscription is illegitimate\u201d and \u201cnormal circumstances [where] a country maintains the right to conscript citizens for military service and to punish them ... for refusing to serve.\u201d For this proposition, Milat relies on persuasive authority from the BIA and other circuits. The government concedes that \u201cpunishment for avoiding military service may constitute persecution\u201d in some cases. But the government argues these sit\u00faa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>tions fall within limited exceptions that apply only if the result is a \u201cdisproportionately severe punishment on account of a protected ground,\u201d such as political opinion, or would effectively conscript the alien \u201cto engage in inhumane conduct.\u201d Because Milat\u2019s case does not fall within these exceptions, the government argues we should deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"> In accordance with the view of the other circuits that have considered the question, we hold that punishment for violation of conscription laws of general applicability does not in itself constitute \u201cpersecution\u201d on account of political opinion under \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812 (rejecting view that a political \u201corganization\u2019s attempt to conscript a person into its military forces necessarily constitutes \u2018persecution on account of ... political opinion\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original)); <em>see also </em>Deborah Anker, <em>Law of Asylum in the United States </em>\u00a7 4.6 (2014) (\u201c[Pjrosecution for refusal to obey compulsory military service laws \u2018generally does not constitute persecution....\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1097 (9th Cir.2005)). Further, we conclude that prosecution for avoiding military conscription may constitute \u201cpersecution\u201d only if the applicant shows either (1) the penalty imposed would be disproportionately severe on account of a protected ground, or (2) the applicant would be required to engage in inhumane conduct as part of military service. <em>Arbabian v. I.N.S., </em>995 F.2d 222, 1993 WL 209978, at *1 (5th Cir. June 4, 1993) (unpublished) (citing <em>Alonzo v. I.N.S., </em>915 F.2d 546, 548 (9th Cir.1990); <em>Barraza Rivera v. I.N.S., </em>913 F.2d 1443, 1451 (9th Cir.1990)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">We have consistently reached this conclusion in unpublished opinions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and after careful consideration, we reach the same conclusion here. We are guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in analogous circumstances in <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>and we are persuaded by the decisions of our sister circuits and the BIA on similar facts. In <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>the \u201cprincipal question presented ... [was] whether a guerilla organization\u2019s attempt to coerce a person into performing military service <em>necessarily </em>constitutes \u2018persecution on account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>... political opinion.\u2019 \u201d 502 U.S. at 479, 112 5.Ct. 812. There, guerrillas invaded the home of Elias-Zacarias in Guatemala, their faces masked by bandanas, and harangued Elias-Zacarias and his parents to get him to join them in their war against the Guatemalan government. The guerrillas eventually left, but they told Elias-Zacarias that they would be back and he should think it over. Elias-Zacarias did not want to join because he feared the government would retaliate, and he fled. The Ninth Circuit held \u201cacts of conscription by a nongovernmental group constitute persecution on account of political opinion,\u201d and Elias-Zacarias had a well-founded fear of conscription and, therefore, persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 112 S.Ct. 812. The Supreme Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The Court explained that the fact \u201cthe guerillas seek to fill their ranks ... [to] pursue their political goals ... does not render the forced recruitment \u2018persecution on account of ... political opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 112 S.Ct. 812. An applicant for asylum fleeing conscription \u201cstill has to establish that the record ... compels the conclusion that he has a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that the guerrillas will persecute him <em>because of </em>that political opinion, rather than because of his refusal to fight with them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483, 112 S.Ct. 812. Because Elias-Zacarias sought judicial reversal of the BIA\u2019s determination denying asylum, the Court ruled \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to And the requisite fear of persecution. That he has not done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812. Thus, under <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>Milat\u2019s argument that \u201cany punishment for escape [from conscription] ... would be persecution\u201d is therefore unavailing. A fear of persecution based only on a refusal to be conscripted into military service is not sufficient. Milat must show that he fears persecution from the Eritrean government <em>because of </em>his political opinion, rather than because of his refusal to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Our sister circuits have concluded that an asylum applicant\u2019s fear of punishment for evading military service establishes a well-founded fear of persecution in only two circumstances: the applicant must either establish that he would face disproportionate and severe punishment for refusing to serve on account of a protected ground, or that military service will necessarily require the applicant to participate in inhumane conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Ninth Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>cuit\u2019s decision in <em>Zehayte v. Gonzales </em>is illustrative. 453 F.3d 1182 (9th Cir.2006). There, Zehayte, an Eritrean national, entered the United States and sought asylum. Zehayte appealed the IJ\u2019s decision denying her asylum application. Zehayte made arguments similar to Milat\u2019s here. She argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that she had a well-founded fear of persecution \u201cbecause she refused to serve in the military, [and] she will be persecuted if she is forced to return to Eritrea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1186. Like Milat, Zehayte was conscripted into the Eritrean National Service and was assigned to the army, and she fled the country to evade conscription. Zehayte claimed that as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, her religious beliefs forbade her from serving in the military. The Ninth Circuit rejected these arguments and denied Zehayte\u2019s petition for review. The court explained \u201cforced conscription or punishment for evasion of military duty generally does not constitute persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1187. Further, the court held Zehayte\u2019s circumstances did not \u201cfit within the exceptions to this rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court explained Zehayte did not present evidence that she would have been required to participate in activities \u201cinternationally condemned [as] inhumane,\u201d or that \u201cshe would be singled out for severe disproportionate punishment for refusing to serve in the Eritrean military.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1187-88. We reached the same conclusion in our unpublished opinion in <em>Paz-Caballero </em>for the same reasons. 1995 WL 71383, at *2-4 (holding \u201c[c]onscription, without more, is not persecution under the [INA],\u201d and denying petition for review in part because \u201cPaz-Caballero has made no showing that he was singled out for any [reason other than his potential as an effective soldier]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Applying this rule, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision denying Milat\u2019s application for asylum was supported by substantial evidence. Although the evidence is conflicting,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the State Department report suggests that evasion of Eritrean National Service obligations generally results in brief detentions. <em>See Rojas, </em>937 F.2d at 190 n. 1 (noting that reports from the State Department are \u201cthe most appropriate and perhaps the best resource ... to obtain information on political situations in foreign nations\u201d). Moreover, Milat does not point to any direct evidence that he would be singled out and disproportionate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ly punished for evading conscription on account of his political views. The IJ and BIA could have reasonable concluded based on the evidence that officials at the Ministry of Defense did not know about his political inclinations. He did not speak with his mother or other family members about why the police came to the family home. He could only speculate as to whether his former supervisor, Lieutenant Colonel Asmerom, reported him to the authorities for his political cartoon critical of the government\u2019s decision to close Asmara University. Nor does he indicate that his request for a reassignment within the National Service itself would be viewed as an expression of political opposition to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Moreover, Milat admitted on cross-examination that the Eritrean government repeatedly furnished him with travel documents, his university certificate, and other information after he had fled the country. This evidence tends to undermine his argument that the Eritrean government views him as a political opponent. Without evidence that the Eritrean government knew of his political opinions or that the government may have imputed some political opinion to him due to his desire for a reassignment within the National Service, the IJ and the BIA reasonably concluded Milat had not shown that any persecution would be <em>because of </em>his political opinions. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 488, 112 S.Ct. 812 (holding that an applicant for asylum fleeing conscription \u201cstill has to establish that the record ... compels the conclusion that he has a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that the guerrillas will persecute him <em>because of </em>that political opinion, rather than because of his refusal to fight with them.\u201d). Further, Milat\u2019s testimony indicated that he was not personally required to participate in any inhumane activities as a journalist at the Ministry of Defense, nor did he establish that he would be required to perform inhumane activities were he to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Therefore, the record on which the BIA rendered its decision does not compel a finding that Milat either was persecuted on account of his political opinion, or that he has a well-founded fear that he would be persecuted on account of his political beliefs were he to return to Eritrea. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134. Milat therefore has failed to show that he is entitled to asylum. Because Milat is not entitled to asylum, he also is not entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See Orellana-Monson, </em>685 F.3d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">B. Motion to Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Milat argues the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to remand his case to the IJ for rehearing based on the following new evidence: the United Nations 2000 Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime; the State Department\u2019s 2012 Trafficking in Persons Report; the State Department\u2019s 2011 Country Report on Human Rights Practices; the United Nations 1967 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the 2012 report of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom; the 2011 report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (\u201cUNHCR\u201d) providing guidelines for assessing the protective needs of asylum seekers from Eritrea; the Department of Labor\u2019s 2010 and 2009 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor; and a United Nations Security Council resolution from December 2011 condemning Eritrea for its aggression as to neighboring Djibouti.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>We review the denial of a motion to remand \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>See Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 451-52 (5th Cir.2001) (explaining that a motion to remand for the consideration of new evidence is considered to be the same in substance as a motion to reopen a removal proceeding). This Court will affirm this decision \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304 (citation and internal quotations marks omitted). \u201cA motion to [remand for new evidence] shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing....\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also Matter of Ige, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 880, 883 (BIA 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Here, the United Nations documents from 1967 and 1980 were available when Milat\u2019s case was before the IJ and could have been presented then. Those documents could not serve as a basis for a remand. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The State Department\u2019s documents from 2011 and 2012 cover similar material but paint a darker picture of Eritrea than the 2008 report does. The UNHCR report describes the National Service program and the steep penalties for evasion, penalties that include \u201cdetention for long periods often in inhumane conditions, torture and forced labour.\u201d The report also notes the grounds for seeking asylum under the INA and states that \u201c[i]n practice, the punishment for desertion or evasion is so severe and disproportionate such as to amount to persecution.\u201d The report further states that \u201c[r]efusal to perform national service may be regarded by the Eritrean authorities as an expression of political opposition to the Government,\u201d and that \u201c[p]ersons who evade or desert military service may be regarded as disloyal and treasonous towards the Government, and therefore punished for their perceived disloyalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">These documents tend to suggest that the Eritrean National Service is a hybrid of traditional military conscription and a system of forced labor akin to slavery. However, the documents on which the BIA rendered its decision denying asylum also suggested this, though to a lesser degree. Moreover, the documents do not establish that Milat would have had any political opinions imputed to him beyond possibly a general opposition to the Eritrean government based on his escape from the country to avoid the National Service. Additionally, Milat was granted relief under the CAT. Thus, the apparently increased possibility of torture were he to be returned to Eritrea was no longer an issue when the BIA was considering whether to remand the case because Milat will not be going back to Eritrea.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>motion for remand was not arbitrary or irrational based on the record before the BIA at the time it denied the motion. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"Adu\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Agt\">We recognize that the evidence indicates the practices of the Eritrean government in enforcing its program of National Service are coercive and disturbing. We also note that some of the evidence submitted in support of Milat\u2019s motion for remand indicates that refusal to participate in National Service may be imputed as political opposition to the Government. On this record, however, we cannot say the IJ\u2019s finding was unsupported .by substantial evidence, nor can we say the BIA\u2019s denial of Milat\u2019s motion for remand was irrational or arbitrary. Therefore, Milat\u2019s PETITION IS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">.

The government contends Milat did not present his argument based on the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate conscription in his appeal to the BIA, and therefore, this argument is unexhausted.

If he were conscripted, it would be because he had not completed his military service requirement rather than because of his political beliefs.

Milat filed a letter under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) to notify the Court of the BIA's decision in <em>Gebrengus; </em>however, Milat's reliance on <em>Gebrengus </em>is misplaced because that decision is distinguishable. In <em>Gebrengus, </em>the petitioner was conscripted into the National Service in the, eleventh grade. When he declined, he was taken to a detention camp, where he was held in a cell and poorly fed. He fled after five days and ultimately made his way to the United States. He was denied asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. On appeal to the BIA, the petitioner submitted a 2012 trafficking report and a 2012 religious freedom report, which the petitioner argued \"demonstrate that the national service program is essentially involuntary servitude.\u201d The BIA granted the motion for remand \"[i]n light of this additional evidence about current country conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Unlike Milat the petitioner in <em>Gebrengus </em>was denied asylum, withholding of removal, <em>and </em>protection under the Convention Against Torture, and the BIA remanded for consideration to decide whether the petitioner might be entitled to relief under the CAT, among other issues. In contrast, here, Milat received protection under the CAT. Further, the petitioner in <em>Gebrengus </em>refused to participate in National Service at all, whereas Milat merely sought reassignment from one branch of National Service to another before he fled the country. Thus, Milat and the petitioner in <em>Gebrengus </em>were not identically situated, and <em>Gebrengus </em>does not render the denial of Mi-lat\u2019s motion for remand irrational or arbitrary so as to constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 304.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
