The trial court granted that motion, adding an award of noneconomic damages, and, after the defendant refused the additur, ordered a new trial on the issue of damages. The defendant, Joao Sousa, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment. The Appellate Court, in reviewing the action of the trial court on a motion to set aside a verdict, in accordance with our well established precedent, examined whether the court had abused its discretion and whether, on the evidence presented, the jury fairly could have reached the conclusion that it did. See <em>Birgel </em>v. Heintz, 163 Conn. 23, 26, 301 A.2d 249 (1972), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u201cIn passing upon a motion to set aside a verdict, the trial judge must do just what every juror ought to do in arriving at a verdict. The juror must use all his experience, his knowledge of human nature, his knowledge of human events, past and present, his knowledge of the motives which influence and control human action, and test the evidence in the case according to such knowledge and render his verdict accordingly. . . . The trial judge in considering the verdict must do the same . . . and if, in the exercise of all his knowledge from this source, he finds the verdict to be so clearly against the weight of the evidence in the case as to indicate that the jury did not correctly apply the law to the facts in evidence in the case, or were governed by ignorance, prejudice, corruption or partiality, then it is his duty to set aside that verdict and to grant a new trial. . . . The trial judge has abroad legal discretion and his action will not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse. ... A mere doubt of the adequacy of the verdict is an insufficient basis for such action. ... A conclusion that the jury exercised merely poor judgment is likewise insufficient. . . . The ultimate test which must be applied to the verdict by the trial court is whether the jury\u2019s award falls somewhere within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages or whether the size of the verdict so shocks the sense of justice as to compel the conclusion that the jury were influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake or cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ruption.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Without relying on the per se rule of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>112 Conn. 228, 232, 152 A. 64 (1930), which we overruled today in <em>Wichers </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>252 Conn. 174, 176, 745 A.2d 789 (2000), the trial court in this case evaluated the evidence and the jury\u2019s award in a manner consistent with its statutory authority<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and our jurisprudence sanctioning the exercise of its discretion in appropriate circumstances. Exercising its appropriate role, the Appellate Court properly affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\"> We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court; <em>Gladu </em>v. <em>Sousa, 52 </em>Conn.
