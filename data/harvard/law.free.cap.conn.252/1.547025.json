We answer the reservation in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">The stipulation reveals the following facts. The plaintiffs are John P. Burke, the banking commissioner of the state of Connecticut (commissioner), and the state of Connecticut. The defendants, Fleet National Bank (Fleet), First Union National Bank (First Union), and BankBoston, N.A. (BankBoston), are national banks that have established and operate ATMs in Connecticut. An ATM is defined under Connecticut law as \u201ca stationary or mobile unattended device, including a satellite device but excluding a point of sale terminal, at which banking transactions, including, but not limited to, deposits, withdrawals, advances, payments or transfers, may be conducted . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36a-2 (3). A point of sale terminal is defined as \u201ca device located in a commercial establishment at which sales transactions can be charged directly to the buyer\u2019s deposit, loan or credit account, but at which deposit transactions cannot be conducted . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36a-2 (45).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">In addition to servicing its own depositors, an establishing bank<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> may, through its participation in an ATM network, process transactions for nondepositors who hold ATM car ds issued by other banks, also called card-issuing banks, which are members of the ATM network. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>There are three types of charges associated with transactions processed through an ATM network. First, an interchange fee is a fee that an establishing bank receives from another member bank in the network, whose depositor uses the establishing bank\u2019s ATM. Second, the ATM depositor fee\u201cis a fee charged by a bank to its own depositor for use of an ATM operated by either the depositor\u2019s bank or another bank. Third, the ATM nondepositor fee, also commonly referred to as a convenience fee or surcharge, is a fee charged by an establishing bank to a nondepositor who uses that bank\u2019s ATM. At issue in this appeal is the permissibility under state law of imposing the ATM nondepositor fee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The issue raised by this appeal originated with an interpretive letter issued by the commissioner in September, 1995, which declared that \u00a7 36a-156 implicitly prohibits ATM nondepositor fees. In January, 1997, Fleet brought an action against the commissioner and the state banking department in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, claiming that \u00a7 36a-156 does not prohibit ATM nondepositor fees, or, in the alternative, that federal law preempts any such prohibition. The District Court granted summary judgment for Fleet, holding that \u00a7 36a-156 does not prohibit ATM nondepositor fees. <em>Fleet Bank, National Assn. </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>23 F. Sup. 2d 196, 203 (D. Conn. 1998). On appeal from that judgment, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Fleet Bank, National Assn. </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>160 F.3d 883, 893 (2d Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1004, 119 S. Ct. 2340, 144 L. Ed. 2d 237 (1999). Accordingly, the Second Circuit vacated the judgment and directed that the action be dismissed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Fleet and First Union immediately brought separate actions against the commissioner, which since have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, claiming various violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See <em>First Union National Bank </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 3:98CV2171 (JBA) (D. Conn. April 7, 1999). Thereafter, the commissioner, invoking General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-50<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>and 36a-52,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> issued atemporary ex parte order and notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>of hearing, claiming that Fleet, First Union and Bank-Boston were in violation of \u00a7 36a-156 by imposing ATM nondepositor fees, and ordering those banks to cease and desist from that practice. The banks requested a hearing in accordance with \u00a7 36a-50. The hearing was postponed while the District Court considered requests for a preliminary injunction filed by the banks and the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller), during which time the banks agreed not to impose ATM nondepositor fees. The commissioner did not proceed with the hearing with respect to Bank-Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">After receiving the cease and desist order, Fleet and First Union filed applications for an injunction in the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 36a-52 (d) to set aside or suspend the enforcement of the order. After a hearing, the trial court, <em>Teller, J., </em>denied the banks\u2019 applications for an injunction. <em>Fleet National Bank </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 566, 580, 727 A.2d 823 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Shortly thereafter, the Comptroller intervened in the consolidated action seeking to restrain the administrative hearing by virtue of a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>and the banking department. The District Court granted the Comptroller\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, and prohibited the commissioner from continuing with the pending administrative proceedings against Fleet and First Union until final disposition of the merits of the Comptroller\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>First Union National Bank </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>supra, United States District Court, Docket No. 3:98CV2171 (JBA). That decision expressly did not preclude either the Comptroller from initiating its own administrative proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 36a-156, or the commissioner from seeking enforcement through the state courts. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The commissioner then brought this action in the Superior Court, pursuant to his authority under \u00a7 36a-50 (b), to enforce his interpretation of \u00a7 36a-156, as described in his September, 1995 interpretive letter. At the request of all parties, and to expedite the resolution of this litigation, the trial court, <em>Hon. Jerry Wagner, </em>judge trial referee, approved the joint stipulation of facts and reserved the following question for the advice of the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-235<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 73-1:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cDoes General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>utes \u00a7 36a-156 prohibit a bank which has established an automated teller machine from charging a fee to a nondepositor who uses the bank\u2019s machine?\u201d We transferred the reservation from the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2. We answer the reservation in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We first address the applicable standard of review. \u201cOrdinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . [A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 389, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio Power, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 635, 642, 708 A.2d 202 (1998); <em>Dept. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>226 Conn. 670, 678, 628 A.2d 957 (1993). \u201cCases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 389; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio Power, Inc., </em>supra, 642; <em>Dept. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>supra, 678. \u201cFurthermore, when a state agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 389; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio Power, Inc., </em>supra, 642; <em>Dept. of Administrative Services </em>v. <em>Employees\u2019 Review Board, </em>supra, 678-79. Whether \u00a7 36a-156 implicitly prohibits ATM nondepositor fees had not been subject to judicial consideration prior to the commissioner\u2019s interpretive letter,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and is purely a question of law concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. We therefore give no special deference to the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 36a-156.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The question reserved for this court presents a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Id.; <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755-56, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bortner </em>v. <em>Woobridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 258-59, 736 A.2d 104 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 36a-156 prohibits the imposition of ATM nondepositor fees because it imposes only an interchange fee and thus implicitly disallows the imposition of any other fees. The plaintiffs expressly contend, however, that \u00a7 36a-156 does not prohibit depositor fees. The defendants argue that \u00a7 36a-156 does not prohibit such fees because the statute does not govern the fees that may be charged to customers, whether depositors or nondepositors. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">We conclude that \u00a7 36a-156 governs the establishment of ATMs by banks, the conditions under which <em>other </em>banks must be afforded access to those ATMs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>and the financial terms, as between the establishing bank and the other banks, of that access. We further conclude that \u00a7 36a-156 does not, either expressly or by implication, govern the imposition of customer fees, whether depositor fees or nondepositor fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We start with the statutory language at issue. Section 36a-156 provides: \u201c(a) One or more banks, Connecticut credit unions or federal credit unions which have established a satellite device or point of sale terminal shall make the satellite device or point of sale terminal available <em>on a nondiscriminatory basis </em>for use by any other bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union, <em>upon payment </em>by each such other bank or credit union <em>of a reasonably proportionate share of all acquisition, installation and operating costs </em>of the satellite device or point of sale terminal. The satellite device or point of sale terminal shall identify with equal prominence all of the banks, credit unions or network systems which use the satellite device or point of sale terminal, (b) Any bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union which has established an automated teller machine which is not a satellite device may, in its discretion, permit any other bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union to use such automated teller machine, provided, (1) if such permission is granted to any other bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union, the automated teller machine is made available <em>on a nondiscriminatory basis </em>for use by any other bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union, <em>upon payment of reasonably proportionate costs </em>as described under subsection (a) of this section, and (2) such use is otherwise in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">We first recognize the differences among the three types of banking devices covered by the statute \u2014 specifically, satellite device, point of sale terminal and automated teller machine which is not a satellite device <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>(hereinafter nonsatellite device). A satellite device is defined as \u201can automated teller machine which is not part of an office of the bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union which has established such machine . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36a-2 (51). In common parlance, a satellite device is an ATM machine located not at a bank, but elsewhere, such as in a supermarket or an office building lobby. A point of sale terminal is defined as \u201ca device located in a commercial establishment at which sales transactions can be charged directly to the buyer\u2019s deposit, loan or credit account, but at which deposit transactions cannot be conducted . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36a-2 (45). A point of sale terminal is not an ATM machine, but rather a device by which a customer may make a purchase at a commercial establishment. Point of sale terminals are commonly located in supermarket checkout lines and pharmacies. Finally, a nonsatellite device is an ATM machine located in a branch of the establishing bank\u2014 e.g., a Fleet ATM machine located at a Fleet branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Although the title of a statute is not determinative of its meaning, we often have looked to a statute\u2019s title as some evidence of that meaning. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 147, 698 A.2d 297 (1997); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 554, 400 A.2d 712 (1978). The title of \u00a7 36a-156, \u201cAvailability of machines, devices and terminals for use by other banks and credit unions,\u201d is indicative of the statute\u2019s limited purpose. It suggests that the statute governs the manner in which the establishing bank shall make the banking devices available to other banks. It makes no mention of how the establishing bank shall treat customers, whether depositors or nondepositors.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Although the language of the statute refers to the three types of banking devices described previously, the statute treats satellite devices and point of sale terminals differently from nonsatellite devices. Subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>tion (a) of the statute applies only to satellite devices and point of sale terminals. Subsection (a) of \u00a7 36a-156 provides in relevant part: \u201cOne or more banks . . . which have established a satellite device or point of sale terminal <em>shall make </em>the satellite device or point of sale terminal available on a nondiscriminatory basis . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) This provision mandates that banks that have established satellite devices or point of sale terminals make the device available on a nondiscriminatory basis for use by any other bank, so long as the other bank pays the interchange fee. To illustrate, if bank A establishes a satellite device or a point of sale terminal, it must grant access to banks B, C and D, so long as these other banks pay the interchange fee. There is no discretion given to the establishing bank under subsection (a) of \u00a7 36a-156 as to the availability of these devices to other banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In contrast to subsection (a), however, subsection (b) of \u00a7 36a-156 applies only to nonsatellite devices, and gives banks discretion to make the device available to any other bank. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 36a-156 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny bank . . . which has established an automated teller machine which is not a satellite device <em>may, in its discretion, </em>permit any other bank ... to use such automated teller machine <em>... on a nondiscriminatory basis </em>. . ..\u201d (Emphasis added.) To illustrate, if bank A establishes and operates a nonsatel-lite device, it is not required under \u00a7 36a-156 to provide any other bank with access to its nonsatellite device. If, however, bank A chooses to grant such access to bank B, it must then provide the same access to banks C and D, so long as banks B, C and D pay the interchange fee, as required by \u00a7 36a-156. Stated another way, the statute prohibits bank A from allying with bank B in order to form an exclusive ATM network, thereby excluding banks C and D. The contrast between subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 36a-156 is significant because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>highlights the statute\u2019s purpose in governing bank-to-bank relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Although the establishing bank has discretion in one type of situation and not in the other, the common denominator is that access, once granted by the establishing bank to another bank, either voluntarily with regard to nonsatellite devices or by statutory mandate with regard to satellite devices and point of sale terminals, must be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis. The statute expressly envisions a type of ATM network in which an establishing bank makes available on a nondiscriminatory basis its ATM machines and point of sale terminals, \u201cupon payment by each such other bank or credit union of a reasonably proportionate share of all acquisition, installation and operating costs . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36a-156 (a). The statutory language regarding the interchange fee provides the condition to the nondiscrimination requirement: availability of the banking devices must be made on a nondiscriminatory basis, so long as the card-issuing bank pays the interchange fee. This statutory language evinces a legislative intent to facilitate shared ATM networks and to prohibit exclusionary ATM networks.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Furthermore, the last sentence of subsection (a) of \u00a7 36a-156 supports the construction that the legislature intended to prevent banking configurations that would favor, or discriminate against, certain card-issuing banks. That provision provides: \u201cThe satellite device or point of sale terminal shall identify <em>with equal prominence </em>all of the banks, credit unions or network systems which use the satellite device or point of sale terminal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 36a-156 (a). The statute, therefore, prohibits the establishing bank from creating a network that favors one member bank over another.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">To summarize, we are presented with \u00a7 36a-156 entitled: \u201cAvailability of machines, devices and terminals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>for use by other banks and credit unions.\u201d It recognizes three different types of banking devices \u2014 satellite devices, point of sale terminals and nonsatellite devices. It regulates two of these types of devices differently from the third type. In all situations where nondiscriminatory access is required, however, the statute permits the estabhshing bank to charge \u201ca reasonably proportionate share of all acquisition, installation and operating costs . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36a-156 (a). Conspicuously absent from this statute is any language referring to fees or charges that may or may not be directly imposed on customers \u2014 either depositors or nondepositors of the establishing bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We next look to the statute\u2019s legislative history. There is nothing in the legislative history of Substitute Senate Bill No. 401, the bill eventually enacted as Public Acts 1975, No. 373, and codified as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-156 through 36a-159, to support the argument that \u00a7 36a-156 implicitly prohibits ATM nondepositor fees. To the contrary, the legislative history supports our conclusion that the enactment of this statutory scheme provided the framework in which state banks could establish ATMs and point of sale terminals. The legislative history also supports our construction that the discrimination addressed by the statute solely concerns the establishing bank\u2019s discrimination or selectivity among other banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">The legislative history demonstrates that \u00a7 36a-156 was the state legislature\u2019s response to the grant of authority by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Comptroller in December, 1974, to federal savings and loan associations and national banks to establish satellite devices and point of sale terminals. 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1975 Sess., p. 4868; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Banks, 1975 Sess., pp. 211, 214, 224, 237, 240, 244, 257. These national financial institutions could establish such devices without regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>state bank branching laws because, according to the Comptroller, these devices were not \u201cbranches.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, pp. 211, 214. In 1973, however, the state attorney general had opined that the commissioner lacked the authority to permit state banks to operate these devices. Id., pp. 212, 240. Without any action taken by the state legislature, therefore, state financial institutions would not have been able to offer the same services as their national counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Legislative committee hearings may be relevant to the meaning of statutes because they often demonstrate the problem or issue that the legislature sought to address by the statute. <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development </em>Associates, 244 Conn. 189, 197, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998); <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>213 Conn. 548, 559-60, 569 A.2d 518 (1990). The hearings regarding the legislation eventually codified as \u00a7\u00a7 36a-156 through 36a-159 indicate that the banking industry had two primary concerns: first, that state chartered banks did not have authority similar to federally chartered banks to establish satellite devices and point of sale terminals; and second, that smaller financial institutions would be excluded from ATM networks in the absence of mandatory sharing.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">During the committee hearings, members of the banking industry acknowledged the disadvantage that state banks would encounter without the same ability as national institutions to establish these banking devices. For example, Elliott C. Miller, then senior vice president of Society for Savings, stated before the joint standing committee on banks: \u201c[This bill] empowers state banking institutions to establish and use satellite devices and point-of-sale terminals.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 210. Miller, representing a state chartered financial institution, recognized the need for such legislation, pointing out that \u201cfederal reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ulatory agencies \u2014 the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the [Comptroller] \u2014 have already started to authorize the use of these facilities by the federally chartered institutions under their respective jurisdictions.\u201d Id., p. 211. Miller further stated: \u201c[W]e, the state chartered financial institutions, are asking, through this legislation, to be allowed to adapt to change along with our federally chartered sister institutions.\u201d Id., p. 213. Similarly, Stephen J. Sweeney, then assistant treasurer of the Naugatuck Savings Bank, made the following comments during the committee hearings: \u201c[A]s you know there is presently legislation which would allow national banks to recognize satellite stations. In Nauga-tuck where there are two national banks, the competitive disadvantage for the Naugatuck Savings Bank would be a dimension the results of which would be disastrous for us.\u201d Id., pp. 224-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Not only do the committee hearings demonstrate the need to give state banks the authority to establish these banking devices, the hearings also demonstrate the purpose to prevent exclusionary ATM networks. For example, during the committee hearings, Stanley Spilecki, then chairman of the special committee on electronic funds transfer systems for the Savings Banks\u2019 Association of Connecticut, made the following statement: \u201cWithout shared satellite facilities only a few very large institutions would be able to set up a network of devices necessary to dominate the rapidly approaching era of electronic funds transfer systems. This is true now because only the large institutions have the research staff to find the best location for satellite facilities, the resources to purchase or control these locations, and the resources to put in place the expensive equipment and support them in a manner most likely for success.\u201d Id., p. 216. This statement recognizes that, because smaller banks may not have the resources necessary to establish and to operate ATMs and point of sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>terminals, they might otherwise be precluded from such ATM usage. Without a provision such as \u00a7 36a-156 providing for nondiscriminatory participation, larger financial institutions could ally with one another, form an ATM network, and deny participation to smaller institutions that could not provide ATM and point of sale services to their depositors on their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The floor debate also indicates that the legislature sought to ensure that state chartered banks would not be precluded from competing in this area. During one Senate debate, when Senator Richard C. Bozzuto was asked when outlying communities could expect ATM machines, he responded: \u201cAs of yet, the federal [government has] not allowed National Banks to avail themselves of this until July of 1975, so this Bill will coordinate with that privilege and I would say immediately thereafter . . . .\u201d 18 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1975 Sess., p. 2241. During the legislative debate in the House of Representatives, Representative Raymond C. Lyddy stated: \u201c[The point of sale terminal] is a revolutionary device, but Federal Agencies have already authorized this and have begun using them under Federally chartered institutions that are under their jurisdiction. This [bill] allows our financial institutions in this State, to use these same facilities and thereby enable our banks to meet the competition that will be generated by the National banking institutions.\u201d 18 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 4868.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">We are also mindful that the legislature and the banking industry, at the time of the enactment of \u00a7 36a-156, regarded this technology and the idea of mandatory shared networks as new and highly experimental. See, e.g., 18 S. Proc., supra, p. 2240, remarks of Senator Bozzuto (\u201cthe Bill will provide for a new technology within the Banking Industry\u201d); 18 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 4868, remarks of Representative Lyddy (\u201c[Substitute Senate Bill No. 401] represents a response to new tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>nology in the banking industry\u201d); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, supra, p. 249, remarks of Charles Lord, president of Hartford National Bank and Trust Company (\u201c[mandatory sharing] is highly experimental\u201d); id., pp. 210-12, remarks of Elliott C. Miller (\u201c[s]at-ellite devices represent a significant technological development as part of the banking industry\u2019s efforts to furnish traditional banking services to customers in more convenient ways . . . this whole area will be largely experimental for awhile\u201d). Such a backdrop cannot support a finding that the legislature regarded this legislation as comprehensive, as it related to ATM usage, nor that it foresaw the proliferation of such devices and fees, as the plaintiffs suggest. Rather, this historical context supports our conclusion that the legislature did not intend \u00a7 36a-156 to be an exhaustive list of fees that banks permissibly could impose in any ATM context.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Finally, in interpreting the meaning of \u00a7 36a-156, we look to the relationship between the statute at issue and existing legislation regarding the same general subject matter. In 1975, the General Assembly enacted several statutes regarding the establishment and usage of ATMs and point of sale terminals. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-155 through 36a-159. Nowhere in the language of any of these statutes does the legislature address fees <em>of any kind </em>that may be imposed on <em>customers </em>\u2014 depositors or nondepositors. In fact, the only mention of customers in this legislation appeal\u2019s in \u00a7 36a-155 (b), which confers, inter alia, power to the commissioner to adopt regulations regarding the safety of customers using these banking facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">We also look to the Deposit Account Contract Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-315 through 36a-323; for its treatment of ATM fees. First, that act is a disclosure statute that places several restrictions on the <em>manner </em>in which fees, or deposit account charges,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>imposed on depositors. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 36a-317 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo financial institution shall impose or attempt to impose any deposit account charge that has not been disclosed to the depositor pursuant to section 36a-318 or 36a-320, as applicable, or is in an amount greater than the amount disclosed to the depositor pursuant to section 36a-318 or 36a-320, as applicable. ...\u201d Similarly, General Statutes \u00a7 36a-320 (a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> specifies other notice requirements to which a bank must adhere in order to impose deposit account charges on depositors. Nowhere in the act, however, does the legislature expressly grant or deny authority to the banks to charge ATM depositor fees. That act, therefore, assumes that the authority to impose fees does exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Additionally, General Statutes \u00a7 36a-250 supports our conclusion that \u00a7 36a-156 does not address customer fees in any way, either directly, or by negative implication. Pursuant to \u00a7 36a-250, which provides an extensive list of the express powers of state banks, banks may: act as depositories of court and trust funds; General Statutes \u00a7 36a-250 (3); act as transfer agents or registrars of stocks and bonds; General Statutes \u00a7 36a-250 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>(9); establish charitable funds; General Statutes \u00a7 36a-250 (17); and provide home banking services to customers. General Statutes \u00a7 36a-250 (23). Although this statute, which provides a thirty-nine item list of banks\u2019 express powers, does not expressly provide for the imposition of ATM depositor fees, the plaintiffs concede that the banks have such power. It would be anomalous to conclude, in light of the Deposit Account Contract Act and \u00a7 36a-250, that \u00a7 36a-156 prohibits ATM nonde-positor fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the reference in \u00a7 36a-156 to the nondiscriminatory imposition of the interchange fee means that the legislature implicitly meant to prohibit the imposition of the nondepositor fees. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument rests on the axiom \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius,\u201d translated from the Latin to mean, \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\u201d Although the so-called canons of statutory construction may at times serve as useful tools in deciphering legislative meaning, to rely on any one of them as a compelling factor in the interpretive process is problematic, because as Professor Karl Llewellyn persuasively has demonstrated, \u201cthere are two opposing canons on almost every point.\u201d K. Llewellyn, \u201cRemarks on the Theory of Appellate Decision and the Rules or Canons About How Statutes Are to Be Construed,\u201d 3 Vand. L. Rev. 395, 401 (1950). The so-called \u201ccanons\u201d are not that, at least in the sense that any one of them reliably can be determined to apply or not to apply in any given case. They are, instead, merely guides drawn from experience, to be employed or not to be employed carefully and judiciously, depending on the circumstances. See F. Frankfurter, \u201cSome Reflections on the Reading of Statutes,\u201d 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 544-45 (1947); see also <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 455, 692 A.2d 742 (1997). \u201cTo permit them to displace the conclusions that careful interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>yields . . . would be a disservice to the legislative process, as well as to the judicial exercise of interpreting legislative language based upon the premise that the legislature intends to enact reasonable public policies.\u201d <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Although we have at times interpreted certain statutory provisions as demonstrating a legislative intent to exclude, by implication, other possible referents; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 766, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982) (statutory itemization demonstrates legislative intent to exclude unenumerated items); we decline to do so where there is no language, legislative history or statutory purpose suggesting that we reach such a result. See <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 584-85, 657 A.2d 212 (1995); <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Fahy, </em>227 Conn. 505, 513, 630 A.2d 1328 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Furthermore, the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the negative implication purportedly created by the statute\u2019s reference to the interchange fee is inherently inconsistent. They specifically concede that the statute does not prohibit depositor fees. It is difficult to understand how the purported negative implication could prohibit one type of customer fee but not another.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The plaintiffs also misconstrue the phrase, \u201con a nondiscriminatory basis,\u201d which is contained in \u00a7 36a-156, as it relates to the availability of ATMs. They argue that the discrimination that is prohibited by \u00a7 36a-156 occurs when the establishing bank charges an ATM nondepositor fee. The discrimination that the statute proscribes, however, is discriminatory conduct by the estabhshing bank with respect to other banks. The statute does not mention, either explicitly or implicitly, differentiation of fees among various categories of customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">The plaintiffs also argue that the Deposit Account Contract Act supports their position that nondepositor fees statutorily are prohibited. They contend that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>although \u00a7 36a-156 permits an interchange fee, thereby implicitly prohibiting all other ATM fees, the Deposit Account Contract Act provides an implicit exception to the otherwise general prohibition of \u00a7 36a-156 against ATM fees being charged to customers, and permits banks to charge only ATM depositor fees, i.e., fees charged to the bank\u2019s own depositors. Thus, the plaintiffs argue that that act implicitly confers authority on the banks to impose ATM depositor fees. For this proposition they rely on the definitional section of the Deposit Account Contract Act, specifically, \u00a7 36a-316 (6), which defines deposit account charge.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As explained previously, however, that act does not grant any authority to banks to charge depositor fees; it merely assumes that such authority exists, to be employed or not as a business decision by the banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The plaintiffs also attempt to import into \u00a7 36a-156 a consumer protection or antitrust focus that neither the statute\u2019s language, history nor background plausibly will bear. To that end, the plaintiffs refer to the defendants\u2019 imposition of ATM nondepositor fees as \u201cthe latest salvo in the current fee war being waged by large banks against the public\u2019s access to its funds and against smaller banks.\u201d The plaintiffs contend, in essence, that the legislature foresaw undue market dominance by large banks as a result of ATMs. Their reading ignores the purposes that the legislature did have in enacting this legislation: to allow state financial institutions to participate in this new technology; and to prevent exclusionary ATM networks. There is nothing in the statute\u2019s language, history or background that supports the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Those contentions, moreover, are inconsistent with the undisputed facts that, when this legislation was enacted in 1975, the entire area of the use of ATMs was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>experimental and untested in the marketplace, and that the legislature regarded it as such. No one, including our legislature, could have foreseen at that time what the economic and competitive effects of ATMs would be. Indeed, as the defendants point out, the marketplace already has begun to respond to the purported dominance by large banks.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If there is to be state regulation of ATM customer fees, that is a policy matter for the determination by the legislature based on current economic and other relevant data. It simply is not, as the plaintiffs suggest, a question that was implicitly resolved in 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We answer the reserved question in the negative. The case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">No costs will be taxed in this court to any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">In this opinion NORCOTT, KATZ, PALMER and CALLAHAN, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 36a-156 provides: \u201cAvailability of machines, devices and terminals for use by other banks and credit unions, (a) One or more banks, Connecticut credit unions or federal credit unions which have established a satellite device or point of sale terminal shall make the satellite device or point of sale terminal available on a nondiscriminatory basis for use by any other bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union, upon payment by each such other bank or credit union of a reasonably proportionate share of all acquisition, installation and operating costs of the satellite device or point of sale terminal.

The following colloquy took place between Representatives Albert R. Webber and Lyddy during the legislative debate in the House of Representatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201c[Representative Webber]: If one were to use this service at a super market, at the checkout counter, would that individual be charged a fee for the use of that service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">\u201cThe Deputy Speaker: The gentleman from the 126th if he cares to respond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">\u201c[Representative Lyddy]: Through you Mr. Speaker.

No charge.\u201d 18 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 4870-71.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">This colloquy does not alter our view of the statute. First, the discussion between Representatives Lyddy and Webber, which does not refer to any particular language in the bill, involved a point of sale terminal, not an ATM machine. We cannot infer from this single exchange that the legislature intended that customers, depositors and nondepositors alike, were to be afforded the same treatment when they used both the point of sale terminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and the ATM machine \u2014 at that time, new banking devices that served, and continue to serve, different banking functions. Second, it is unclear, when the 1wo legislators referred to the customer at the checkout counter of a supermarket, whether that customer, who would not be charged a fee according to Representative Lyddy, was a depositor or a nondepositor of the bank that operates the device. This dialogue just as easily could be construed, or misconstrued, to prohibit surcharges to all customers, depositors and nondepositors, for any ATM or point of sale terminal transaction. The plaintiffs concede, however, that ATM depositor fees are permissible. Third, this colloquy alone cannot overcome a contrary construction, which <em>is </em>supported by the statutory language, other legislative history, and the legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 36a-316 (6) defines deposit account charge as \u201ca charge which may be imposed on a depositor for utilizing the services of a financial institution in connection with a deposit account, including a charge for: (A) Stop payment orders; (B) items drawn on a deposit account which are dishonored; (C) providing the depositor with a copy of any record relating to a deposit account; (D) the use of checks, negotiable orders of withdrawal, share drafts or other items, devices or methods that may be used to withdraw moneys from a deposit account; and (E) maintaining a deposit account, such as a service charge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b44-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 36a-320 (a) provides: \u201cA financial institution may delete or decrease any existing deposit account charges without notice.

For example, the record reveals that in 1988, the then banking commissioner, Howard B. Brown, disclosed that an ATM network composed of smaller banks prohibited member banks from charging such fees. Depositors of smaller banks that are members of such anetwork, therefore, presumably have ATMs available to them without being subject to convenience fees and, accordingly, those banks may exploit that availability as a competitive response to the ATM networks of the larger banks.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b48-9\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_6\">with whom LAVERY, J., joins, dissenting. Putting aside the majority\u2019s rhetoric, the court\u2019s decision today, favoring the state\u2019s largest and most powerful banks at the expense of the consumer and smaller banks, construes General Statutes \u00a7 36a-156 in such a manner that authorizes the banks to charge the nondepositor a fee for using their automated teller machines (ATM). Superficially, it may seem reasonable to allow a bank who owns an ATM to charge the customer of another bank a fee for its use. If there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>no more, I would not be dissenting; but this is far from the end of the story.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The ATM must first be put in its proper perspective. These unattended electronic devices allows the consumer to conduct banking transactions \u2014 such as obtaining cash withdrawals, making deposits, transferring funds between accounts, obtaining balances \u2014 all without a bank teller. The ATMs of all the banks are connected through shared networks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In other words, a customer of bank A can access his account through bank B, even though he is not a customer there. The ATM has become the primary means for the poor\u2014 indeed, not only the poor but also the average consumer \u2014 to fulfill their banking needs without being restricted by long lines and banker\u2019s hours. It is not uncommon for a bank to have an ATM at a supermarket or other commercial establishment for the convenience of the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The impact of these fees \u2014 which have in the past ranged between $0.50 to $2.50 per transaction, with the common surcharge of $1.50 \u2014 is the hardest on the poor. The working poor find it virtually impossible to do their banking during the hours when the banks are open but must rely on the ATM. Those that are recipients of state assistance receive their benefits through electronic benefit trust (benefit trust) or electronic fund transfer (direct deposit). Although the poor do not now pay a service fee for accessing their benefits electronically through the ATMs, that is based upon the interpretation of \u00a7 36a-156 by the plaintiff, John P. Burke, the commissioner of banking for the state (commissioner), that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>prohibits the charging of fees to nondepositors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is the issue presented in this case. With the majority\u2019s decision today, it opens the door for the banking industry to take advantage of the poor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The amicus curiae Greater Hartford Legal Assistance points out in its brief the following: According to statistics from the department of social services, \u201cthe average monthly [temporary family assistance program]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> public benefit distribution to a family of three in the state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Connecticut is $572. A family receiving this monthly benefit lives on an amount which is less than one half of the federal poverty level. ATM withdrawal surcharges would clearly have an impact on the monthly budget of such families. If each transaction at an ATM carried with it a surcharge, in addition to the fees that benefit trust recipients and other low-income banking customers are paying, low-income people would be sacrificing an additional amount of money that is sorely needed to survive. Further, if a person of low-income needs to withdraw, or desires to withdraw, only $20 or $30 at a time at an ATM, she could be paying a 5 to 10 [percent] surcharge for each transaction, which would have an enormous impact on her budget. Low-income persons should not be forced to carry with them large amounts of cash at one time in order to avoid a surcharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The problem does not stop there \u2014 allowance of those charges would be harmful to the public welfare. The commissioner made specific findings as to the harm that would occur to the public and to the competitiveness of the banking industry in Connecticut. In an action brought by two of the three defendants in the present case, Fleet National Bank (Fleet) and First Union National Bank,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> against the commissioner, seeking to enjoin the commissioner from enforcing a cease and desist order he issued prohibiting the ATM surcharge fees for nondepositors, the trial court stated: \u201cThe commissioner found that the public welfare requires immediate action. This finding is based on the financial costs to the public of the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed surcharges, which, when aggregated, amount to a total of approximately $25,000 per day. As the plaintiffs control more than 30 percent of the ATMs in the state, this would constitute a significant financial drain on the public. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Moreover, the commissioner determined that [Fleet] advised ATM users (while Fleet was imposing surcharges) that nondepositor customers could avoid the same by becoming Fleet depositors. The commissioner concluded that this was anticompetitive and could put pressure on users to become Fleet depositors to the detriment of banks with smaller ATM networks. The commissioner also concluded that given the concentration of ownership of ATMs by the plaintiffs, the ability of Connecticut consumers to use nonsurcharging ATMs could be severely limited.\u201d <em>Fleet National Bank </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 566, 578, 727 A.2d 823 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The sole issue before this court is: Does \u00a7 36a-156 prohibit a bank that owns an ATM from charging a fee to a nondepositor who uses the bank\u2019s machine?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is fundamental that statutory construction requires the ascertainment of the legislative intent. In seeking to determine the legislature\u2019s intent when it adopted \u00a7 36a-156, we \u201clook to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. ... No one invariable rule of statutory construction is controlling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">I first focus on the language of \u00a7 36a-156. The statute provides: \u201cAvailability of machines, devices and terminals for use by other banks and credit unions, (a) One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>or more banks, Connecticut credit unions or federal credit unions which have established a satellite device or point of sale terminal shall make the satellite device or point of sale terminal available on a nondiscriminatory basis for use by any other bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union, upon payment by each such other bank or credit union of a reasonably proportionate share of all acquisition, installation and operating costs of the satellite device or point of sale terminal. The satellite device or point of sale terminal shall identify with equal prominence all of the banks, credit unions or network systems which use the satellite device or point of sale terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u201c(b) Any bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union which has established an automated teller machine which is not a satellite device may, in its discretion, permit any other bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union to use such automated teller machine, provided, (1) if such permission is granted to any other bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union, the automated teller machine is made available on a nondiscriminatory basis for use by any other bank, Connecticut credit union or federal credit union, upon payment of reasonably proportionate costs as described under subsection (a) of this section, and (2) such use is otherwise in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36a-156.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">In common parlance, the applicable provisions of the statute with respect to the issue in this case clearly and specifically provide that (1) if a bank establishes a satellite ATM \u2014 that is, an ATM off its premises \u2014 it must make that ATM available to the customers of all other banks upon payment of an interchange fee<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>nondepositor\u2019s bank and (2) that if a bank establishes an ATM which is not a satellite \u2014 in other words, an ATM located on the premises of the bank \u2014 and it permits the customers of any other bank to use the ATM, it must be made available on a nondiscriminatory basis for use by the customer of all other banks upon payment of an interchange fee by the nondepositor\u2019s bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">As a result of \u00a7 36a-156, which specifically allows a bank that owns an ATM to charge another bank a specific fee when that bank\u2019s customers use the ATM\u2014 that is, the interchange fee \u2014 a well established rule of statutory construction <em>prohibits </em>the charging of any other fee for the use of the ATM by a nondepositor. This rule \u2014 \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alter\u00e1is\u201d or \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); has been firmly implanted in this state\u2019s jurisprudence and employed continuously for more than one hundred years. See <em>Coletti </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>Co., 105 Conn. 94, 96, 134 A. 248 (1926); <em>State ex rel. Morris </em>v. Bulkeley, 61 Conn. 287, 367, 23 A. 186 (1892). Simply put, a \u201cstatute which provides that a thing be done in a certain way carries with it an implied prohibition against doing that thing in any other way.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chairman, Criminal Justice Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 200, 585 A.2d 96 (1991). Accordingly, since \u00a7 36a-156 provides that the bank who owns the ATM must make it available upon the payment of an interchange fee by the nondepositor\u2019s bank, it is implied that if the legislature intended to allow the ATM bank to also charge a user\u2019s fee to a nondepositor it would have specifically provided for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">There is another rule of statutory construction that reinforces the conclusion that the legislature never intended to allow the ATM bank to charge nondeposi-tors a user\u2019s fee. On November 20, 1998, as previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>indicated, two of the three defendants in the present case brought an action to enjoin the commissioner from enforcing his cease and desist order prohibiting them from charging nondepositors the ATM surcharge fee. The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 application for a temporary injunction. See <em>Fleet National Bank </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>supra, 45 Conn. Sup. 580. The trial court\u2019s well reasoned published opinion posited that, \u201c\u00a7 36a-156 already provides for payment of \u2018acquisition, installation and operating costs,\u2019 the legal presumption is that the legislature did not intend to include other charges. Had the legislature wanted to do so, it could have included such a provision.\u201d Id., 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201c[T]he legislature is presumed to be aware of the judicial construction placed upon its enactments.\u201d <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>223 Conn. 22, 30, 610 A.2d 1292 (1992). The legislature, having been in session since <em>Fleet National Bank </em>was decided, could have amended \u00a7 36a-156 if they had disagreed with that judicial construction of the statute by specifically authorizing the ATM fee for nondepositors. It did not do so. Accordingly, there is \u201cnothing to support the claim that the legislature intended a contrary construction of the statute.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">I must confess that the majority opinion confuses me with respect to the legislative history cited therein. The majority discounts as \u201cambiguous\u201d the only genuinely relevant legislative history of Public Acts 1975, No. 75-373, which was codified as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-156 through 36a-159. That legislative history is revealing, although it had specific reference to the point of sale terminal, the ATM utilized in retail outlets. The debate on the floor of the House of Representatives with respect to Public Act 75-373 included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201c[Representative Albert R. Webber, cochairperson of the legislative committee on general law]: Thank you. If one were to use this service at a supermarket, at the check-out counter, would that individual be charged a fee for the use of that service? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201c[Representative Raymond C. Lyddy, cochairperson of the legislative committee on banks]: . . . No. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201c[Representative Webber]: If I understand the answer correctly, if a bank installs this very sophisticated piece of equipment in a supermarket for the convenience or at least to alleviate the problems at a check-out counter and the equipment, from what Mr. Lyddy tells us is costly, there shall be no charge and I ask the question again, to the customer who uses it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201c[Representative Lyddy]: <em>... No </em>charge.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10,1975 Sess., pp. 4870-71.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">It is obvious Representative Webber\u2019s reference to a supermarket checkout counter was merely an example. It does not make sense to limit his inquiry about fees to that one type of transaction, that is, the point of sale; it is obvious that he was concerned about charges to nondepositors for the entire ATM system.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u201cAlthough statements made on the floor of the legislature are not controlling on statutory interpretation, we may take judicial notice of those statements, which are strong indications of legislative intent. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 195 n.8, 530 A.2d 171 (1987); <em>Manchester Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>South Windsor, </em>203 Conn. 267, 276, 524 A.2d 621 (1987); <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>[188 Conn. 213, 223 n.9, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982)].\u201d <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 303, 310-11, 592 A.2d 953 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">Furthermore, as the majority concedes, the legislative history indicates that there was a concern \u201cthat smaller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>financial institutions would be excluded from ATM networks in the absence of mandatory sharing.\u201d To be concerned about the exclusion of the customers of smaller banks and not be concerned about the charges with respect to those customers is incongruous. The fees would simply drive the consumer to the ATM of a bank that does not charge them. See Barkley, Clark, Shook, Hardy &amp; Bacon, LLP, \u201cATM Surcharges: Here Today, Gone Tomorrow?\u201d 5 Clarks\u2019 Bank Deposits and Payments Monthly 1, 3 (February 1997).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the other hand, limiting the servicing bank to recouping the costs by charging the noncustomer banks an interchange fee is \u201cdesigned to increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, competitive.\u201d <em>Southtrust Corp. </em>v. <em>Plus System, Inc., </em>913 F. Sup. 1517, 1523 (N.D. Ala. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Finally, the majority\u2019s standard of review that gives no deference is due to the commissioner\u2019s view that \u00a7 36a-156 prohibits banks from charging nondepositors ATM user fees is baffling. Since at least September 14, 1995, the commissioner construed \u00a7 36a-156 to prohibit charges to customers of other banks.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since that date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>there has been four legislative sessions and the legislature has failed to amend \u00a7 36a-156.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">This construction by the commissioner invokes principles to which this court has always adhered \u2014 at least in those instances where it comports with the direction in which the majority wishes to travel. First, as Justice Katz writing for a unanimous court pointed out: \u201cAlthough the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law ... it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, 244 Conn. 487, 494, 709 A.2d 1129 (1998). Simply put, the \u201ctime-tested agency interpretations\u201d must stand. <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 774, 523 A.2d 1297 (1988). Second, we should presume that the legislature is aware of the executive branch\u2019s written interpretation of those statutes that come within its domain. See, e.g., <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 30 and n.11. The failure of the legislature to amend \u00a7 36a-156 in light of the commissioner\u2019s longstanding interpretation of the statute is illuminating. The majority simply ignores these fundamental principles of administrative law.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The majority\u2019s decision today will have the greatest impact on those who can least afford it and have the least power to redress it. This decision renders the poor of this state captive to a growing banking monopoly and will broaden the ever widening gap between the rich and the poor. It will stifle banking competition at the expense of both the poor and smaller banks, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>will ultimately sacrifice Connecticut\u2019s overall economic well-being and stability for the benefit of the few.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\"> The ATMs axe connected through shared networks such as CIRRUS, PLUS and NYCE.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-7\"> Receipt of cash assistance in Connecticut is now required to be delivered via benefit trust or direct deposit in accordance with the statutorily mandated statewide fraud detection system for the department of social services. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-2 and 17b-7a. Through benefit trust systems, benefits are made available electronically to recipients who do not have bank accounts through the use of a coded card that works similar to an ATM card. In 1996, the state negotiated a contract for its benefit trust services with Citigroup, Inc. Individuals who receive benefits through benefit trust access their cash at an ATM or at a point of sale terminal at a retail location. Currently, however, unlike direct deposit recipients who pay their banks\u2019 standard fees for their accounts, benefit trust recipients can access then' funds at an ATM four times a month at no charge and $0.85 for all subsequent transactions. According to Robert O\u2019Connor, director of management information systems at the department of social services, this arrangement for benefit trust services for public benefits recipients who otherwise would be unable to obtain bank accounts, was based upon the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 36a-156, prohibiting ATM surcharge fees. Based on the majority\u2019s ruling today, those receiving public assistance in this state who rely on the benefit trust service will no longer have this service available to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b50-8\"> The low income population in Connecticut is disproportionately high. The cities of Hartford and New Haven have some of the highest poverty rates for northeastern cities. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that as of 1995 Hartford\u2019s poverty rate was 35.2 percent while New Haven\u2019s was 26.4 percent. Indeed, according to the United States Census Bureau, in a state with the highest per capita income in the country, over 10 percent of our citizens are living below the poverty level. Over 83,000 households receive food stamps and approximately 56,193 households receive cash benefits.

Before the surcharge fee, the price of ATM services among competing institutions remained relatively stagnant. In an effort to maintain or even improve market share, banks generally offered competitive ATM service charges. The surcharge fee may change this pricing environment and have the unwelcome effect of driving the small bank depositor to the larger banks. Because the surcharge is levied by the ATM owner directly against the use, there is relatively little incentive to keep the surcharge low. Therefore, a bank that has the largest market share of deployed ATMs may effectively entice its competitors\u2019 depositors to switch banks merely by imposing a high surcharge. Tired of paying the surcharge fee at the most-frequented ATMs, these users may switch banks because generally the ATM owner will not levy a surcharge on its own customers. <em>Thus it appears that the bank with the most ATMs may increase its market share by raising prices!</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\"><em>\u2018\u2018The effect, on smaller local banks could be devastating. </em>Unable to deploy numerous ATMs because of the costs involved, smaller banks have relied on the shared network to give their depositors equal access to the same ATMs that the larger banks provided their customers. To remain competitive, many of these smaller institutions offered their ATM services free or at prices substantially below their larger competitors. The surcharge fee changes the ability of the smaMocal bank to effectively offer free or low-cost ATM services. Again, tired of paying these surcharge lees, the small bank depositor may switch institutions in an effort to maintain the same ATM service without the added surcharge fee.\u201d (Emphasis added.)

Specifically, you seek confirmation of your interpretation that a state-chartered bank permissibly may charge a direct transaction fee for the use of such bank\u2019s ATM by a person who does not otherwise maintain a banking relationship with the bank. The imposition of such transaction fees would permit a bank to recoup a portion of the expenses incurred by the bank to establish and maintain the ATM. You also seek the concurrence of this department that the Connecticut statutes governing the use of ATMs in Connecticut would not place any restriction on the ability of a federally-chartered bank in Connecticut to impose similar fees, provided it was authorized to do so under federal law. You state that any such transaction fees to be imposed would be disclosed to the user of the ATM either on a sign posted on the ATM or in clear view of the customer using the ATM or electronically during the course of the transaction in a manner that would permit a user to cancel the transaction without incurring the transaction fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u201cThe Connecticut statutes governing the establishment and use of ATMs do not authorize banks to impose the transaction fees described above. Moreover, [\u00a7] 36a-156 . . . specifically authorizes a bank that has established an ATM to impose a usage fee on other banks whose customers use the ATM to cover \u2018a reasonably proportionate share of all acquisition, installation and operating costs.\u2019 It is an established rule of statutory construction that a statute which provides that a thing shall be done in a certain way carries with it an implied prohibition against doing that thing in another way. See, <em>State ex rel. Barlow </em>v. Kaminsky, 144 Conn. 612 [620, 136 A.2d 792] (1957). Therefore, [\u00a7] 36a-156, which provides that a bank may charge another bank that uses its ATM a fee for such use, carries with it an implied prohibition against the bank imposing a fee on the customers of the other bank for such use. Accordingly, this department is unable to agree with your interpretation that a state-chartered bank in Connecticut may charge a direct transaction fee for the use of its ATM by the customer of another bank or that the Connecticut statutes governing ATMs would not restrict the abiliiy of federally-chartered banks in Connecticut to impose similar fees. A state-chartered or federally-chartered bank in Connecticut that wishes to recoup the expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining an ATM may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>do so by imposing the usage fee permitted under [\u00a7] 36a-156 on other banks whose customers use the ATM.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
