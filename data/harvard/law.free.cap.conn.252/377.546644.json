The trial court had dismissed the plaintiffs administrative appeal from an order of the named defendant, the freedom of information commission,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requiring the disclosure of certain documents involving an internal affairs investigation of the Hartford police department, which had been the subject of discovery proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The plaintiff claims that the documents in question were exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (act) because: (1) to require their disclosure would limit the rights of the plaintiff as a litigant under the laws of discovery in violation of \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1); and (2) the question of their disclosure was governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and, therefore, they were exempt from the provisions of the act pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (a), which makes the act inapplicable where \u201c \u2018otherwise provided by any federal law . . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree with both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>claims and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Terence P. Sexton made a request under the act for the plaintiff to provide him with copies of certain reports of the internal affairs division of the Hartford police department. Upon the plaintiffs refusal to provide the reports, Sexton filed this complaint with the defendant. The defendant ordered the plaintiff to provide Sexton with the reports, and further ordered that \u201c[h]enceforth, the [plaintiff] shall strictly comply with the public records requirements set forth in [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-212 and 1-210 (a)].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>tiff appealed from that order to the trial court, which dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff appealed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment. <em>Chief of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>52 Conn. App. 12, 18, 724 A.2d 554 (1999). This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The facts and procedural history are undisputed. Sexton is an attorney who represented Carmen Delia Soto. In February, 1995, Sexton requested from the plaintiff copies of all \u201c \u2018documents, reports and memoranda concerning any Internal Affairs or Patrol Operations Division investigations relating to Officer Raymondo Diaz\u2019 . . . .\u201d Shortly thereafter, Sexton filed a civil action, in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, on behalf of Soto against the city of Hartford and Diaz alleging violations of Soto\u2019s civil rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">In May, 1995, the plaintiff declined to comply with Sexton\u2019s freedom of information request on the ground that the requested records were exempt from disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 1-213 (b) (l).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In June, 1995, Sexton filed this complaint with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">In the then pending civil action in the federal court, Sexton filed a discovery request for production of documents relating to Diaz, including \u201c \u2018Internal Affairs reports or investigations.\u2019 \u201d The city objected to the discovery request, and no further action was taken with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">In May, 1996, the defendant rejected the plaintiffs claim of exemption from the act, ordered the plaintiff to provide Sexton with the requested records, and further ordered that \u201c[h]enceforth, the [plaintiff] shall strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>comply with the public records requirements set forth in [the act and \u00a7 1-210 (a)].\u201d The plaintiff appealed from that order to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Prior to the hearing in the trial court, the federal civil action was settled and withdrawn. Nonetheless, the trial court correctly determined that the case was not moot because of the order by the defendant that the plaintiff henceforth must comply with \u00a7 1-210 (a) regarding such records. <em>See Domestic Violence Services of Greater New Haven, Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>240 Conn. 1, 8-9, 688 A.2d 314 (1997). The trial court rejected the plaintiffs claim that the records were exempt from disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1), and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The plaintiff appealed from that judgment to the Appellate Court, claiming that \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) \u201cprovides an exemption from disclosure under the act if the same records have also been sought through the use of the discovery process in civil litigation.\u201d <em>Chief of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 15. The Appellate Court focused on the language of \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1), namely, that \u201c[njothing in the Freedom of Information Act shall be deemed in any manner to . . . <em>limit </em>the rights of litigants . . . under the laws of discovery of this state . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Reasoning that the \u201cright of a litigant to discovery is primarily the right to obtain information\u201d; <em>Chief of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 16; and relying on the fact that in 1994, the legislature, in the wake of our decision in <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 641, 631 A.2d 252 (1993), had changed the word \u201caffect\u201d to \u201climit\u201d in \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1); <em>Chief of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 17; the Appellate Court concluded that \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) \u201cshould be interpreted as prohibiting the use of the act to <em>restrict </em>the rights of parties seeking information through discovery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 17-18. Thus, in the Appellate Court\u2019s view, \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) operates as an exemption in only one direction: it cannot limit or restrict a litigant\u2019s right to <em>seek </em>discovery of documents; but at the same time, it cannot be used as a source of exemption from the act by a litigant who seeks to <em>resist </em>discovery. Accordingly, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In this court, the plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment is flawed in two respects. First, the plaintiff claims that the Appellate Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) is improper because \u201crequiring the disclosure of these documents would limit its right as a litigant under the laws of discovery, particularly since these documents were not discoverable in the Federal Court litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, the plaintiff claims that the act is entirely inapplicable to the request filed by Sexton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u201cbecause the legal matter in question was \u2018otherwise provided by . . . federal law,\u2019 \u201d namely, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as provided by \u00a7 1-210 (a). See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">We reject both claims. We conclude that the language of \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) at issue in the present case means that requests for records under the act are to be determined by reference to the provisions of the act, irrespective of whether they are or otherwise would be disclosable under the rules of state discovery; see footnote 7 of this opinion; whether civil or criminal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We also conclude that questions of discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are not what is meant by the phrase \u201cotherwise provided by any federal law\u201d as used in \u00a7 1-210 (a). We therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">We first consider the claim of the plaintiff that the documents in question were exempt from disclosure under the act because, under \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1), to order their disclosure would \u201climit\u201d the plaintiffs rights as a litigant \u201cunder the laws of discovery . . . .\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">This claim presents a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cStatutory interpretation is a matter of law over which this court\u2019s review is plenary. ... In construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>252 Conn. 79, 84, 743 A.2d 156 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">This question of statutory interpretation also must be resolved in light of certain general principles governing the act. First, we have often recognized \u201cthe longstanding legislative policy of the [act] favoring the open conduct of government and free public access to government records. . . . <em>[Glastonbury Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>234 Conn. 704, 712, 663 A.2d 349 (1995)]; see <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 166, 635 A.2d 783 (1993); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>208 Conn. 442, 450, 545 A.2d 1064 (1988); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 328, 435 A.2d 353 (1980). We consistently have held that this policy requires us to construe the provisions of the [act] to favor disclosure and to read narrowly that act\u2019s exceptions to disclosure. See, e.g., <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>[supra, 227 Conn. 651]; <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>222 Conn. 621, 626, 609 A.2d 998 (1992).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>240 Conn. 835, 840, 694 A.2d 1241 (1997). Second, whether records are disclosable under the act does not depend in any way on the status or motive of the applicant for disclosure, because the act vindicates the public\u2019s right to know, rather than the rights of any individual. See <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 233, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">With these principles in mind, we begin with the language in question: \u201c(b) Nothing in the Freedom of Information Act shall be deemed in any manner to: (1) . . . limit the rights of litigants, including parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>administrative proceedings, under the laws of discovery of this state . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1). The last three words \u2014 \u201cof this state\u201d \u2014 themselves render the particular discovery dispute involved in this case inapplicable to \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1). A discovery procedure in the federal court, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, cannot be considered as coming within the language, \u201cunder the laws of discovery <em>of this state </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1). We do not rest our decision on that narrow ground, however, because \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) is entirely neutral with reference to state discovery proceedings as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The language of \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1), read in its entirety, strongly suggests that it is intended to exempt entirely from the operation of the act questions of discovery that may arise in the course of litigation, whether in court or in administrative proceedings. In other words, the most plausible interpretation of the language of subsection (b) (1) is that questions of whether records are disclosable under the act are separate from questions of whether the same records are or would be discoverable in litigation. The language specifically provides that \u201c[njothing in the [act] shall be deemed in any manner to: (1) Affect the status of judicial records as they existed prior to October 1, 1975, nor to limit the [state discovery] rights of litigants . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The emphatic sense of \u201c[n]othing\u201d and \u201cin any manner,\u201d and the linkage between the judicial records prior to October 1, 1975, and the discovery rights of litigants \u2014 both being treated in the same subsection and in essentially the same manner \u2014 strongly indicate an intention to make the act simply inapplicable to such records and rights. The most plausible way to effect such an intention is to read the language as meaning that the two issues \u2014 disclosability under the act, and rights under discovery laws \u2014 are separate and indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>dent of each other. Indeed, reading the statutory language as the plaintiff would have us do would mean that, although the statute <em>explicitly </em>provides that nothing in the act shall be deemed to limit the rights of litigants under the laws of discovery, nonetheless the rights of litigants under the laws of discovery <em>implicitly </em>limit the rights of the public under the act. We decline to infer from statutory language an implicit meaning that would undermine the statute\u2019s explicitly barred meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The legislative history of the language, scant as it is, is consistent with this interpretation. This provision was part of the original act, enacted in 1975, which provided that nothing in the act would \u201cbe deemed in any manner to <em>affect </em>the status of judicial records as they existed prior to October 1, 1975, nor to <em>affect </em>the rights of litigants, including the parties to administrative proceedings, under the laws of discovery of this state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 1-19b (3). Here, the linkage between the judicial records exemption and the rights of litigants under discovery laws was even more clear than it currently is, because both exemptions were introduced by the general term \u201caffect,\u201d and the clear import of the exemption from the act of judicial records prior to October 1,1975, was linguistically shared by the exemption of the \u201crights of litigants . . . under the laws of discovery of this state.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 l-19b (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Furthermore, the only reference in the legislative debate to the provision in question was in a colloquy between Representatives Paul C. Manchester and Martin B. Burke, the sponsor of the legislation. Representative Manchester asked: \u201cIs it the intention of this Bill to make available to the public, appraisals rendered in tax appeal cases?\u201d Representative Burke responded: \u201cI think that\u2019s covered in the area of records pertaining to pending claims or litigation <em>and further covered by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>the [laws of </em>discovery]<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of production lawsuits.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1975 Sess., p. 3950. We do not read this brief exchange as inconsistent with our conclusion that \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) renders the provisions of the act and questions of state discovery independent of each other.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In accordance with Practice Book \u00a7\u2022 13-4 (4),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and its predecessors, and as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>matter of long-standing practice, the reports of appraisers in tax appeals are routinely discoverable by each party. Thus, we read this colloquy as indicating no more than that the rules of discovery would govern any such document.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In 1993, this court considered, in <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 642, \u201cwhether a municipal police department arrest report must be disclosed by the police department to the public, pursuant to the [act]; General Statutes [Rev. to 1993] \u00a7\u00a7 1-7 through 1-2 lk; while the criminal prosecution that is related to the arrest report is pending.\u201d We first assumed, without deciding, that such a report was \u201cnot a record of the [criminal justice] division pursuant to General Statutes [Rev. to 1993] \u00a7\u00a7 l-18a and 1-19.\u201d <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 653 n.13. We concluded that, pursuant to the then current version of the act, such an arrest report was disclosable under the act, but only to the extent of the name and address of the person arrested, the date, time and place of the arrest, and the offense for which the person was arrested. Id., 654-62. In doing so, we specified that the issue specifically was governed by General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 l-20b.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>We then added, however, in dictum, which we now regard as ill-advised, that \u201cour conclusion is supported by reference to [General Statutes (Rev. to 1993)] \u00a7 l-19b (b)\u201d; <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 662; the provision specifically at issue in the present case. We stated: \u201cPublic access to arrest reports while the prosecution is pending would affect the rights of litigants under the laws of discovery\u201d because the criminal defendant would have immediate access under the act to documents otherwise unavailable under our discovery rules, and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s rights would be adversely affected by being required to disclose to the defendant documents upon which he might be relying to make strategic decisions. Id., 663-65. In light of those considerations, we declined to read General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 l-20b more broadly than its terms plainly specified. Id., 665-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In 1994, the legislature, by virtue of Public Acts 1994, No. 94-246, \u00a7 15 (P.A. 94-246), amended the statute involved in the present case by substituting \u201climit\u201d for \u201caffect\u201d in the clause dealing with discovery rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Public Act 94-246 was a lengthy enactment entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning a DNA Data Bank, the Registration of Sexual Offenders and the Disclosure of Arrest Record Information.\u201d As its title indicates, most of it concerned the creation of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) data bank from blood samples of persons convicted of certain crimes; P.A. 94-246, \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 7; a system of registration of the identities of persons convicted of certain sexual offenses; P.A. 94-246, \u00a7\u00a7 8 through 12; an amendment of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 1-20b regarding the scope of disclosure of arrest records; P.A. 94-246, \u00a7 13;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and an amendment of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 1-19 (b) (3) regarding the scope of disclosure of the identity and signed statements of witnesses. P.A. 94-246, \u00a7 14. Only \u00a7 15 of the P.A. 94-246 concerned the provision at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The legislative history for P.A. 94-246 is bereft of any discussion of \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There was no discussion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>dictum in <em>Gifford </em>regarding the scope of the discovery exemption, or of the effect of changing \u201caffect\u201d to \u201climit.\u201d The only legislative discussion of our decision in <em>Gifford </em>focused on that part of its ruling defining the meaning of arrest records under then \u00a7 l-20b. See, e.g., 37H.R. Proc., Pt. 20, 1994 Sess., p. 7388, remarks of Representative Dale W. Radcliffe;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> id., pp. 7391-92, remarks of Representative Radcliffe;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> 37 S. Proc., Pt. 6,1994 Sess., p. 1936, remarks of Senator George C. Jepsen;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> id., p. 1961, remarks of Senator William A. DiBella;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> id., p. 1966, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>remarks of Senator Jepsen;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> id., pp. 1968-69, remarks of Senator DiBella;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> id., p. 1969, remarks of Senator John A. Kissel.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, whatever the intent or meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>change from \u201caffect\u201d to \u201climit,\u201d we can find nothing in either the language or legislative history of P.A. 94-246 to indicate that \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) means anything different now from what it meant when it originally was enacted, namely, that the provisions of the act do not affect or limit discovery rights, and discovery rights do not affect or limit the provisions of the act. The two operate separately and independently.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Finally, the procedures in this case supply a scenario that suggests an additional reason that \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) has the meaning that we have ascribed to it. In this case, the discovery dispute over the documents at issue was never resolved by the federal court. Therefore, despite the plaintiffs assertion that the documents in question were not discoverable in the federal action, we cannot know whether an order of disclosure under the act <em>would </em>have limited the right that the plaintiff asserted under the federal discovery rules to withhold the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Therefore, in the absence of a definitive prior discovery ruling regarding documents involved in both a judicial discovery dispute and a request under the act, the defendant, or a court reviewing the defendant\u2019s action, in attempting to apply the discovery exemption, would be required to determine whether the documents sought under the act would be subject to discovery under the applicable procedural court rules. Many discovery questions, however, are highly discretionary in nature. It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the defen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>danl or a court to determine accurately how that discretion would be exercised. It is unlikely that in enacting \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1), the legislature intended to place such a difficult and conjectural burden on the defendant or a court. The more plausible interpretation is that each determination \u2014 disclosure under the act, and disclosure under discovery rules \u2014 is made solely by the body charged with that responsibility: the defendant or the court applying the act; and the court applying its discovery rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The plaintiff argues that requiring disclosure of the documents in question \u201climits the rights of litigants because it forces public agencies to litigate in an [unlevel] playing field, particularly with respect to discovery matters. The decision appealed herein gives a private party litigating against a public agency the advantage of obtaining much more information in preparation for litigation than its opponents.\u201d We do not deny that, except to the extent that other provisions of the act exempt documents from disclosure, the practical effect of our interpretation is that a member of the public might be able to secure under the act documents from an agency that he is suing or intends to sue that he might not be able to secure through discovery in the litigation. The reason for that, however, is rooted in the fundamental purposes of the act, which presumptively make public documents available to the public, and in the notion that the act and judicial discovery rules are designed with different aims and limitations in mind. Although in many cases the two routes for disclosure might overlap, in some cases they might ar rive at different destinations. The fact that a member of the public might also be an adversary of the agency, however, does not by itself strip him of his rights under the act. Moreover, there may also be instances in which a litigant would be able to secure documents through discovery that are exempt from disclosure under the act. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>reason for that is, likewise, rooted in the fact that the act and discovery rules have different purposes and limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The plaintiff also relies on our statement in <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 665-66, that the discovery exemption is intended to avoid transforming \u201cthe commission, an executive agency, into the overseer of . . . discovery rules.\u201d As we previously have indicated, that statement, and the discussion of \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) of which it was a part, were dictum. Our holding was that the specific statutory language of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 l-20b controlled the disposition of that case. Moreover, as we also previously have indicated, that dictum was ill-advised. Construing the language to mean that the two questions^ \u2014 disclosability under the act, and discovery under litigation rules \u2014 are independent of each other does not, as we suggested in <em>Gifford, </em>make the defendant an overseer of discovery rules. It simply divides into separate spheres those questions that most appropriately are decided in those spheres. Furthermore, our dictum ignored the most plausible interpretation of the language at issue in the present case, and it ignored the concomitant result that, by making disclosure under the act dependent on an actual or hypothetical discovery ruling, it transformed a court dealing with separate litigation into an overseer of the provisions of the act. We do not think that \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1) contemplates such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The plaintiff also claims that the act is inapplicable to the documents at issue in this case because \u00a7 1-210 (a) makes public records available <em>\u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by any federal law </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) See footnote 4 of this opinion for the text of \u00a7 1-210 (a). The plaintiff contends that the documents \u201cin question in the present case [are] \u2018otherwise pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>vided by [any] federal law\u2019 because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure already provide a legal process for [their] disclosure . . . .\u201d We disagree. We conclude that the language in question does not include questions of discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">First, the phrase at issue in \u00a7 1-210 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute . . . .\u201d State discovery rules are governed generally by rules of the court, not by statutes. Thus, linking a total federal exemption from the disclosure provisions of the act with a parallel reference to state statutes strongly suggests that the reference to \u201cfederal law\u201d was not intended to encompass federal litigation engendered issues of discovery. It suggests, instead, a reference to federal and state laws that, by their terms, provide for confidentiality of records or some other similar shield from public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Indeed, the only references in the entire legislative history of the act to the language in question are consistent with the suggestion that it was intended to refer to other federal and state laws that by their terms shield specific information from disclosure.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> There is nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>therein, therefore, that suggests that the legislature intended this very general language to encompass the kinds of individualized and possibly hypothetical determinations under federal discovery rules that the plaintiffs argument would suggest. Indeed, there is no reference at all to federal discovery rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Third, we already have determined that \u00a7 1-213 (b) (1), which specifically refers to \u201cthe laws of discovery of this state,\u201d does no more than make state discovery questions irrelevant to the question of disclosure under the act. It would be incongruous for a specific reference to <em>state </em>discovery rules to have that meaning, but a general reference to \u201cany federal laws\u201d to mean that the applicability of the act depends on questions of discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-213 provides: \u201cAgency administration.

The only amicus curiae to focus on this language, namely, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, argues that \u201c \u2018laws of discovery of this state\u2019 \u201d includes federal law because of the supremacy clause of the United States constitution. This argument notwithstanding, it is difficult to see how discovery procedures in a federal action, which are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, would come within that language.

Proc., supra, p. 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> During the legislative debate in the Senate, Senator Jepsen stated: \u201cI think it is important to note that the Supreme Court didn\u2019t say, offered no opinion about restricting information. They merely said under current law it is not required that it be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u201cWe did just fine for years up until the <em>Gifford </em>Case with the free disclosure of such information. The [Freedom of Information] laws didn\u2019t just happen. They happened because of the perceived need to open up information . . . .\u201d 37 S. Proc., supra, p. 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\"> Senator DiBella stated during the legislative debate in the Senate: \u201cI have listened to many debates in this room. I find it hard to tie the issue of discrimination and the question that\u2019s before us today. Point, it is assumed that the law prior was that these records had to be released. Fact, it has been the fact that the present law has been the law for many years. If you read the <em>Gifford </em>versus the <em>Freedom of Information, </em>it\u2019s a clarification that says that the police departments are allowed to continue to proceed as most of them had in the past and that was restricting this kind of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\u201cSo when you read <em>Gifford, </em>it wasn\u2019t a question that <em>Gifford </em>restricted the [Freedom of Information]. The question was challenged and they sustained the present and existing operation in <em>Gifford. </em>The question is a very critical issue as to the question of being able to protect the rights of people in an investigation and the issue that the amendment within the bill allows that, it would allow an immediate decision when this \u2014 when the report, was being drawn up, not giving the police department the ability to evaluate extensively the effects and ramifications of releasing' such information in the course of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">\u201cSo the information, the critical issue here is the Supreme Court decision sustained the existing practice. It passed the test in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court looked at the issue of the rights of the individuals and balanced that against the rights of those people that would be protected in the course of an investigation or in the course of protecting that, information from public dissemination.\u201d 37 S. Proc., supra, pp. 1968-69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\"> Senator Kissel stated during the legislative debate in the Senate: \u201cYes, I rise in support of the amendment. With all due respect to Senator DiBella, I believe that the statements made by Senator Jepsen are true. I will grant you that perhaps in the <em>Gifford </em>Case, the state Supreme Court clarified the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>underlying issue and that perhaps what had been taken for a right was not such and that it was taken for granted, but even if that\u2019s the case, our issue before us is do we let the sun shine in or don\u2019t we. . . .\u201d 37 S. Proc., supra, p. 1969.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b418-9\"> This does not mean, however, that other specific exemptions from the act might not operate to shield certain documents from disclosure that also are or might be involved in discovery disputes. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) (3) (records of law enforcement agencies) and (4) (pending claims or pending litigation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\"><em> </em>On the floor of the House of Representatives, Representative Burke stated: \u201cIn line 164, there is the word \u2018TAX RETURNS\u2019 inserted in one of the exemptions for public records and it would read \u2018records, tax returns, reports and statements exempted by federal law or state statute.\u2019 Now the reason for this, the Tax Department called it to the Committee\u2019s attention . . . that under federal law, tax returns are to be confidential and did we not specifically exempt tax returns, we would probably have some problems so we did so, although, in my own personal opinion, <em>that was the intention of the Committee all along when we said records, reports and statements exempted by federal law. </em>. . (Emphasis added.) 18 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 3897.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Thereafter, the following exchange occurred between Representatives Burke and Albert R. Webber:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">\u201c[Representative Webber]: Through you Mr. Speaker, a question to the gentleman from the 56th. In line with the questioning developed by [Representative Gerald F.] Stevens, could one get information from apar\u00f3le board? I speak particularly of the applicant for parole. Gould he receive, under <em>the </em>terms of this Amendment, or the Bill, the detailed information as to his status and why from a board of pardons or parole board?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8S\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u201c[Representative Burke]: Through you Mr. Speaker, there is a general exclusion in the Bill itself concerning records, reports and statements exempted by state statutes. There is a further exclusion concerning records of law enforcement agencies. It would be possibly, I guess on my part, but I would say that, because I don\u2019t know what the parole statutes say, we certainly didn\u2019t peruse every section of the General Statutes in dealing with this Bill. But if they are privileged and exempt from inspection, as they now exist, then they would continue to be so under the blanket exclusion, if you will, on lines 164 and 165 of the file copy.\u201d 18 H.R.
