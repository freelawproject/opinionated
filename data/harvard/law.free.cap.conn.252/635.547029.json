One juror, June Briere, claimed that another juror, Dan M., had made statements such as: \u201cWhat do you care about a spic?,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s get one more spic off the streets of Willimantic,\u201d and \u201cOf course he\u2019s guilty, he\u2019s a spic.\u201d After hearing testimony from Briere and the jury foreperson, Paul Belanger, who testified that he did not recall any juror making any ethnic slurs, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court based its conclusion that Briere\u2019s allegations were not credible on inconsistencies in her story and her apparent loss of objectivity with regard to the defendant. The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to this court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court had failed to conduct an adequate inquiry into allegations of juror misconduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>245 Conn. 301, 323-40, 715 A.2d 1 (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Exercising our supervisory authority over the administration of this state\u2019s courts, we reversed the judgment as to the scope of the trial court\u2019s inquiry into allegations of juror misconduct and remanded the case to the trial court for a more expansive inquiry into the allegations. Id., 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">On the remand, the trial court heard the following evidence. Dan M. testified that he did not make any of the statements alleged by Briere. Dan M. also testified that, during voir dire, in response to a question regarding whether he had overheard any racist comments while in the jury assembly room, he reported that a woman in the jury room had commented that there would be \u201cone less spic off the street . . . .\u201d He testified that he was uncomfortable using this derogatory word, even in the limited context of repeating another person\u2019s statement. Dan M. could not remember <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>whether he had mentioned the woman\u2019s derogatory statement to any other jurors. Dan M. also testified that he recalled eating lunch at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant one day during the trial. While there, he recognized some people who had been attending the proceedings, and, in order to avoid any contact with them, he left and ate his lunch in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Briere testified that Dan M. used racial slurs on two occasions during the trial. According to Briere, on February 7, 1996, the entire jury was watching the news in the assembly room when Dan M. said, \u201cjust like this case, one less spic on the streets of Willimantic.\u201d Briere also testified that, on that occasion, Dan M. stated in a loud and boisterous voice, \u201cWhat do you care about a spic?\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s guilty, he\u2019s a spic.\u201d According to Briere, the second incident occurred on February 27, 1996, when Dan M., following his return from lunch at McDonald\u2019s, stated in a loud voice that he had \u201coverheard all the spies talking about the Santiago case\u201d and that they had stated that the defendant was guilty. Briere testified that, after Dan M. made this statement, two other jurors, Barbara Loy and Glory Beir, criticized him for bringing outside information into the jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Briere further testified that, alter the trial, she brought this information to defense counsel, Mark Shapera, who advised her to write a letter to the judge. Briere testified that, on Shapera\u2019s advice to keep the letter \u201cplain and simple,\u201d Briere omitted any reference to Dan M.\u2019s racial bias in her letter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Briere stated that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>after receiving no response from the trial judge, she called the courthouse and spoke with a clerk about her concerns. According to the clerk\u2019s notes from this conversation, Briere told her that Dan M. had reported to the jury that, during lunch one day, he had overheard other people referring to the defendant as a \u201cspic.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Briere also testified that, since the trial, she had become \u201cthe champion of the defendant\u2019s cause,\u201d had appeared on news shows in support of his release, had referred to him as her \u201cson,\u201d and even had readied a room in her home for him to stay in upon his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Six jurors<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> testified that they did not recall Dan M. making either statement alleged by Briere. Four of those jurors did not hear the word \u201cspic\u201d used by anyone throughout the entire trial. Although two jurors remembered hearing Dan M. use the word \u201cspic\u201d during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>trial, they both stated that Dan M. was merely repeating comments that he had overheard, and that he was not himself using the term as a description of the defendant or any other person.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state questioned three jurors regarding whether racial prejudice had played a role in the jury deliberation, and all three jurors stated that it had not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct. The court found Briere\u2019s testimony to be unworthy of credibility, and concluded that her claims of juror bias were not credible. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The defendant appealed from this judgment directly to this court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a new trial. The defendant claims that the testimony of Walter Lynch and Loy supports Briere\u2019s allegations, and establishes that Dan M. used racial epithets during the trial. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>argues that Dan M. was not truthful when he claimed that the only time he had used the word \u201cspic\u201d was during the course of his voir dire. The defendant also claims that he was prejudiced by Dan M.\u2019s bias and the effect that it had on the other jurors. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\u201cOur analysis begins with the appropriate standard of review. We have long held that a finding of fact is reversed only when it is clearly erroneous. See, e.g., <em>Poulos </em>v. <em>Pfizer, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 598, 616, 711 A.2d 688 (1998). A factual finding is clearly erroneous when it is not supported by any evidence in the record or when there is evidence to support it, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Id. Simply put, we give great deference to the findings of the trial court because of its function to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses. . . . <em>Ros-tain </em>v. <em>Rostain, </em>214 Conn. 713, 716, 573 A.2d 710 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Allen-Bradley Co., </em>250 Conn. 334, 345-46, 736 A.2d 824 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The defendant contends that, given the seriousness of allegations of racial bias on the part of a juror, this court should review the trial court\u2019s conclusions on a de novo basis. We decline to do so. The trial court\u2019s decision was based on its factual findings that the events reported by Briere never had occurred. This court reviews factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard, even when faced with allegations as serious as racial bias or discrimination in jury selection. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 336, we reaffirmed that \u201c[o]ur decision to provide additional guidelines for conducting a preliminary inquiry in situations of racial allegations in no way undermines the discretion we accord to the trial courts in making credibility assessments . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Upon review of the evidence, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that Briere\u2019s allegations were not credible was not clearly erroneous. There was ample evidence that Briere had lost her objectivity and had become an advocate for the defendant. Briere\u2019s testimony also was undermined by numerous inconsistencies. The fact that Lynch and Loy testified that Dan M. had used the word \u201cspic\u201d to repeat something that he had heard does not support the defendant\u2019s allegations that the juror was \u201cracially biased.\u201d See id., 339. Moreover, Lynch and Loy testified that racial prejudice played no role in the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\"> In that appeal, the defendant also raised issues regarding his waiver of the probable cause hearing and the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress his statements. We affirmed the judgment with respect to those issues. <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 340.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\"> The letter to the trial court provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201cI have contemplated the circumstances and sentencing of [the defendant] for a month.
