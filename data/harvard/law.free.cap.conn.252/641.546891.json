We agree with the second and third of these claims and, accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The plaintiff brought this action against the defendant for alleged negligence in causing her to contract the human immunodeficiency vims (HIV). The trial court, <em>Silbert, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and struck the defendant\u2019s special defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>of immunity under the act. Thereafter, the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>rendered judgment on the verdict in favor of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. At the time of the incident underlying this case, the plaintiff was a medical intern in the second month of her first year in the residency program<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at Yale-New Haven Hospital (hospital), and a graduate student at the defendant, Yale University d/b/a Yale University School of Medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">To put the facts that follow in the proper context, we describe at the outset the incident that caused the plaintiffs injury and a brief summary of the procedure that she was performing at the time. The plaintiff sustained her injuries as a result of her attempt to perform an arterial line insertion during her rotation in the hospital\u2019s medical intensive care unit. An arterial line insertion requires the insertion of a hollow needle, called a stylet, and a catheter, which is a thin flexible tube, into a patient\u2019s artery in order to permit monitoring of the patient\u2019s blood pressure and to obtain samples of the patient\u2019s blood. If the artery is punctured by the needle, blood will flow into a clear plastic cap located at the top of the needle \u2014 a result known as a flashback. If the catheter is inserted properly into the artery, blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>will start to come out of the hub, the now-open end of the catheter, once the needle is withdrawn. A pressure transducer is then hooked up to the catheter.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">A three day orientation period for the residency program began on June 20, 1988. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs first rotation in the residency program began in a general medicine program at the hospital, called the Fitkin Service. Deborah Erenthal, a senior resident physician at the time of the events at issue, was the plaintiffs supervisor during that rotation. At some time during that approximately four week rotation, Erenthal directed the plaintiff to attempt her first arterial line insertion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff told Erenthal that she had never performed one, and Erenthal instructed her to make the attempt anyway and to let Erenthal know if there was any problem. During this unsupervised attempt,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the plaintiff punctured the artery, as evidenced by a flashback, and withdrew the needle in order to determine whether the catheter was in the artery. When no blood came out of the catheter, the plaintiff understood that to mean that she had been unable to cam\u00faflate the artery, or thread the catheter into the artery. She then reinserted the needle in order to manipulate the catheter into the artery, and was again unsuccessful and removed the catheter. After making another attempt using a new catheter kit, the plaintiff still could not cam\u00faflate the artery, and called Erenthal, who finished the procedure outside the presence of the plaintiff, who had been paged out of the room. After her rotation in the Fitkin Service, the plaintiff spent approximately four weeks at the West Haven Veterans Administration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Hospital, where she did not perform any arterial line insertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Thereafter, on August 15, 1988, the plaintiff began a rotation at the hospital\u2019s medical intensive care unit. Alison Heald, a third year resident physician, was the plaintiffs supervisor during this rotation. On August 16, 1988, Heald asked the plaintiff to perform an arterial line insertion. Because the plaintiff had never performed one successfully before, she asked Heald to accompany her, which Heald did. Heald described to the plaintiff a method of the procedure by which one punctures the artery, punctures the back wall of the artery upon flashback, then advances the catheter into the artery, and withdraws the needle and holds it in one\u2019s hand. Heald did not describe how to control the bleeding once the catheter was in the artery. The plaintiff attempted the procedure, but because she was unable to cannulate the artery, Heald took over and completed the procedure. The plaintiff observed Heald: puncture the artery; get the flashback; advance the needle through the back wall of the artery until there was no more blood coming back; withdraw the needle and hold it in her hand near the catheter; thread the catheter into the artery; put the needle down; and then hook up the transducer. Heald did not describe to the plaintiff how she controlled the bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Later that day, Heald instructed the plaintiff to attempt another arterial line insertion. During this attempt, with Heald present at the plaintiffs request, the plaintiff inserted the needle into the artery, experienced the flashback, advanced the needle through the back arterial wall, removed the needle and held it in her hand, and attempted to thread the catheter into the artery. No blood, however, came out of the hub of the catheter when the plaintiff removed the needle from it, indicating to the plaintiff that the catheter was not properly positioned in the artery. In Heald\u2019s presence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the plaintiff reinserted the needle in order to reposition the catheter. Because she was still unsuccessful in threading the catheter into the artery, however, she removed the needle and the catheter. There was no discussion between the plaintiff and Heald regarding the reinsertion of the needle.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The plaintiff then began the procedure again with a new catheter kit and completed the procedure successfully. During this attempt, still in Heald\u2019s presence, the plaintiff had removed the needle from the catheter and held it in her hand, close to the opening of the catheter. When she did so, blood came out of the catheter at a very slow pace because the patient had an unusually low blood pressure. The plaintiff then hooked up the pressure transducer to the catheter. There was no further discussion with respect to the methods employed by the plaintiff during that attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">On August 18, 1988, Heald directed the plaintiff to perform an arterial line insertion without her supervision<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on a patient known to suffer from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). During this attempt, the plaintiff inserted the needle into the artery, advanced the catheter, withdrew the needle from the catheter and kept it close to the opening of the catheter. Immediately upon the plaintiffs withdrawing of the needle, the patient\u2019s blood began spurting out.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In order to stop the bleeding, the plaintiff placed her thumb over the top of the catheter and, in the course of doing so, pricked her thumb on the needle, which was contaminated with the patient\u2019s blood. After attempting to clean her injured hand, the plaintiff completed the arterial line insertion. As a result of the puncture, the plaintiff developed the HIV infection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action against the defendant alleging negligence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The hospital intervened as a coplaintiff, pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u00a7 31-293,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to assert its right to recover past and future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation payments that it was obligated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to make as a result of the injuries alleged in the plaintiffs action against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The defendant asserted two special defenses. In the first special defense, the defendant alleged that the plaintiffs own negligence proximately caused her injuries. In the second special defense, the defendant alleged that, because the hospital was obligated to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the plaintiff as a result of the same incident and injuries alleged in her complaint against the defendant, it enjoyed immunity from suit under the exclusivity provision of the act; General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> by virtue of its participa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>tion in a joint venture with the hospital, namely, the residency program.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The defendant moved for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiffs claim sounded in educational malpractice, which the trial court, <em>Silbert, J., </em>denied. The plaintiff moved to strike the defendant\u2019s second special defense contending that: (1) joint ventures do not fall within the definition of an \u201cemployer\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (10);<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (2) the defendant was not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>plaintiffs employer because it did not pay her for her services; (3) the defendant is not entitled to immunity because it did not obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance as required by \u00a7 31-284 (b);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (4) the defendant is not a joint venturer because it failed to allege a profit motive in its affiliation with the hospital; and (5) the plaintiff was a student and not a teacher, and therefore was not employed within the scope of the operation of the residency program.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The trial court, <em>Silbert, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendant\u2019s second special defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The court concluded that the defendant was not entitled to immunity under the act on the grounds that: (1) joint ventures do not fall within the purview of the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under \u00a7 31-275 (10) of the act; (2) the affiliation between the defendant and the hospital did not have a profit motive, as the defendant acknowledged at oral argument and in its pleadings, and therefore did not constitute a joint venture; (3) the defendant neither procured, contributed to, nor reimbursed the hospital for its workers\u2019 compensation coverage relating to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant did not pay the plaintiffs salary; (5) the defendant did not comply with the provisions of \u00a7 31-284 (b); and (6) the plaintiffs injury did not occur while performing the business of the affiliation between the defendant and the hospital, namely, to educate and train students; instead, the court ruled that the plaintiffs participation in the affiliation was that of a student, and not an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Upon the trial, the court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and, following the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the plaintiff, also denied the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">COGNIZABILITY OF THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the jury\u2019s verdict should be set aside and judgment rendered for it because, by permitting the adjudication of the plaintiffs claim, the trial court improperly recognized a tort of negligent resident education, which, according to the defendant: (1) previously has been rejected bythis court in <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>239 Conn. 574, 591-92, 687 A.2d 111 (1996); and (2) does not satisfy the uniform test that this court articulated in <em>Zamstein </em>v. <em>Marvasti, </em>240 Conn. 549, 558, 692 A.2d 781 (1997), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>for recognizing new causes of action. The defendant argues, in the alternative, that it is entitled to a new trial because the trial court impermissibly permitted specifications in the complaint that alleged educational malpractice to be submitted to the jury. The plaintiff argues, to the contrary, that her claim does not sound in educational malpractice, but is instead akin to the negligence claim recognized by this court in <em>Kirchner </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>150 Conn. 623, 626, 192 A.2d 641 (1963). We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Before reaching the merits of the arguments, we briefly address the standard by which we review this claim. In this claim, the defendant challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions. It is well established that when we review a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, those conclusions are subject to de novo review by this court. <em>Connecticut Associated Builders &amp; Contractors </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>251 Conn. 169, 177, 740 A.2d 813 (1999); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 752, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">We first address the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court improperly submitted to the juiy the plaintiffs claim, the cognizability of which, according to the defendant, was rejected by this court in <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 574. The trial court, <em>Silbert, J., </em>concluded that the plaintiffs claim was not an educational malpractice claim, but rather a claim of negligence, similar to that in <em>Kirchner </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 626. In essence, our task is to determine whether the plaintiffs claim sounds in educational malpractice, and is therefore barred by <em>Gupta, </em>or whether the plaintiffs claim is appropriately governed by <em>Kirchner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">We recently joined those courts that have rejected the cognizability of educational malpractice claims. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number><em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General </em>Hospital, supra, 239 Conn. 580, the plaintiff resident physician brought a breach of contract claim against the defendant hospital alleging that he was improperly dismissed from the residency training program, and that such dismissal was a breach of the residency agreement between the plaintiff and the hospital. The hospital based its decision to dismiss the plaintiff on his \u201cinability to make decisions in the operating room, his unwillingness to accept responsibility for errors, and gaps in the plaintiffs \u2018knowledge base.\u2019 \u201d Id., 579. In granting the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court \u201ccharacterized the decision to dismiss the plaintiff as an academic decision that lay solely within the province of the medical community.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 581. We affirmed the judgment of the trial court, stating that \u201c[a] residency committee\u2019s decision to dismiss a resident physician for poor performance in the clinic mirrors a professor\u2019s decision to fail a medical school student for poor performance in the classroom.\u201d Id., 587. We rejected the propriety of permitting courts to evaluate such an academic decision as the dismissal of a student based on poor performance. Id., 590-92, 594 \u2014 95. In short, we concluded that the plaintiff had not stated a cognizable claim. Id., 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">On the other hand, the plaintiff in <em>Kirchner </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 630, stated a viable cause of action. In <em>Kirchner, </em>the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant university and the supervisor of the woodworking shop at the university to recover damages for personal injuries. Id., 624. The plaintiff, an architectural student at the university, sustained injuries to his hand while operating amachine called a jointer in the university\u2019s woodworking shop. Id., 624 \u2014 25. One specification of negligence in the complaint alleged \u201ca failure to provide necessary rules, regulations and instructions in the use of the jointer, and another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>charged a failure to provide a proper type of push block to be used in connection with the operation of the jointer.\u201d Id., 626. This court, in reversing the judgment based upon a directed verdict for the defendants, stated: \u201cIt was the obligation of the defendants to exercise reasonable care not only to instruct and warn students in the safe and proper operation of the machines provided for their use but also to furnish and have available such appliances, if any, as would be reasonably necessary for the safe and proper use of the machines.\u201d Id., 627. We determined that this claim, implicating the duty owed by an educator not to cause physical injury by negligent conduct in the course of instruction, was viable. Id., 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We recognize that, at first blush, the distinction between an educational malpractice claim, rejected in <em>Gupta, </em>and a cognizable negligence claim arising in the educational context, permitted in <em>Kirchner, </em>may not always be clear. We conclude, however, that the distinction lies in the duty that is alleged to have been breached. If the duty alleged to have been breached is the duty to educate effectively, the claim is not cognizable. <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 593-94. If the duty alleged to have been breached is the common-law duty not to cause physical injuiy by negligent conduct, such a claim is, of course, cognizable. That common-law duty does not disappear when the negligent conduct occurs in an educational setting. This principle underlies this court\u2019s decision in <em>Kirchner. </em>The duty of an educator or supervisor to use reasonable care so as not to cause physical injury to a trainee during the course of instruction or supervision is not novel.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>We conclude that the duty alleged to have been breached in the present case is essentially the same duty that was implicated in <em>Kirchner, </em>namely, the duty not to cause physical harm by negligent conduct. The duty that the plaintiff alleged was breached here is not some general duty to educate her effectively, as was the claim alleged in <em>Gupta. </em>Instead, the plaintiff alleged that, in the course of instructing her, the defendant caused her to suffer physical injury as a result of its negligent conduct. Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff did not assert an educational malpractice claim, but instead stated a viable negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The defendant advances several arguments in support of its claim that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action sounds in educational malpractice. Although these arguments are not entirely without appeal, we do not find them persuasive. We address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court failed to follow <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>239 Conn. 574. The defendant contends that the trial court failed to \u201c[focus] on whether the alleged negligence claimed by [the] plaintiff flowed from or implicated educational decision making and evaluative assessments.\u201d Instead, the defendant maintains, the trial court did what we proscribed in <em>Gupta, </em>\u201cnot merely to make judgments as to the validity of broad educational policies . . . but, more importantly, to sit in review of the day-to-day implementation of these policies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 591. As a result, according to the defendant, the trial court improperly submitted all of the seventeen specifications of negligence for the jury\u2019s consideration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At the very least, the defendant contends, several specifications allege educational malpractice, however defined.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>examples, the defendant points to the allegations that it \u201c \u2018failed to instruct residents such as [the plaintiff] to decline to undertake procedures\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018failed to train more senior residents in the proper instruction of residents under their supervision.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">It is important to recognize the point at which our proscription in <em>Gupta, </em>to which the defendant refers, arose in our analysis. In that case, we already had concluded that the plaintiff s claim sounded in educational malpractice. Having reached that conclusion, our purpose was to determine, in light of public policy considerations, whether educational malpractice was a viable cause of action. We then invoked the policy of judicial noninterference in rejecting the cognizability of such claims. We caution, however, against placing undue weight on specific language of that proscription \u2014 for example, \u201cday-to-day implementation\u201d \u2014 in order to suggest that an educational institution\u2019s conduct on any given day is immune from judicial scrutiny when that conduct causes physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">We acknowledge that the jury in the present case was asked to determine, in part, whether Heald\u2019s training and particular aspects of the residency program <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>were adequate. We also acknowledge that these and similar assessments, raised by the plaintiffs allegations of negligence, require the kind of judicial oversight of the educational process that, for policy reasons, we eschewed in <em>Gupta. </em>What tips the balance here, however, and what distinguishes this case from <em>Gupta, </em>is the <em>result </em>of the claimed educational inadequacy. When the claimed result is an inadequate education, there is no viable claim because we are unwilling to recognize such a legal duty as a matter of public policy. <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 590-95. When, however, the result is physical harm, as in the present case, we <em>are </em>willing to recognize the claim because it falls within the traditionally recognized duty not to cause physical harm by negligent conduct. The fact that the harm is caused in an educational setting is not sufficient to <em>remove </em>the claim from that traditionally cognizable claim. Similarly, the fact that some of the allegations that support a claim of a failure of a defendant\u2019s duty not to cause physical injury by negligent conduct in the course of instruction may mirror some of those that would be alleged to support an educational malpractice claim, does not require the conclusion that the cause of action is one sounding in educational malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The defendant next contends that the present case is not controlled by <em>Kirchner </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 623, because, the defendant asserts, \u201cthere is nothing in <em>[Kirchner] </em>to indicate that the plaintiff challenged educational techniques, decision making or evaluative assessments in any way.\u201d Instead, the defendant likens the injured plaintiff in <em>Kirchner </em>to a student whose chair collapses during class. Neither the specifications of negligence in the complaint in <em>Kirchner, </em>nor the court\u2019s treatment of the case, however, supports the defendant\u2019s contention. As stated previously, the plaintiff in <em>Kirchner </em>alleged that the defendants failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201cto provide necessary rules, regulations and instructions in the use of the jointer . . . .\u201d Id., 626. The court stated that the defendants had a duty \u201cto exercise reasonable care ... to instruct and warn students in the safe and proper operation of the machines . . . .\u201d Id., 627. To liken the plaintiff in <em>Kirchner </em>to a student whose chair collapses during class, as the defendant does, is to ignore what the court in <em>Kirchner </em>recognized: the common-law duty not to cause physical injury by negligent conduct in the course of instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The defendant also argues that, in concluding that <em>Kirchner </em>governed the present case, the trial court improperly relied on two \u201cirrelevant\u201d factors: (1) the presence of physical injury; and (2) the fact that the plaintiffs claim was \u201c \u2018precise,\u2019 \u201d not \u201c \u2018broad.\u2019 \u201d The presence of physical injury, however, hardly can be considered irrelevant to the common-law duty not to cause such injury by negligent conduct. Similarly, the fact that the plaintiff made narrow, rather than overly broad, allegations is not irrelevant to the validity of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that, in distinguishing between educational malpractice claims and other negligence claims, the trial court improperly ignored whether the alleged negligence occurred in an environment where specialized external regulators provide oversight of educational standards with respect to residency training programs. The defendant contends, and suggests that our decision in <em>Gupta </em>stands for, the proposition that the existence of independent regulatory bodies that oversee medical residency programs<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> obviates the need for the judicial establishment of standards of care because those bodies serve as a protection for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>medical residents and are better equipped to evaluate the effectiveness of such programs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Critical to a proper understanding of our decision in <em>Gupta </em>is that the duty alleged to have been breached in that case was the duty to provide an adequate, effective residency program. On the basis of that understanding, in determining whether such a novel claim was cognizable, we referred to external regulators of graduate medical education as being appropriate evaluators of the effectiveness of such a program. <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 592. In other words, we relied on the existence of external regulators as one policy consideration in concluding that judicial noninterference was particularly appropriate where the alleged breach involved the duty to educate effectively, specifically, the failure to provide an adequate residency program. Id. The existence of external regulators, however, does not have the same weight where the alleged breach involves the well established common-law duty not to cause physical harm by negligent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The defendant also contends that the plaintiffs cause of action does not satisfy the requirements set forth in <em>Zamstein v. Marvasti, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 558, and refined by our decision in <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>241 Conn. 399, 407, 696 A.2d 332 (1997), for determining, when considering novel claims, whether a legal duty exists. In <em>Zamstein, </em>we stated that \u201cthe test for the existence of a legal duty of care entails (1) a determination of whether an ordinary person in the defendant\u2019s position, knowing what the defendant knew or should have known, would \u2018anticipate that harm of the general nature of that suffered was likely to result,\u2019 and (2) a determination, on the basis of a public policy analysis, of whether the defendant\u2019s responsibility for its negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>gent conduct should extend to the particular consequences or particular plaintiff in the case.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Zamstein </em>v. <em>Marvasti, </em>supra, 558. Because of our conclusion in part IA of this opinion that the plaintiffs claim alleges the breach of a previously recognized duty and, therefore, does not seek recovery based on a novel claim, the analysis set forth in <em>Zamstein </em>does not apply to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The defendant also argues that in <em>Gupta </em>v. <em>New Britain General Hospital, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 574, this court applied a version of this legal duty analysis in the context of medical resident education and concluded that the plaintiff did not state a viable cause of action. The court in <em>Gupta, </em>however, engaged in such an analysis because of the novelty of the duly alleged to have been breached in that case, namely, the duty to educate effectively. Id., 590-93. In the present case, because we are not presented with the task of determining whether to recognize a new duty, the legal duty analysis set forth in <em>Zamstein </em>v. <em>Marvasti, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 558, and <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 407, is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">THE MOTION TO STRIKE</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court, <em>Silbert, J., </em>improperly granted the plaintiffs motion to strike its special defense, which asserted immunity from suit under the exclusivity provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the act. General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We begin by setting out the well established standard of review in an appeal from the granting of a motion to strike. \u201cBecause a motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court, our review of the court\u2019s ruling on the [plaintiffs motion] is plenary. See <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 232-33, 680 A.2d 127 (1996) [cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997)]. . . . We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. <em>Bohan </em>v. <em>Last, </em>236 Conn. 670, 674, 674 A.2d 839 (1996); see also <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 108-109, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Autuori, </em>236 Conn. 820, 826, 676 A.2d 357 (1996). Moreover, we note that [w]hat is necessarily implied [in an allegation] need not be expressly alleged. <em>Clohessy </em>v. <em>Bachelor, </em>237 Conn. 31, 33 n.4, 675 A.2d 852 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Knight </em>v. <em>F. L. Roberts &amp; Co., </em>241 Conn. 466, 470-71, 696 A.2d 1249 (1997). \u201cIt is fundamental that in determining the sufficiency of a complaint challenged by a defendant\u2019s motion to strike, all well-pleaded facts and those facts necessarily implied from the allegations are taken as admitted. . . . <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>182 Conn. 80, 83, 438 A.2d 6 (1980). Indeed, pleadings must be construed broadly and realistically, rather than narrowly and technically. . . . <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Tardif </em>240 Conn. 610, 620, 692 A.2d 1266 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>243 Conn. 66, 100, 700 A.2d 655 (1997) (Berdon, J., concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">With respect to this claim, the defendant first argues that the trial court improperly concluded as a matter of law that joint ventures do not fall within the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under the act and, therefore, cannot seek shelter under the act\u2019s exclusivity provision. Section 31-275 (10) of the act defines \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201cany person, corporation, limited liability company, firm, partnership, voluntary association, joint stock association, the state and any public corporation within the state using the services of one or more employees for pay, or the legal representative of any such employer . . . .\u201d Under the act\u2019s exclusivity provision, \u201c[a]n employer who complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section shall not be liable for any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment .... All rights and claims between an employer who complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section and employees, or any representatives or dependents of such employees, arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The defendant contends that the definition of employer encompasses joint ventures because they fall within either the term \u201c \u2018partnership\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018person,\u2019 \u201d or both. The plaintiff contends, to the contrary, that a joint venture may not be considered an employer under \u00a7 31-275 (10) because the itemized list of covered employers does not include the term \u201cjoint venture.\u201d We agree with the defendant in part, and conclude that a joint venture may be considered an employer for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation purposes. We base our conclusion on the principle that the expansive language of the act should be broadly construed, the similarities between joint ventures and partnerships, and the fact that a contrary conclusion could impede the act\u2019s remedial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Whether a joint venture may be an employer under the act presents a question of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Id.; <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>[supra, 220 Conn. 755-56].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bortner v. Woodbridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 258-59, 736 A.2d 104 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The language governing who may be deemed an employer for workers\u2019 compensation purposes is expansive. Section 31-275 (10) expressly includes within its ambit \u201cany person, corporation, limited liability company, firm, partnership, voluntary association, joint stock association, the state and any public corporation within the state using the services of one or more employees for pay, or the legal representative of any such employer . . . .\u201d The definition of employer has remained largely unchanged since the act\u2019s enactment in 1913. In its original form, the act defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>\u201c \u2018employer\u2019 \u201d as \u201cany natural person, corporation, firm, partnership, or joint stock association, the state, and any public corporation within the state using the services of another for pay; it includes also the legal representative of any such employer.\u201d Public Acts 1913, c. 138, part B, \u00a7 43. The scope of this definition subsequently was amended to change \u201cany natural person\u201d to \u201cany person\u201d; Public Acts 1915, c. 288, \u00a7 22; and to include \u201cvoluntary association\u201d; Public Acts 1921, c. 306, \u00a7 11; and \u201climited liability company\u201d; Public Acts 1995, No. 95-79, \u00a7 117. Unlike the counterpart definition of \u201cemployee\u201d contained in \u00a7 31-275 (9),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> which excepts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>from its purview certain persons, the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d contains no provision that makes express exceptions from its broad scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 31-275 (10) is consistent with the notion that the act, broadly construed, is capacious enough to include a joint venture as an employer under the act. During the committee hearings on the bill that ultimately became chapter 138 of the 1913 Public Acts, Professor Willard C. Fisher, an economist at Wesleyan University who had been engaged by the standing committees on judiciary and labor to assist in drafting the act, remarked that \u201cthe law ought to be as wide as possible in its scope; there ought to be no employment left out that can practicably be included.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1913 Sess., p. 197; see A. Grillo, \u201cFifty Years of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u2014 An Historical Review,\u201d 38 Conn. B.J. 239, 244-45 (1964). Moreover, there is nothing in the legislative history to preclude, as a matter of law, a joint venture from being considered an employer under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">It is well settled that the act is to be construed broadly in order to serve its remedial purpose. <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>244 Conn. 781, 800, 712 A.2d 396, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Slotnik </em>v. <em>Considine, </em>525 U.S. 1017, 119 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>542, 142 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1998). \u201cConnecticut first adopted a statutory scheme of workers\u2019 compensation in 1913. The purpose of the [act] . . . General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.; is to provide compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, regardless of fault. <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 240 A.2d 886 (1968). Under the statute, the employee surrenders his right to bring a common law action against the employer, thereby limiting the employer\u2019s liability to the statutory amount. ... In return, the employee is compensated for his or her losses without having to prove liability. ... In a word, these statutes compromise an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for <em>relatively quick </em>and certain compensation. . . . <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 381, 698 A.2d 859 (1997). The intention of the framers of the act was to establish <em>a speedy, </em>effective and inexpensive method for determining claims for compensation. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>St. Paul's Universalist Church, </em>109 Conn. 737, 147 A. 671 [1929], . . . <em>Chieppo </em>v. <em>Robert E.

Our case law has long recognized that a joint venture, also referred to as a joint adventure or joint enterprise, exists \u201cwhere two or more parties combine their property, money, efforts, skill or knowledge in some common undertaking . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>137 Conn. 668, 671, 81 A.2d 115 (1951); <em>Lesser </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>115 Conn. 86, 89, 160 A. 302 (1932); <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>107 Conn. 342, 349, 140 A. 745 (1928). \u201cThe relationship between contracting parties cannot amount to a joint venture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>unless the parties so intend.\u201d <em>Electronic Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Automatic Equipment Development Corp., </em>185 Conn. 31, 35, 440 A.2d 249 (1981). Generally, joint ventures relate to a single transaction, whereas partnerships exist for a general business. 1 R. Rowley, Partnerships (2d Ed. 1960) \u00a7 6.1, p. 39; see <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra, 671 (\u201c[w]e have pointed out that the distinction between a partnership and a joint adventure is often very slight, but that commonly the former is formed for carrying on a general business, while the latter is more often limited to a single transaction or course of transactions\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>supra, 349 (\u201c[w]hile the distinction between a partnership and a joint adventure is often very slight, it is commonly considered that, as respects the character of the enterprise, a partnership is formed for the purpose of carrying on a general business of one sort or another, and a joint adventure is more commonly limited to a single transaction or course of transactions\u201d). Partnerships, however, may also exist for the purpose of a single transaction. 1 R. Rowley, supra, \u00a7 6.5, p. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We noted in <em>Lesser </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 115 Conn. 89, that \u201cthe relations and obligations of [a joint venture] in general are those which govern a partnership. This concept of a joint adventure as distinguished from a partnership, is of comparatively modem origin and is a creation of the American courts. At common law and still in England, such an enterprise is treated as an informal partnership.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>supra, 107 Conn. 349, we stated that a joint venture \u201cwas what at common law was looked upon as a sort of informal partnership. It would probably still be so considered in the British Dominion, but in this country it is commonly defined as ajoint enterprise or adventure.\u201d Although regarded as an informal partnership, joint ventures are generally governed by the same principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>that govern common-law partnerships. 1 R. Rowley, supra, \u00a7 6.1, p. 39; see <em>Travis </em>v. <em>St. John, </em>176 Conn. 69, 73, 404 A.2d 885 (1978); see also <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra, 137 Conn. 670-71 (applying to joint venture partnership principle that death of one partner dissolves partnership); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra, 672 (duty of survivor of joint venture or partnership to wind up its affairs); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>supra, 673 (accounting between joint venturers governed by same principles as accounting between partners). As in a partnership, the members of a joint venture \u201cundertake fiduciary duties to each other concerning matters within the scope of the joint venture.\u201d <em>Electronic Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Automatic Equipment Development Corp., </em>supra, 185 Conn. 35; see also <em>Meinhard </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>249 N.Y. 458, 463-64, 164 N.E. 545 (1928) (\u201c[jJoint adventurers, like co-partners, owe to one another, while the enterprise continues, the duty of the finest loyalty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The plaintiff points out that a key distinction between a joint venture and a partnership is that, although mutual agency is required in order to have a partnership; <em>Travis </em>v. <em>St. John, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 72-73; it is not required for the existence of a joint venture. <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>supra, 107 Conn. 349 (\u201c[tjhere is not the relation of principal and agent in joint adventure which we find in a partnership\u201d). This distinction, however, does not alter our conclusion. The fact that a joint venture may not share every particular legal or factual characteristic of a common-law partnership does not mean that their similarities are insufficient to treat them the same for purposes of determining who may be an employer under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">To further its purposes, \u201c[the] language [of the act] is not that of restriction or limitation, but all-embracing. . . . [I]t applies to <em>all contracts </em>of employment, and this was intended to mean ... by <em>whomsoever made. . . . Douthwright </em>v. <em>Champlin, </em>[91 Conn. 524, 527, 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>A. 97 (1917)].\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 805; see also <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 541, 494 A.2d 555 (1985); <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 117, 411 A.2d 924 (1979); <em>DeCarli </em>v. <em>Manchester Public Warehouse Co., </em>107 Conn. 359, 364, 140 A. 637 (1928). \u201c[T]he act must be interpreted liberally to achieve its humanitarian purposes . . . [and] this court should not impose limitations on the benefits provided for a . . . worker that the statute itself does not clearly specify. . . . <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>239 Conn. 676, 682-83, 687 A.2d 146 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Transportation General, Inc., </em>245 Conn. 613, 626, 716 A.2d 857 (1998) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). It is consistent with these general principles to treat joint ventures similarly to partnerships for purposes of determining those entities that may qualify as an employer under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Finally, excluding joint ventures from the scope of the act\u2019s coverage, as a matter of law, would, under certain circumstances, impede the legislative policy the statute was designed to effectuate. \u201cThe purpose of the [workers\u2019] compensation statute is to compensate the worker for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer. <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>[208 Conn. 589, 598-99, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988)]; <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>[179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979)]. The [act] compromise^] an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation. <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>supra, 599; see <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 446, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997); <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>[supra, 242 Conn. 381]; <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>Inc., </em>[supra, 196 Conn. 97].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The following hypothetical situation illustrates how excluding joint ventures from the act\u2019s scope would impede its purpose: An art museum and a cultural center for the arts form a joint venture for the purpose of hosting special events, whereby the cultural center, which has considerable seating availability, provides the facilities for the events, and the art museum displays various pieces of art and provides commentary on them. The cultural center employs and pays the salary of a janitor, who cleans the center for these events. In fact, however, both the art museum and the cultural center, as joint venturers, exercise control over the manner in which the janitor\u2019s duties are to be carried out. During the course of cleaning the stage, the janitor is injured. He seeks to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the art museum because the cultural center, which pays his salary, has no workers\u2019 compensation coverage. If joint ventures were excluded, as a matter of law, from the purview of the act, the janitor would be precluded from recovering workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the art museum, even though at the time of the accident he was acting in furtherance of the joint venture, and the art museum exercised control over his conduct. We fail to see how precluding recovery, as a matter of law, in such a circumstance would further the remedial purpose of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly concluded that a profit motive is required in order for a j oint venture to exist, thereby precluding the defendant, which is a nonprofit organization, from asserting that it was the plaintiffs employer by virtue of its joint venture with the hospital, which also is a nonprofit organization. The plaintiff maintains, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>existence of a joint venture requires a profit motive and that, therefore, the relationship between the defendant and the hospital cannot constitute a joint venture because their affiliation lacks such a motive.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant, and we conclude that although a profit motive is often recognized as one factor suggesting the existence of a joint venture, the absence of a profit motive is not fatal, as a matter of law, to the existence of a joint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The legislature, in the context of statutes other than the act, has used the term \u201cjoint venture\u201d to include nonprofit organizations. This treatment by the legislature supports our conclusion that nonprofit organizations are not precluded, as a matter of law, from forming joint ventures. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 8-113a (n)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (\u201c \u2018[hjousing partnership\u2019 means any partnership, limited partnership, <em>joint venture, </em>trust or association <em>consisting of </em>. . . a housing authority, <em>a nonprofit corporation or </em>both\u201d [emphasis added]); General Statutes \u00a7 8-430 (27)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (\u201c \u2018[h]ousing partnership\u2019 means any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>partnership, limited partnership, <em>joint venture, </em>trust or association consisting of . . . <em>one or more nonprofit </em>entities\u201d [emphasis added]); and General Statutes \u00a7 10a-252 (4) (\u201c \u2018Lj]oint venture\u2019 means a cooperative contractual arrangement between the corporation and one or more other parties including, but not limited to, hospitals, physicians, dentists, medical and dental clinics, health maintenance organizations, insurance companies, venture capital firms, banks and governmental agencies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Furthermore, to allow the formation of ajoint venture without a profit motive, and to include such a venture within the purview of the act, is consistent with the applicability of the act to other nonprofit employers. It is the majority rule, with which we agree, that workers\u2019 compensation acts generally apply to charitable and other nonprofit employers. 4 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1999) \u00a7 72.04 [2], For example, in <em>Levecque v. Dupuis, </em>119 Conn. 224, 229-30, 175 A. 782 (1934), this court, upon concluding that the plaintiff had sustained injuries while in the employ of the defendant church, applied the act to the church and required it to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the plaintiff, despite the lack of a profit motive on the part of the church. It would be incongruous to conclude that a single nonprofit entity may be an employer under the act, but that ajoint venture of two such entities may not be an employer under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The plaintiff also argues that a joint venture that lacks a profit motive cannot be an employer under the act because a profit motive is required for a common-law partnership. We disagree. It is true that a profit motive is required for a common-law partnership.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See, e.g., E.

The remedial purposes of the act, and the incongruity of such a preclusion when a single nonprofit entity may be an employer, counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>strongly against such a conclusion. Although, in concluding that the language of the act is broad enough to include joint ventures we pointed to the similarities between partnerships and joint ventures, we do not suggest that only a joint venture that also would be considered a partnership under the act may be deemed an employer under \u00a7 31-275 (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Having concluded that a joint venture between two nonprofit organizations <em>may </em>be an employer under the act, we next consider the specific circumstances under which either one of the joint venturers will be deemed to be an employer for purposes of the act. \u201cThe entire statutory scheme of the [act] is directed toward those who are in the employer-employee relationship as those terms are defined in the act and discussed in our cases. That relationship is threshold to the rights and benefits under the act .... <em>Vanzant </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>219 Conn. 674, 678, 594 A.2d 967 (1991); <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>[207 Conn. 420, 433, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988)].\u201d <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 800-801. Just as a claimant may invoke the act\u2019s remedies only if the claimant satisfies the jurisdictional requirement of an employee as set forth in \u00a7 31-275 (9); <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>supra, 800-801; <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 60, 566 A.2d 670 (1989); only those defendants who satisfy the requisite jurisdictional standard of an employer as set forth in \u00a7 31-275 (10) may successfully assert the exclusivity of the act as a bar to a common-law action by an alleged employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Whether a joint venturer is an employer under the act is therefore a question of the specific j oint venturer\u2019s degree of control over the alleged employee. \u201cThe \u2018right to control\u2019 test determines the [relationship between a worker and a putative employer] by asking whether the putative employer has \u2018the right to control the means and methods\u2019 used by the worker in the performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>of his or her job. <em>Hunte </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>238 Conn. 146, 154, 680 A.2d 1231 (1996); <em>Silverberg </em>v. <em>Great Southwest Fire Ins.

It is not the fact of actual interference with the control, but the right to interfere, that makes the difference between an independent contractor and a servant or agent. . . . <em>Latimer </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>[216 Conn. 237, 248, 579 A.2d 497 (1990)]; <em>Caraher v.

In <em>Coady, </em>the plaintiff widow of a plumber, who died while attempting to locate a gas leak in his employer\u2019s shop, sought recoveiy from her husband\u2019s employer under the act. Id., 54-55. She claimed that, although his plumbing business employed less than five employees, he still qualified as an employer under the act by virtue of his joint venture with a master carpenter and a master mason. These three master craftsmen had formed a joint venture for the purpose of purchasing land and building houses thereon. Id., 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The plaintiff argued that, because some carpenters, who were supplied by the master carpenter, were working on houses for the joint venture on the day of her husband\u2019s death, they should be counted toward the number of employees employed by her husband\u2019s employer. Id., 55-56. The court rejected this argument, finding that \u201cthese three men, each engaged in different, established business, associated themselves in an outside joint adventure. Each agreed to furnish at cost the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>labor and materials which he was specially equipped to furnish, and each was to have the control of his own men. As between themselves each remained the sole employer of his own workmen, having the exclusive right of hiring, controlling and discharging them, and the exclusive responsibility for their wages. To that extent the partners expressly agreed not to confer mutual agency each upon the other.\u201d Id., 56. The court held that \u201cthe finding of facts as to the actual scope of [the coadventurer\u2019s] agency\u201d controlled the workers\u2019 compensation claim. Id., 57. The court did not analyze the differences between a partnership and a joint venture and, in fact, used the terms interchangeably. Instead, the court concluded that it was a matter of <em>fact, </em>namely, the coadventurer\u2019s lack of control over the decedent, that precluded the application of the act to the specific joint venturer. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">With these legal conclusions in mind, we turn to the allegations in the defendant\u2019s special defense to determine whether it properly alleged facts sufficient to support its claim of immunity under the act. Mindful of the well settled principles concerning the construction of pleadings, we conclude that the allegations of the special defense, properly construed, would permit proof of facts sufficient to invoke immunity under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">In the stricken special defense, the defendant alleged that it and the hospital were involved in a joint venture, \u201cin which they combined their respective property, money, efforts, skill and knowledge in the common purpose of operating the internal medicine residency program to educate and train participants such as the plaintiff. \u201d The defendant also alleged that this j oint venture was one in which it and the hospital \u201ceach had a voice.\u201d It alleged that the plaintiff was injured while participating in the residency program, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>defendant\u2019s coadventurer, the hospital, had paid, and would continue to pay, workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the plaintiff. We conclude that under these allegations, the defendant could have proven that it had a sufficient right to control the plaintiffs conduct so as to satisfy the requirements of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The plaintiff argues that the special defense must fail because direct employment is required in order to fall under the act\u2019s coverage, and that because the defendant was not her direct employer as conceded in the pleadings, it may not be deemed an employer for purposes of the act. We disagree. Reading the special defense broadly in the defendant\u2019s favor, as we must, we infer from the defendant\u2019s various uses of the term direct employment \u2014 for example, when it states that the plaintiff was a direct employee of the hospital\u2014 that it meant that the hospital, rather than the defendant, paid the plaintiffs salary. This allegation, however, is not inconsistent with proof that the defendant nonetheless had a sufficient degree of the right to control the plaintiff so as to satisfy the requirements of employment under the act. Whether an employer-employee relationship exists for purposes of the act is a question of the right to control, and not whether an employee is a direct employee of one or the other joint venturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Finally, the plaintiff argues that the special defense must fail because it alleges that the plaintiffs role in the joint venture was only as a student, and not as an employee. The specific language in the special defense states that \u201cthe common purpose [between the defendant and the hospital] of operating the internal medicine residency program [was] to educate and train participants such as the plaintiff.\u201d This language does not by itself preclude proof of an employer-employee relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. Depending on the evidence adduced, a medical resident who is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>be educated and trained also may be an employee for purposes of the act.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Although we conclude that the defendant has carried its burden of <em>pleading </em>that it is entitled to immunity under the act, on retrial the defendant will retain the burden of <em>proving </em>that it is so entitled. It remains the burden of the party asserting the exclusivity of the act to prove that a joint venture existed, that it exercised the requisite control over the injured party to satisfy the right to control test, and that the injured party was injured while acting in furtherance of the joint venture. We conclude only that the allegations of the defendant\u2019s special defense were legally sufficient and, therefore, that the trial court improperly struck the special defense.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">THE JURY INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>improperly failed to instruct the jury that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>in order to find the defendant liable, it must base its findings on credible expert testimony.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The defendant submitted a request to charge instructing the jury that, although it was not required to believe the expert testimony, it must base its conclusions regarding the standard of care issues on expert testimony, in order to find the defendant negligent.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Although the trial court gave the standard instruction that the jury did not have to accept the expert testimony, the court declined to give the defendant\u2019s proffered instruction, and instead, charged the jury as follows: \u201cOn the issue of any duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, you <em>may </em>consider the evidence of the medical experts on what standard of care was appropriate in 1988 in the circumstances in which the plaintiff and the defendant found themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Upon the defendant\u2019s taking exception to the instruction given to the jmy to the extent that the charge did not require expert testimony, the court responded: \u201cI have suggested to the jury that expert testimony is relevant for them to consider with respect to the standard of care, but I have not restricted them to that, and I think that\u2019s all they\u2019ll need to do.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Whether expert testimony was required to support the plaintiffs claim compels us to consider whether \u201cthe determination of the standard of care requires knowledge that is beyond the experience of [the] fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>finder . . . <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 226, 682 A.2d 106 (1996); see <em>State </em>v. <em>McClary, </em>207 Conn. 233, 245, 541 A.2d 96 (1988) (expert testimony required because nature and cause of victim\u2019s injuries \u201cmanifestly beyond the ken of the average trier of fact, be it judge or jury\u201d); see also <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 349, 64 A.2d 330 (1949); <em>Sickmund </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>122 Conn. 375, 379, 189 A. 876 (1937); <em>Slimak </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>106 Conn. 366, 368, 138 A. 153 (1927); <em>Matyas </em>v. <em>Minck, </em>37 Conn. App. 321, 326, 655 A.2d 1155 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">\u201cGenerally, expert testimony is <em>admissible </em>if (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McClendon, </em>248 Conn. 572, 586, 730 A.2d 1107 (1999). In some circumstances, however, expert testimony is not only admissible, it is required to support a claim. \u201cExcept in the unusual case where the want of care or skill is so gross that it presents an almost conclusive inference of want of care; <em>Puro </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>188 Conn. 301, 305, 449 A.2d 176 (1982); the testimony of an expert witness is necessary to establish both the standard of proper professional skill or care on the part of a physician; <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 66, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986); and that the defendant failed to conform to that standard of care. <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>207 Conn. 125, 131, 540 A.2d 666 (1988); <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>[143 Conn. 290, 295, 122 A.2d 21 (1956)]. . . . <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>20 Conn.

The plaintiffs amended complaint alleged that the defendant: \u201ca. failed to adequately and properly supervise and train the plaintiff; b. failed to adequately and properly teach, train and demonstrate to the plaintiff the proper performance of arterial line insertions; c. failed to adequately and properly instruct the plaintiff in techniques to avoid exposure to patient\u2019s blood during arterial line insertions; d. failed to correct the plaintiffs improper technique used in inserting arterial lines; e. failed to adequately and properly instruct the plaintiff in techniques to avoid needle punctures with contaminated blood during arterial line insertions; f. ordered the plaintiff to insert an arterial line in an AIDS patient without adequate training; g. ordered the plaintiff to insert an arterial line in an AIDS patient without supervision; h. failed to assess the plaintiffs ability to insert an arterial line prior to ordering the plaintiff to perform said procedure; i. knew or should have known that the plaintiff was not competent to perform the insertion of an arterial line but ordered the plaintiff to perform said procedure on an AIDS patient; j. failed to adequately train the plaintiff regarding safety procedures to be employed when inserting arterial lines; k. failed to instruct residents such as the plaintiff to decline to undertake procedures where competence was lacking; <em>l. </em>failed to train more senior residents in the proper instruction of residents under their supervision; m. knew or should have known that the plaintiff was likely to be exposed to HIV infection by the improper insertion of arterial lines without proper training but failed to warn the plaintiff of the risk of such exposure; n. coerced or otherwise pressured the plaintiff to undertake the performance of procedures regardless of competence; o. failed to provide a safe work environment; p. failed to provide graded responsibility to residents in the program, such as the plaintiff, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>accordance with their current competence; [and] q. failed to consider the welfare of the residents, such as the plaintiff, in assigning them to high risk patients without adequate training.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Simply put, these allegations required the jury to answer questions that may not be appropriately answered by laypersons. They require specialized knowledge and expertise regarding the standard of care that applied to residency training programs in 1988, and whether the alleged failures of the defendant constituted a breach of that standard. Defining that standard of care and determining whether the alleged conduct constituted a breach of that standard are simply not matters of common sense or within the experience of laypersons. See <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 226-29 (requiring expert testimony in order to establish standard of care applicable to umpires and that alleged conduct constituted breach of that standard). Thus, the jury should have been restricted to credible expert testimony in resolving the issues of the applicable standard of care and whether that standard had been breached by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Moreover, the fact that we concluded in part I A of this opinion, that the plaintiffs claim sounded in negligence, rather than educational malpractice, does not automatically mean that the jury may be left to its own devices in evaluating the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s conduct. The question is not the label placed on the claim. The question is whether the allegations presented to the jury, irrespective of that label, are within a juror\u2019s common sense or experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">By using the word may \u2014 a term of permissive language \u2014 in its instruction to the jury that \u201cyou may consider the evidence of the medical experts on what standard of care was appropriate,\u201d the trial court vested the jury with discretion to base its conclusion as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>standard of care on something other than the evidence of the medical experts. By not requiring the jury to rely on credible expert testimony in deciding the standard of care issues, the court improperly permitted a verdict in favor of the plaintiff even if the jury had found that the plaintiffs experts were not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Our conclusion does not mean, of course, that the jury was required to believe the expert testimony. See, e.g., <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Griffin Hospital, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 145 (\u201c[t]he jury is under no obligation to credit the evidence proffered by any witnesses, including experts . . . even if that evidence is uncontroverted\u201d [citations omitted]); <em>Bieluch </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>199 Conn. 550, 555, 509 A.2d 8 (1986) (\u201c[t]he trial court is not bound by the uncontra-dicted testimony of any witness\u201d); see also C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988 &amp; Sup. 2000) \u00a7 3.1. It means only that the jury could not appropriately make factual findings on the allegations regarding the standard of care, based on something other than the evidence of the medical education experts. Stated another way, if, with respect to any specification of negligence, the jury did not believe the relevant expert testimony, it would have to find for the defendant on that specification, because the plaintiff would not have met her burden of proof.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The plaintiff contends that expert testimony was not required as a foundation for a finding of liability \u201cin this case because the standard of care issues either were undisputed or were matters of common sense, or both.\u201d According to the plaintiff, because all of the witnesses agreed that she should have removed the needle from the immediate area after withdrawing it from the catheter, \u201cthe only question was whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>plaintiff knew it and, if not, why not.\u201d Resolving such a question, the plaintiff maintains, does not require expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">We disagree with the theory advanced by the plaintiff on this issue. The factual assertions that the plaintiff makes cannot convert a legally flawed jury instruction into a proper one. Such factual claims are appropriate in determining whether such a flawed instruction constitutes harmless error. As stated previously, however; see footnote 30 of this opinion; we need not reach the question of any alleged harm that resulted from the improper instructions. We therefore decline to address the plaintiffs factual claim that the standard of care issues were undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In this opinion PALMER, CALLAHAN, HENNESSY and LEUBA, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-11\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b665-12\"> Although the female plaintiff was granted permission to prosecute the action using the fictitious name John Doe, we will use feminine pronouns when referring to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b665-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 provides: \u201cBasic rights and liabilities.

If the employee, the employer or the custodian of the Second Injury Fund brings an action against such person, he shall immediately notify the others, in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of the action and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the others may join as parties plaintiff in the action within thirty days after such notification, and, if the others fail to join as parties plaintiff, their right of action against such person shall abate. In any case in which an employee brings an action against a party other than an employer who failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of section 31-284, in accordance with the provisions of this section, and the employer is a party defendant in the action, the employer may join as a party plaintiff in the action. The bringing of any action against an employer shall not constitute notice to the employer within the meaning of this section. If the employer and the employee join as parties plaintiff in the action and any damages are recovered, the damages shall be so apportioned that the claim of the employer, as defined in this section, shall take precedence over that of the injured employee in the proceeds of the recovery, after the deduction of reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorneys\u2019 lees, incurred by the employee in effecting the recovery. The rendition of a judgment in favor of the employee or the employer against the party shall not terminate the employer\u2019s obligation to make further compensation which the commissioner thereafter deems payable to the injured employee.

No compromise with the person by either the employer or the employee shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the other, unless assented to by him.

The word \u2018compensation\u2019, as used in this section, shall be construed to include incapacity payments to an injured employee, payments to the dependents of a deceased employee, sums paid out for surgical, medical and hospital services to an injured employee, the burial fee provided by subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of section 31-306, payments made under the provisions of sections 31-312 and 31-313, and payments made under the provisions of section 31-284b in the case of an action brought under this section by the employer or an action brought under this section by the employee in which the employee has alleged and been awarded such payments as damages.

First, the plaintiff points out that the defendant did not. properly preserve this claim for appellate review in that it did not: move to strike any of the specifications; request a jury charge limited to the narrower specifications; take exception to the jury instruction regarding all specifications; or make any objection to the submission of all specifications in its motion for a directed verdict or its motion to set aside the verdict. Thus, the plaintiff argues that the aider by verdict doctrine, as applied in <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>215 Conn. 450, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990), remanded, 24 Conn. App. 377, 588 A.2d 656 (1991), rev\u2019d, 222 Conn. 233, 610 A.2d 574 (1992), allows a verdict, based on poorly worded pleadings, to stand absent surprise or prejudice. The defendant\u2019s claim here, however, is essentially that the plaintiff failed to state a viable cause of action. The aider by verdict doctrine does not apply in such a case. We also conclude that this claim was adequately preserved by: the defendant\u2019s objections to various specifications in its motion for summary judgment based on educational malpractice arguments; its motion for a directed verdict that incorporated its objections; and its motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Second, the plaintiff also argues that appellate consideration of this claim on appeal is precluded on the ground that, pursuant to the general verdict rule, as redefined in <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>225 Conn. 782, 626 A.2d 719 (1993), the defendant did not request jury interrogatories, so that it cannot show that the jury considered the specifications to which it now objects. In <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 801, we concluded that the general verdict rule only applies in the following circumstances: \u201c(1) denial of separate counts of a complaint; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>(2) denial of separate defenses pleaded as such; (3) denial of separate legal theories of recovery or defense pleaded in one count or defense, as the case may be; (4) denial of a complaint and pleading of a special defense; and (5) denial of a specific defense, raised under a general denial, that had been asserted as the case was tried but that should have been specially pleaded.\u201d The plaintiff contends that, if we were to conclude that there were two theories of recovery alleged, the third prong of this analysis applies. The defendant, to the contrary, argues that the general verdict rule does not apply because there are no \u201c \u2018distinct causes of action,\u2019 \u201d but \u201c \u2018separate factual allegations made in support of a single cause of action,\u2019 \u201d and that, therefore, appellate consideration of its claim of trial court error is not precluded. Although we find it difficult to square the defendant\u2019s argument\u2014 that the plaintiff only states a single cause of action \u2014 with its argument that at least some of the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint sounded in educational malpractice, we conclude that the general verdict rule does not apply because the plaintiff has asserted only one legal theory of recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\"> The defendant cites to the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, the American Board of Internal Medicine, and the American Medical Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b688-10\"> In <em>Jaworski </em>v. <em>Kiernan, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 407, we stated that the factors to consider in the public policy portion of the analysis are: \u201c(1) the normal expectations of participants in the sport in which the plaintiff and the defendant were engaged; (2) the public policy of encouraging continued vigorous participation in recreational sporting activities while weighing the safety of the participants; (3) the avoidance of increased litigation; and (4) the decisions of other jurisdictions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> See footnote 3 of this opinion for the text of \u00a7 31-284 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (9) provides: \u201c(A) \u2018Employee\u2019 means any person who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">\u201c(i) Has entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer, whether the contract contemplated the performance of duties within or without the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">\u201c(ii) Is a sole proprietor or business partner who accepts the provisions of this chapter in accordance with subdivision (10) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">\u201c(iii) Is elected to serve as a member of the General Assembly of this state; \u201c(iv) Is a salaried officer or paid member of any police department or fire department;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">\u201c(v) Is a volunteer police officer, whether the officer is designated as special or auxiliary, upon vote of the legislative body of the town, city or borough in which the officer serves; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">\u201c(vi) Is an elected or appointed official or agent of any town, city or borough in the state, upon vote of the proper authority of the town, city or borough, including the elected or appointed official or agent, irrespective of the manner in which he is appointed or employed.

Profit sharing is simply one type of evidence of an intention to form a partnership. See E. Gilmore, Partnership (1911) p. 19 (\u201cThe rule which made the sharing of profits a test of partnership rather than a test of intention to form a partnership was overthrown in England, and was never generally accepted in the United States.

Because the plaintiff expressly states that she does not rely on \u00a7 31-284 (b) in arguing that the defendant could not be deemed her employer, we only briefly consider the argument. We discern no purpose in precluding ajointventurer, who satisfies the right to control test as developed by our case law, from asserting the act\u2019s exclusivity as a bar in a situation where the injured employee has obtained workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the coadventurer. The defendant directs our attention to the following cases that stand for the same proposition: <em>Burke v. Charles B. Esher, Inc., </em>397 So. 2d 439 (Fla. App. 1981); <em>Haertel </em>v. <em>Sonshine Carpet </em>Co., 104 Nev. 331, 333-34, 757 P.2d 364 (1988); <em>Lawler </em>v. <em>Dallas Statler-Hilton Joint Venture, </em>793 S.W.2d 27, 29 (Tex.

Also, this procedural posture makes it unnecessary to consider the plaintiffs contention that any error in the instructions was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> The defendant\u2019s request to charge provided in relevant part: \u201cYou should consider each expert, opinion received in evidence in this case and give it such weight as you think it deserves. . . . It is in no way binding upon you. ... In order to recover on her claim against the [defendant], the plaintiff must prove by the preponderance of the evidence three elements: First, the plaintiff must establish by expert testimony the particular standard of care to which the defendant had a duty to conform. Second, the plaintiff must prove by expert testimony that the defendant failed to measure up to that applicable standard of care. Third, the plaintiff must prove by expert testimony that the defendant\u2019s deviation, or [departure] from Hie applicable standard of care, was the proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\"> With regard to negligence, the trial court gave the following instruction: \u201cThe plaintiff has alleged that she has been injured by the defendant\u2019s negligence. Negligence involves the violation of a legal duty \u2014 negligence involves the violation of a legal duty which one owes to another to care for the safety of the other person or property. The principles of negligence law have been pronounced by courts in England and the United States of America for hundreds of years, so we often speak of these broad principles as common-law negligence and it can be stated as follows: When the activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of two persons or entities come together in such a way that unless proper care is used injury is likely to result, each must use reasonable care to avoid the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"azq-dedup-0\">\u201cThe plaintiff claims that the defendant was negligent in the way it acted here. Negligence is the doing of something that a reasonably prudent person would not do under the circumstances, or conversely, failing to do what a reasonably prudent person would do under the circumstances. It\u2019s the breach or violation of a legal duty owed by one to another, and such legal duty is the exercise of reasonable care. Reasonable care is defined as the care which an ordinarily prudent or careful person would use in view of the surrounding circumstances. You must determine the question by placing an ordinarily prudent person in the situation and ask yourselves what would such a person have done? Note that it is the care which such a person would have used under the surrounding circumstances, that is, in view of the facts known or the facts of which the defendant should have been aware at the time. You see, the standard of care required of an ordinarily prudent person under the circumstances never varies, but the degree or the amount of care may vary with those circumstances. For example, in circumstances that involve only a slight risk or danger, a slight amount of care might be sufficient to constitute reasonable care, while in circumstances of greater risk or greater danger an accordingly great amount of care would be required to constitute reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"AK-l\">\u201cSince the intricacies of the operation of medical residency programs are normally outside the knowledge of most lay persons, each side has questioned witnesses who have an expertise in this area. On the issue of any duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, you may consider the evidence of the medical experts on what standard of care was appropriate in 1988 in the circumstances in which the plaintiff and the defendant found themselves.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b708-10\"> The plaintiff agreed at oral argument before this court that the trial court\u2019s instructions as given did not require the jury to rely on expert testimony in order to find the defendant hable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\"> Similarly, the trial court should not submit to the jury any such specification that is not supported by expert testimony.

I respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">The defendant asserted the following special defense: \u201c[The] [p]laintiff was injured on August 18, 1988, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>[she]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was participating in a residency program in internal medicine. Although [the] plaintiffs complaint alleges . . . that Yale University [the defendant] was operating this program, the program was in fact operated by [the] plaintiffs direct employer, Yale-New Haven Hospital [hospital], and by [the defendant. The] [p]laintiff s injury occurred in the course of [her] work in that residency program and at the same time arose out of and within the scope of [her] direct employment by [the] [h]ospital. [The] [h]ospital has paid, and will continue to pay, workers\u2019 compensation benefits to [the] plaintiff and, therefore, it enjoys immunity from suit by reason of ... \u00a7 31-284 (a) of the . . . [a]ct, which provides that all rights and claims between employer and employees are abolished other than the rights and claims given by the . . . [a]ct. Although [the] plaintiff was not a direct employee of [the defendant], [her] claims against [the defendant] in this action are likewise barred by ... \u00a7 31-284 (a) because at the time of [her] injury the residency program in internal medicine was, and had been for many years, a joint adventure, venture, enterprise or undertaking between [the] [h]ospital and [the defendant] in which they each had a voice and in which they combined their respective property, money, efforts, skill and knowledge in the common purpose of operating the internal medicine residency program to educate and train participants such as the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The plaintiff moved to strike the defendant\u2019s special defense on the ground that \u201cit [was] insufficient as a matter of law because: [(1) the] [plaintiff\u2019s claims against [the defendant] are not barred by reason of the exclusivity provision of ... \u00a7 31-284 (a); [(2) the defendant] is not an \u2018employer\u2019 as that term has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>defined by . . . General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (10);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [(3) the defendant] is not a joint venturer; [and (4) the plaintiff] was not employed within the scope of the operation of the residency program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The trial court noted that \u201c[t]he [defendant] has acknowledged that it was not [the plaintiffs] direct employer but claims that it is entitled to the same immunity by virtue of its having engaged in a joint venture, enterprise or undertaking with the [hjospital . . . .\u201d The trial court then found that, as a matter of law, joint ventures are not included within the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under the act; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (10); and that, in any case, not-for-profit entities cannot form a joint venture. The trial court observed that \u201c[t]he [defendant] seeks the immunity offered by the workers\u2019 compensation statutes without having undertaken any of the obligations that would entitle it to such immunity. It has alleged in its . . . [s]peciai [d]efense that the scope, or common purpose, of the operation of the residency program was to educate and train students participating in the program. [The plaintiffs] only participation in the residency program at the time of [her] injury was as a student. [She] was not, therefore, involved in the operation of the program to educate and train. [The plaintiff] was the object of the program, not its operator, and the [the defendant] was [her] teacher, not [her] employer. [The plaintiffs] only employment was by the [hjospital for the purpose of treating its patients. [Her] injury did not occur while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>performing the business of the affiliation between the [defendant] and the [h]ospital, and, the [defendant] is therefore not entitled to immunity from suit under . . . \u00a7 31-284.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\u201cA motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading. . . . [I]t admits all facts well pleaded; it does not admit legal conclusions or the truth or accuracy of opinions stated in the pleadings.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 108, 491 A.2d 368 (1985).

Even under this relatively generous standard, however, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion to strike. The defendant alleged in its special defense that the plaintiffs injury \u201carose out of and within the scope of [her] direct employment by [the] [h]ospital.\u201d It further alleged that the \u201cplaintiff was not a direct employee of [the defendant] . ...\u201d I would affirm the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion to strike because, not only did the defendant fail to allege that it was the plaintiffs employer, but it specifically alleged that it was <em>not </em>the plaintiffs \u201cdirect employer,\u201d a term not used in the act. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u00a7 31-284 (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides immunity only to employers. The allegation that the defendant was engaged in a joint venture with the plaintiffs employer is not, by itself, sufficient to confer employer status on the defendant. Neither is the defendant\u2019s allegation that the plaintiffs injury occurred during the course of her \u201cwork\u201d in the residency program, which was operated, in part, by the defendant, sufficient for such a purpose. The special defense contains no allegation that the defendant had the \u201cright to control\u201d the plaintiff, which the majority recognizes as the test for an employer-employee relationship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant did not allege any of the elements required to claim immunity under the act. Furthermore, the necessary elements of the immunity defense are not <em>necessarily implied </em>by any of the allegations in the defendant\u2019s special defense. See <em>Clohessy </em>v. <em>Bachelor, </em>237 Conn. 31, 33 n.4, 675 A.2d 852 (1996) (\u201c[w]hat is necessarily implied [in an allegation] need not be expressly alleged\u201d). Therefore, the defendant\u2019s special defense is legally insufficient and it was properly struck by the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">I am also not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s arguments at trial and during oral argument that its special defense contains a pleading in the alternative, and that the defendant\u2019s allegation that it was not the plaintiffs direct employer, therefore, should not be construed as an admission. The defendant claimed that its alternative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>pleadings were: (1) that neither the plaintiff nor Alison Heald, a third year resident who had supervised the plaintiff, was an employee or an agent of the defendant; or (2) if Heald were found to be the defendant\u2019s agent, then the plaintiff must be the defendant\u2019s employee for the purposes of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">I am not persuaded by this argument because nothing about the defendant\u2019s special defense suggests that it is a pleading in the alternative. Furthermore, pleadings in the alternative must be \u201cbased on genuine doubt . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DeJesus </em>v. <em>Craftsman Machinery Co., </em>16 Conn. App. 558, 567, 548 A.2d 736 (1988). \u201cThe pleader states the facts in the alternative because he [or she] is uncertain as to the true facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 567-68. Only \u201c[alternative factfual] allegations made in good faith and based on genuine doubt are not admissions against interest so as to be admissible in evidence against the pleader.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 567. Nowhere in its pleadings did the defendant indicate that it did not know whether the plaintiff was its employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Furthermore, at trial, Edwin C. Cadman, senior vice president of medical affairs for the hospital, professor of medicine at Yale University School of Medicine, chairman of the school\u2019s department of medicine and the person ultimately responsible for administration of the residency program when the plaintiff was accepted into it, specifically testified in response to questioning by the defendant that the plaintiff was not an employee of the defendant doing business as Yale University School of Medicine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, the defendant argued dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>ing closing arguments that the plaintiff \u201cwas an employee of [the] [h]ospital, not an employee of [the defendant]. And there is no dispute about that.\u201d Yet the defendant argues that a new trial is required so that it can attempt to prove that the plaintiff was its employee. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Moreover, I am not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that it is somehow unfair to deprive the defendant of the immunity defense on the ground that the defendant had not alleged facts implying that it was the plaintiffs employer while simultaneously allowing the plaintiff to prove an agency relationship between Heald and the defendant for purposes of establishing vicarious liability. I recognize that, in Connecticut, the \u201cright to control\u201d test historically has determined the relationship between a worker and a putative employer. I believe, however, that this court should recognize that, while it is necessary to find a \u201cright to control\u201d in order to establish an employer-employee relationship, such a finding should not always be sufficient to establish such a relationship in the context of workers\u2019 compensation claims involving issues of joint employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Transportation General, Inc., </em>245 Conn. 613, 716 A.2d 857 (1998), on which the majority relies to support its conclusion that employer status for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation claims is a question of the right to control, this court recognized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>\u201cthe right to control test, in its present form, was embedded into the act by early cases relying on similar rules in [vicarious liability] cases.\u201d Id., 617 n.5. Larsons\u2019 treatise, however, indicates that the concept of employee, for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law, may be narrower than the common-law concept of servant, which turns on the right to control. 3 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1999) p. 64-1. The treatise states that \u201c[t]he end product of a vicarious liability case [in which a master-servant relationship must be established] is not an adjustment of rights between employer and employee on the strength of their mutual arrangement, but a unilateral liability of the master to a stranger. The sole concern of the vicarious liability rule, then, is with the master: Did he or she accept and control the service that led to the stranger\u2019s injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\u201cCompensation law, however, is a mutual arrangement between the employer and employee under which both give up and gain certain things. Since the rights to be adjusted are reciprocal rights between employer and employee, it is not only logical but mandatory to resort to the agreement between them to discover their relationship. To thrust upon a worker an employee status to which he or she has never consented would not ordinarily harm him or her in a vicarious liability suit by a stranger against his employer, but it might well deprive him or her of valuable rights under the compensation act, notably the right to sue his or her own employer for common-law damages.\u201d 3 id., \u00a7 64.01, pp. 64-2 through 64-3.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, I do not believe that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>determination that there was a master-servant relationship between the defendant and Heald, based on the defendant\u2019s \u201cright to control,\u201d necessarily, or even presumptively, should be conclusive as to whether Heald was the defendant\u2019s employee. Much less should such a determination be conclusive as to whether the plaintiff was the defendant\u2019s employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The majority has concluded that the plaintiffs claim is not an educational malpractice claim. The majority, instead, has concluded, and I agree, that this claim is a simple tort claim governed by <em>Kirchner </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>150 Conn. 623, 192 A.2d 641 (1963). I also agree with the majority that the fact that this is a simple negligence claim does not necessarily mean that the plaintiff is not required to present expert testimony. For the reasons that follow, however, I do not agree with the majority that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that it may, rather than must only, consider expert testimony was harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">It is well established that, if \u201cthe determination of the standard of care requires knowledge that is beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the experience of an ordinary fact finder, expert testimony will be required.\u201d <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 226, 682 A.2d 106 (1996). In <em>Kirchner, </em>because the proper method of operating a jointer, a device used to plane wood; <em>Kirchner </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 625; was not within the knowledge or experience of the ordinary fact finder, the plaintiff presented expert testimony \u201cthat a push block rather than a push stick was the proper and reasonably safe device to use in operating the jointer.\u201d Id., 627. The plaintiff then presented factual testimony that \u201cthe plaintiff did not see, nor know of, a push block or any device other than the push stick . . . that no push block was made available for use by the plaintiff, and that there were no regulations, warnings, or instructions posted in the shop, or otherwise communicated to the plaintiff, regarding the safe and proper operation of the jointer or the dangers incident to the use of a push stick in its operation.\u201d Id. Thus, the plaintiff in <em>Kirchner </em>presented expert testimony on the method of operating a jointer, which required special knowledge, and factual testimony on whether the plaintiff was properly instructed in that method or warned of the dangers of operating the machine in any other method, which was within the knowledge of laypersons. Id. This court concluded that, on the evidence presented, \u201ca jury could well have concluded that in the exercise of reasonable care the defendants should have anticipated that unless they made a push block available and gave some warning or instruction to the plaintiff that he should use a push block rather than a push stick in the operation of the jointer, harm of the general nature of that which actually occurred was likely to result, and that the defendants\u2019 failure in each respect constituted negligence . . . .\u201d Id., 627-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In this case, following the <em>Kirchner </em>paradigm, the issue of whether the defendant breached the standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>of care can be divided into the following subissues: (1) what was the proper method for performing an arterial line insertion; and (2) did the defendant properly instruct the plaintiff in that method?</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Determination of the first subissue clearly requires the fact finder to have specialized knowledge, and the plaintiff, therefore, is required to present expert testimony on that subissue. With the exception of Heald, whose deposition testimony was admitted at trial, all of the experts who testified at trial agreed that the proper method for arterial line insertion requires removal of the needle from the operative field immediately upon withdrawing it from the catheter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Heald <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>testified at her deposition that she found the method the plaintiff used in reenacting the injury, during which she kept the needle in her left hand after withdrawing it from the catheter, to be acceptable. The defendant, however, did not adopt the position taken by Heald. Rather, during its closing arguments to the jury, the defendant argued that the plaintiff \u201cdid this procedure perfectly from beginning to end, except for one thing: she violated the most basic principle \u2014 when you take the needle out and you are through with that needle in the procedure, get rid of it. She didn\u2019t do that. And that\u2019s why she stuck herself. And both [doctors Mary M.] Cooke and ... [E. Clinton] Lawrence acknowledged that the reason she stuck herself was because she violated this basic principle: that she did not remove the needle from the field as soon as she was through using it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Thus, there clearly was no dispute between the parties as to the first subissue concerning the standard of care. Both parties adopted the expert testimony that the method of arterial line insertion that the plaintiff used was improper and that the proper method required removal of the needle from the operative field as soon as it was no longer needed. Therefore, even though I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>would find that the jury charge<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in this case was improper as to the first subissue because it implied a right of the jury to consult its own judgment and common sense rather than expert opinion, the impropriety was harmless. To conclude otherwise, this court must assume that the jury rejected the undisputed expert testimony that the technique the plaintiff used in inserting the arterial line was improper, and that the jury then came to the same conclusion relying only on its own common sense and experience. I decline to make that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">With regal\u2019d to the second subissue, namely, whether the defendant properly instructed the plaintiff in the proper method of performing an arterial line insertion so as to avoid injury, I would conclude that no specialized knowledge is required to find a breach of this duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\u201cWhile the standard of care, skill and diligence is a matter of expert opinion and knowledge, the determination of the facts concerning the conduct under consideration is always for the jury.\u201d <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>143 Conn. 290, 295, 122 A.2d 21 (1956). A plaintiffs expert witnesses need not specifically express an opinion that the defendant breached the standard of care in order for a plaintiff to prevail. See <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 229. Rather, the plaintiff need only produce \u201csufficient expert testimony to permit the jury reasonably to infer, on the basis of its findings of fact, that the defendant breached the standard of care.\u201d Id., 229-30. Breach of the standard of care may be proved \u201cthrough the testimony of the defendant.\u201d Id., 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>In this case, both the plaintiff and the defendant agreed with the expert testimony that the proper method of performing an arterial line insertion required removal of the needle from the operative field immediately upon withdrawing it from the catheter. The plaintiff also presented factual testimony that the defendant never specifically had instructed her on how to control the flow of blood from the artery after insertion of the catheter. She presented factual testimony that, while performing the procedure under Heaid\u2019s supervision, she kept the needle in her hand after withdrawing it from the catheter under the mistaken assumption that she could reinsert the needle. Furthermore, on one occasion, the plaintiff actually reinserted it. There was no testimony that Heald ever had instructed the plaintiff that her technique was improper or specifically had told her to remove the needle from the operative field immediately upon withdrawing it from the catheter. Rather, the plaintiff testified that Heald said nothing to her after observing her improper technique. In addition, Heald testified that she believed that the technique the plaintiff used during the procedure when she was injured was acceptable, and that it was acceptable to reinsert the needle into the catheter. The defendant did not dispute the factual testimony presented by the plaintiff, but argued, instead, that the plaintiff, by virtue of her prior medical school training, should have known, without further instruction, the \u201cbasic principle\u201d that all needles should be removed from the operative field immediately after use, and that her injury, therefore, was a result of her own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">In my opinion, based on this evidence, \u201can ordinary fact finder\u201d; <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 226; could reasonably infer; see id., 229; based on its own judgment and experience, that the defendant had breached the standard of care by failing to instruct and warn the plaintiff in the conduct of this dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>procedure. <em>See Kirchner v. Yale University, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 627 (university has duty to exercise reasonable care \u201cto instruct and warn students in the safe and proper operation of the machines provided for their use\u201d). In <em>Kirchner, </em>the plaintiff presented no expert testimony that the <em>method of instruction </em>the defendants used was improper, but, rather, presented factual testimony that there had been no instruction in the proper technique. See id., 627-28. The court found that, based on this evidence, a jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendants had breached their duty. Id., 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Similarly, in this case, I do not believe that the plaintiff was required to present an expert opinion that the defendant\u2019s methods of instruction were improper. Rather, I would conclude that the factual testimony that the plaintiff presented, including Heald\u2019s deposition testimony that she found the plaintiffs technique to be acceptable and the plaintiffs uncontradicted testimony that she had received no instruction that her technique was improper, together with the expert, testimony that the plaintiffs technique was improper and that first year residents must be specifically instructed to remove the needle from the operative field while performing an arterial line insertion,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was sufficient for the jury reasonably to infer that there had been no instruction in the proper technique for arterial line insertions, that the standard of care, therefore, had been breached, and that the defendant \u201cshould have anticipated . . . harm of the general nature of that which actually occurred was likely to result . . . .\u201d Id., 627-28; see also <em>Santo-pietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 229-30 (plaintiff need only produce \u201csufficient expert testimony to permit the jury reasonably to infer, on the basis of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>findings of fact, that [the defendant] breached the standard of care\u201d). Therefore, I disagree with the holding of the majority that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction that the jury <em>may </em>consider expert testimony on whether the standard of care had been breached was improper as to the second subissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Furthermore, even if the jury were required to consider only expert testimony on the issue of whether the defendant had breached the standard of care, the plaintiff presented ample, undisputed expert testimony to support the jury\u2019s verdict on that issue. Lawrence, a physician and an expert in arterial line insertion, testified that the technique the plaintiff had used under Heald\u2019s supervision was not acceptable. He testified that it would be a breach of the standard of care to instruct a first year resident to hold the needle \u201coutside and in close proximity to the catheter,\u201d and that a first year resident must be specifically trained to remove the needle from the operative field. Lawrence also testified that it would be a breach of the standard of care to order a first year resident to insert an arterial line without supervision when he or she has performed only one prior successful arterial line insertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Louise Lucianin Fisher, a physician and the director of the hospital\u2019s internal medicine residency program, testified that the technique that the plaintiff used under Heald\u2019s supervision, and without correction by Heald, was not acceptable and should not have been used at the hospital in 1988. She also testified that, if a person believed that reinsertion of the needle into the catheter was acceptable, then it would not be a violation of universal precautions; see footnote 9 of this dissenting opinion; for that person to keep the needle in the operative field after withdrawing it from the catheter, because there would be a further use for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Cooke, a physician and an expert in the training of medical residents, testified that for Heald to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>observed the plaintiff while the plaintiff kept the needle in the field and then reinserted it into the catheter, and then to have failed to correct that technique, was \u201ccompletely inadequate supervision . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Again, I find it implausible that the jury rejected all of this testimony that the defendant had failed to instruct the plaintiff in the proper technique for arterial line insertions, and then came to the same conclusion based on only its own judgment and experience. Therefore, even if the charge were improper, which I do not believe, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The majority holds that there was no expert testimony to support many of the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The general theory under which the plaintiff proceeded in this case was that the defendant failed to train, supervise and evaluate the plaintiff properly and adequately, which resulted in her serious injury. This is the same general theory that this court recognized in <em>Kirchner </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 623. I would find that each of the specific factual allegations in the plaintiffs complaint is colorable under the theory of recovery recognized by this court in <em>Kirchner. </em>I recognize that some of the plaintiffs allegations are somewhat vague. For instance, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant \u201cfailed to provide a safe work environment . . . .\u201d Based on the evidence presented, however, a reasonable jury could have found that the plaintiff failed to provide a safe work environment by failing to instruct the plaintiff in a proper and safe technique for performing arterial line insertions. In my opinion, there was sufficient evidence of each of the factual allegations in the plaintiffs complaint for the jury to have found that the defendant had breached the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Accordingly, I concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-11\"> Although General Statutes \u00a7 31-284a has been amended numerous times since the plaintiffs date of injury in 1988, those amendments are not relevant to this appeal.

In that case, the petitioner, a resident manager of an apartment complex brought a workers\u2019 compensation claim against the rental and management agent for injuries incurred during a fire. Id., 119. The trial court ruled that, because the owners of the apartment complex had retained a right of control over the petitioner\u2019s work, she was an employee of the owners, not of the rental and management agent. See generally <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Carter Realty Co., </em>518 So. 2d 117 (Ala. Civ. App. 1986). The Alabama Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[a] finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>control in one putative employer does not absolve the other putative employer of compensation liability, where there is evidence of joint or concurrent control.\u201d <em>Ex parte Stewart, </em>supra, 121.

Id. I find this approach, which focuses on the contractual intentions of the parties, to be more reasonable than the strict \u201cright to control\u201d test employed by this court. Following the approach taken by the Alabama Supreme Court in <em>Stewart </em>in this case, Cadman\u2019s testimony at trial that the plaintiffs employment agreement was exclusively with the hospital; see footnote 7 of this dissenting opinion; would strongly suggest that the plaintiff was not the defendant\u2019s employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\"> E. Clinton Lawrence, a physician who testified on behalf of the plaintiff as an expert in arterial line insertion techniques, testified that it is inherently dangerous to keep the needle in the operative field after withdrawing it from the catheter, and that that is not an acceptable method. On cross-examination, counsel for the defendant asked Lawrence: \u201cAnd would you agree . . . that it is a basic principle that applies in every one of the literally hundreds of procedures in which health care professionals use needles, it\u2019s a basic principle that when you finish using the needle in the procedure you get rid of it?\u201d Lawrence replied: \u201cThat is a basic principle, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABI\">Louise Lucianin Fisher, a physician and the director of the internal medicine residency program at the hospital, testified that residents were given 1 raining in \u201cuniversal precaul ions, \u201d which was designed to educate residents about protecting against exposure to blood-borne pathogens. Fisher testified that, pursuant to these universal precautions, it is improper to keep the needle in the operative field in order to reinsert the needle into the catheter. Fisher clarified her testimony on cross-examination, stating that universal precautions require needles to be taken out of the operative field as soon as they are no longer needed. Fisher further testified that, if aperson believed that reinsertion of the stylet into the catheter after withdrawal was proper, then the needle would still be needed, and failing to take it out of the operative field would not violate universal precautions.</p>\n<p id=\"Axu\">Mary M. Cooke, a physician who testified on behalf of the plaintiff as an expert in the training of medical residents, testified that the needle should be taken out of the operative field after withdrawing it from the catheter, as there is no use for it after that point. Cooke testified that the needle should never be reinserted because of the danger of cutting the catheter with the tip of the needle. Cooke further testified that the procedure is \u201cvery difficult,\u201d and that a new intern would not be expected to be competent at performing the procedure, even if the intern had extensive experience with other medical procedures involving the use of needles. Cooke further testi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>fled that Heald \u201cwas clearly not teaching [the procedure] properly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKKR\">The plaintiff testified that, when Heald demonstrated the procedure to her, Heald continued to hold the needle in her right hand after withdrawing it from the catheter. The plaintiff also testified that, when she performed the procedure under Heald\u2019s supervision, she reinserted the needle into the catheter after withdrawing it in an attempt to insert the catheter into the artery, and that Heald did not correct her method. The plaintiff testified further that, when she performed the procedure on another patient under Heald\u2019s supervision, she continued to hold the needle in her hand so that she could use it to reposition the catheter if required, and that Heald did not correct her. Finally, the plaintiff testified that, when she performed the procedure on the patient infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, she kept the needle in her left hand after withdrawing it from the catheter, and that she pricked her right thumb while trying to use her thumb to stem the flow of blood from the catheter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\"> The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cSince the intricacies of the operation of medical residency programs are normally outside the knowledge of most laypersons, each side has questioned witnesses who have an expertise in this area.
