We disagree with the defendant, and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Gregory Frederick, a correctional officer employed by the state department of correction and assigned to the John Manson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Youth Correctional Center, had attended a union rally at the state capitol in early May, 1997. This rally was called by the defendant in response to the Senate\u2019s recent rejection of an interest arbitration award that affected the labor contract covering correctional officers. At the rally, the defendant asked its rank and file members to contact Senate members to protest the rejection of the contract and distributed telephone lists for that purpose. While on duty at the Manson Youth Correctional Center on May 15, 1997, Frederick called approximately six legislators, including Senator Alvin W. Penn from Bridgeport. Frederick used a state owned telephone for this purpose. The telephone call to Senator Penn is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Without identifying himself, Frederick left a profane and racist message<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the Senator\u2019s voice mail.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Senator Penn reported the call to legislative security and an investigation ensued. Frederick initially denied making the call. The next day, however, he admitted to the investigator that he had made the telephone call. As a result of this action, Frederick\u2019s employment with the correction department was terminated, effective June 18, 1997. Frederick also was arrested for harassment in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-183 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He applied for accelerated rehabilitation, which was granted by the court. The court imposed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>two year period of probation and ordered Frederick to perform 300 hours of community service. General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Frederick filed a grievance concerning his dismissal through the defendant claiming that he was discharged without cause and that the discipline was too severe. The grievance was denied at the initial stages, and the defendant subsequently filed for arbitration pursuant to the applicable collective bargaining agreement. The parties joined in framing the following issue to be submitted to the arbitrator, Thomas Staley: \u201cWas the dismissal of the grievant, Gregory Frederick, for just cause? If not, what shall be the remedy consistent with the contract?\u201d As documented by the certificate of record before the- arbitrator, certified by the office of labor relations and filed with the clerk of the Superior Court on May 8, 1998, the arbitrator reviewed Department of Correction Administrative Directives, Unit Directives and General Post Orders, which were relevant to Frederick\u2019s alleged misconduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The arbitrator issued the following award: \u201cThe termination of [Frederick] effective June 18, 1997, is vacated and same is reduced to a suspension of sixty (60) working days without pay. The [plaintiff] is ordered to reinstate [Frederick] forthwith with all benefits and pay lost by [Frederick] from June 18, 1997, to the date of his reinstatement less the pay covering the sixty (60) working days suspension. Further, the back pay award is to be further decreased by any form of compensation received by [Frederick] during the time of June 18,1997, to the date of his reinstatement except for the first sixty (60) working days commencing with what would have been [Frederick\u2019s] first working day after June 18,1997. The back pay award should be paid at the rate [Frederick] would have earned during the applicable time period. The [plaintiff] shall place a copy of this arbitration award in [Frederick\u2019s] personnel file. Employment record should include a copy of this award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The plaintiff applied to the trial court to vacate the arbitration award, pursuant to both \u00a7 52-418 and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>common law. The plaintiff claimed that the arbitrator, by ordering Frederick\u2019s reinstatement on the ground that he had not been dismissed for just cause, \u201cexceeded his powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made as hereinafter set forth: (A) The award does not draw its essence from the contract. (B) The arbitrator exceeded his powers in violation of . . . \u00a7 52-418 and the common law. (C) This award violates explicit, well defined and dominant public policy referenced in both the statutory and common law of this state. (D) Enforcement of this award would violate explicit, well defined and dominant public policy referenced in both the statutory and common law of this state.\u201d The defendant cross applied to confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The trial court granted the plaintiffs application to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award and denied the defendant\u2019s cross application to confirm the award. The court concluded that \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s award violates an explicit, well-defined and dominant policy of the state warranting the termination of employees who engage in behavior such as [Frederick\u2019s], which is wholly incompatible with continued employment by the [plaintiff]. Anything less than termination is not sufficient to uphold this important policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. Thereafter, we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The defendant claims that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 53a-183 (a) establishes a public policy sufficient to justify vacating the arbitration award and that the trial court wrongfully vacated the award as violative of such public policy. In doing so, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly based its decision to vacate the arbitration award on considerations of supposed public interest, not on policy grounded in statutory law and legal precedent. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision was properly grounded in statutory law and legal precedent, and that the trial court correctly concluded that the arbitration award was violative of public policy clearly expressed in statutes and relevant administrative regulations that were properly before the arbitrator and, subsequently, the trial court. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We begin our analysis with a restatement of familiar principles reflecting this court\u2019s traditional deference to arbitral awards. \u201c \u2018We have consistently stated that arbitration is the favored means of settling differences and arbitration awards are generally upheld unless an award clearly falls within the proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418 of the General Statutes.\u2019 <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>195 Conn. 266, 270, 487 A.2d 553 (1985); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>173 Conn. 287, 290, 377 A.2d 323 (1977); <em>International Union </em>v. <em>Fafnir Bearing Co., </em>151 Conn. 650, 653, 201 A.2d 656 (1964); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Local 818, </em>5 Conn. App. 636, 639, 502 A.2d 426 (1985). \u2018A challenge of the arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to a comparison of the award to the submission.\u2019 <em>Bic Pen Corporation </em>v. <em>Local No. </em>134, 183 Conn. 579, 584, 440 A.2d 774 (1981); see also <em>American Universal Ins.

This challenge is premised on the fact that the parties cannot expect an arbitration award approving conduct which is illegal or contrary to public policy to receive judicial endorsement any more than parties can expect a court to enforce such a contract between them. . . . When a challenge to the arbitrator\u2019s authority is made on public policy grounds, however, the court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>not concerned with the correctness of the arbitrator\u2019s decision but with the lawfulness of enforcing the award. . . . Accordingly, the public policy exception to arbitral authority should be narrowly construed and [a] court\u2019s refusal to enforce an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of [collective bargaining agreements] is limited to situations where the contract as interpreted would violate some explicit public policy that is well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests. . . . The party challenging the award bears the burden of proving that illegality or conflict with public policy is clearly demonstrated. . . . Therefore, given the narrow scope of the public policy limitation on arbitral authority, the plaintiff can prevail in the present case only if it demonstrates that the board\u2019s award clearly violates an established public policy mandate.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">This court recently has held, in an issue of first impression, that the judicial review of whether an arbi-tral award implicates and violates public policy is necessarily de novo review. <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Cummings &amp; Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 416, 418, 747 A.2d 1017 (2000). \u201cWhere there is no clearly established public policy against which to measure the propriety of the arbitrator\u2019s award, there is no public policy ground for vacatur. If, on the other hand, it has been determined that an arbitral award does implicate a clearly established public policy, the ultimate question remains as to whether the award itself comports with that policy. We conclude that where a party challenges a consensual arbitral award on the ground that it violates public policy, and where that challenge has a legitimate, colorable basis, de novo review of the award is appropriate in order to determine whether the award does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>in fact violate public policy.\u201d Id., 429. Our decision in the present case stands in accordance with <em>Schoon-maker </em>and its newly articulated standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Here, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiffs application to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. The defendant claims that the trial court exceeded its authority and \u201cplaced itself in the role of the arbitrator and issued its own opinion as to whether the [plaintiff] had just cause to terminate [Frederick].\u201d The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s decision is inconsistent with this court\u2019s traditional deference to arbitral authority and that the award does not meet the public policy exception articulated in \u00a7 52-418. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the award did not violate an explicit, well-defined and dominant public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The plaintiff counters that the trial court properly vacated the award because it violated \u201cthe explicit, well-defined and dominant public policy of this state set forth in ... \u00a7 53a-183 (a).\u201d We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Here, the trial court set forth the \u201ctwo-step analysis . . . often employed [in] deciding cases such as this. First, the court determines whether an explicit, well-defined and dominant public policy can be identified. If so, the court then decides if the arbitrator\u2019s award violated the public policy.\u201d The trial court determined that Frederick\u2019s act of placing an anonymous, obscene and racist telephone call while on duty in a state correction facility, from a state owned telephone, was a violation of explicit public policy. This public policy is articulated in both \u00a7 53a-183, the offense for which Frederick was given accelerated rehabilitation, and the relevant regulations of the department of correction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>We agree with the trial court that an explicit, well-defined and dominant public policy is identified here, wherein a state employee, while on duty, utilized a state owned telephone to place an anonymous, obscene and racist call. Accordingly, the first prong of the required inquiry is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The trial court then proceeded to the second prong of the analysis: whether the arbitrator\u2019s award violated this clear public policy. The court noted that the arbitrator attempted to excuse Frederick\u2019s conduct \u201cas the outgrowth of various personal stressors,\u201d but did \u201c[find] that he did, in fact, leave the stipulated message for the legislator.\u201d Accordingly, the arbitrator justified reinstating Frederick despite his conduct, which violated both statute and department regulations. We agree with the trial court that, in doing so, the arbitrator \u201cminimize [d] society\u2019s overriding interest in preventing conduct such as that at issue in this case from occurring.\u201d Thus, the award \u2014 with its inherent rationalization of conduct stipulated to by Frederick, which was violative of statute and regulations \u2014 is in itself violative of clear public policy. As the trial court aptly stated, the termination of Frederick as provided for in the department of correction regulations is \u201cwarranted .... A lesser sanction \u2014 a progressive sanction, as suggested by the arbitrator \u2014 would, very simply, send the message that stress, or poor judgment, or other factors, somehow renders the conduct permissible or excusable.\u201d We need not accept the trial court\u2019s statement that \u201c[anything less than termination is not sufficient to uphold this important policy\u201d as a generic endorsement of termination in all such cases. We do not hold that the violation of a criminal statute is a per se public policy violation sufficient to justify vacating an arbitrator\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>decision. Instead, we conclude that this case poses a narrow, blatant example of the department of correction\u2019s proper exercise of its power to dismiss. Although the conduct demonstrated by Frederick is particularly offensive to an enlightened society, our decision here is dictated not by personal standards of decency, but by proper legal precedent that does provide, in this case, the just outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that this case rests squarely within the narrow exception carved out of the broad authority granted to arbitrators. Here, the trial court properly concluded that an arbitration award violated a clearly defined public policy because the award reinstated a state employee whose conduct blatantly violated both a criminal statute and the employment regulations set forth by the department of correction. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court correctly vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, KATZ and CALLAHAN, Js., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b500-8\">PETERS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"aad-dedup-0\">concurring in the result. I concur in the result. Whatever is the proper test for setting aside an arbitration award on public policy grounds, I agree with the outcome in this case. Under any standard, the facts found by the arbitrator in this case establish that the plaintiff, the state of Connecticut, was justified in discharging the employee who was the subject of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Before the arbitrator, the defendant, the employee\u2019s union, conceded that, precisely as charged, the employee had left the stipulated message for the legislator. The arbitrator agreed with the state that leaving the message was unjustified. The arbitrator concluded, nonetheless, that he would reduce the sanction against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the employee from discharge to suspension. That conclusion was premised on a letter of apology written by the employee and a finding, by the arbitrator, of mitigating circumstances arising out of the employee\u2019s personal and family circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">I agree that this court is not bound by arbitral finding of mitigating circumstances in light of the egregious nature of the employee\u2019s conduct. It is hard to imagine a more repugnant message than that left by the employee. The fact that this egregious misconduct concededly occurred while the employee was on the job distinguishes it from other cases of employee misconduct in which courts have upheld arbitral awards that reduced sanctions against employees from discharge to suspension. See, e.g., <em>United Paperworkers International Union, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 108 S. Ct. 364, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1987); <em>Bureau of Special Investigations </em>v. <em>Coalition of Public Safety, </em>430 Mass. 601, 722 N.E.2d 441 (2000); <em>New York State Correctional Officers &amp; Police Benevolent Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>New York, </em>94 N.Y.2d 321, 726 N.E.2d 462, 704 N.Y.S.2d 910 (1999) (all involving employee misconduct outside of work).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides . . . shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects: (1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-417 provides in relevant part: \u201cAt any time within one year after an award has been rendered and the parties to arbitration notified thereof, any party to the arbitration may make application to the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides . . . for an order confirming the award.
