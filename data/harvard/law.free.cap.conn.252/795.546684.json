The defendant, Ronald Albert, appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming his conviction by the trial court, rendered after a jury trial, of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we hold that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court correctly had instructed the jury, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion sets forth the following facts that the juiy reasonably could have found. \u201cOn August 2,1992, the defendant attended a picnic at Globe Hollow Pond in Manchester with the victim, N, age three, her mother, her father and her brother. [The victim] referred to the defendant, her godfather, as Uncle Ronnie. [The victim] testified that while she and the defendant were swimming, the defendant put his hand underneath [the victim\u2019s] bathing suit and touched her \u2018inside\u2019 her \u2018crotch\u2019 with his index finger. The touching caused pain and [the victim] screamed. After [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>victim] screamed, the defendant told her not to tell anyone about the touching. When [the victim] started crying, her father took her out of the water and brought her to her mother. While she was crying, [the victim] said \u2018bad Uncle Ronnie\u2019 several times. Physical examinations by physicians shortly thereafter revealed two scrapes on the inside fold of [one of] the labia majora<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that were typical of recent sexual abuse. \u201d <em>State </em>v. Albert, 50 Conn. App. 715, 718, 719 A.2d 1183 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The following additional facts and procedural history are necessary to our disposition of this appeal. During cross-examination, defense counsel asked the victim\u2019s psychologist, Kevin R. Conter: \u201cDid [the victim] indicate to you if she had any reaction to the touch at the time the touch was allegedly made?\u201d Conter answered: \u201c[The victim] said that it hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The victim\u2019s pediatrician, Wanda Merced, testified that she treated the victim on August 4, 1992, two days after the incident in question. Merced testified that, in taking the victim\u2019s medical history, the victim had told Merced, in the presence of the victim\u2019s mother, that the defendant had touched her \u201cprivate part.\u201d Merced testified that she observed two small scrapes on the victim\u2019s labia majora and that the labia majora constituted \u201cthe outside of the vagina.\u201d Merced farther testified that the scrapes were \u201c[a]t the entrance of the vagina,\u201d and that they \u201clooked fresh\u201d because \u201cthey bled . . . when [she] touched them\u201d with a cotton swab. Merced testified that she had marked, on a diagram of the anatomy of the genital area of a female, the location on the victim\u2019s labia majora where she had observed the two scrapes. Merced further testified that, if the genital area, as shown in the diagram, were the face of a clock, the scrapes would be located between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>5:30 and 6 o\u2019clock. Finally, Merced testified that, when she asked the victim during the August 4,1992 examination how she got the scrapes, the victim answered that the defendant had touched her \u201cprivate part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Frederick B. Berrien, a physician who was qualified as an expert in the field of pediatrics, provided testimony in two areas of relevance to this case. First, Berrien provided expert testimony with regard to the physical structure of the female genital area, genital opening and vagina. To illustrate his testimony, Berrien used the diagram that Merced had used during her testimony. He drew a circle around the area on the diagram that he considered to be the genital area of a female and testified that the labia majora constituted the outermost border of that area. He testified that the labia majora are part of the female genital area and consist of folds of skin that \u201cclose over the opening to the vagina,\u201d but that the labia majora are not part of the vagina itself. Berrien also testified that, although the labia majora are not part of the genital opening,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the space between the labia was the beginning of the genital opening.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, Berrien testified that, in order to consummate vaginal intercourse, penetration had to be made through all of the labia structures.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Second, Berrien testified regarding the location <em>of </em>the scrapes on the victim that Merced had observed upon examination of the victim. He testified that the scrapes that Merced had noted were in the area of the victim\u2019s \u201cposterior fourchette,\u201d which he defined as the \u201cposterior position of . . . the labia majora.\u201d He testified that, if one were to visualize the genital area as the face of a clock, the scrapes \u201cwere located at about 5:30\u201d and that \u201cinjuries in that area are . . . typically involved with sexual abuse.\u201d He further testified that, based on his review of the diagram on which Merced had pointed out the location of the two scrapes, the victim\u2019s injuries appeared to be on the inside of the fold of the labium majora. He stated that the history given by the victim and the scrapes observed by Merced were consistent with a finger going through the victim\u2019s genital opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Subsequent to Berrien\u2019s testimony, the trial court permitted the state to amend its information. The first count of the original information alleged that the defendant had committed sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) by \u201cpenetrating] <em>the vagina </em>of a three . . . year old girl with his finger or fingers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The second count of the original information alleged that the defendant had committed risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 by <em>\u201cvaginally penetrating </em>[the victim] with his finger or fingers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The state amended the first count of the information to allege that the defendant had committed sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2) by \u201cpenetrat[ing] <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number><em>labia majora </em>of the genitalia of a three . . . year old girl with his finger or fingers,\u201d and the second count to allege that the defendant had committed risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 by \u201cpenetrating] <em>the labia majora </em>of the genitalia of a three . . . year old child with his finger or fingers.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">After a jury trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts of the information. Subsequently, the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the juiy\u2019s verdict and imposed a total effective sentence of fifteen years imprisonment, execution suspended after four years, and five years probation. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment on both counts. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 717. This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the meaning of the term sexual intercourse, as defined in General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state claims that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>properly instructed the jury on the meaning of this term. As both parties recognize, in order to determine whether the trial court correctly instructed the jury, we first must interpret the statute defining the term sexual intercourse, namely, \u00a7 53a-65 (2). The defendant argues that a \u201ctouching\u201d of the labia majora cannot support a finding that sexual intercourse occurred by way of digital penetration of the genital opening. Rather, the defendant argues that, under the facts of this case, in order to penetrate the genital opening, there must be evidence \u201cthat the defendant put his finger beyond the labia majora . . . .\u201d Finally, the defendant argues that \u201cthere was no evidence presented that the defendant did anything other than touch the surface of [the victim\u2019s] labia majora.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The state argues that digital penetration of the labia majora constitutes penetration of the genital opening and, therefore, is sexual intercourse within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-65 (2). The state also argues that the evidence supported the conclusion that there was penetration of the victim\u2019s labia majora, and refutes \u201cany . . . claim [by the defendant] that the touching was a mere contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>with the exterior surface of the labia.\u201d We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">\u201cStatutory inteipretation is a matter of law over which this court\u2019s review is plenary. ... In construing statutes, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Ins. Co., </em>252 Conn. 79, 84, 743 A.2d 146 (1999). \u201c[A]lthough we recognize the fundamental principle that [penal] statutes are to be construed strictly, it is equally fundamental that the rule of strict construction does not require an interpretation which frustrates an evident legislative intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 330, 692 A.2d 713 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">We begin with the plain language of the statute. General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Sexual intercourse\u2019means vaginal intercourse . . . between persons regardless of sex. <em>Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse . . . </em>and does not require emission of semen. <em>Penetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the genital . . . opening of the victim\u2019s body. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We consider the two italicized portions of the definition of sexual intercourse particularly relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">First, we consider the statute\u2019s provision that \u201c[penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>\u00a7 53a-65 (2). Although the plain language of the statute does not specify <em>what </em>must be penetrated,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the legislature, in using the phrase \u201c[p]enetration, however slight,\u201d evinced an intent to incorporate, into our statutory law, the common-law least penetration doctrine. As the Appellate Court correctly noted: \u201cWe first encounter the notion that the least penetration is sufficient to complete the crime of rape in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>45 Conn. 256 (1877).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> [In that case] [t]he defendant requested that the trial court charge the jury that to constitute rape actual penetration of the <em>body </em>of the woman by the insertion into her of the private parts of the accused is absolutely necessary. Id., 259. After charging as requested, the court added, but the least penetration is sufficient .... Id. Our Supreme Court affirmed the charge as correct. Id., 263.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The defendant argues that, in order to satisfy the element of penetration in \u00a7\u00a7 53a-65 (2) and 53a-70 (a) (2), there must be evidence of penetration \u201cthrough the labia structures, to the outer vagina,\u201d or, at least, penetration \u201cbeyond the labia majora to at least the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>labia minora . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Neither <em>Shields, </em>its common-law progeny; see footnote 12 of this opinion; nor any case that the defendant has cited to in any jurisdiction, suggests that penetration \u201cthrough the labia structures, to the outer vagina\u201d or penetration \u201cbeyond the labia majora to at least the labia minora\u201d is required to complete vaginal intercourse under the least penetration doctrine.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">On the contrary, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>supra, 45 Conn. 256, we upheld a jury charge that referred to \u201cpenetration of the <em>body\u201d] </em>(emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted) id., 259; and stated that \u201cthe least penetration is sufficient [to commit rape].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We conclude that the public policy underlying our holding in <em>Shields, </em>namely, that the least penetration of the <em>body </em>is sufficient to commit rape, was to protect victims from unwanted intrusions into the interior of their bodies. The legislature endorsed this public policy through its codification of the phrase \u201c[p]enetration, however slight\u201d in \u00a7 53a-65 (2). Therefore, because penetration of the labia majora constitutes penetration of the body, we agree with the Appellate Court that \u201c[t]he \u2018penetration, however slight\u2019 language of the statute is a common-law carryover that was designed to eliminate precisely the kind of claim that is made here. The common-law construction of rape was designed to punish the fact, not the degree, of penetration.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>724. We conclude that the phrase \u201c[p]enetration, however slight\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2); was intended to cover penetration of the labia majora.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">We also note that other jurisdictions likewise have concluded, on the basis of the least penetration doctrine, that penetration of the labia majora is sufficient to establish the element of penetration. See, e.g., <em>Craig </em>v. <em>State, </em>214 Md. 546, 547, 136 A.2d 243 (1957) (penetration of labia majora sufficient to prove rape); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wisdom, </em>122 Or. 148, 161, 257 P. 826 (1927) (because any penetration of labia sufficient to prove rape, trial court need not charge jury that penetration must reach \u201cinto the labia of the female organ having mucous membrane\u201d). See generally annot., 76 A.L.R.3d 163, 178-83 (1977) (reviewing numerous cases in which courts have held that penetration of labia is sufficient penetration to constitute rape).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The next sentence of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[p]enetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the <em>genital . . . opening </em>of the victim\u2019s body\u201d; (emphasis added); further strengthens our conclusion that penetration of the labia majora is sufficient to constitute sexual intercourse. We begin by noting that this sentence includes digital penetration as a species of penetration that constitutes vaginal intercourse under \u00a7 53a-65 (2). See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hermann, </em>38 Conn. App. 56, 60, 658 A.2d 148, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 903, 665 A.2d 904 (1995). Therefore, because \u201c[p]enetration, however slight\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2); is sufficient to constitute vaginal intercourse, the text of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2) providing that \u201c[p]enetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the <em>genital </em>. . . <em>opening </em>of the victim\u2019s body\u201d; (emphasis added); means that digital penetration, however slight, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>of the <em>genital opening, </em>is sufficient to constitute vaginal intercourse.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">We must then determine what the legislature intended by its use of the term \u201cgenital . . . opening.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2). We begin by noting that, although the statute does not expressly define the term genital opening, our \u201cconstruction must accord with common sense and commonly approved usage of the language.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>248 Conn. 543, 550, 729 A.2d 760, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S. Ct. 406, 145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999). We also note that, when \u201ca statute or regulation does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 771, 695 A.2d 525 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Under common usage of the language, the term genital opening means an opening associated with the genitals.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The word \u201cgenitals\u201d means \u201cgenitalia\u201d; Webster\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Third New International Dictionary; which means \u201cthe organs of the reproductive system; <em>esp[ecially]: the external genital organs.\u201d </em>(Emphasis altered.) Id. Similarly, Taber\u2019s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary defines genitals and genitalia as \u201c[o]rgans of generation; reproductive organs,\u201d and states that the female \u201cexternal genitalia collectively are termed the vulva or pudendum and include the . . . <em>labia </em>majora\u201d and that the internal genitalia are \u201cthe two ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and <em>vagina.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Taber\u2019s Cyclo-pedic Medical Dictionary (16th Ed. 1989). Thus, as the term \u201cgenitals\u201d refers especially to the external genital organs, which include the labia majora, it would be unreasonable to conclude that when the legislature used the term genital opening, it meant to exclude the external genital organs and refer only to the internal genital organs such as the vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">\u201cOpening\u201d is defined in common usage as \u201csomething that is open . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. \u201cOpen,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201cspread out: <em>unfolded: </em>having the parts or surfaces laid back in an expanded position: not drawn together, folded, or contracted . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. We previously noted that the labia majora are defined as \u201cthe outer fatty <em>folds </em>bounding the vulva.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.; see footnote 5 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">From these definitions, it can be deduced that: (1) the term \u201cgenitals\u201d commonly refers to the external reproductive organs, which include, on a female, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>labia majora; (2) the term \u201copening\u201d means something that is unfolded or spread out; and (3) the labia majora are folds. Thus, we conclude that the opening between the folds, i.e., labia majora, is the genital opening and that the labia majora form the boundaries of the genital opening.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, because we have construed the term vaginal intercourse, as that term is used in \u00a7 53a-65 (2), to include digital penetration, however slight, of the <em>genital </em>opening; see text accompanying footnote 15 of this opinion; we conclude that digital penetration, however slight, of the <em>labia majora </em>is sufficient penetration to constitute vaginal intercourse under \u00a7 53a-65 (2).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The legislative history of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) provides further support for our conclusion. That history dates back to 1969, when \u201cthe legislature revised the penal code in accordance with recommendations by the commission to revise the criminal statutes (commission).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Desimone, </em>241 Conn. 439, 456, 696 A.2d 1235 (1997). Public Acts 1969, No. 828, \u00a7 66 (P.A. 828), codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-65, statutorily defined, for the first time, the term sexual intercourse for purposes of our state\u2019s sexual assault statutes. Public Act 828 provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Sexual intercourse\u2019 has its ordinary meaning and occurs upon any penetration, however slight. . . .\u201d In discussing House Bill 7182, the bill that eventually was enacted as P.A. 828, Senator John F. Pickett stated that the bill statutorily \u201cdefines with modem language crime ... so that, we no longer, as we at present must rely, simply on the common law, for definitions of our crimes.\u201d 13 S. Proc., Pt. 7,1969 Sess., p. 3542. Thus, as we stated previously, because this court had held that the least penetration is sufficient to commit rape under the common law; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>supra, 45 Conn. 263; the legislature, in using the phrase \u201c[p]enetration, however slight,\u201d evinced an intent to codify the common-law least penetration doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">In addition, in its commentary on \u00a7 53a-65, the commission stated: \u201cThese definitions are taken largely from the New York Revised Penal Law.\u201d Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Connecticut Penal Code Comments (1969) p. 25. Indeed, the relevant portion of the definition of sexual intercourse in P.A. 828 tracks the New York counterpart exactly. See N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.00 (1) (McKinney 1967). The definition found in N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.00 (1), in turn, originally derived from \u00a7 280 of the New York Penal Code of 1881. Therefore, because our statute was modeled after the New York statute, we find the interpretation of the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>\u201cpenetration, however slight\u201d by the New York Court of Appeals to be particularly persuasive in construing the equivalent language in \u00a7 53a-65. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Havi-can, </em>213 Conn. 593, 601, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990) (recognizing that, because \u201c \u2018[t]he drafters of the [Connecticut penal] code relied heavily upon . . . the penal code of New York,\u2019 \u201d it is appropriate to look to New York statutory and case law for guidance in interpreting Connecticut Penal Code).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Our conclusion that the \u201ccommon-law construction of rape was designed to punish the fact, not the degree, of penetration\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 724; is supported by the construction of the phrase \u201cpenetration, however slight\u201d in <em>People </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>102 N.Y. 234, 6 N.E. 384 (1886). In <em>Crowley, </em>the New York Court of Appeals concluded that the phrase \u201cmeans nothing more than penetration of the private parts of the man into the person of the woman, and <em>no discussion is necessary or proper as to how jar they entered.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Public Acts 1975, No. 75-619, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 75-619), amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 53a-65 by providing in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Sexual intercourse\u2019 means vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse or fellatio and does not require emission of semen. Penetration may be committed by an object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal opening of the victim\u2019s body. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, through P.A. 75-619, \u00a7 1, the legislature: (1) amended the definition of sexual intercourse to include anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus, all of which previously had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>been statutorily defined as forms of \u201c[d]eviate sexual intercourse\u201d; General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-65 (2);<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (2) maintained the codification of the common-law least penetration doctrine; and (3) provided that the element of penetration could be established by proving that a defendant manipulated an object into the victim\u2019s genital opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The legislative history of Senate Bill 1519, the bill that eventually was enacted as P.A. 75-619, clearly indicates \u201cthat the purpose of changing the definition of sexual intercourse from \u2018having its ordinary meaning\u2019 was to include \u2018anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus,\u2019 none of which had been encompassed under the expression \u2018ordinary meaning\u2019 of sexual intercourse. See 18 S. Proc., Pt. 7, 1975 Sess., pp. 3214-27.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sieving, </em>35 Conn. App. 173, 181-82, 644 A.2d 958, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 914, 648 A.2d 158 (1994). The term \u201cvaginal\u201d was inserted into the statute to distinguish what previously had been considered \u201cordinary\u201d intercourse; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-65 (1); from anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus. As the defendant recognizes, the addition of the term \u201cvaginal\u201d to the definition of sexual intercourse in \u00a7 53a-65 did not change the meaning of that definition as it pertained to vaginal intercourse. Therefore, in adding the term \u201cvaginal\u201d to the definition of sexual intercourse, the legislature did not intend to create a requirement of penetration of the vagina in order for the defendant\u2019s conduct to constitute sexual intercourse. This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the legislature maintained the phrase \u201c[pjenetration, however slight\u201d in the amended definition of sexual intercourse, and, as we have concluded previously, slight penetration does not require vaginal penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>With regard to the second relevant sentence in \u00a7 53a-65 (2), which includes, inter alia, digital penetration of the genital opening within the definition of sexual intercourse, there is nothing in the legislative history to support the defendant\u2019s argument that the legislature, in using the term genital opening, intended the statute to require that penetration occur \u201cbeyond the labia majora to at least the labia minora . . . .\u201d Finally, we also note that our construction of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-65 (2) and 53a-70 (a) (2), unlike that of the defendant, furthers one of the statute\u2019s principal objectives, namely, \u201cto protect children from being sexually violated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hermann, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Although we have rejected most of the defendant\u2019s arguments in the preceding analysis, we wish to address briefly the defendant\u2019s claim that a mere touching of the surface of the labia majora is not sufficient to constitute penetration under \u00a7 \u00a7 53a-65 (2) and 53a-70 (a) (2). As we previously indicated, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s suggestion that a defendant must put his finger or fingers \u201cbeyond the labia majora\u201d for his conduct to fall within the definition of sexual intercourse in \u00a7 53a-65 (2). Even if we assume that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) is correct, however, there was evidence presented in this case from which a reasonable jury could have concluded that the defendant put his finger beyond the victim\u2019s labia majora. For example, the victim testified that the defendant touched \u201c[ijnside\u201d her crotch. In addition, Conter testified that the victim had indicated to him that the touching hurt her, Merced testified that the scrapes on the victim\u2019s labia majora bled when she examined the victim two days after the incident and Berrien testified that the history the victim had given and the scrapes observed by Merced were consistent with a finger penetrating the victim\u2019s genital opening. Therefore, we reject the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>defendant\u2019s claim that \u201cthere was no evidence presented that the defendant did anything other than touch the surface of [the victim\u2019s] labia majora.\u201d On the contrary, a reasonable jury could have inferred, based on the foregoing evidence, that the defendant\u2019s finger entered the victim with some force and passed beyond the actual location of the scrapes on the victim\u2019s labia majora.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Having construed the applicable definition of sexual intercourse in \u00a7 53a-65 (2), we now review the defendant\u2019s challenge to the following portion of the jury instructions. The trial court instructed the jury in relevant part: \u201cNow, for purposes of this case, sexual intercourse means penetration into the genital opening .... The evidence presented by [Merced] and [Ber-rien] was that two scrapes were found on the labia majora of the victim\u2019s genital opening. These scrapes and their locations are designated on [the diagram that Merced and Berrien used during their testimony], which you will have during your deliberations. You may consider the labia majora as an anatomical part of a woman\u2019s genital opening. . . . Now, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was under thirteen years of age and that the defendant digitally penetrated the victim\u2019s genital opening, then you will find the defendant guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The defendant argues that the portion of the jury instruction stating that the labia majora are part of the genital opening and that the scrapes found on the victim\u2019s labia majora constituted evidence of \u201cpenetration\u201d was improper and harmful because it provided an incorrect definition of an essential element of the crime of first degree sexual assault. The defendant further claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the jury instructions were correct because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the instructions obliterate the distinction between sexual intercourse, which is defined in \u00a7 53a-65 (2), and sexual contact, which is defined in \u00a7 53a-65 (3).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Whereas sexual intercourse is a necessary element of first degree sexual assault; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-70; footnote 2 of this opinion; sexual contact is a necessary element of fourth degree sexual assault; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a; and in some prosecutions for third degree sexual assault. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">The state argues, to the contrary, that that portion of the trial court\u2019s instructions with which the defendant takes issue was factually and legally correct and could not have misled the jury. The state also argues that the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion with respect to the propriety of that portion of the instructions does not eliminate the distinction between sexual intercourse and sexual contact. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">\u201cOur analysis begins with a well established standard of review. When reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction . . . we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>instructions] axe correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 484-85, 668 A.2d 682 (1995). [I]n appeals involving a constitutional question, [the standard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 170-71, 665 A.2d 63 (1995). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>247 Conn. 616, 625, 725 A.2d 306 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">\u201cIn determining whether it was . ; . reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding [it] to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied ... is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>251 Conn. 671, 713-14, 741 A.2d 913 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s argument that it was improper for the trial court to have instructed the jury that it \u201cmay consider the labia majora as an anatomical part of a woman\u2019s genital opening.\u201d The defendant argues that this instruction was improper because the labia majora are not part of the genital opening. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">We concluded in part I of this opinion that the opening between the labia majora is the genital opening, as that term is used in \u00a7 53a-65 (2), and that the labia majora form the boundaries of the genital opening. The boundaries of an opening commonly are thought of as part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>of the opening. For example, a doorjamb defines the boundaries of a door opening, and a jamb is \u201can upright piece or surface forming the side of an opening . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. A side of an opening is, obviously, part of the opening. We also note that appellate courts in other jurisdictions commonly have referred to the labia as an opening that can be entered. See, e.g., <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>171 F.2d 1022, 1023 (D.C. Cir. 1948) (\u201c[t]he crime of rape is committed if [the male organ] enters only the labia of the female organ\u201d); <em>Short </em>v. <em>State, </em>564 N.E.2d 553, 559 (Ind. App. 1991) (any \u201centering of the . . . labia\u201d is sufficient to complete sexual intercourse).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Therefore, it was not improper for the trial court to have referred to the labia majora as part of the genital opening. Although it technically might have been more correct for the trial court to have stated that <em>the space </em>between the labia majora is the genital opening, rather than stating that the labia majora constitute part of the genital opening; see footnote 10 of this opinion; \u201cthe charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 714. Thus, we conclude that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions that the labia majora are part of the genital opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s argument that it was improper for the trial court to have instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he evidence presented by [Merced] and [Berrien] was that two scrapes were found on the labia majora of the victim\u2019s genital opening. . . . Now, if you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>find beyond a reasonable doubt that . . . the defendant digitally penetrated the victim\u2019s genital opening, then you will find the defendant guilty.\u201d The defendant argues that this part of the instruction was improper because: (1) the labia majora are not part of the genital opening; and (2) the jury may have understood the trial court\u2019s instructions on the element of penetration to mean that it was to decide whether the defendant pierced the victim\u2019s skin, rather than determining whether the defendant penetrated the victim by placing his finger in the victim\u2019s genital opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The defendant\u2019s first argument fails because we have concluded previously that it was not improper for the trial court to have instructed the jury that the labia majora are part of the genital opening. His second argument fails because it is obvious from the trial court\u2019s instructions that the jury was instructed to consider whether the defendant had put his finger through the victim\u2019s genital opening. See footnote 10 of this opinion. For example, the trial court instructed the jury: \u201cOur law . . . provides that penetration may be committed digitally, that is, by the finger or fingers into the genital opening of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d In contrast, there is nothing in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions that would have caused a reasonable juror to conclude that, in order to determine whether penetration occurred, he or she must determine whether the defendant had punctured the victim\u2019s skin and tissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Finally, we consider the defendant\u2019s argument that the jury instructions eliminate the distinction between sexual intercourse, as defined in \u00a7 53a-65 (2); see footnote 1 of this opinion; and sexual contact, as defined in \u00a7 53a-65 (3). See footnote 21 of this opinion. The defendant argues that, \u201c[i]f the trial court\u2019s instructions are deemed correct, there would never be a contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>with the \u2018genital area\u2019<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> of a female that did not also constitute . . . penetration of the \u2018genital opening.\u2019 \u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">We begin by noting that sexual intercourse, as defined in \u00a7 53a-65 (2), requires <em>penetration </em>whereas sexual contact, as defined in \u00a7 53a-65 (3), requires mere <em>contact. </em>The trial court instructed the jury, \u201cif you find beyond a reasonable doubt. . . that the defendant digitally <em>penetrated </em>the victim\u2019s genital opening, then you will find the defendant guilty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Footnote 10 of this opinion. Thus, the trial court properly instructed the jury that it was to convict the defendant only if it found that the defendant had <em>penetrated </em>the victim\u2019s genital opening. Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s claim that \u201cthere was no evidence presented that the defendant did anything other than touch the surface of [the victim\u2019s] labia majora,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the jury based its verdict on a finding of penetration of the genital opening, not mere contact with the genital area. Compare General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2) with General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (8). Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the trial court correctly had instructed the jury in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-13\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2) provides: \u201c \u2018Sexual intercourse\u2019 means vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, fellatio or cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse or fellatio and does not require emission of semen.

In so concluding, we avoid the bizarre result that would occur were we to treat digital penetration differently than all other forms of penetration by necessitating mere penetration of the <em>genital opening </em>in cases involving digital penetration, but requiring slight penetration of the <em>vagina </em>in cases involving all other forms of penetration. \u201cWe decline to interpret the statute so as to lead to this bizarre and unintended result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>251 Conn. 617, 631-32, 741 A.2d 902 (1999). In contrast, as the Appellate Court noted in this case, the interpretation offered above harmonizes the doctrine of least penetration with the statute\u2019s prohibition against the manipulation of an object into a victim\u2019s genital opening. <em>See State v. Albert, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 724. \u201c[I]n ascertaining [legislative] intent, we deem the legislature to have intended to harmonize its enactment with existing common law and statutory requirements . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Allied Van Lines, Inc., </em>246 Conn. 170, 179, 717 A.2d 195 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\"> Although there is evidence in the record to suggest that the trial court may have considered the phrase \u201cgenital or anal <em>opening\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added) General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2); to mean genital <em>area </em>and anal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>opening when it allowed the state to amend its information during the trial, the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the state to amend the information was proper in light of our conclusion that penetration of the labia majora is sufficient to constitute sexual intercourse, as that term is defined in \u00a7 53a-65 (2). Furthermore, the trial court correctly instructed the jury that digital penetration could be accomplished by penetration of the genital <em>opening. </em>See part II and footnote 10 of this opinion. The court never instructed the jury that penetration of the genital <em>area </em>would be sufficient to complete the element of penetration required for prosecution under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b831-6\"> We also note that the medical definition of labia majora provides further support for our conclusion. Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary defines labia as the \u201cplural of labium\u201d and defines labium \u201cmajus\u201d or majora as \u201cone of two rounded folds of integument forming the lateral boundaries of the pudendal cleft.\u201d Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary (26th Ed. 1995). \u201cPudendal\u201d means \u201c[Relating to the external <em>genitals\"-, </em>(emphasis added) id.; and \u201cpudendal cleft\u201d is defined as \u201cthe cleft between the labia majora.\u201d Id. Cleft is defined as a \u201cfissure.\u201d Id. Thus, it is clear that the labia majora form the boundaries of a fissure, or opening, associated with the female genitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">In addition, the expert testimony given by Berrien supports this interpretation. Berrien was asked: \u201cIs the space between the labia the beginning of the genital opening?\u201d He responded: \u201cYes, it is.\u201d Footnote 7 of this opinion. Although Berrien testified that the labia majora are \u201cnot part of the [genital] opening\u201d; footnote 6 of this opinion; it appears from his testimony that he simply meant that the labia majora formed the boundaries of the genital opening and the space between the labia is the genital opening. See footnotes 6 and 7 of this opinion. In addition, although Berrien answered yes to the court\u2019s question whether \u201cpenetration ha[s] to be made through all of these labia structures [to effectuate vaginal intercourse]\u201d; footnote 8 of this opinion; it is unclear from the transcript whether, by reference to \u201call of these labia structures,\u201d Berrien understood the court to be asking about both the labia majora and the labia minora, or simply both of the labium majora.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b831-8\"> Our conclusion that penetration of the labia majora is sufficient penetration to constitute sexual intercourse is bolstered by the fact that the legislature, in defining the term sexual intercourse, as that term applies to digital penetration, did not use the phrase \u201cpenetration to the <em>outer vagina,\u201d </em>which the defendant argues is necessary to constitute sexual intercourse. Rather, the legislature utilized amore inclusive phrase, specifying that mere \u201c[p]enetration . . . [of] the <em>genital . . . opening\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added) General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-65 (2); is sufficient to constitute sexual intercourse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\"> This definition of sexual intercourse is identical to the definition of sexual intercourse applicable in this case.

Times, February 20, 2000, \u00a7 6 (Magazine), p. 36 (quoting Irwin Goldstein, urologist, as stating that \u201c[t]he man needs a sufficient axial rigidity so his penis can <em>penetrate through labia\" </em>[emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\"> See footnote 21 of this opinion for the relevant text of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b841-10\"> We note that we rejected this characterization of the evidence in part I of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
