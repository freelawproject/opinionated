On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court, in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, improperly concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s action was barred by the three year statute of repose contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-584.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike her claim that the defendant had committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). See General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">We conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the statute of repose in \u00a7 52-584 was tolled by the continuing course of conduct doctrine; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>see, e.g., <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>229 Conn. 256, 275-77, 640 A.2d 74 (1994); based on the defendant\u2019s continuing wrongful conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We conclude, however, that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs CUTPA claim and, accordingly, affirm that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment striking the plaintiffs claim under CUTPA. Because we reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, we do not decide the other issues pertaining to the granting of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment that the plaintiff raises in her appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The record reveals the following pertinent facts and procedural history. On March 2, 1985, the Food and Drug Administration approved the enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay test (ELISA test) for the purpose of screening units of blood for antibodies associated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>with the human immunodeficiency viras (HIV). Ramon Kranwinkel, a pathologist and hematologist, who, at all relevant times, was the director of the blood bank at the hospital, testified in a deposition that he had learned of the Food and Drag Administration\u2019s ratification of the ELISA test \u201csometime in 1985, earlier that year, probably around February, but [was] not sure of the exact date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">On April 18, 1985, Dennis Ogelia, the plaintiffs treating physician, admitted the plaintiff to the hospital for the treatment of congenital scoliosis. The next day, April 19,1985, the plaintiff underwent a posterior spinal fusion during which she received four units of blood. The blood was provided to the hospital by the American Red Cross (Red Cross), and had an expiration date of April 22, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The plaintiff, in an uncontroverted affidavit, swore that, prior to her surgery: (1) she \u201cdid not know of the risk of contracting HIV from a blood transfusion and [that] the [defendant did not inform [her] of [that] risk\u201d; (2) she \u201cdid not know that [she] had the option [of banking her] own blood for the surgery and [that] the [defendant did not tell [her] of [that] option\u201d; (3) she \u201cwas not aware that there was a test to detect the presence of . . . IIIV [antibodies] in blood\u201d; (4) she \u201cdid not know that [she] was given untested blood\u201d; and (5) \u201cno one ever told [her] that [she] could [have] postpone[d] [the] surgery until tested blood was available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Kranwinkel testified that neither he nor anyone else from the hospital blood bank had told the plaintiff, prior to surgery, that the ELISA test was available for screening blood for the presence of HIV antibodies. Kranwinkel further testified that when the plaintiff was transfused, he had assumed that the blood had not been tested for the presence of HIV antibodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>On, or shortly after, April 20, 1985, the day after the plaintiffs transfusion, Kranwinkel received a letter from the Red Cross. The letter stated that, \u201ceffective April 22,1985, all units of whole blood and blood components routinely distributed by the American Red Blood Services, Connecticut Region, will have been determined to be nonreactive when tested for [antibodies associated with HIV].\u201d The letter requested the hospital blood bank to \u201cpromptly return\u201d to the Red Cross all units of blood remaining in its inventory that had not been tested for HIV antibodies. Kranwinkel testified that the hospital blood bank had complied with this request. Kranwinkel further testified that, had the plaintiff not received the units of blood that were used during her transfusion, those units would have been among the units returned to the Red Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The plaintiff was discharged from the hospital on May 14, 1985. There was no evidence that the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant continued after she was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">On September 1, 1994, following a routine blood test ordered by Micheline Williams, the plaintiffs physician, the plaintiff learned for the first time that she had contracted HIV. An investigation ensued, through which the plaintiff learned, for the first time, on March 14, 1995, that the source of her HIV infection was contaminated blood administered to her during the April 19, 1985 transfusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The plaintiffs uncontroverted affidavit also contained numerous, specific factual statements regarding the absence of any information given by the defendant to the plaintiff following the transfusion. She swore that \u201cat no time\u201d did the defendant tell her that: (1) \u201cthe ELISA test was available at the time of [her] surgery\u201d; (2) \u201cthe blood [that she] was given during surgery was not tested for the presence of HIV [antibodies]\u201d; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u201cthe blood [that she] was given [during] surgery [had been] \u2018recalled\u2019 by the Red Cross\u201d; and (4) \u201c[she] could have postponed her surgeiy ... a few days\u201d until tested blood became available.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The plaintiff also submitted, in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, an uncon-troverted affidavit from Elizabeth Donegan, a physician who, from 1985 to 1991, had been in charge of operating a blood bank at a hospital affiliated with the University of California at San Francisco, a community with a large population infected with HIV. Donegan was retained as an expert witness by the plaintiff and stated in her sworn affidavit that: (1) she directed a program at her hospital between July, 1987, and October, 1987, \u201cto notify all persons who had been recipients of untested blood dating back to approximately the time [her hospital] was aware of the . . . presence [of HIV] in [the] community\u201d; and (2) in March, 1987, \u201cthe Center for Disease Control . . . issued a recommendation that recipients of multiple transfusions between 1978 and late spring of 1985 be advised that they were at risk for . . . HIV . . . infection and [be] offered HIV antibody testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The plaintiff filed this complaint on July 9,1996, alleging in the first count that the defendant had been negligent,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, in the second count, that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce in violation of CUTPA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Grogins, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs CUTPA claim. The plaintiff reserved her right to appeal the trial court\u2019s decision to strike that count, and that ruling forms one basis for the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In her substituted complaint, the plaintiff repeated her allegations sounding in negligence; see footnote 6 of this opinion; and eliminated her CUTPA claim in accordance with the trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to strike. The defendant answered the plaintiffs substituted complaint, and pleaded a special defense, namely, that the statute of repose in \u00a7 52-584 barred the plaintiffs negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The trial court, <em>Radcliffe, J., </em>concluded that, because the plaintiffs action had been filed on July 9, 1996, more than eleven years following the blood transfusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>that she received at the hospital on April 19, 1985, the statute of repose in \u00a7 52-584 barred her negligence claim. Accordingly, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the remaining negligence count and rendered judgment thereon. This conclusion forms a second basis for the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">We first consider whether the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Specifically, we consider the plaintiffs claim that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the statute of repose in \u00a7 52-584 was tolled by the continuing course of conduct doctrine based on the defendant\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct after the plaintiffs transfusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u201cThe standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is well established. [W]e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Rytman, </em>241 Conn. 24, 37, 694 A.2d 1246 (1997). \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>248 Conn. 419, 424, 727 A.2d 1276 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the three year statute of repose in \u00a7 52-584 barred her negligence claim. That statute provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in relevant part that \u201c[n]o action . . . caused by negligence ... or by malpractice of a . . . hospital . . . <em>may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained </em>of. . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) The plaintiff contends that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s acts of negligence continued long after, and related to, the original transfusion . . . .\u201d The plaintiff claims the continuing course of conduct doctrine thus tolled the commencement of the running of the three year period under the statute of repose in \u00a7 52-584 until March 14, 1995, when the plaintiff first learned that she had suffered actionable harm. The plaintiff further argues that, because she brought this action against the defendant on June 11, 1996,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it was timely commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The defendant claims, to the contrary, that the three year period began to run in May, 1985, when the plaintiff was discharged from the hospital. Although the defendant recognizes that, under some circumstances, the continuing course of conduct doctrine serves to toll a statute of limitations, it disclaims the applicability of the doctrine in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We begin by noting the relevant \u201c \u2018date of the act or omission complained of,\u2019 as that phrase is used in \u00a7 52-584, is \u2018the date when the negligent conduct of the defendant occurs and . . . not the date when the plaintiff first sustains damage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 265. This court has recognized, however, that a statute of limitations<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cmay be tolled under the . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>continuing course of conduct doctrine, thereby allowing a plaintiff to commence his or her lawsuit at a later date. See, e.g., <em>Connell v. Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, [254-55], 571 A.2d 116 (1990); <em>Fichera </em>v. <em>Mine Hill Corp., </em>207 Conn. 204,209-10, 541 A.2d 472 (1988); <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Huttenlocher, </em>185 Conn. 390, 400, 440 A.2d 952 (1981); <em>Handler v. Remington Arms Co., </em>144 Conn. 316, 321, 130 A.2d 793 (1957) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 265-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u201c[W]e have held that in order [t]o support a finding of a continuing course of conduct that may toll the statute of limitations there must be evidence of the breach of a duty that remained in existence after commission of the original wrong related thereto. That duty must not have terminated prior to commencement of the period allowed for bringing an action for such a wrong. . . . Where we have upheld a finding that a duty continued to exist after the cessation of the act or omission relied upon, there has been evidence of either a special relationship between the parties<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> giving I'ise to such a continuing duty or some later wrongful conduct of a defendant related to the prior act. <em>Fichera </em>v. <em>Mine Hill Corp., </em>supra, 207 Conn. 209-10 (no evidence to support continuing duty on part of defendant after property sold); see, e.g., <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 242 (improper reliance on theory [by plaintiff in medical malpractice action]); <em>Beckenstein </em>v. <em>Potter &amp; Carrier, Inc., </em>191 Conn. 150, 464 A.2d 18 (1983) (no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>continuing duty on defendant\u2019s part after completion of roof installation); <em>Prokolkin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>[170 Conn. 289, 299, 365 A.2d 1180 (1976)] (continuing course of conduct theory inappropriate in strict product liability action); <em>Handler v. Remington Arms </em>Co., supra, 144 Conn. 316 (applying continuing course of conduct doctrine to toll statute of limitations on . . . basis of continuing duty to warn of defective cartridge by manufacturer); <em>Vilcinskas </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>[144 Conn. 170, 174, 127 A.2d 814 (1956)] (continuing course of conduct inapplicable where act completed by sale of air rifle).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 275-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Therefore, a precondition for the operation of the continuing course of conduct doctrine is that the defendant must have committed an initial wrong upon the plaintiff. In this case, the plaintiff claims that the defendant was negligent by failing to inform her of the risks associated with the blood it was supplying for her blood transfusion. See footnote 6 of this opinion. In <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 528 A.2d 805 (1987), we stated that \u201c[t]he delivery of a service, such as providing a blood transfusion, requires the provider of that service to exercise reasonable care to avoid injury to the consumer of the service. If a plaintiff can show that the defect in the blood could reasonably have been detected or removed, the plaintiff may well be entitled to recover for the supplier\u2019s negligent failure to detect or remove the defect.\u201d Id., 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">A second requirement for the operation of the continuing course of conduct doctrine is that there \u201cmust be evidence of the breach of a duty that remained in existence after commission of the original wrong related thereto.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 275. This court has held this requirement to be satisfied when there was \u201cwrongful conduct of a defendant related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>prior act.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Specifically, in determining whether the continuing course of conduct doctrine applies to toll the repose section of the statute of limitations in \u00a7 52-584, we have held twice, in the medical treatment context, that continuing \u201cwrongful conduct may include acts of omission as well as affirmative acts of misconduct . . . .\u201d Id., 264 (doctor\u2019s failure to monitor patient after initial misdiagnosis was continuing course of conduct that tolled statute of limitations); see also <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Huttenlocher, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 400 (\u201c[b]ecause [a physician\u2019s] negligent failure to warn [concerning the potential adverse effects from taking a particular drug] is a continuing course of conduct, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the course of conduct is completed\u201d); cf. <em>Handler </em>v. <em>Remington Arms Co., </em>supra, 144 Conn. 321 (manufacturer\u2019s failure to perform its continuing duty to warn purchasers of defective gun cartridge tolls statute of limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Finally, in <em>Blanchette </em>and <em>Cross, </em>the plaintiffs presented expeit testimony that the defendants\u2019 omissions amounted to a breach of the standard of care. See <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 279 (\u201c[t]he testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s expert witness . . . which the jury might have found credible, was sufficient for the jury to find not only ... a continuing duty on the part of the defendant . . . but also continuing negligence on the part of the defendant based upon a breach of his professional duty of care to the plaintiff\u2019); <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Huttenlocher, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 402 (plaintiff presented expert testimony that, \u201cif credited by the jury, could have been sufficient to make out a case of negligent failure to warn\u201d). In this case, we have such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">We must determine, therefore, in light of this case law and evidentiary record, whether it was proper for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the trial court to have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Specifically, we must determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the defendant: (1) committed an initial wrong upon the plaintiff; (2) owed a continuing duty to the plaintiff that was related to the original wrong; and (3) breached that continuing duty.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We first consider whether there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the defendant committed an initial wrong upon the plaintiff. It is undisputed that: (1) prior to the plaintiffs transfusion, the Food and Drug Administration approved the ELISA test for screening units of blood for HIV antibodies; (2) Kranwinkel testified that he assumed that the plaintiff had been administered untested blood; and (3) no one from the hospital blood bank informed the plaintiff, prior to surgery, that the ELISA test was available for screening blood for the presence of HIV antibodies. Because a hospital that supplies blood for a transfusion must \u201cexercise reasonable care to avoid injury to the [recipient of the blood]\u201d; <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 410; a hospital may be hable for negligently failing to inform a patient of the risks associated with the blood it has supplied for a transfusion. Therefore, we conclude that there was a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the defendant committed an initial wrong upon the plaintiff by failing to inform her that the blood with which she was transfused had not been screened.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>We next consider whether there was a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the defendant owed the plaintiff \u201ca duty that remained in existence after commission of the original wrong related thereto.\u201d <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 275. The plaintiff presented an affidavit from Donegan, a medical expert who stated that she oversaw a program at a hospital blood bank that notified persons who had been administered blood untested for HIV antibodies. She also stated that she \u201cfelt that it was good medical practice to institute this program at the hospital.\u201d Thus, the plaintiff presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could have found that the standard of care required the defendant to have taken steps to notify the plaintiff, after the transfusion, that the blood that she received during her transfusion was not tested for HIV antibodies.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Therefore, as in <em>Blanchette </em>and <em>Cross, </em>the plaintiff in this case presented evidence that \u201cgood medical practice\u201d required the defendant to have acted affirmatively subsequent to a medical procedure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>because \u201cwrongful conduct may include acts of omission as well as affirmative acts of misconduct\u201d; <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 264; Donegan\u2019s affidavit was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the defendant owed the plaintiff a continuing duty that was related to the original wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Finally, we consider whether there was a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether there was a continuing breach of the defendant\u2019s duty of care. The plaintiff provided her own uncontroverted affidavit, in which she swore that \u201cat no time\u201d did the defendant tell her that: (1) \u201cthe ELISA test was available at the time of [her] surgery\u201d; (2) \u201cthe blood [that she] was given during the surgery was not tested for the presence of HIV [antibodies]\u201d; (3) \u201cthe blood [that she] was given [during] surgery . . . was \u2018recalled\u2019 by the Red Cross\u201d; and (4) she \u201ccould have postponed [her] surgery . . . a few days and that tested blood would [have been] available then.\u201d Furthermore, it is undisputed that neither party adduced evidence indicating that the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant continued after the plaintiff was discharged from the hospital in May, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Thus, the plaintiff presented uncontroverted evidence of the defendant\u2019s continuing failure to inform the plaintiff: (1) that the blood with which she was transfused had not been tested for the presence of HIV antibodies; (2) of the risk of contamination of the blood with HIV; and (3) that she was at risk of being infected with HIV. This continuous failure to notify is similar to the continuous failure to monitor that we found actionable in <em>Blanchette, </em>and the continuing failure to warn that we found actionable in <em>Cross. </em>Therefore, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>elude that this evidence of the defendant\u2019s continuing failure to notify was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether the defendant breached its ongoing duty of care to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Therefore, we conclude that, because the plaintiff presented \u201cevidence of the breach of a duty that remained in existence after commission of the original wrong related thereto\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 275; there was a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the repose section of the statute of limitations in \u00a7 52-584 was tolled by the defendant\u2019s continuing course of conduct. We conclude that it was improper for the trial court to have concluded that, as a matter of law, there was no continuing course of conduct. Accordingly, we reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we reject a number of arguments made by the defendant. First, the defendant relies on <em>Giambozi </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>127 Conn. 380, 384, 16 A.2d 833 (1940), overruled on other grounds, <em>Foran </em>v. <em>Carangelo, </em>153 Conn. 356, 360, 216 A.2d 638 (1966), for the proposition that the <em>continuous treatment </em>doctrine does not apply in this case. The plaintiff, however, has not argued on appeal that the <em>continuous treatment </em>doctrine applies. Rather, the plaintiffs claim on appeal is that the <em>continuing course of conduct </em>doctrine applies to this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court in <em>Giambozi </em>did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>consider whether the continuous course of conduct doctrine applied to that case and, therefore, <em>Giambozi </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Second, the defendant argues that \u201cno . . . relationship at all . . . existed between the [p]laintiff and [the defendant] after May, 1985 . . . .\u201d Concededly, in Blanchette, this court stated that \u201cthe continuing course of conduct doctrine, <em>under the circumstances of th[e\\ case, </em>would require the jury to find ... an ongoing physician-patient relationship that had not terminated . . . the last time the plaintiff had consulted with the defendant . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 278. The court in <em>Blanchette, </em>however, also emphasized that the application of the continuing course of conduct doctrine was \u201cconspicuously fact-bound.\u201d Id., 276. Therefore, we do not read <em>Blanchette </em>to require an ongoing physician-patient relationship <em>in all instances </em>in the medical context in which the continuing course of conduct doctrine may apply. Rather, the requirement in <em>Blanchette </em>was based upon our determination that, \u201cunder the circumstances of th[at] case\u201d; id., 278; the defendant\u2019s affirmative continuing duty to monitor the plaintiffs illness arose from his ongoing relationship with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">This reading of <em>Blanchette </em>is supported by our discussion therein of the plaintiffs expert testimony in that case. In <em>Blanchette, </em>we noted that the plaintiffs expert \u201caddressed the issue of the standard of care of a family physician. He concluded that the defendant had failed to meet the standard of care with regard to breast exam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>inations, record keeping, management and diagnosis of a finding in the breast and follow-up treatment of a breast condition. In his opinion, <em>the [defendant\u2019s] entire pattern of care, </em>especially as to [the above mentioned] points, represented a significant deviation from the standard of care.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 269-70.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">In this case, the defendant\u2019s affirmative duty to notify the plaintiff was not conditioned upon the plaintiff maintaining an ongoing relationship with the defendant. On the contrary, the plaintiffs expert stated in an affidavit that her hospital had notified <em>\u201call persons </em>who had been recipients of untested blood dating back to approximately the time [the hospital was] aware of the . . . presence [of HIV] in [the] community.\u201d (Emphasis added.) She also attested to the fact that approximately 17,000 recipients had been so notified. Furthermore, there was no evidence that it would have been \u201cgood medical practice\u201d to inform only those patients who had maintained an ongoing relationship with the hospital. Therefore, we conclude that the absence of any ongoing physician-patient relationship beyond May, 1985, when the plaintiff was discharged from the hospital, would not necessarily preclude a jury from applying the continuing course of conduct doctrine in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that, because it \u201chad no knowledge of [the plaintiffs] illness until nine years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>after it had ceased to treat her, the [p]laintiff cannot sustain a claim that a continuing course of conduct tolled the [s]tatute of [l]imitations . . . .\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Although there was no evidence to suggest that the defendant was aware that the plaintiff had been infected with HIV before 1994, the plaintiff does not claim that the defendant was negligent solely for failing to warn her that she actually had been infected with HIV. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Rather, the plaintiff has presented evidence that creates a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the defendant was negligent in failing to notify her: (1) that the blood with which she had been transfused had not been tested for the presence of HIV antibodies; (2) of the risk of contamination of the blood with HIV; and (3) that she was at risk of being infected with HIV. Therefore, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge as to the plaintiffs actual infection status does not preclude a reasonable jury from concluding that the defendant had a duty to notify the plaintiff, as outlined previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">THE MOTION TO STRIKE THE CUTPA CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">We now consider whether the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs CUTPA claim. The standard of review of a trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to strike is well established. \u201cBecause a motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court, our review of the court\u2019s ruling on [a defendant\u2019s motion to strike] is plenary. ... In an appeal from the granting of a motion to strike, we must read the allegations of the complaint generously to sustain its viability, if possible . . . . We must, therefore, take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and . . . construe the complaint in the manner most favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>to sustaining its legal sufficiency.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>ATC Partnership </em>v. <em>Windham, </em>251 Conn. 597, 603, 741 A.2d 305 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The plaintiffs complaint alleged that the defendant\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute[d] unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of a trade or commerce in violation of ... \u00a7 42-110b.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs CUTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u201c[T]he touchstone for a legally sufficient CUTPA claim against a health care provider is an allegation that an entrepreneurial or business aspect of the provision of services is implicated, aside from medical competence or aside from medical malpractice based on the adequacy of staffing, training, equipment or support personnel. Medical malpractice claims recast as CUTPA claims cannot form the basis for a CUTPA violation. To hold otherwise would transform every claim for medical malpractice into a CUTPA claim. Accordingly, within this framework, we must review the plaintiffs allegations of CUTPA violations and look to the underlying nature of the claim to determine whether it is really a medical malpractice claim recast as a CUTPA claim.\u201d <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>243 Conn. 17, 38, 699 A.2d 964 (1997). The court in <em>Haynes </em>also cited with approval a Washington Court of Appeals decision that stands for the proposition that \u201cviolations predicated on negligence or malpractice, whether legal or medical, are not covered because those claims address only competence.\u201d Id., 35, citing <em>Quimby </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>45 Wash. App. 175, 180, 724 P.2d 403 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The plaintiff claims that her allegation that the defendant transfused the plaintiff with blood \u201cthat had not been tested for the presence of HIV [antibodies] when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>. . . tested blood was available\u201d raises a claim relating to the entrepreneurial or commercial aspects of the defendant\u2019s business.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that \u201c[t]he clear implication that can be drawn from this allegation is that the hospital made a business decision to use old, shelf blood instead of incurring the additional expense of testing or obtaining good blood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We disagree that, based on the plaintiff\u2019s allegation, it is a \u201cclear implication\u201d that the defendant \u201cmade a business decision to use old, shelf blood . . . .\u201d The untested blood may have been administered to the plaintiff for any number of reasons that are wholly independent from the business or entrepreneurial aspects of the defendant\u2019s business. The plaintiff has made no specific factual allegations to support her claim that the entrepreneurial or commercial aspects of the defendant\u2019s business were implicated by its alleged decision to use untested blood when tested blood was available. Because such allegations are necessary to state a legally sufficient CUTPA claim; see <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 38; we conclude that the trial court properly granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s CUTPA claim. Accordingly, we affirm that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment granting the defendant\u2019s motion to strike this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>With respect to the summary judgment for the defendant on the first count, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

Therefore, if the jury determines upon remand that the continuing course of conduct doctrine applies and that the defendant is liable, the plaintiff may collect damages that flow from the defendant\u2019s initial wrongful conduct as well as those that flow from the defendant\u2019s continuing conduct that relates to the initial wrong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\"> In <em>Blanchette </em>and <em>Cross, </em>we considered cases sounding in professional negligence. See <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 258-59; <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Huttenlocher, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 391. In this case, however, the plaintiff characterizes her negligence claim against the defendant as sounding in ordinary negligence. Notwithstanding the plaintiffs characterization of her negligence claim, determining whether the defendant breached a duty owed to the plaintiff by failing to notify her of the risks associated with a medical procedure clearly requires \u201cknowledge that is beyond the experience of an ordinary fact finder . . . .\u201d <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 226, 682 A.2d 106 (1996). Therefore, this claim is \u201cakin to allegations of professional negligence or malpractice . . . .\u201d Id. In order to prove such a claim, the plaintiff is required to present evidence from an expert so as \u201cto assist lay people, such as members of the jury and the presiding judge, to understand the applicable standard of care and to evaluate the defendant\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>in light of that standard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

While \u201ctheir relevance to any particular set of circumstances . . . may overlap\u201d; id.; 1his need not be the case. For example, in considering whether the continuous treatment doctrine or the continuous course of conduct doctrine applied in <em>Blanchette, </em>we concluded that the jury was required to have found, inter alia, that \u201csome form of <em>treatment or required, conduct . . . </em>continued beyond\u201d the plaintiffs last visit with the defendant.

When, however, there is no evidence that the plaintiff received any <em>treatment </em>beyond his or her last visit with the defendant, as in this case, the continuing treatment doctrine does not apply.

See <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 284 (\u201cwe disagree with the premise that a physician who has performed a misdiagnosis has a continuing duty to correct that diagnosis <em>in the absence of proof that [the </em>physician] <em>subsequently learned that his [or her] diagnosis was incorrect\u201d </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\"> The plaintiff also claims that the following allegations in her complaint implicate the business concerns of the defendant, namely, that the defendant was negligent in failing to: (1) \u201cadopt an adequate system of quality assurance to monitor the quality of blood given to patients of the [defendant, including the [p]laintiff(2) \u201cadopt an adequate infection control program to prevent the acquisition and/or administration of blood that had not been tested for, or was contaminated with, HIV\u201d; (3) \u201cadopt adequate rules, regulations and protocols for the screening of blood\u201d; and (4) \u201cadvise the [p]laintiff that the ELISA test was available for testing blood for the presence of HIV [antibodies].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">We disagree that these allegations raise claims relating to the business concerns of the defendant for reasons identical to those discussed in the text of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
