East, and the named defendant, Lisa M. Labbe, were employees of the defendant Easter Seal Society, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> engaged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>course of their employment, when the plaintiff was thrown from a golf cart operated by Labbe on property owned by the Easter Seal Society, Inc. In this action for personal injuries, the trial court, <em>Sullivan, J., </em>granted summary judgment for the defendants on the grounds that: (1) the action was barred by the exclusivity of remedy provision of General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the action was not based on the fellow employee\u2019s negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (a) (47).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>On appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The Appellate Court stated: \u201cOur examination of the record and briefs persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The issue regarding the underlying dispute was resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. See <em>East </em>v. <em>Labbe, </em>46 Conn. Sup. 24, 735 A.2d 371 (1998). Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the facts and the applicable law on those issues.\u201d <em>East </em>v. <em>Labbe, </em>54 Conn. App. 479, 480-81, 735 A.2d 370 (1999). We then granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">After consideration of the record and briefs, and after oral argument, we agree with the determination of the Appellate Court that the trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision properly resolved the underlying issue in this case. See <em>East </em>v. <em>Labbe, </em>supra, 46 Conn. Sup. 24. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-15\"> Easter Seal Society, Inc., is also an intervening plaintiff for purposes of reimbursement of worker\u2019s compensation payments pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a provides: \u201cNo right against fellow employee; exception.
