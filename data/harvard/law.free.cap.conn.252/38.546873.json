The trial court dismissed the appeal, holding that the police had legally stopped the plaintiffs vehicle. The plaintiff then appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Fishbein </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>48 Conn. App. 552, 711 A.2d 733 (1998). This court granted the plaintiffs petition for certification limited to the issue of whether the Appellate Court properly had concluded that the police had reasonable suspicion to justify stopping the plaintiffs vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Fishbein </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>247 Conn. 901, 719 A.2d 902 (1998). After the initial oral argument, we ordered supplemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tal briefs and additional argument before an en banc court on the following issue: \u201cIs the question of whether the police have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify an investigative stop outside the scope of the four issues to be considered at a \u00a7 14-227b license suspension hearing?\u201d We answer that question in the affirmative, and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The essential facts of this case, as revealed in the record, are undisputed. On March 5, 1996, police officers were conducting a surveillance of a house at 180 Poplar Street in New Haven. The police suspected that the house was a favored spot for illegal drug transactions. At 2:15 a.m., a car driven by the plaintiff stopped at the house. The plaintiff turned off the car\u2019s headlights and motor, and a passenger exited the car and went to the door of the house. The passenger knocked on the door and had a brief conversation -with the person who opened the door. The passenger then returned to and entered the car, and the plaintiff started the car and turned on the lights. Although the car was not yet in motion, the police officers effectuated a stop by pulling their cruiser alongside and turning on the cruiser\u2019s overhead lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Officer Peter A. Beckwith approached the car and questioned the plaintiff regarding his reasons for being at that address. When the plaintiff responded to the officer\u2019s questions, the officer smelled alcohol on his breath. The officer then asked for the plaintiffs registration and insurance papers. He had to repeat the request three times before it was understood by the plaintiff. The officer proceeded to order the plaintiff out of the car and administered a series of field sobriety tests to the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed each test. At that point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the officer read an implied consent advisory<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff agreed to take a breath test at the police station. Thereafter, the officer arrested the plaintiff on a charge of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, informed the plaintiff of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights, and brought the plaintiff to the police station where he administered two breath tests to the plaintiff. Both breath tests showed that the plaintiffs blood alcohol level exceeded the limit set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">On the basis of these facts, the commissioner issued a notice to the plaintiff, advising him of a proposed ninety day suspension of his operator\u2019s license, and informing him that he was entitled to request a hearing on the suspension. Following the plaintiffs request, a hearing was held, at which the commissioner determined that the four elements set forth in General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-227b (1), as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-279, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 (now \u00a7 14-227b [g]),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had been met, and, therefore, that the plaintiffs operator\u2019s license would be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The issues before this court on appeal are: (1) is the question of whether the police have reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify an investigative stop outside the scope of the four issues to be considered at a license suspension hearing pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (f); and (2) if the answer to the first question is no, did the commissioner properly find that the police had reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the plaintiff? Because we answer the first question in the affirmative, we need not answer the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-227b (d), as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-279, provides in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>relevant part: \u201cAny person whose license or operating privilege has been suspended in accordance with this subsection shall automatically be entitled to a hearing before the commissioner to be held prior to the effective date of the suspension. . . .\u201d Subsection (f) provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he hearing shall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle was impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor; (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to such test or analysis or did such person submit to such test or analysis, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, and the results of such test or analysis indicated that the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight; and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The plaintiff now argues that the \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d element in \u00a7 14-227b (f) implicitly incorporates a requirement that the <em>initial </em>investigative stop of the driver of a vehicle be lawful. If the stop is unlawful, his argument continues, the commissioner is without authority to suspend his license. The plaintiff further argues that any other interpretation would violate the constitutional requirements of due process. Neither the commissioner nor the trial court considered this issue, as they both assumed that a determination of the legality of the stop was required. The Appellate Court upheld the trial court\u2019s determination that there had been a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify the stop of the plaintiffs vehicle and concluded that the trial court had properly dismissed the plaintiffs appeal, but did not address the supplemental issue in this appeal. <em>Fishbein </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The question before us is a matter of statutory interpretation and, as such, constitutes a question of law subject to de novo review. See <em>In re Eden F., </em>250 Conn. 674, 690, 741 A.2d 873 (1999). \u201cIn seeking to discern [statutory] intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">It is well settled that \u201c [w]here the meaning of a statute ... is plain and unambiguous, the enactment speaks for itself and there is no occasion to construe it. Its unequivocal meaning is not subject to modification by way of construction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pitchell </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>247 Conn. 422, 432, 722 A.2d 797 (1999). This court previously has held that the language of \u00a7 14-227b (f), limiting the issues to be considered at a license suspension hearing, is plain and unambiguous. See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 7, 509 A.2d 489 (1986) (\u201c[t]he language of ... \u00a7 14-227b [f] is plain and unambiguous\u201d); see also <em>Bialowas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>44 Conn. App. 702, 711, 692 A.2d 834 (1997) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We also have held repeatedly that the plain language of the statute expressly and narrowly limits the scope of the license suspension hearing to the four issues enumerated in the statute. See <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>229 Conn. 51, 59, 639 A.2d 1028 (1994) (statute limits issues properly raised on appeal from license suspension, and officer\u2019s failure to comply with regulation requiring certification to operate breath test would not be basis for overturning license suspension if other elements demonstrated); <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>229 Conn. 31, 40, 639 A.2d 1018 (1994) (same); <em>Volck </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>204 Conn. 507, 512, 529 A.2d 177 (1987) (because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>hearing limited to four enumerated issues, multiple failures by arresting officer to comply with statutory dictates of \u00a7 14-227b not sufficient grounds for overturning commissioner\u2019s determination that operator\u2019s license should be suspended); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 7 (hearing limited to four enumerated issues and commissioner not required to determine whether subject of hearing understood consequences of refusal to submit to chemical testing before suspending license). The Appellate Court has held in <em>Dalmaso </em>v. <em>Dept. of Motor </em>Vehicles, 47 Conn. App. 839, 844, 707 A.2d 1275 (1998), that the admitted failure of the police to comply with subsection (b) of the statute, requiring police to afford the arrested person an opportunity to call his attorney, was irrelevant in a suspension hearing. See also <em>Bialowas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 710 (subsection [f] of \u00a7 14-227b does not provide for adjudication of multiple procedural errors by police under subsection [b] of statute, but is limited to four enumerated issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">This court has not addressed previously the specific question of whether the \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d element of subsection (f) incorporates a requirement that there be legal grounds for the underlying initial stop. We see no reason, however, to depart from our previous interpretation that the statutory language narrowly limits the license suspension hearing to the four issues expressly enumerated. A common theme of our cases construing \u00a7 14-227b is that \u201cthe restriction of a license suspension hearing to the four issues specified in [\u00a7 14-227b (f)] is indicative of the legislative view that the failure to comply precisely with the [criminal procedure] requirements of subsection (b) should not prevent suspension of the license of a person, arrested with probable cause for believing he was operating under the influence or with impaired ability as a result of intoxicating liquor, who has refused to submit to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>prescribed tests\u201d; <em>Volck </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 514; or who, as in this case, has taken the tests and has been found to have a blood alcohol level in excess of the statutory limit. While \u201cthe legislature has attached certain consequences to departures from the procedures specified in \u00a7 14-227b (b) and has provided a substantial incentive for the police to comply with those procedures\u201d in the context of criminal proceedings; id.; \u201cthe legislature has manifested its intention that noncompliance with subsection (b), not involving one of the four issues to be determined pursuant to subsection (d) [which became subsection (f) of the version of the statute under consideration], does not preclude the suspension of the license of a driver\u201d when the four enumerated elements have been demonstrated. Id., 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hickam, </em>235 Conn. 614, 624, 668 A.2d 1321 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1221, 116 S. Ct. 1851, 134 L. Ed. 2d 951 (1996), we concluded that \u201c[a]n examination of the legislative history of \u00a7 14-227b reveals that a principal purpose for the enactment of the statute was to protect the public by removing potentially dangerous drivers from the state\u2019s roadways with all dispatch compatible with due process.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This court in <em>Hickam </em>distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>guished license suspension proceedings, the primary purpose of which is to promote public safety by removing \u201cthose who have demonstrated a reckless disregard for the safety of others\u201d from the state\u2019s roadways, from criminal proceedings, the primary purpose of which is punishment. Id., 626. This court concluded that when a driver is subject to criminal prosecution, the license suspension hearing is not barred by the constitutional double jeopardy prohibition on multiple punishments for the same offense. Id., 628. In <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>Del-Ponte, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 42, and <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 51, we determined that although a failure to comply with a regulation requiring certification of the officer who administers the breath analysis test would render any test results inadmissible in a criminal proceeding under \u00a7 14-227a (c), it was not a basis for overturning the commissioner\u2019s decision when the four elements enumerated in \u00a7 14-227b (f) had been established. Thus, we have indicated repeatedly that a license suspension hearing is not a criminal proceeding and that the subject of such a hearing is not entitled to all of the procedural protections that would be available in a criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">We accordingly conclude in this case that the legislature did not intend that the lack of a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify an initial investigatory stop would be a basis for overturning the commissioner\u2019s decision if the commissioner finds that, subsequent to the stop, \u201cthe police officer [had] probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-227b (f), as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-279. We further conclude that failure to comply with the requirements for criminal prosecution as they apply to investigatory stops should not prevent suspension of the license of a person arrested upon probable cause to believe that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>operating under the influence of intoxicating liquor. See <em>Volck v.Muzio, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 514. Any interpretation that prevented the commissioner from suspending the license of a person who was stopped without a reasonable and articulable suspicion, but whom the police subsequently had probable cause to arrest for driving under the influence, would undermine the primary purpose of the statute, which is \u201cto protect the public by removing potentially dangerous drivers from the state\u2019s roadways with all dispatch compatible with due process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Hicham, supra, 235 Conn. 624. Nothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 14-227b (f) suggests a contrary interpretation. Therefore, we conclude that the legislature did not intend the probable cause to arrest requirement in subsection (f) to incorporate all of the procedural protections that would be available to the plaintiff in a criminal proceeding. Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs argument that, in the context of \u00a7 14-227b (f), probable cause requires a finding of a reasonable and articulable suspicion to make the initial stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Our narrow reading of the probable cause requirement in subsection (f) is fully consistent with the requirements of due process. We are persuaded that the statute\u2019s probable cause requirement, coupled with its provision for an administrative hearing, affords a driver all the constitutional protection to which he is entitled. Due process requires that \u201c[a] state must afford notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case before the [license suspension] becomes effective.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>170 Conn. 136, 144, 365 A.2d 403 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Whether the procedure accorded at a hearing is \u201cappropriate to the nature of the case\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; is to be determined by considering three factors: \u201cFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>463 U.S. 1112, 1117, 103 S. Ct. 3513, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1267 (1983); see also <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Applying the due process analysis set forth in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>supra, 463 U.S. 1117, to this case, we recognize, with regard to the first consideration, that the plaintiff has an interest in continuing the use of his license during the suspension period. With regard to the second consideration, we conclude that, because the commissioner must find at the license suspension hearing that the police had probable cause to arrest for driving under the influence, a requirement that the police must have a reasonable and articulable suspicion justifying the initial stop would accomplish nothing toward reducing the risk of an erroneous license suspension. Finally, we find that the interest of the government in expeditiously removing intoxicated drivers from the state\u2019s roadways is great; see id., 1118 (finding that \u201c[t]he interest of the States in depriving the drunk driver of permission to continue operating an automobile is particularly strong\u201d and recognizing \u201c[t]he carnage caused by drunk drivers\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); and that the state\u2019s interest substantially outweighs the driver\u2019s interest in continuing the use of his license during the suspension period.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Furthermore, the plaintiffs argument assumes that the exclusionary rule precluding use of evidence obtained as a result of an improper search or seizure is applicable, not only to a criminal proceeding, but also to a civil hearing held pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>disagree. \u201cThe general rule in a criminal proceeding is that statements and other evidence obtained as a result of an unlawful, warrantless arrest are suppressible if the link between the evidence and the unlawful conduct is not too attenuated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service </em>v. <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1040-41, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1984). \u201c[T]he [exclusionary] rule\u2019s prime purpose is to deter future unlawful police conduct and thereby effectuate the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures .... Application of the rule is thus appropriate in circumstances in which this purpose is likely to be furthered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>207 Conn. 565, 570, 541 A.2d 504, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 898, 109 S. Ct. 242, 102 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1988). \u201c[I]n the complex and turbulent history of the rule, the [United States Supreme] Court never has applied it to exclude evidence from a civil proceeding, federal or state.\u201d <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service </em>v. <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>supra, 1041-42 (holding that rule does not apply in deportation proceedings); see also <em>Pennsylvania Board of Probation &amp; Parole </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>524 U.S. 357, 363, 118 S. Ct. 2014, 141 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1998) (recognizing that \u201cwe have repeatedly declined to extend the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than criminal trials\u201d and holding that rule not applicable in parole revocation proceedings); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 448, 454, 96 S. Ct. 3021, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1046 (1976) (holding that rule does not apply in civil tax proceedings); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343-46, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1974) (holding that rule does not apply in grand jury proceedings). \u201c[B]ecause the rule is prudential rather than constitutionally mandated, [it has been held] to be applicable only where its deterrence benefits outweigh its substantial social costs.\u201d (Internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>omitted.) <em>Pennsylvania Board of Probation &amp; Parole </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 363. \u201c[T]he need for deterrence and hence the rationale for excluding the evidence are strongest where the Government\u2019s unlawful conduct would result in imposition of a criminal sanction on the victim of the search.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calandra, </em>supra, 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\"><em>In Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 571, we concluded that \u201capplication of the [exclusionary] rule [in probation revocation proceedings] would at best achieve only a marginal deterrent effect.\u201d We reasoned that any illegally obtained information would be inadmissible in a criminal trial; <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961); and that, where the police officer was unaware that the suspect was on probation, exclusion of the evidence in a probation revocation hearing would not enhance appreciably the deterrent effect already created by the inadmissibility of the evidence at a criminal trial. <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 571. We further reasoned that \u201c[s]ince the use of evidence in a probation revocation hearing falls outside the offending officer\u2019s zone of primary interest; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>supra, [428 U.S.] 458; exclusion of such evidence will not significantly affect a police officer\u2019s motivation in conducting a search.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>We conclude in this case that \u201cthe local law enforcement official is already \u2018punished\u2019 by the exclusion of the evidence in the state criminal trial. That, necessarily, is of substantial concern to him.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>supra, 428 U.S. 448. The exclusion of the evidence in the license suspension hearing would be of only incremental deterrent value. That value is substantially outweighed by the societal interest in having otherwise reliable evidence of probable cause to arrest for driving under the influence presented at the hearing. Accordingly, we conclude that due process does not require the exclusionary rule to apply at hearings held pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The plaintiff argues that, if a reasonable and articula-ble suspicion for the initial stop need not be demonstrated at the license suspension hearing, and if the exclusionary rule does not apply at the hearing, then the police will be encouraged to conduct arbitrary or discriminatory stops on the mere chance of subsequently establishing probable cause to arrest for driving under the influence. We are unpersuaded by this argument for the following reasons: First, the exclusion of any illegally obtained evidence in criminal proceedings, which are the police officer\u2019s primary zone of interest, provides a deterrent to such conduct. Second, we will not assume that the police will expend scarce law enforcement resources to stop motorists whom they have no articulable reason to suspect of any offense on the mere chance of establishing probable cause. Finally, the Connecticut legislature, in Public Acts 1999, No. 99-198, \u00a7 2 (a), has required that \u201ceach municipal police department and the Department of Public Safety shall adopt a written policy that prohibits the stopping, detention or search of any person when such action is solely motivated by considerations of race, color, ethnicity, age, gender or sexual orientation, and the action would constitute a violation of the civil rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>of the person.\u201d A violation of this official written policy would likely subject the police officer to disciplinary action. Subsection 2 (e) of that act further provides that \u201c[i]f a municipal police department or the Department of Public Safety fails to comply with the provisions of this section, the Chief State\u2019s Attorney may recommend and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management may order an appropriate penalty in the form of the withholding of state funds from such department or the Department of Public Safety.\u201d This statute provides a direct disincentive for police to make discriminatory investigatory stops. In summary, we reject the plaintiffs argument envisioning wholesale arbitrary or discriminatory investigative stops.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">We conclude that neither the statute as written nor the constitutional requirements of due process require the commissioner to determine at a license suspension hearing that the police had reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify the initial investigative stop. Accordingly, we need not determine whether the police had a reasonable and articulable suspicion justifying the stop of the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">In this opinion KATZ, PALMER, PETERS and CALLAHAN, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-14\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-227b, as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-279, provides in relevant part,: \u201c(a) Any person who operates a motor vehicle in this state shall be deemed to have given his consent to a chemical analysis of his blood, breath or urine and, if said person is a minor, his parent or parents or guardian shall also be deemed to have given his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">''(b) If any such person, having been placed under arrest for operating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor, and thereafter, after being apprised of his constitutional rights, having been requested to submit to a blood, breath or urine test at the option of the police officer, having been afforded a reasonable opportunity to telephone an attorney prior to the performance of such test and having been informed that his license or nonresident operating privilege may be suspended in accordance with the provisions of this section if he refuses to submit to such test or if he submits to such test and the results of such test indicate that the ratio of alcohol in his blood was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight, and that evidence of any such refusal shall be admissible in accordance with subsection (f) of section 14-227a and may be used against him in any criminal prosecution, refuses to submit to the designated test, the test shall not be given; provided, if the person refuses or is unable to submit to a blood test, the police officer shall designate the breath or urine test as the test to be taken.

It is clear that for the defendant, the commissioner of motor vehicles (commissioner), to suspend a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license, he must prove that a police officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the driver had committed or was about to commit a crime to justify an investigatory stop of the automobile as aprecondition of the finding of \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d and \u201cplaced under arrest\u201d elements of \u00a7 14-227b (f). The majority comes to the contrary conclusion. This holding, which condones a police officer\u2019s unconstitutional invasion of a person\u2019s privacy, is simply unprecedented.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">I must first address a matter of vital concern to me. The majority decision gives police officers carte blanche to practice racial profiling.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority legitimizes a police officer stopping a person to determine if there was \u201c \u2018probable cause to ar rest the person for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor ....\u2019\u201d Accordingly, an African-American or a Hispanic, or for that matter anyone operating a motor vehicle, may be targeted, have her privacy invaded, and be humiliated and harassed based on the whim of a police officer. The officer can invade an individual\u2019s privacy under the pretext of ascertaining probable cause that the person was operating her motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs without any reasonable and articulable suspicion that she was indeed operating under the influence or committing some other crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is not only contrary to any reasonable interpretation of \u00a7 14-227b (f) and unconstitutional, it simply flies in the face of the legislative policy prohibiting racial profiling as enacted in Public Acts 1999, No. 99-198.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The ramifications of this decision for minorities is frightening.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The majority bypasses the concern about racial profiling by contending that the only consequence of a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>officer stopping a citizen is an administrative hearing that may result in the suspension of her operator\u2019s license. That misses the point: It is not the resulting administrative hearing that is of concern, but rather the initial invasion of a citizen\u2019s privacy. This is not a totalitarian government but a democracy. We have a right to walk down the street or operate a motor vehicle without being harassed by the police. Our right of privacy should not be invaded unless the police officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person is violating the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">According to the majority, we need not be concerned about this because we can assume that the police will not \u201cexpend scarce law enforcement resources to stop motorists whom they have no articulable reason to suspect of any offense on the mere chance of establishing probable cause.\u201d This calls for two responses. First, it is obvious that the majority believes that we live in Alice\u2019s Wonderland.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, let us not just assume that the police will not interfere with a person\u2019s privacy but let us mandate it by requiring that the officer have a reasonable and articulable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">As the procedural history reveals, both the trial court and the Appellate Court assumed that the police officer needed a reasonable and articulable suspicion to make the initial stop of the plaintiff, David Fishbein. The trial court held that although the police officer need not have probable cause to make an investigatory stop, he must have had a \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion that a person has committed or is about to commit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>crime.\u201d The trial court determined that the police officer had such grounds to stop the plaintiff<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and sustained the commissioner\u2019s suspension of his driver\u2019s license. The Appellate Court predicated its decision on the police officer\u2019s stop being justified by a \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion,\u201d and affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision that there was such suspicion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Fishbein </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>48 Conn. App. 552, 557, 711 A.2d 733 (1998). Judge Lavery of the Appellate Court dissented on the basis that the facts of this case did not reach the level of reasonable and articulable suspicion. Id., 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The majority of this court affirms the Appellate Court, not on the basis that the police officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion, but, rather, that no such suspicion was required. In other words, a police officer, without more than the barest suspicion, may stop a citizen, infringe upon her constitutional rights and subsequently gain sufficient evidence to support probable cause to arrest her for operating a motor vehicle while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>under the influence of liquor or drugs in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 14-227b (f) (1). The commissioner never advanced this argument. Rather, he argued merely that we should strictly construe the probable cause requirement of \u00a7 14-227b (f). The majority of this court, through its own advocacy, raised the issue and ordered rebriefing. The majority would do well if it would be as vigilant in protecting the constitutional rights of our citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Judge Maloney in his well reasoned opinion in <em>Field </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>42 Conn. Sup. 306, 618 A.2d 80 (1991), explicated the reasoning and the legislative history that clearly supports the requirement that an officer must have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop a vehicle as follows: \u201cAn axiomatic rule of statutory construction is that statutes \u2018should be construed so that no part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant and unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment.\u2019 <em>84 Century Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>207 Conn. 250, 263, 541 A.2d 478 (1988). The obvious purpose of the legislature in including the probable cause and arrest requirements in the administrative procedure on license suspensions was to ensure that that procedure would be subject to minimum basic constitutional safeguards. The legislative history of the administrative hearing statute, General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (f), supports this interpretation. In 1981, the license suspension procedure was removed from the judicial system and transferred to the department of motor vehicles, which was charged with the responsibility of providing a hearing and determining whether a license should be suspended for violation of the per se law. See Public Acts 1981, No. 81-446; <em>Volck </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>[204 Conn. 507, 515, 529 A.2d 177 (1987)]. In introducing and explaining [Public Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>81-446] to the [S]enate, Senator Clifton A. Leonhardt remarked as follows: \u2018Some people have raised the question does this Bill go too fax? Is it a little too stringent? And I would like to go through some of the protections that are built into the Bill. First of all, <em>no one can be asked to be given this test [to measure blood alcohol content] unless they have been arrested for probable cause for driving under the influence so there has to be some independent source of the arrest; erratic driving, speeding and then the smelling of the breath and that sort of thing. The police officer has to have independent probable cause for administering the test . . . </em>and then very importantly, the Bill makes provision for an immediate post suspension hearing ... so that the Constitutional due process rights of drivers are protected.\u2019 24 S. Proc., Pt. 18, 1981 Sess., pp. 5672-73. Later, speaking in support of the act, Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr., responded to a question concerning constitutional safeguards as follows: \u2018Now, Senator [Eugene R.] Skowronski points out the fact that the tests or the safeguards for probable cause are not that great, but when I worked on this Bill with Senator Leonhardt, and when I worked on it in the Committee, one of the things, one of the alternatives that was given to us was that the police officer should have a right to stop anyone and give them a test and <em>one of the things that I felt that was very important was that the probable cause be built in. For instance, before a test could be administered, that the probable cause had in fact, to be established first </em>.... And I can say that I don\u2019t think that the police officers will act arbitrarily and I think that that probable cause test that was put in there will make certain that before the test was given, that they have someone and that the test will be used merely to buttress what has already been shown to the police officer when he makes this arrest or in fact, the probable cause is established.\u2019 Id., pp. 5685-86.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Field </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>supra, 315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>I agree with Judge Maloney that the legislature intended that basic constitutional protections apply to the license suspension procedure. The statutory requirements that there be \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d and that the person be \u201cplaced under arrest\u201d are constitutional guarantees that would be rendered meaningless unless this court requires that the police officer have a reasonable and articulable suspicion before making the initial stop. An investigatory stop can lead to further invasions into an individual\u2019s privacy as she is subject to arrest, to invasive testing of her breath or blood alcohol content and to the suspension of her operator\u2019s license. Given that a police officer\u2019s unlawful stop of a suspect invalidates her subsequent arrest; <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>195 Conn. 668, 678-79, 490 A.2d 984 (1985), an unconstitutional investigatory stop cannot be the basis of the license suspension procedure. The legislature\u2019s inclusion of probable cause requires that a police officer take the necessary steps of finding a reasonable and articulable suspicion before attaining the heightened standard. This heightened standard is meaningless when the lower rungs of reasonable and articulable suspicion are removed and replaced with a police officer\u2019s subjectivity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\"><em>Field </em>has been controlling law since 1991. The legislature, which has met in annual session at least seven times since <em>Field </em>was decided, did not amend it with respect to the requirement that there be a reasonable and articulable suspicion. \u201cIt is presumed that the legislature is mindful of judicial construction relevant to legislation it has enacted. ... It is further presumed that when the legislature subsequently acts with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>to a statute, it does so with full awareness of relevant judicial interpretations.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Forman School, </em>54 Conn. App. 841, 845-46, 738 A.2d 697 (1999). Because the legislature visited \u00a7 14-227b by amending the subsection at issue four times since <em>Field, </em>including in 1998 by No. 98-182, \u00a7 20, of the 1998 Public Acts, wherein it completely reorganized \u00a7 14-227b, its intent has been made clear that reasonable and articulable suspicion is a requirement before a police officer can make an initial stop and invade the privacy of a person. If the legislature disagreed with <em>Field, </em>it surely would have amended \u00a7 14-227b to clarify the law. It did not do so. See <em>Cappellino </em>v. <em>Cheshire, </em>226 Conn. 569, 576, 628 A.2d 595 (1993); <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>223 Conn. 22, 30, 610 A.2d 1292 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Other states with similar statutes which refer to the \u201carrest\u201d of a person have concluded that the police officer must have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person has committed or is about to commit a crime. An Illinois implied consent statute providing that a suspect be \u201cplaced under arrest,\u201d has been interpreted to require \u201ca lawful and valid arrest.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Krueger, </em>208 Ill. App. 3d 897, 903-904, 567 N.E.2d 717 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 919, 112 S. Ct. 1293, 117 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1992). The Illinois Appellate Court reasoned that \u201cthis construction is consistent with our duty to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature and to avoid, if possible, a construction which would raise doubts regarding the constitutionality and validity of the statute. . . . [I]t is our duty to avoid a construction that would open the constitutionality of the implied-consent law to serious question. Although the State characterizes the issue in this case as whether to apply the exclusionary rule to a civil summary suspension proceeding, we believe that the real question before us is whether the statute affirmatively authorizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the Secretary of State to suspend a motorist\u2019s license on the basis of a search which itself is the product of an unauthorized arrest. The Secretary\u2019s power to impose a summary license suspension is derived from the statute, and we decline to read the statute as, in effect, authorizing unconstitutional arrests or searches and the imposition of new deprivations based on those unconstitutional arrests or searches.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 904-905. The court further noted that the state\u2019s authority to suspend an operator\u2019s license was based upon the operator\u2019s consent to submit to blood alcohol tests as a condition of obtaining a license. \u201cTo hold that motorists waive their right to be free of unconstitutional arrests and searches as a condition of operating motor vehicles would do violence to the principle of implied consent.\u201d Id., 905. Thus, operators do not consent to be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Similarly, a Michigan implied consent statute providing that \u201c \u2018[a] person who operates a vehicle upon the public highways of this state ... is arrested\u2019 \u201d was interpreted to require a lawful arrest. <em>Gallagher v. Secretary of State, </em>59 Mich. App. 269, 275, 229 N.W.2d 410 (1975). The Michigan Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[w]e are acutely aware of what is at stake in this question of statutory construction. We have not the slightest inclination to dilute in the most minute degree the public purpose of apprehending and convicting intoxicated or impaired drivers. No less are we inclined to give a statute an unconstitutional interpretation and render nugatory all the good that was the legislative purpose in passing the act. We cannot conceive that the Legislature had the remotest intention ... to mean that law enforcement officers can on what they alone consider \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 without any judicial restraint, supervision, or requirement of prior valid arrest, request a citizen to take a chemical test of bodily substances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>or suffer the grave penalty of license loss or suspension on refusal to comply. Hence we hold that the sine qua non to energize the statutory mandate of the \u2018implied consent\u2019 law is a prior valid arrest.\u201d Id., 275-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">A federal District Court struck down a South Dakota implied consent law as unconstitutional because it failed to require a lawful arrest. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>354 F. Sup. 196, 199 (D.S.D. 1973). \u201cThus it would seem that if a police officer, implementing search and seizure procedures in accordance with constitutional proscriptions, cannot require a person to take a blood test without a warrant unless there is a lawful arrest and emergency circumstances, then neither could the officer demand that a licensee submit to the blood test, without these same constitutional prerequisites, when refusal would result in automatic loss of his license. If it were any other way, the Fourth Amendment protections would be rendered valueless since asserting them would result in a penalty potentially more severe than conviction for the alleged public offense.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">What the majority would have us believe is that when the legislature provided for the requirement that there be an \u201carrest,\u201d it also meant an illegal arrest by a police officer who did not even have a reasonable and articula-ble suspicion. I cannot believe the legislature would intend, under any circumstances, that an operator\u2019s license could be suspended as a result of an unconstitutional invasion of a person\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Accordingly, I conclude that the state must prove as part of the statutory requirements of \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d and that a \u201cperson was placed under arrest\u201d that the police officer have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the operator has committed or is about to commit a crime to justify the initial investigatory stop. I also agree \"with Judge Lavery\u2019s dissenting opinion that \u201c[t]o satisfy the reasonable and articulable standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>on [the] facts [of this case], in light of the totality of the circumstances presented here, there needed to be something more.

They further were suspicious of the entire neighborhood, and that is presumedly why they were assigned to surveillance there.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u201cThose facts, combined with the very late hour, 2:15 in the morning, and the actual activity of the [plaintiffs] passenger going from the vehicle, going to the suspicious building, coming back and getting into the car were, in the court\u2019s opinion, sufficient basis for stopping the vehicle to investigate further.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b82-9\"> The Appellate Court found that \u201c[i]n this case, the police officers observed the plaintiffs vehicle at 2:15 a.m. on a street known for illicit drug sales.

Because I believe that the dissenting opinion of Judge Lavery in the Appellate Court decision in this case is persuasive, I cannot agree with the majority opinion set forth today. Judge Lavery in his dissent argued that the facts of the this case did not reach the level of a reasonable and articulable suspicion. Judge Laveiy correctly noted that \u201c \u2018[t]he fact that [the plaintiff] was in a neighborhood frequented by drug users, standing alone, is not a basis for concluding that [the plaintiff] himself was engaged in criminal conduct.\u2019 <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>[443 U.S. 47, 52, 99 S.

Succinctly put, I fail to understand how there can follow the furtherance of any state purpose, be it criminal or administrative, when the police have failed to meet even the threshold requirement, i.e., a reasonable and articulable suspicion, that forms the basis of their authority to interfere with the Connecticut citizenry.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Initially, I was moved by the commissioner\u2019s argument that, given the limited administrative context of the proceeding involved, we should strictly construe the probable cause requirement of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 14-227b (f), as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-279, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, now \u00a7 14-227b (g).

And I can say that I don\u2019t think that the police officers will act arbitrarily and I think that [the] probable cause test that was put in there will make certain that before the test was given, that they have someone and that the test will be used merely to buttress what has already been shown to the police officer when he malees this arrest or, in fact, the probable cause is established. . . .\u201d 24 S.
