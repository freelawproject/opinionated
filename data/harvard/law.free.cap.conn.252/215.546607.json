We conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when read in light of the facts and circumstances of this case, the policy of exclusivity set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the legislative history of the enactment of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), limits the plaintiffs recovery to the receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The plaintiff, Linda Driscoll, brought this tort action<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeking damages for negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress from her employer, the named defendant, General Nutrition Corporation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on the diversity of citizenship of the parties, the defendant removed this action to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1446.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant then moved for summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ment in light of the exclusivity provision of \u00a7 31-284 (a). See footnote 3 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Pursuant to <em>Erie Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938), because the jurisdiction of the District Court was based on diversity of citizenship, that court was required to adjudicate the claims of the parties in accordance with the law of Connecticut. The District Court concluded that the applicable authorities in this state provided insufficient guidance to enable it to rule definitively on the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. That court, therefore, denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment without prejudice and certified the following question to this court: \u201cIs a sexual assault where the victim is forced to perform fellatio on her assailant a \u2018physical injury\u2019 within the meaning of . . . \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) such that any claim for emotional injuries resulting from the sexual assault [is] governed by the Connecticut Workerfs\u2019] Compensation Act?\u201d This court accepted the question of law as framed by the District Court and we now answer it in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In an appeal in response to a question certified by a federal court, this court relies on the finding of facts from the certifying court. Practice Book \u00a7 82-3. In this case, the District Court made the following findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The defendant owned and operated a store in Enfield. On January 19, 1996, the plaintiff began working as a sales clerk for the defendant at this store. Gloria West-over, the store manager, also was working at the store that day. That morning, Gregory Popielarczyk entered the store on four occasions within a period of one to one and one-half hours. During his fourth visit to the store, Popielarczyk seized the plaintiff by the neck and physically forced her and Westover into separate rooms located in the rear of the store. With the women out of the way, he ransacked the cash register. He then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>returned to the rear of the store and sexually assaulted the plaintiff by forcing her to perform oral sex on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In its motion for summary judgment, the defendant claimed that the plaintiffs tort action was barred by \u00a7 31-284 (a) because, under that statutory provision, the defendant was \u201cnot . . . liable for any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by [the plaintiff] arising out of and in the course of [her] employment . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a). Our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act includes in the definition of the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d an \u201caccidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A). That act, however, excludes from this definition \u201cmental or emotional impairment, unless such impairment arises from a physical injury or occupational disease . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In response to the defendant\u2019s motion, the plaintiff focused her claim for relief on the emotional distress she had suffered as a result of Popielarczyk\u2019s assault. The District Court\u2019s certified question assumed that the plaintiffs claim for relief was limited to the recovery of damages for emotional injuries only.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONNECTICUT LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The issue before us is whether a person who alleges that she has been assaulted physically as well as emotionally can avoid the statutory rule of exclusivity by expressly limiting her tort action to a claim for recovery only for emotional distress and emotional injury. The plaintiffs complaint, however, alleges that she has \u201csuffered various physical and psychological injuries . . . .\u201d See footnote 8 of this opinion. It would be difficult to conjure up a case in which the involuntary act of fellatio would not be a physical as well as an emotional assault.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We must decide, therefore, whether the applicable provisions in our workers\u2019 compensation law; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-284 (a) and 31-275 (16) (A) and (B) (ii); consider a person so situated to have suffered multiple injuries that may be unbundled for pleading purposes, or to have suffered only one injury, with physical as well as mental components, which, because of the mandate of \u00a7 31-275 (B) (ii), may be pursued only through a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act indisputably is a remedial statute that should be construed generously to accomplish its purpose. See, e.g., <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>245 Conn. 66, 71, 712 A.2d 938 (1998); <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Sherwood Industries, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 502, 511, 710 A.2d 1338 (1998); <em>Hunnihan </em>v. <em>Mattatuck Mfg. Co., </em>243 Conn. 438, 447, 705 A.2d 1012 (1997). Section 31-284 (a), the exclusivity provision in the act, manifests a legislative policy decision that a limitation on remedies under tort law is an appropriate trade-off for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>benefits provided by workers\u2019 compensation. That trade-off is part and parcel of the remedial purpose of the act in its entirety. Accordingly, our case law on workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity reflects the proposition that \u201cthese statutes compromise an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation.\u201d <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). \u201cThe purposes of the act itself are best served by allowing the remedial legislation a reasonable sphere of operation considering [its] purposes.\u201d Id. \u201cIn appeals arising under workers\u2019 compensation law, we must resolve statutory ambiguities or lacunae in a manner that will further the remedial purpose of the act.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>241 Conn. 692, 698, 699 A.2d 52 (1997), citing <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 32, 602 A.2d 560 (1992); see also <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corp., </em>208 Conn. 589, 604, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Our resolution of the proper construction of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A) and (B) (ii) is guided by well established principles. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Id.; <em>Carpenteri-Waddington, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>sioner of Revenue Services, </em>231 Conn. 355, 362, 650 A.2d 147 (1994); <em>United Eluminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755-56, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992). . . . <em>Bortner v. Woodbridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 258-59, 736 A.2d 104 (1999) .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Fleet National Bank, </em>252 Conn. 1, 11, 742 A.2d 293 (2000) .</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In this case, the word \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d as used in the relevant statutes, certainly is a term broad enough to include forcible fellatio. Further support for such a construction may be found in the legislative history of that provision when it was enacted in 1993. Before that provision was enacted, \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A) defined the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to include, \u201cin addition to accidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred, an injury to an employee which is causally connected with his employment and is the direct result of repetitive trauma or repetitive acts incident to such employment, and occupational disease.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A). Only the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d as \u201caccidental injury\u201d is relevant in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The text of subdivision (16) (B) (ii) of \u00a7 31-275 does not purport to repeal subdivision (16) (A) in its entirety. In relevant part, the portion of the 1993 public act that eventually was codified as \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) provides that \u201c \u2018[pjersonal injury\u2019 or \u2018injury\u2019 shall not be construed to include . . . (ii) A mental or emotional impairment, <em>unless such impairment arises from a physical injury or occupational disease . </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">In the course of the legislative debates concerning the enactment of the bill that subsequently was codified as \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), the members of the House of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Representatives discussed the meaning of this provision. Representative Michael P. Lawlor was the proponent of the bill. In the course of debate, Representative Lawlor was asked whether the bill would preclude workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a correction officer who was able to subdue a prisoner who had tried to assault her sexually, and thus had suffered no bodily harm, but who subsequently suffered emotional distress. 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18, 1993 Sess., pp. 6153-54. He replied that, because the correction officer had been \u201ctouched and physically assaulted . . . that is an injury and she may be compensated . . . .\u201d Id., p. 6155. This legislative history strongly supports the defendant\u2019s claim that, under the facts of this case, the exclusivity rule applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF A COMMON-LAW TORT ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The language of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), read in the light of its legislative history, strongly supports the defendant\u2019s claim that, because the plaintiffs emotional impairment \u201carises from a physical injury,\u201d she is entitled only to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Nonetheless, the plaintiff makes four arguments in support of her claim that she is entitled to pursue a common-law tort action against the defendant. We find none of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The plaintiff first argues that the term \u201cphysical injury\u201d is an undefined term under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and, therefore, is a term that requires judicial definition. The plaintiffs claim cannot be sustained in light of the definition contained in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A). The facts alleged in the plaintiffs complaint; see footnote 8 of this opinion; readily fall within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>following language of that provision: \u201c \u2018Personal injury\u2019 or \u2018injury\u2019 includes . . . [an] accidental injury which may be definitely located as to the time when and the place where the accident occurred . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A). As the defendant aptly observes, this provision focuses on the fact of injury, and not on its nature. The physical iryury to the plaintiff was the sexual assault perpetrated by Popielarczyk. Except as specified, \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) does not purport to override the definition contained in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A). As previously noted, \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) excludes from the term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or \u201cinjury\u201d only \u201c [a] mental or emotional impairment, unless such impairment arises from a physical injury or occupational disease . . . The term cannot, therefore, be said to be undefined statutorily, and in need of judicial definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We find equally unpersuasive the plaintiffs second argument, namely, that \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) compels a construction of \u201cphysical injury\u201d as an injury that is manifested by \u201cphysical trauma.\u201d The plaintiff asks us to define \u201cphysical trauma\u201d so as to exclude minor physical symptoms, except in cases in which such physical symptoms \u201crise to the level of a heart attack or exposure to a contagious disease.\u201d Even if we were to agree with the proposition that forcible fellatio is not, per se, a \u201cphysical trauma,\u201d which we do not, our case law is to the contrary. The plaintiffs proposed definition is consistent with the specific holding of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 700, wherein we held that, \u201c[f]or purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law, the [physical] injury suffered by the claimant is the exposure to potentially fatal contagious diseases. That injury is no less real or cognizable because it was not attended by puncture or abrasion.\u201d On a broader level, however, <em>Doe </em>reflects our judicial philosophy of construing access to workers\u2019 compensation benefits as broadly as the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>will permit. <em>Doe </em>decided a claim for workers\u2019 compensation, not a claim for common-law tort damages. Moreover, <em>Doe </em>relied on the definition of personal injury in \u00a7 31-275 (16) (A), a definition the relevance of which the plaintiff in this case has disavowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><em>Biasetti </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 65, 735 A.2d 321 (1999), is not to the contrary. In <em>Biasetti, </em>we decided that, under the facts of that case, posttraumatic stress disorder, a mental impairment, was not compensable under \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) of the workers\u2019 compensation act. The dispositive facts were that \u201cthe [plaintiff], while working for the [defendant] in his capacity as a police officer, was involved in a high-speed pursuit. The pursuit came to an end in the [t]own of Fairfield, Connecticut, and a gun battle [ensued].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 68. Although the plaintiff was not wounded in the gun battle, he subsequently \u201csuffered from headaches, upset stomach, a pressure sensation in his right calf and upper leg, and [posttraumatic stress disorder].\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">We concluded in <em>Biasetti </em>that, although the plaintiffs posttraumatic stress disorder was, for a police officer, an occupational disease, as that term is defined in \u00a7 31-275 (15), his eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation benefits could not survive the enactment of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii). Id., 73. By enacting \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii), the legislature had manifested its intent to exclude from workers\u2019 compensation coverage \u201cany occupational disease that does not have a physical component.\u201d Id., 75. We found dispositive the fact that \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii) \u201cincludes within the definition of \u2018personal injury\u2019 an emotional impairment that <em>arises from or is caused by </em>a physical injury or occupational disease.\u201d (Emphasis altered.) Id., 79. That definition, we held, does not \u201cextend coverage to an emotional impairment which itself is an occupational disease. To conclude otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>would be to ignore the causation requirement encompassed within the term \u2018arises.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The facts of this case distinguish it from <em>Biasetti. </em>The plaintiff herein was, at the very least, physically manhandled by Popielarczyk. When he forced her to perform fellatio, he subjected her to an invasive physical contact. The plaintiffs emotional distress, as alleged in her own complaint, arose from or was caused by a physical injury. See footnote 8 of this opinion. Therefore, unlike the plaintiff in <em>Biasetti, </em>the plaintiff in the present case cannot escape from workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In addition to these textual arguments, the plaintiff argues that Black\u2019s Law Dictionary supports her definition of \u201cphysical injury\u201d as \u201cphysical trauma.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) defines \u201cphysical injury\u201d as \u201cbodily harm or hurt, excluding mental distress, fright or emotional disturbance.\u201d This argument, too, is unavailing. First, a dictionary definition cannot displace a legislative definition. Second, even if we were to overlook this principle of appellate adjudication, the definition contained in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, by its own terms, lends little support for the plaintiffs assertion that \u201cphysical injury\u201d excludes \u201cminor physical symptoms that do not rise to the level of a heart attack or exposure to a contagious disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Fourth, in the plaintiffs reply brief, she argues, for the first time, that she is entitled to pursue her tort action because workers\u2019 compensation \u201cneither adequately recompenses [her] for the injuries she has suffered nor deters [employer] conduct with regard to how [employers] safeguard their employees.\u201d Procedurally, it is improper to raise a new argument in a reply brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>because doing so deprives the opposing party of the opportunity to respond in writing. Substantively, it is an essential part of the workers\u2019 compensation bargain that an employee, even one who has suffered such an offensive injury, relinquishes his or her potentially large common-law tort damages in exchange for relatively quick and certain compensation. See <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 196 Conn. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In conclusion, we hold that none of the plaintiffs arguments can overcome the persuasive power of the legislative history of the enactment of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii). As previously noted, the proponent of the legislation, Representative Lawlor, expressly stated that mental anguish resulting from a sexual assault \u201cwould be compensable under workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d 36 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 6215.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Representative Lawlor\u2019s subsequent statement that a sexual assault is a \u201cphysical injury\u201d for the purposes of workers\u2019 compensation; id., p. 6155; gives us cogent guidance for the proper construction of \u00a7 31-275 (16) (B) (ii). Under well established principles of statutory construction, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ...
