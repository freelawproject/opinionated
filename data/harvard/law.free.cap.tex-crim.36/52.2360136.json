The information alleges that the appellant carried \u201cbrass knuckles.\u201d The proof left it in doubt as to whether the knuckles were made of brass or some other metal. The proof supporting the information shows, however, that it was made of a metal. This court judicially knows that \u201cbrass knuckles\u201d maybe composed of metal other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>than brass, as steel, iron, etc.; and, when the information charges \u201cbrass knuckles,\u201d it is equivalent to an allegation that they were made of metal or a hard substance. It is not an allegation charging that the knuckles were made of the' metal known as \u201cbrass.\u201d This proposition is settled in Harris v. State, 22 Tex. Crim. App., 677. The court instructed the jury that \u201cbrass knuckles\u201d meant knuckles made of any metal or hard substance. We so held in the case above cited. There is no variance or failure of proof in this case. It was not necessary to prove that the knuckles were made of the metal known as \u201cbrass,\u201d and there was no error in the charge of the court. The statute does not read that, if any person shall carry, on or about his person, \u201cbrass knuckles,\u201d or \u201cknuckles made of metal or some other hard substance,\u201d thus drawing a distinction \u2022between brass knuckles and knuckles made of some other metal. If this had been the reading of the statute, the State would have been required to prove that the knuckles were composed of brass. The judgment is \u2022affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
