The only questions necessary to be considered in this ease are those raised on the indictment. The indictment, in the charging part, is as follows, to-wit: \u201cThat James Cravey * * * did then and there, with implied malice, kill Rafael Crane, by shooting him, the said Rafael Crane, with a pistol.\u201d The statute defines murder as follows: \u201cEvery person with a sound memory and discretion, who shall unlawfully kill any reasonable creature in being within this State, with malice aforethought, either express or implied, shall be deemed guilty of murder.\u201d Penal Code, Art. 605. From this definition, it is absolutely necessary, to constitute murder, that the killing be with malice aforethought. This is so whether it be murder of the first or second degree. Malice aforethought is a necessary element to either degree. The first question presented is whether \u201cmalice\u201d means precisely the same thing as \u201cmalice aforethought.\u201d If it does, then the indictment is sufficient. There is a well-settled rule of pleading in criminal cases\u2014that the indictment must use the language of the statute, or language of similar or greater import than used by the statute. The language used by the statute is \u201cmalice aforethought.\u201d We have, in the indictment, \u201cimplied malice.\u201d There is nothing which stands for \u201caforethought.\u201d The \u201cmalice\u201d in the indictment and .that in the statute, of course, mean the same thing, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>indictment contains no word for \u201caforethought.\u201d Hence, in order to sustain the indictment, we have to treat \u201caforethought\u201d as a word without any meaning. Mr. Bishop, upon this subject, says that the meaning of these words is not precisely the same. The effect or meaning of the word \u201caforethought,\u201d in this phrase, indicates a greater degree of wickedness than \u201cmalice\u201d simply. His language is as follows: \u201cIn opinions of courts, and other law writings, we frequently meet with language from which \u2018malice\u2019 alone would seem to signify the same thing as \u2018malice aforethought,\u2019 but apparently the better use assigned to the former (malice) a meaning somewhat less intense in wickedness than in the latter.\u201d 1 Bishop\u2019s New Crim. Law, Art. 429. When we go to the precedents upon this subject, we find that in all cases of indictment for murder the phrase \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d is used. Mr. Wharton, upon this subject, says, \u201cIt is necessary to state that the act by which the death was occasioned was done feloniously, and especially that it was done of malice aforethought, which, as we have already seen, is the great characteristic of the crime of murder.\u201d Whar. on Horn., \u00a7 807. The same form is \u00a1prescribed for indictment for murder \"by Archbold. See, 1 Archb. Pl. <em>&amp; </em>Prac., pp. 784-785. We are not aware of any authority at common law holding that an indictment would be sufficient for murder which omitted to allege that the killing was done with malice aforethought. In some States it is held unnecessary. These opinions depend largely upon statutes. In this State the question is settled from another standpoint. We quote from Judge Willson: \u201c \u2018Malice aforethought\u2019 are technical words, for which, in an indictment for murder, there can be no equivalents or substitutes. They constitute an essential part of the definition of murder, both at common law and in our statute. Where the homicide is committed without \u2018malice aforethought,\u2019 either express or implied, it is not murder. At common law it has always been held essential to use these words in an indictment for murder, and upon this point the common law authorities and precedents are unanimous. 1 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Proc., 335; 2 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Proc; 544; 1 Archb. Pl. and Prac., pp. 784-785; Whar. Crim. Law, 8th Ed., 518; 1 Whar. Prec. Ind. 114h; 2 Hale, P. C., 186-187; Whar. on Hom., Sec. 807. Such, also, is the doctrine held by our own courts. McCoy v. State, 25 Texas, 33; Tooney v. State, 5 Tex. Crim. App., 183.\u201d See, McElroy v. State, 14 Tex. Crim. App., 236. \u201cMalice,\u201d by writers, is frequently used as synonymous with \u201cmalice aforethought.\u201d This will be met with in charges to juries, and in textbooks. We are not holding that it is necessary, in defining \u201cmalice aforethought,\u201d in the charge, for the court to say \u201cmalice aforethought.\u201d The indictment having charged malice aforethought, the charge of the court, defining \u201cexpress malice,\u201d and, in a proper case, also \u201cimplied malice,\u201d is sufficiently responsive to the allegation in the indictment, \u201cmalice aforethought,\u201d and it is not necessary to reiterate this term in the charge of the court. We close this case with the following remarks of Judge Willson, in the case of McElroy v. State, 14 Tex. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Crim. App., 237, as follows: \u201cIt is indeed strange that the pleader should have omitted from the indictment these essential words. He certainly consulted no precedent, and did not even have reference to the statutory definition of murder; for, if he had taken this trouble, he could not have failed to discover the necessity of these words. In place of these, he has incumbered the indictment with other words, which could and should have been omitted, because wholly useless in charging this offense. If those whose duty it is to prepare indictments would exercise a reasonable amount of care, and occasionally, at least, consult the law as to the requisites of an indictment, and frame their indictments with reference to the statutory definitions of offenses, it would save the country from much trouble and expense, and aid greatly in the speedy and effectual enforcement of the criminal law. We do not make these remarks with reference to this case alone, for it is by no means an isolated or unusual case, in this particular. This court is compelled almost daily to set aside convictions because of the carelessness of prosecuting officers in the preparation of indictments. Such palpable and fatal mistakes as the one before us are of such frequent occurrence that we have deemed it proper to call attention to the evil, with the hope that District and County Attorneys will reflect upon the consequences which result from defective indictments, and bestow more thought and attention upon the preparation of them.\u201d The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\n<em>Reversed and Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
