An indictment for burglary, which described the house as \u201coccupied S.,\u201d instead of \u201coccupied by S.,\u201d is fatally defective in omitting the essential word \u201cby\u201d between the words \u201coccupied\u201d and the name of the occupant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b133-12\">Appeal from the District Court of Atascosa.

Omitting the preceding portions of the indictment, it is averred that appellant \u201cdid then and there unlawfully, by force, threats and fraud, break and enter a house there situated, and occupied Wm. Stonell, without the consent of the said Wm. Stonell,\u201d etc. The sufficiency of this indictment was attacked in the lower court, by motion in arrest of judgment, because it failed to aver that the house was occupied \u201cby\u201d William Stonell. \u25a0 The contention is based upon the omission of the word \u201cby\u201d between the word \u201coccupied\u201d and the name \u201cWm. Stonell.\u201d In cases of burglary, it is necessary to allege the occupancy by some one, of the house broken into; and, unless this has been done, this offense is not averred. Words which are necessary to allege such occupancy, are essential to the certainty necessary in the description of the offense. Such words cannot be supplied by intendment; and, this being so, it necessarily follows that their omission would be fatal to-the indictment. Such has been the uniform rule of decision in this State. In State v. Daugherty, 30 Texas, 360, it was held that \u201cwhere an indictment omits a material word, although it be but a preposition or a helping verb, the court will not, from its knowledge of the language, supply the missing word, so as to supply the probable intention of the grand jury.\u201d In Jones v. State, 21 Tex. Crim. App., 349, it was held that the omitted preposition \u201cto,\u201d preceding \u201ckill and murder,\u201d was fatal to an indictment charging the offense of assault with intent to murder. See, State v. Hutchinson, 26 Texas, 111; Ewing v. State, 1 Tex. Crim. App., 362; Sparks v. State, 35 Texas, 349; Edmonson v. State, 41 Texas, 496; Moore v. State, 7 Tex. Crim. App., 42; State v. Huston, 12 Texas, 245; State v. Toney, 13 Texas, 74; Thompson v. State, 15 Tex. Crim. App., 39, 168. Under this line of authorities, the judgment in this case is reversed, and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\n<em>Reversed and Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
