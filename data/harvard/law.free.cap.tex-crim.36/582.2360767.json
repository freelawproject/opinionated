Gabrielsky v. State, 13 Tex. Crim. App., 428; Turner v. State, 30 Tex. Crim. App., 691. The allegations are that appellant had seen persons bet or wager at a gaming table or bank, kept or exhibited, etc.; that he had bet or wagered at a gaming table or bank, kept or exhibited, etc., and that he had seen Love keep or exhibit a gaming table or bank for gaming; etc. There is a distinction between a gaming table and a bank, and between keeping and exhibiting either, and to allege one \u201cor\u201d the other is not to allege the truth of the matter on which the perjury is assigned. Webb v. State, 17 Tex. Crim. App., 205; Will. Ann. C. C., Sec. 589.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b599-11\">2. The last three assignments are insufficient, because in assigning the matter as perjury, and in setting out the truth of such matter, it does not appear from the allegations in the indictment who were the persons appellant had seen bet or wager at a game of \u201ccraps,\u201d or at \u201cmonte,\u201d or at a game with cards in the building alleged to be an outhouse, nor when he had seen them bet or wager.

The fifth assignment is also insufficient, (a) Because there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>no such game as one played with cards called \u201cmonte,\u201d and consequently it was a matter the grand jury did not have jurisdiction to inquire about.

The charge of the court should have been con-' fined to the case as made by the indictment in so far as it charged an offense, and in plain and intelligible words. If one or more of the assignments were bad and one or more good, the bad assignments would be rejected as surplusage (Henderson v. State, 2 Tex. Crim. App., 88), and the indictment sustained for the good assignment or assignments. The assignment or assignments rejected would not be the case, or a part of it, made by the pleadings, and to authorize a conviction on such assignment or assignments would be to authorize a conviction for a false statement not 'assigned as perjury.

P. Willson, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmQ\">On his appeal, as the principal reasons why the judgment of the trial court should be set aside, appellant insisted: (1) That the indictment was bad. (2) That, if it was not wholly bad, some of its assignments of perjury were bad; and (3) That if any one of the assignments was bad, it was error in the trial court to authorize the jury to convict appellant on such bad assignment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-9\">In the opinion affirming the judgment of the trial court, this honorable Court of Criminal Appeals, in holding the first three assignments in the indictment to be good, seem to have mistaken the objection made by appellant to the sufficiency of those assignments. That objection was not that the charging part of the indictment was insufficient as to those assignments, but it was that the truth of the matters charged as perjury was not set out in the indictment. The indictment charged that it was a material inquiry before the grand jury whether appellant had bet or wagered at a gaming table or bank kept or exhibited, etc.; that he falsely swore that he had not bet or wagered at a gaming table or bank kept or exhibited, etc. Appellant admits that the charge so made was sufficient. But on the authority of the Gabrielsky case, 13 Tex. Crim. App., 428, and the Turner case 30 Tex. Crim. App., 691, he insists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>that those assignments ave insufficient in that the truth of the matter charged in them is not set out in the indictment. The allegation in the indictment attempting to set out the truth of the matter is: \u201cWhereas, in truth and in fact\u201d appellant had bet or wagered \u201cat a gaming table or bank kept or exhibited,\u201d etc. In law a gaming table and a bank are not the same thing. Webb v. State 17 Tex. Crim. App., 205. Nor is it the same thing to keep and exhibit one \u00f3r the other. Willson\u2019s Grim. Stat., \u00a7 589. If this is true then the indictment did not set out the truth of the matter charged as perjury To say that the truth of a matter is this, or it is that, is not to allege which it is. If it was one or the other, the allegation should have shown which one it was. If it was both, the allegation should have been that it was both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b601-4\">If there was a bad assignment in the indictment it should have been treated as surplusage. \u2019 It would be rejected from the indictment. It would be no part of the indictment. Henderson v. State, 2 Tex. Crim. App., 88. It would not be a part of the State\u2019s case as made by the allegations of the indictment. If this is true then the court should not submit it as a part of the State\u2019s case and authorize the jury to convict on it. To charge upon a part of an indictment rejected as surplusage is not charging the \u201claw applicable to the case.\u201d Code Crim. Proc., 1895, Art. 715. It is not conforming the charge to and limiting it by the allegations. Willson\u2019s Ann. Code Crim. Proc., \u00a7 2336. But is charging upon a case not before the court for trial. Donahoe v. State, 14 Tex. Crim. App., 643. If the assignments of perjury had never been made a part of the indictment and the court with evidence before it admitted without objection tending to sustain a charge of perjury on the matters covered by them, had charged the jury they might convict on such matters, it would not be contended for a minute that the charge was not error. Why is the rule different when the attempt is ineffectually made to make such assignments a part of the indictment? If they are bad they are rejected as surplusage, and the indictment is sustained for its good assignments. If the court in its charge limits the jury to the good . assignments, a general verdict finding the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment will be referred to the good assignments and their finding sustained. To hold that when the court submits in its charge good and bad assignments of perjury and the jury returns a general verdict, their verdict will be referred to the good assignments, seems to me to be relieving the court of the obligation placed on him by the statute to charge the law applicable to the case, and to throw upon the jury the duty of determining the good and bad assignments in an indictment for perjury.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b601-5\">HURT, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">Appellant was convicted of perjury; hence this appeal. There are six distinct assignments in the indictment on which the perjury is predicated, as follows: (1) \u201cIt then and there became a material inquiry before the said grand jury, and necessary for ' the due administration of the criminal laws of said State, whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>said John Fry had seen any person bet or wager at a gaming table or bank, kept or exhibited for the purpose of gaming, in Jim Love\u2019s room, in the town of Jacksonville, in the said county and State, within two-years before the said 11th day of December, 1893.\u201d (2) \u201cWhether the said John Fry had bet or wagered at a gaming table or bank, kept or exhibited for the purpose of gaming, in Jim Love\u2019s room, in said town of Jacksonville, in said county and State,\u201d etc. (3) \u201cWhether the said John Fry had seen Jim Love keep or exhibit a table or bank, for the purpose of gaming, in the said Jim Love\u2019s room, in the said town of Jacksonville, in said county and State, at any time,\u201d etc. (4) \u201cWhether the said John Fry had seen any person bet or wager at a game then and there played with dice, called \u2018craps,\u2019 in the said Jim Love\u2019s room, in the town of Jacksonville, in the said Cherokee County; * * * said room not then and there being a private residence.\u201d (5) \u201cWhether the said John Fry had seen any persons bet or wager at a game with cards called \u2018monte\u2019 in the said Jim Love\u2019s room,\u201d etc. (6) \u201cWhether the said John Fry had seen any person playing at a game-with cards in said Jim Love\u2019s room, in the said town of Jacksonville, in said county and State, at any time within two years,\u201d etc.; \u201csaid room then and there being an outhouse, where people did then and there-resort for the purpose of gaming.\u201d There was no motion made to quash the indictment, or any assignment of perjury therein contained. However, a motion in arrest of judgment was made, the grounds of the motion being'as follows: (1) \u201cBecause it does not appear from the face' of the indictment that an offense against the law was committed by the-defendant;\u201d and (2) \u201cbecause the offense attempted to be charged in said indictment is' not set forth in plain and intelligible words.\u201d ' In the brief' of counsel for the appellant, objections were made to all of the assign-\u25a0 ments of perjury. We pretermit any expression of opinion as to the sufficiency of the last three counts in the indictment, and the testimony supporting the same. We will now consider whether the first three- \u2022 counts are sufficient. The indictment charged that it was necessary and material to know whether \u201cJohn Fry (appellant) had seen any person bet or wager at a gaming table or bank, kept or exhibited for the purpose of gaming,\u201d1 etc. This allegation is objected to upon the ground that it is in the alternative. Appellant swore that he had not seen any person bet or wager at a gaming table or bank, kept or exhibited for the. purpose of gaming, in Jim Love\u2019s room, in the town of Jacksonville.. If this statement was false and deliberately made, it was perjury. It is not necessary, in order for it to be perjury, that the witness (appellant) should have stated that he had not seen any person wager at a gaming-table, etc., or that he had not seen any person bet at a gaming table, etc. When he swore that he had not seen any person bet or wager at a gaming table or bank, he denied as emphatically that he had seen any person bet or wager as if each had been denied separately and distinctly from the other. These observations apply to \u201ctable or bank,\u201d as well as to \u201ckeeping or exhibiting.\u201d It is true that, in charging an act in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>indictment, the charge must not be in the alternative, but we know of no case or law which would require this rule to be applied in setting forth the statement assigned for perjury. The indictment should set forth what the witness swore substantially as he testified, and if the statement assigned for perjury be material, and was wilfully and knowingly made, it is perjury, whether the statement be in the conjunctive or disjunctive form. We are of opinion that the first three assignments of perjury are sufficient. The question then arises, as there may be three defective assignments of perjury with the three good assignments, whether a general verdict can be sustained. It will be borne in mind that there was no motion to quash either assignment, nor was there any objection urged to evidence tending to support the assignments which are claimed to be defective. Under this state of case, what is the law? Mr. Bishop, in his New Crim. Proc. (Vol. 1, \u00a7 1015, Subdiv. 2), says: \u201cOn a bad count, mingled with good ones, the court has no right to receive evidence against the defendant\u2019s objections. Properly, the ill count should be quashed. If it is not, and the court refuses to exclude evidence applicable only to it, and does not direct the verdict to be limited to the good counts, a general finding of guilty will be set aside.\u201d Subdivision 4 \u201cIf good and bad counts appear together at the sentence, or, on error, all have been treated at the trial as good, and no objection to evidence having been saved, the Case is the same as when any other incompetent evidence was introduced with the defendant\u2019s tacit consent. He cannot now complain of it, but can object to being sentenced on a bad count, 'as is cls\u00e9where shown. Still, treating the bad count as surplusage, he may be sentenced oil the good counts. Moreover, a general sentence on good and bad counts is riot reversible on a motion in arrest of judgment or on' error, if sustained by the good ones.\u201d This court has recognized this doctrine in a number of cases. See, Shuman v. State, 34 Tex. Crim. Rep., 69; English v. State, 29 Tex. Crim. App., 174, and authorities cited. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><em>ON </em>MOTION <em>FOB </em>REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b603-5\">HURT, Presiding Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AB_\">In the opinion in this case, we held the first three assignments of perjury in the \u25a0 indictment good. We were laboring under a misapprehension of the contention of appellant in regard to these'assignments. The first assignment is based upon the testimony given before the grand jury, that appellant had not seen Jim Love exhibit or keep a table or bank for the purposes of gaming, etc. This is alleged to be material, and was material. The indictment charges that, \u201cwhereas, in truth and in fact, the said John Fry (appellant) had seen the said Jim Love keep and exhibit a gaming table or bank for the purposes of gaming,\u201d, etc. The defect in this assignment consists in alleging this matter in'the-alternative.- It is not al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>leged that he did see Love keep and exhibit a gaming table, nor is it alleged that appellant saw Love keep and exhibit a bank; but it is alleged that appellant saw Love keep and exhibit one \u201cor\u201d the other\u2014a gaming-table \u201cor\u201d bank. Now, if a gaming table and bank are the same thing, this allegation is sufficient. But, if there be a difference between a gaming table and a bank, then it is insufficient. Is there a difference? We think there is. See, Webb v. State, 17 Tex. Crim. App., 205. These observations apply with equal force to the second and third assignments of perjury. However, there is a good assignment for perjury, to-wit', that pertaining to monte. The indictment charges that it \u201cbecame and was a material inquiry, before said grand jury, * * * whether the said John Fry (appellant) had seen any person bet or wager at a game played with cards, called \u2018monte.\u2019 \u201d The indictment alleged that appellant testified, before said grand jury, that he had not seen any person bet or wager at a game played with cards, called \u201cmonte.\u201d The closing words of this assignment in the indictment are as follows: \u201cWhereas, in truth and in fact, the said John Fry had seen persons bet or wager at a. game played with cards, called \u2018monte,\u2019 \u201d etc. The objection to this assignment is that there was no such game played with cards as monte, and therefore this was immaterial matter; that monte is a banking game, and is not known as a \u201cgame played with cards.\u201d We do not agree with this contention. The game of monte, although a banking game, is a game played with cards; and it is a game where the players bet on certain cards of a layout, and win or lose according as others drawn from the pack do or do not match with these. As above stated, this assignment is good, and was amply sustained by the evidence on the trial. As was said in the original opinion, \u201cthere was no motion made to quash the indictment or any assignment of perjury therein contained,\u201d and there was no objection to testimony introduced to support any assignment. The court was not requested- to confine the jury to this good assignment, or any particular assignment. This matter was first brought forward in the motion in arrest of judgment. We adhere to the rule, stated by Mr. Bishop, which is given in the original opinion in this case. There being a good assignment in the indictment, and the evidence in the record supporting that good assignment, although there is evidence tending to support the bad assignments, they will be treated as surplusage, and the case will be considered as if testimony had been admitted on the good assignment not pertinent - thereto, which could have been excluded, but was not objected to. This, as we understand it, is the rule laid down by Mr. Bishop; and it appears to us to be a sound and logical rule. If the defendant chose not to make any motion to quash the indictment, or any of the particular assignments, and not to object to the introduction of evidence, notwithstanding the bad counts or assignments in the indictment, yet, if there is a good count or assignment, and the testimony supports it, the verdict will be applied to such good count or assignment; and it will make no difference in this regard if the court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>have charged on the bad counts or assignments as well as on the good one. Where the question is raised for the first time on motion in arrest of judgment, the verdict of the jury, where the evidence supports it, will be applied to the good count or assignment, and the judgment upheld. See, 1 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Proc., \u00a7 1015, Subdiv. 2.
