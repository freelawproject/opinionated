The punishment was fixed at a fine of \u00a725, and twenty days\u2019 imprisonment in the county jail. From this conviction he prosecutes this appeal. The sufficiency of the evidence to support this conviction is called in question. The alleged purchaser, Brown, testified that he bought two pint flask bottles of \u201cPreston\u2019s Tolu\u201d from the appellant; \u201cthat he drank a good deal of it, but did not feel it. It had no influence on him. I do not know whether it would intoxicate or not. It did not intoxicate me. * * * I never saw any of it sold anywhere except in local option districts. The defendant had run a saloon and sold whiskey at Wayne until local option went into effect, and after that he continued in business and sold Tolu.\u201d Heath testified for the State that he took a drink from one of the flasks bought by Brown. \u201cIt tasted like ginger and water sweetened. I do not know whether it would intoxicate or not. Saw a great deal of it down around Wayne, and would see people drunk, but do not know that they got drunk on it. It was labeled \u2018Preston\u2019s Tolu.\u2019 It was put up at Jefferson, and claimed to be a tonic. I never saw any of it sold out of local option districts. I cannot say that it is intoxicating.\u201d The State also introduced the witnesses, Surrat and Sheffield; and Surrat testified that he had bought three bottles of \u201cSedberry <em>&amp; </em>Taylor\u2019s Tolu\u201d at Linden; and Sheffield testified that several years ago he lived at Lodi, in Marion County, and saw a good deal of Sedberry <em>&amp; </em>Taylor\u2019s Tolu sold and drunk in that neighborhood and county, and the effect of this Tolu upon the system was about the same as whiskey. All of these witnesses agreed in their testimony as to the effect that Sedberry <em>&amp; </em>Taylor\u2019s Tolu was intoxicating. It will be ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>served that there is no evidence in this case showing that the tolu known as 1 \u2018Preston\u2019s Tolu\u201d had any intoxicating liquor in it. There were but two witnesses in regard to this preparation of tolu, and both of them stated that, so far as they knew, it was n\u00f3t intoxicating. As to the fact that it was sold by a man who was formerly a saloon keeper, and sold in a local option precinct, this is hardly sufficient evidence to indicate that Preston\u2019s Tolu was an intoxicant. We do not think, even if was legitimate evidence, that the fact that in previous years Sedberry <em>&amp; </em>Taylor-prepared and sold a tolu that was intoxicating, was evidence tending to show that Preston\u2019s Tolu was intoxicating. There is nothing to show in this regard that Preston\u2019s Tolu and Sedberry &amp; Taylor\u2019s Tolu contained the same ingredients. The fact that Sedberry <em>&amp; </em>Taylor made a tolu that was intoxicating did not tend to show or throw any light on the question whether Preston\u2019s Tolu was intoxicating, and we do not believe the testimony was legitimate, and it should have been excluded. This evidence was excepted to, and exceptions reserved by appellant. For the reason indicated, the judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Hurt, Presiding Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
