Former Jeopardy\u2014Discharge of Jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b640-11\">After all the evidence in the case had been submitted to the jury, about 13 o\u2019clock at night the sheriff reported to the judge, at his private apartments, that the wife of one of the jurors was taken suddenly sick and not expected to live; whereupon, the judge instructed the sheriff to discharge the juror, which was done, and he went home; all of which was without the knowledge or consent of defendant or his counsel. The next morning, when apprised of the action of the court, they refused to proceed in the trial with eleven jurors; whereupon the court, over the protest of defendant, discharged the jury and continued the case to the next term, defendant properly excepting to this action at that time. At the next term, defendant pleaded these facts as former jeopardy, and the plea was overruled. Held: Error, and that the defendant had been placed in former jeopardy, and was entitled to his discharge.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b640-12\">Appeal from the District Court of McLennan.

On the 2nd day of May, 1895, the case was called for trial, a jury was duly selected, empaneled and sworn to try the cause, and appellant entered his plea of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d The State introduced its evidence and rested; after which, it being adjourning hour, the court put the jury in charge of an officer for the night, and took recess until next morning. During the night, and before the morning of the 3rd of May, Jesse Abbott, one of the jurors selected to try the case, sent word to the court by the sheriff in charge of said jury, that his (Abbott\u2019s) wife was sick and had sent for him, and he (Abbott) asked to be excused from further service on the jury. The court, acting on this message, without the consent of either the defendant or his counsel, or even their knowledge, and in their absence out of court, and in the absence of the jury, directed the sheriff to discharge said juror, Abbott, which was done.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-15\">When court convened the next morning, the defendant was told for the first time of the action of the court in the discharge of the juror, and when the defendant insisted upon his right to be tried by a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>jury, the court discharged the rest of the jury over the protest of the defendant, and without his consent, and continued the cause, to which defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-3\">On October 12th, 1896, this cause was again called for trial. Defendant filed and presented his plea of former jeopardy. The State filed a motion to strike out said plea, which the court overruled. The court, however, refused to sustain said plea of former jeopardy, but stated that he would submit same to the jury, to which defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-4\">At the second trial, with regard to defendant\u2019s plea of former jeopardy, the evidence introduced, was substantially as follows: Mr. Garrett, the messenger who came for j uror, Abbott, stated that. Abbott\u2019s little girl came over to where he was in his cotton patch, and asked him to go for Abbott and bring him home. He took his wife over to Abbott\u2019s house; did not go in himself, but came directly to Waco and went to the courthouse, where he met the sheriff, and told him, the sheriff, to tell Abbott his wife had sent for him to come home at once, as \u201cshe was down.\u201d On cross-examination, he stated that Abbott\u2019s little girl asked him to bring his wife to their house and go for Mr. Abbott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-6\">Dr. Harn, a physician who waited on Abbott\u2019s wife, stated that Mrs. Abbott had been confined on the 21st of April, 1895, and was doing well; that he was called in on the morning of May 3rd, 1895, and found her suffering with puerperal malaria fever, but was not dangerously ill. He went to see her, at that time, twice only. The disease with which she was suffering, he said, is considered dangerous, yet Mrs. Abbott\u2019s attack was not serious when he arrived; there were no neighbors present while he was there. The court asked Dr. Harn, was it, in his opinion, necessary that her husband be present, to which he replied, yes; and on cross-examination on this point, in reply to a question by defendant, whether it, in his opinion, was necessary for the welfare of the patient that her husband be present, provided she had with her some good female nurse, the doctor stated the following: \u201cIt would have been a benefit mentally to her; I mean it would have been a relief to the patient. There was nothing dangerous about the attack.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-8\">Judge S. R. Scott, who tried the case, asked to be sworn, and stated in substance, that he was aroused by Deputy Sheriff Reed about 12 or 1 o\u2019clock on the night of May 2nd, who told him that Mr. Abbott, one of the jurors in this case, had a message that his wife was about to die, and was not expected to live until morning. He stated that he inquired of the deputy if he knew that the man who brought the message was reliable, to which the deputy replied, that he did. * \u201cI then,\u201d stated the court, \u201ctold him to go back and release the juror. I was satisfied the woman was sick.\u201d On cross-examination, the court stated \u201cthat he was boarding about nine blocks from the court house. He did not see the messenger, jury, defendant or counsel; that this was the same defendant and same case then on trial, under the same indictment, which is a valid one; the defendant was not present when he told the sheriff to discharge the juror.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>It was admitted by the court and County Attorney, that the defendant, Upchurch, is the same man who was placed on trial in this cause on May 2nd, 1895; that he is now put on trial under the same indictment as he was then put on trial.

The action of the trial court in discharging juror, Jesse Abbott, upon receipt of information that his wife was sick and would probably die before morning, and subsequently discharging the entire panel, thereby making mistrial of the cause, is amply supported by Art. 737, Code Crim. Proc., which provides, \u201cIf after the retirement of the jury in a felony case, any one of them becomes so sick as to prevent the continuance of his duty, or any accident or circumstance occur to prevent their being kept together, the jury may be discharged.\u201d See, Ellison v.

Appellant objects because he was not present and did not consent to the discharge of said juror. The rule that he must be present and consent to the discharge is not arbitrarily applied to all times and conditions, as it only applies to express waiver by defendant. Contingencies may arise in which the law enters the waiver for him, that is, so far as he might object to again being placed upon trial, for instance, the sickness or death of the judge or a juror pending trial. The necessities of such case forces a mistrial by operation of law. 1 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Law, Sec. 1032; 1 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Proc., \u00a7 272; 44 Kan., 75.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b644-5\">HENDERSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A8TH\">Appellant was convicted of murder in the second degree, and given ten years in the penitentiary; hence this appeal. On the trial of the case, appellant interposed a plea of former jeopardy. The plea set out that the case against this defendant had been tried at a former term of the court; that pending the trial, and after all the evidence for the State had been introduced, and the court had adjourned over night, the wife of one of the jurors was reported to be very ill, the report being made to the sheriff. At about 12 o\u2019clock of that night, the sheriff reported the fact, as communicated to him by a neighbor of the juror, Jesse Abbott, that the wife of said Abbott was taken suddenly sick, and not expected to live, said report being made to the judge at his room, some distance from the court house; whereupon the court directed the sheriff to discharge said juror, Jesse Abbott, and permit him to go home to his wife, which was accordingly done. In the morning, when court was opened, but eleven of the jurors appeared, de- . fendant and his counsel being present, and ready to proceed with the trial. The defendant and his counsel for the first time were then apprised of the action of the judge in discharging said juror. They stated that they were unwilling to proceed without a full jury, and the court then proceeded to, and did, discharge the rest of the jury# on its own motion, over the protest of the defendant, and continued said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\u2022ease until the next regular term of the court. This action of the court was properly excepted to at the time. This plea was in propria forma. On the trial of the case, the judgment discharging the jury at the former trial, and reciting the facts, was presented to the court, and the action of the court invoked on said plea, which was overruled, and the plea permitted to go to the jury, and the defendant excepted. The matters contained in the plea on the trial of the case were presented to the jury, and proof made, said proof being in substantial accord with the statement heretofore made, the main points of which were not controverted, but conceded to be true. When the jury were charged, appellant asked a charge in substance, directing the jury to find that said plea of former jeopardy was true, and to acquit the defendant thereon. This was refused by the court, and an exception reserved. The court\u2019s charge on this point was as follows: \u201cIf you find from the evidence in this case bearing upon the issue of former jeopardy that the wife of the juror, Abbott, was sick, and that her condition upon the night in question was such that it was necessary that Mr. Abbott be with her immediately, then, if you so find, you will find said'plea to be untrue; but if you find that said Abbott\u2019s wife was not sick, or that if she was sick, that her condition was not such that created a necessity that said Abbott should go to the bedside of his wife, then, if you so find, then you will find said special plea true, or, if you have a reasonable doubt thereon, then you will find said special plea to be true. But, in determining this issue, you must consider all of the facts and circumstances as they appeared upon the night in question, to-wit: May 2nd, 1895, and not as they appear at this day.\u201d So the question as to former jeopardy, which involved the action of the court in discharing the jury, is fairly and properly presented to this court for determination. It is not necessary in this case to discuss the question as to whether it is competent for the \u2022court, under our Constitution and laws, to discharge a juror on account of the sickness of some member of the juror\u2019s family, pending the trial \u2022of a person charged with felony. The question we will consider is whether or not the court is authorized to take such action as was taken here, in the absence of the prisoner, and not in open court. Our statute provides (Art. 737, Code Crim. Proc., 1895), as follows: \u201cIf, after the retirement of the jury in a felony case, any one of them become so sick as to prevent a continuance of his duty, or any accident or circumstance occur to prevent their being kept together, the jury may be discharged.\u201d Conceding that the legislature had the power to enact this article, and conceding that the severe illness of the wife of a juror is such a circumstance as would authorize the discharge of the jury\u2014propositions about which we express no opinion, because unnecessary\u2014still, it was absolutely necessary to judicially ascertain the fact of sickness before the jury could be legally discharged. This apprehends a judicial finding. It is a step in the progress of his trial, and an important one, so far as defendant\u2019s rights are concerned. Mr. Bishop says: \u201cThat in all trials for felony, at every material stage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>in the trial, it is absolutely necessary that the accused be present, else there can be no valid judgment against him.\u201d 1 Bishop\u2019s Crim. Proc., \u00a7 273. And he also lays down the following: \u201cIf any fact is to be established requiring or necessitating the discharge of the jury before the verdict, as the sickness of one of the panel, plainly the prisoner must be present.\u201d Sec. 272, Subdiv. 2. We also quote from the well-considered case of State v. Smith, 44 Kan., 75; 24 Pac., 84. This was a case that came up much in the same way as the case before us, and under a statute somewhat similar to ours, with reference to the discharge of a juror on account of sickness. In that case one of the jurors was taken sick, and it was reported to the court, in the absence of the prisoner, that he was unable to be present in court during the trial, on account of his sickness. The judge thereupon, in open court, and when defendant\u2019s counsel were present (but the prisoner was absent in jail), discharged the panel, and the question of jeopardy was presented. Among other things, the learned judge, in deciding said case, uses this language: \u201cWhen an order is made by a trial court discharging a jury, without verdict, to which has been committed the question of the guilt or innocence of the person charged with the crime, the record ought to show affirmatively the existence of the fact which induced such order, and justified the exercise of such extraordinary power. * \"x\". * Now, the court in this, case shows that one of the causes for which the trial court is authorized to discharge a jury in a criminal'case by the statute of this State happened on this trial, to-wit: the sickness of a juror. The sickness did not happen in the immediate 'presence of the court. The juror took sick .at home, during a recess of the court, and the fact of sickness had to be established in accordance with the rules that govern in all cases when the fact is to he judicially established, and made a finding upon which to base a legal conclusion or judicial action.\u201d And, in conclusion upon this point, the court say: \u201cWe think that error was committed in determining the sickness 'of a juror as a cause for the discharge- of the jury, in the absence of the appellant.\u201d Now, in the case at bar the action-of the judge was not in open court at all. It was at night, some distance away from the court room, in the absence not only of the jury, but of the prisoner and his counsel. Not only so, but this action was taken on the ex parte statement of an officer of the court that some one had informed him that the wife of the j uror, Abbott, was very sick. Gould the court, under such circumstances, make a judicial finding of\u2022 so important a fact in the progress of this trial\u2014one which involved t-he discharge of the jury? If so, the discharge of a juror in any case would appear to be a matter entirely within the arbitrary discretion of the judge\u2014a power which he could exercise in the absence of the prisoner, and without any judicial procedure to ascertain the fact which would authorize his action-. Such arbitrary power would place it entirely within' the province of. a judge to discharge--a jury of his own motion, and without investigation. If, in any given case, he should desire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the conviction of a defendant, and it should appear that the jury was not likely to convict, that the State had not entirely made out its case, by his arbitrary discretion he could discharge the jury, and upon a subsequent trial, the State being better prepared, secure a conviction. This was the practice of courts in the days of the Stuarts, but happily not so now. It is well settled that the court\u2019s discretion is a j udicial discretion, and not an arbitrary discretion. Take this case as it appears to us from the subsequent trial, in which the facts were presented; if this investigation had been had when the defendant was arraigned on his first trial, if he had been present, and had objected to the discharge of the jury, and insisted, as he had a right to do, upon an examination as to the necessity for such discharge, the record, as it now presents itself to us, we think, would have shown that there was no such existing necessity for the discharge of the juror. At a subsequent term of the court, not at the time the jury was discharged, evidence was received bearing upon the fact as to whether the juror\u2019s wife was sick or not. The testimony received relating to that fact, as we have said above, shows that the jury ought not to have been discharged, but the investigation into the facts should have been made before the jury was discharged, and not at the time the plea was interposed. The defendant had a right to be heard then, and not forced to wait until a subsequent term to ascertain whether the court had acted correctly or not. In Wright v. State, 35 Tex. Crim Rep., 158, in a case involving the question of jeopardy, this court used the following language: \u201cAgain, the record informs us simply that the court discharged the jury. We are left to inferences as to the reasons prompting him to this action. There should have been a judgment of the court finding and declaring that the jury had been kept together such a length of time as to render it altogether improbable that they could agree\u201d\u2014citing Adams v. State (Fla.) 15 South., 905. If the court is to find and ascertain the fact which authorizes him to act in discharging a jury, this apprehends a trial\u2014a trial in open court, in the presence of the accused, and not an ex parte proceeding, at which he is neither present nor consenting. Because, in our opinion, the action of the court in discharging the jury was without authority of law, the defendant having once been placed in jeopardy, the judgment of the court below is reversed, and defendant ordered to be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">\n<em>Reversed and Defendant Ordered Discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
