During the evening Walter and one Celia Smith became involved in some sort of a dispute, when Walter playfully slapped Celia\u2019s cheek. Jim Smith, deceased, the escort of Celia, came up, and inquiring as to the cause of the fuss, was told that Walter had struck Celia, whereupon deceased struck appellant. Appellant did not resent the blow, saying be wanted no trouble with a neighbor boy. There was evidence of threats made by both appellant and deceased that night, after the difficulty, against each other. The next day, Sunday, appellant leaves his home in a wagon with Tom Henley to go to Lisbon after another wagon, and deceased leaves his. home and goes to appellant\u2019s home. While there, appellant returns, passes by deceased; nothing is said or done. Shortly after, deceased and Henley go down the road in the two wagons, and appellant, coming out of the house about this time, sees them going .towards his other brother, Henry\u2019s, and takes a near cut through the field to catch them and go on to Anderson Pleasant\u2019s, where they were going to play marbles, knowing they would stop to leave one of the wagons at Henry\u2019s. When he got there, deceased was in the wagon. Appellant got in the wagon and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>spoke to Mm when deceased began cursing him, threatening to kill him, and finally ran his hand in his bosom and attempted to pull a revolver, when appellant caught him, and, opening Ms knife with his teeth, began to cut him, deceased struggling to get out his gun, and striking appellant over the head with his other hand, when they fell out of the wagon. Both got up; one ran one way, the other the other way. Deceased finally fell and died. Appellant gave himself up and was indicted for murder, and on December 19th convicted of murder in the second degree and his punishment fixed at fifteen years in the penitentiary. His motion for a new trial being overruled, appellant prosecutes this appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-5\"><em>Bell &amp; Atwell, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIJ\">The court erred in forcing on appellant the juror Ledbetter. Ledbetter was a brother of a deputy sheriff, and stood in the jury room for murder in the first degree. Appellant\u2019s counsel being in error as to number of challenges exhausted was informed by the clerk that there were so many remaining, which would have allowed a peremptory challenge of Ledbetter, and appellant acting thereon did so challenge Ledbetter, when the court informed counsel that all challenges had been exhausted. And it was at this time that counsel inspected the score, and not before, as stated by the court in his explanation of the bill of exception. Wilson v. State, 3 Tex. Crim. App., 64; Holt v.

Witness answered that deceased was a good sort of fellow. Defendant then asked witness if he knew what \u201cpea'ce and quietude\u201d meant. He said he did not; whereupon the court refused to allow counsel to explain what said words meant, and to prove by said witness that deceased\u2019s reputation, as above stated, was very bad, all of which witness would have testified.

In open defiance of this Jim Garrett remained in the court room and heard many witnesses testify and was then introduced upon the stand. Defendant objected. The court overruled objection and allowed witness to testify; then'instructed the jury to j)ay no attention to his testimony because he was drunk; sent witness to jail and the next day allowed witness, over defendant\u2019s objection, to testify, remarking at the same time that he (the court) did not believe what witness heard would influence him.

Will Fletcher testified that Tom Henley told him the evening after the difficulty that he, Henley, never heard a word snoken until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>boys fell out of the wagon. The court charged the jury as follows: \u201cYou are instructed that in passing upon defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence you will not consider any evidence as to what the witness, Tom Henley, may have said to Will Fletcher or others as to what he saw or heard at the killing, but you may look to such evidence in considering the credibility of said Tom Henley and the weight to be attached to his evidence.\u201d Tom Henley wa,% a negro, Will Fletcher a white man. Henley\u2019s sworn testimony was the same at inquest, examining trial and final trial. There is not a syllable in this record which even tends to indicate that Henley made statements to any one but Fletcher. No proof offered by the State that witness, Henley, had made statements to any one but Fletcher. Foster v. State, 8 Tex. Crim. App., 248; Ross v. State, 10 Tex. Crim. App., 455, Jernigan v.

Appellant complains that he was compelled to take on the jury, one Ledbetter, who was a brother of a deputy sheriff of Dallas County; that he was misled by the clerk as to the number of his challenges, or he would not have taken this juror. It appears that this mistake of the clerk was corrected by the judge some time before the appellant\u2019s challenges were exhausted. At any rate, appellant or his counsel should have kept account of the number of challenges, and then they would not have been misled by the clerk. The fact that Ledbetter was a brother of the deputy sheriff would appear to be a lame excuse on which to predicate even a peremptory challenge. Appellant introduced one Asia Myers, to prove the reputation of the deceased as being a quarrelsome and dangerous man. The question was asked of said witness by the appellant, \u201cIf he was acquainted with the general reputation of the deceased for peace and quietude in the community in which he lived?\u201d witness answered, \u201cThat the deceased was a good sort of fellow.\u201d On further questioning by defendant\u2019s counsel, he said that he did not know what peace and quietude meant. Counsel then wanted an opportunity to instruct the witness as to the meaning of such words. It is the duty of counsel to ascertain, before they put a witness on the stand, what they can prove by him, and it is too late, after a witness has been introduced, to then undertake to ascertain what he knows; or, if disappointed in his testimony, to' then propound leading questions to him, in order to indicate to him what is wanted. In the action of the court in this regard we see no error. Nor was there any error in the court permitting the witness, Jim Garrett, to be sworn as a witness and placed on the stand, although he had remained in the courthouse, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>heard some of the witnesses testify. This is a matter largely in the discretion of the court, and, unless the bill of exceptions shows some abuse of that discretion, this court will not reverse. The bill in this case does not show such abuse. The charge of the court on threats in connection with self-defense, we think was sufficient, and it was not necessary to give the charge asked by the appellant. The charge of the court on manslaughter, while not called for by the facts' in this case, was certainly as liberal towards the defendant as he could ask. The defendant introduced a witness\u2014Tom Henley\u2014who testified that he was present, and saw the difficulty, heard the deceased curse the defendant, and say, \u201cGod damn you! I am going to kill you,\u201d and reached his hand in his bosom, and the defendant grabbed the deceased, and they struggled and fought, and the, defendant cut the deceased, etc. . The State introduced Will Fletcher, for the purpose of impeaching the witness, Henley, and he testified that Henley told him the evening after the difficulty, that he (Henley) never heard a word spoken until the boys fell out of the wagon. \"The court charged the jury as follows on this subject: \u201cYou are instructed that, in passing upon the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, you will not consider any evidence as to what the witness, Tom Henley, may have said to Will Fletcher or others, as to what he saw or heard at the killing, but you may look to such evidence in considering the credibility of the said Tom Henley, and the weight to be attached to his evidence.\u201d Now, it will be observed that the witness, Fletcher, gave no affirmative evidence as to any statement of anything by Henley, but merely stated that Henley told him that he did not hear what he testified he did hear. The court, in this case, need not have charged as to\" the purpose of this testimony at all, but we certainly fail to see how the appellant can complain that he did limit the negative testimony of the witness, Fletcher; and the fact that the court may have predicated the instruction, not only as to the contradictory testimony of Fletcher, but as to others, when no other impeaching witness was introduced by the State, we fail to see -how such action could have prejudiced the appellant. There is nothing in the contention that the name of the prosecuting attorney to the indictment was typewritten, and not signed with pen and ink. By another bill of exceptions it is shown that the State was permitted to preve that \u201cEd Miller had a pistol on the day and at the time of the killing, when he went down the road from George Miller\u2019s house, towards Henry Miller\u2019s house, and in allowing counsel for the State to state before the jury that he expected to prove a conspiracy between the defendant and said Ed Miller to kill the deceased.\u201d This was excepted to by the appellant, but no grounds of objection are stated in the bill. This bill is too meager and indefinite to be considered. Nor is the explanation of the court attached to the bill any more satisfactory, to-wit: that he \u201cpermitted this evidence on the promise of the prosecution to show a conspiracy between the defendant and Ed Miller, and stated it should not be considered unless a conspiracy was shown.\u201d These acts of Ed Mill\u00e9r may have been admissible. If the testimony showed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>circumstances or by positive evidence that the conspiracy existed between the defendant and Ed Miller, then these acts may have been in furtherance of the common design. ' It will be seen that the bill is too-indefinite to require consideration. If this evidence was admissible at all, it was to prove the main fact, for the act of one co-conspirator in furtherance of the common design is the act of all the conspirators; and such evidence does not require a charge limiting its effect. This is based upon the further fact, however, that in such state of case the conspiracy has been shown. In this connection it will be noted that no objection was urged, and no facts set out in the bill of exceptions showing the predicate was not laid which would authorize the introduction of said, testimony. The bill should have been sufficiently specific, certain, and full in its statements to have manifested the supposed erroneous ruling-of the court; otherwise such ruling will be presumed correct. Until the bill comes within the well-settled rules in this regard, this court is not-authorized to revise the same. Willson\u2019s Grim. Stat., \u00a7\u00a7 2368, 2516. There was no motion made to exclude this evidence on the ground that the conspiracy was not proved. Id., \u00a7 2514. As this bill comes before-us, it is too indefinite to require consideration. The judgment and sentence of the lower court are affirmed.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"ARP\">[Note.\u2014Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing, filed May 5th, 1896, was-overruled without a written opinion.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\n<em>Affirmed. .</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
