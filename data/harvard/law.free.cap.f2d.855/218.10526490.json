Pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b), Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>and Mrs. Fernandez elected to claim exemptions as provided by Texas state law. Appellants listed over $8,000 worth of jewelry as exempt property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Texas Property Code \u00a7 42.002(3)(C) allows debtors to exempt \u201cclothing,\u201d but includes no separate category for \u201cjewelry.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court came to the plausible conclusion that \u201cclothing\u201d does not include jewelry and denied appellants\u2019 claimed exemptions as a matter of law. The district court affirmed. 89 B.R. 601 (W.D.Tex.1988). Applying Texas law governing the construction of exemption statutes, we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Prior to recodification in 1983, Texas law allowed a family to exempt \u201cwearing apparel.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cases interpreting the exemption statute held that the phrase \u201cwearing apparel\u201d included at least some items of jewelry.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For instance, in <em>Hickman v. </em>Hickman,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Texas Supreme Court ruled that two diamond rings occasionally worn by the owner should be considered \u201cwearing apparel,\u201d even though the owner did not wear them continuously and even, at times, pledged the rings as collateral for loans or kept them in a bank box. The court noted the traditional Texas rule that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af7\">our exemption laws should be liberally construed in favor of express exemptions, and should never be restricted in their meaning and effect so as to minimize their operation upon the beneficent objects of the statutes. Without doubt the exemption would generally be resolved in favor of the claimant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">This liberal rule of construction has led Texas courts to conclude that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIn\">a dray is a \u201cwagon\u201d ... an automobile is a \u201ccarriage\u201d ... a piano is \u201chousehold and kitchen furniture\u201d ... [and] the word \u201chorse\u201d includes a bridle and saddle, as well as the shoes on its feet and the rope and martingales around its neck_ And this spirit of liberal construction has been indulged until [the courts] have held that an unbroken colt is a \u201chorse\u201d ... and even that a mule, removed as he is one degree by consanguinity, is nevertheless a \u201chorse.\u201d Furthermore, in their effort to extend the humane and beneficial character of [their] exemption statute, [Texas courts] have become so blind to every other consideration that they have looked upon the mule\u2019s father and pronounced him\u2014 voice, ears, and all\u2014a horse.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0Oz\">As part of its ongoing project of statutory recodification, the Texas Legislature in 1983 adopted Senate Bill No. 748, creating the Texas Property Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>repealed the exemptions contained in old article 3836 and recodified them at Tex. Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 42.002 (Vernon 1984). In the process, the code revisors changed the phrase \u201cwearing apparel,\u201d substituting in its place the less stilted term \u201cclothing.\u201d The courts below decided that the Texas Legislature had made a substantive change in state law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the cases construing jewelry to be wearing apparel turned on the fact that jewelry is \u201cworn,\u201d they reasoned, the decision to remove the word \u201cwearing\u201d from the statute dictated a contrary result.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because \u201cclothing\u201d does not normally include jewelry, the lower courts disallowed the exemptions claimed by the debtors.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The lower court opinions err by giving an effect to the adoption of the Texas Property Code that the Texas Legislature did not intend. We begin our analysis with provisions of the Texas Code Construction Act relating to the construction of statutes:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In construing a statute, <em>whether or not the statute is considered ambiguous on its face, </em>a court may consider among other matters the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-13\">(1) object sought to be attained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-14\">(2) circumstances under which the statute was enacted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-15\">(3) legislative history;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-16\">(4) common law or former statutory provisions, including laws on the same or similar subjects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-17\">(5) consequences of a particular construction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-18\">(6) administrative construction of the statute; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-19\">(7) title (caption), preamble, and emergency provison.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-20\">In the case of the Texas Property Code, the circumstances of enactment and legislative history make clear that the Texas Legislature did not intend to change the legal effect of the prior statute. In authorizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>recodification, the Legislature narrowly defined the task, providing, \u201cWhen revising a statute the [Texas Legislative] Council <em>may not alter the sense, meaning, or effect </em>of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The revisors of the Property Code took this prohibition to heart:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">In reviewing the proposed code, the reader should keep in mind the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">(3) <em>This is a nonsubstantive revision. </em>The staffs authority does not include improving the substance of law. The sole purpose of this draft is to compile all the relevant law, arrange it in a logical fashion, and rewrite it <em>without altering its meaning or legal effect. </em>If a particular source statute is ambiguous and the ambiguity cannot be resolved without a potential substantive effect, the ambiguity is preserved.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The Property Code as adopted specifically states that it constitutes \u201cpart of the state\u2019s continuing statutory revision program,\u201d which \u201ccontemplates a topic-by-topic revision of the state\u2019s general and permanent statute law <em>without substantive change.\u201d </em><footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section seven of Senate Bill No. 748, which contained the new code, declares, \u201cThis Act is intended as a recodi-fication only, and no substantive change in the law is intended.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The bill\u2019s sponsor, Senator McFarland, and the chief revisor, Mr. Kindred, repeatedly assured the legislators that the proposed code made no substantive changes in prior statutes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Repeatedly and clearly, the Texas Legislature stated its intention that adoption of the Property Code have no effect on the legal results reached under the statutes recodified. Even though the exemption statute as amended is not ambiguous, the Code Construction Act allows us to take these statements into account in construing the statute. However, our holding does not rest on the legislative history alone. The Code Construction Act also allows us to consider the \u201cconsequences of a particular construction.\u201d In practical terms, the lower court rulings allow a bankruptcy trustee to \u201cremove the pendants from a lady\u2019s ears, or a badge from the veteran\u2019s coat.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We find it difficult to believe that Texas law requires debtors to hand over their wedding rings to satisfy the claims of creditors,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> while letting them keep \u201chome furnishings, including family heirlooms,\u201d and \u201cathletic and sporting equipment.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The lower court construction of the statute does not mesh well with the Texas tradition of liberality toward the debtor in construing exemption statutes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">The Bankruptcy Trustee urges that the exemption statutes should be construed to give debtors a fresh start, not a head start. The Fernandezes\u2019 claim of over $8,000 worth of exempt jewelry may well be excessive. Our holding should not be read as allowing automatic exemption of all jewelry claimed by the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>In particular, two requirements limit a debtor\u2019s ability to exempt jewelry from the Trustee\u2019s reach. First, the item of jewelry must be \u201cworn by the owner.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Since we hold today that the Texas Legislature intended no change in the law when it substituted \u201cclothing\u201d for \u201cwearing apparel\u201d in the exemption statute, it follows that the limitations imposed by the older cases still apply under the new statutory language. Thus, it would be inappropriate to claim an exemption for jewelry held by the debtor for investment or resale purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Second, the statute requires that items claimed under the \u201cclothing\u201d category of the exemption statute be \u201creasonably necessary for the family or single adult.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The \u201creasonably necessary\u201d language was added to the statute in 1973 and has been construed by at least one court in the context of a claimed exemption of jewelry.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We hold today that Tex.Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 42.002(3)(C) (Vernon 1984) allows a debtor to claim an exemption for jewelry worn by the owner and reasonably necessary for the family or single adult. Since the bankruptcy court failed to apply these standards to the exemptions claimed by Mr. and Mrs. Fernandez, we remand the case for reconsideration in light of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">. The debtors claimed as exempt property a man's watch, two ladies\u2019 watches, cuff links, two wedding rings, two other rings, three necklaces, six earrings and a pendant (amethyst and diamonds), and three bracelets. The estimated value of these items totalled $8,005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">.

The project of recodification is authorized by Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 323.007 (Vernon 1988), itself a recodification of Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 5429b-l (repealed).

For instance, the district court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">This change in terminology from \"all wearing apparel\u201d to \"clothing\" cannot be misconstrued as a modernization of the phrase \"all wearing apparel\u201d since this expression is not archaic or infrequently used. This alteration by the Texas Legislature has excluded the possibility of jewelry as exempt personal property. Furthermore, the Texas Legislature has chosen not to include a separate exemption for jewelry as. does 11 U.S.C. Section 522(d)(4), under the Federal exemptions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\">. For instance, the bankruptcy court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">The statute itself might not have been overwritten by the change in wording, but the judicial gloss in cases like <em>Hickman </em>and <em>Robinson </em>apparently has been. The holdings of these old Texas cases were adornments which hung on the word \"wearing.\" That word is now gone from the statute and with it, the justification for the gloss which once made jewelry exempt.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\">.

State, </em>695 S.W.2d 653, 656 n. 3 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Austin 1985, no writ), wherein the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">When adopted by the Legislature in a constitutional manner, the resulting Code as a whole constitutes a law in and of itself, and not a mere compilation of previous statutes, save in certain respects not material here. The Code becomes the statutory law of the State respecting the subjects to which it relates, superseding previous statutes omitted therefrom or repealed thereby, so that anyone subject to its provisions may look to the Code alone with safety and confidence, and without resorting to the previous statutes except to explain contradictions and ambiguities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQE\">However, we agree with another Texas appellate court which wrote more recently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-22\">We are aware of the cases holding that the enactment of a revision or a codification of a statute prevents the court from looking to the prior repealed statute unless an ambiguity or contradiction exists on the face of the statute. This is simply a restatement of the general rule that the intent of a statute may not be inquired into if the statute is clear on its face. We believe that this general proposition cannot be followed when a statute is codified and the legislature explicitly states that no substantive change in the law is intended. Enacting a codified statute, therefore, even if the statute is clear on its face, is not controlling if it results in a substantive change in the law contrary to the direction of the code\u2019s preamble.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-23\"><em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Transit Authority, </em>722 S.W.2d 738, 740 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1986, no writ) (citations omitted).
