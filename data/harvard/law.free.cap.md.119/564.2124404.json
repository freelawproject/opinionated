From this judgment, he has brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The rulings of the Court on the demurrer, and on the various motions interposed in the course of tl^,trial and on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh bills of exceptions, present almost the identical questions passed upon by us, in the <em>Cochran </em>and <em>Wagner cases, supra, </em>and we find it unnecessary to discuss them on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The determination of the questions raised in those cases are conclusive as to the same questions presented on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">The twelfth and thirteenth exceptions relate to certain statements and instructions by the Court, to the jury, before they retired to consider their verdict, and they are set out in the record. After the Court\u2019s instruction to the jury as set out in the eleventh bill of exceptions, and before the jury retired to consider the case, one of. the jurors asked the Court the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">(Juror) : May I ask a question?</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">(The Court) : Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">(Juror) : Did this man get any instruction from anybody?</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">(The Court) : Yes, from the Board of Election Supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">To this statement of the Court to the jury the counsel for the traverser excepted and the error here complained of constitutes the twelfth exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-16\">The thirteenth exception will be considered with the twelfth and is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>(Mr. Ward, Counsel): There is nothing in the record to support that (meaning the statement of the Court to the jury) in the traverser\u2019s twelfth hill of exception where the Court said, \u201cTes, from the Board of Election Supervisors.\u201d We would like to take an exception to that. Whereupon the Court further instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">(The Court) : \u201cYou can take it from me, if you will, and the gentlemen can except to it if it is not true \u2014 The Board of Supervisors gave these gentlemen full instructions. The testimony in this case is, that this particular traverser had acted three years previous to this election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">While there was evidence that the traverser had served as a judge of election on other occasions, there was not a particle of evidence to support the statement made by the Court to the jury that the Board of Election Supervisors had given him full instructions. This statement was not only a palpable error upon the part of the Court, hut this error was accentuated by the further statement by the Court, set out in the thirteenth hill of exception to the effect that \u201cYou can take it from me, if you will, and the gentlemen can except to it if it is not true \u2014 The Board of Supervisors gave these gentlemen full instructions. The testimony in this case is, that this particular traverser had acted three years previous to this election.\u201d The Court erred, and oxceeded its power, in making a statement of this character, to the jury, because it was not sustained by any proof, whatever, in the case, and it constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">It therefore follows for these reasons, and for the further reasons stated in the opinion filed in the case of <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>State </em>and <em>Wagner </em>v. State, which apply with equal force in this case, that the judgment must he reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
