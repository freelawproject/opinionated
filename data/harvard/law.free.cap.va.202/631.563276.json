Justis, hereinafter called the defendants, to recover the sum of $500, with interest, being the penalty of a bond which the defendants had executed, payable to the plaintiff, and conditioned that the plaintiff would not \u201ccontest the validity of the recorded will of Nona Wessells,\u201d deceased. It was alleged that the penalty of the bond was due because the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>tiff had not contested the will. The defendants filed grounds of defense, alleging that the plaintiff had filed certain exceptions to the account of the executors of the estate of Nona Wessells, deceased, which constituted a \u201ccontest of the validity\u201d of the will and rendered the bond \u201cnull and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The record shows that all parties having waived a jury, the case was submitted to the lower court which, \u201chaving fully heard the evidence,\u201d found for the plaintiff and entered judgment in his favor for the amount claimed. To review this judgment the defendants were granted a writ of error. Their assignment of error is that the finding and judgment for the plaintiff are contrary to the law and the evidence. Specifically, the contention is that the exceptions which the plaintiff filed to the executors\u2019 account constituted a contest of the will within the meaning of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">However, the evidence heard and considered by the lower court was not preserved and made a part of the record in the manner provided by Rule 5:1, \u00a7 3(e). The record does not contain a copy of the will, a copy of the executors\u2019 account, or a copy of the exceptions which the defendants say constituted a contest of the will. Nor is there any evidence in the record of the contents of these documents. Without such evidence it is impossible for us to determine whether the lower court properly ruled that there had been no contest of the will by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">We have many times pointed out that on appeal the judgment of the lower court is presumed to be correct and the burden is on the appellant to present to us a sufficient record from which we can determine whether the lower court has erred in the respect complained of. If the appellant fails to do this, the judgment will be affirmed. 1 Mich. Jur., Appeal and Error, \u00a7\u00a7 258, 259, pp. 675, 676.

E. 2d 618, 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">In the petition for a writ of error there is a purported copy of the exceptions which the plaintiff filed to the account of the executors. However, in the argument before us the accuracy of this copy was questioned. This demonstrates the soundness of the rule that we must consider the case on the record which is sent to us from the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>lower court, \u201cand not upon counsel\u2019s recollection of what occurred\u201d there. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 310, 320, 53 S. E. 2d 54, 59.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ4\">For these reasons the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
