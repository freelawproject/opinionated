Corbett, defendant, for damages resulting from injuries she received while a passenger in an automobile operated by her husband, Maurice W. Bonney, when his car was struck in the rear by a vehicle driven by defendant in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">Defendant filed a plea of release and also her grounds of defense to the motion for judgment. A similar plea was filed by her in a pending action instituted by Maurice W. Bonney arising out of the same accident, and since the Bonneys had executed a joint release, the trial court, without objection, ordered that the cases be heard together on the issue raised by the special pleas. A trial was had on June 13, 1960, and at the conclusion of all the evidence defendant moved to strike plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, which motion was overruled. The jury returned verdicts in favor of both plaintiffs, thus holding the release invalid. Defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdicts was overruled. Thereafter, on July 27, 1960, a trial was had on the merits of plaintiff\u2019s (Mrs. Bonney\u2019s) case. The jury found for plaintiff and fixed her damages at $5,000 upon which judgment was entered. We granted defendant a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">Defendant relies solely upon assignments of error Nos. 3 and 4. They relate to the trial on defendant\u2019s special plea of release, and they allege that the court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s evidence because plaintiff failed to prove (1) \u201cfraud in the procurement of the release by clear, concise and credible evidence\u201d, and (2) \u201ca mutual mistake of fact as to her alleged injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">We, therefore, are concerned here only with the evidence adduced at the trial on defendant\u2019s special plea of release. The Bonneys and defendant were friends and residents of Norfolk, Virginia. They drove to Charlotte, North Carolina, in their respective automobiles to attend a Jehovah\u2019s Witness convention. While there, on August 15, 1959, at approxim\u00e1tely 10 a.m. defendant, who was following Bonney\u2019s vehicle, negligently operated her car and struck Bonney\u2019s vehicle in the rear causing it damage. Defendant contacted Robert L. Fry, a claims adjuster for her insurance carrier, The Celina Mutual Insurance Company. Fry drove to the scene of the accident, and made arrangements for necessary temporary repairs to Bonney\u2019s car at Kiser\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>garage. He then escorted the Bonneys and defendant to a local hospital, where plaintiff was examined by Dr. Basil Boyd, an orthopedic surgeon. The X-rays taken were negative. Dr. Boyd diagnosed her injury as \u201ca complaint of lombar cervical spine\u201d. He rendered her \u201cemergency treatment which consisted of a sedative and muscle relaxer and told her to contact her physician on her return to Norfolk if necessary\u201d. The examination consumed about an hour, after which the Bonneys left the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Later in the day the Bonneys contacted Fry on the telephone and arrangements were made for Fry to drive them the next morning to Kiser\u2019s garage where the automobile had been temporarily repaired. There, according to Fry, Bonney told him of plaintiff\u2019s condition and that Dr. Boyd had said there would possibly be additional treatments by an orthopedic doctor in Norfolk. Fry said there was a discussion with respect to the amount of damages sustained as a result of the accident, after which the Bonneys agreed to accept $197.96 in settlement of their claims. It covered repairs made to the automobile; $75.46 for additional repairs required; $15 to pay Dr. Boyd; $15 to pay the hospital; $5 for a telephone call, and the balance was for further medical treatment of plaintiff, if necessary. As a consequence he said that he filled in a release form<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in their presence and explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>to them it was a release from any and all claims resulting from the accident, and that the Bonneys read it before signing. Their signatures were witnessed by A. A. Ramsey, a Charlotte police officer, and Robert V. Kiser, who were at the garage. Ramsey testified that the release was filled in and signed by the Bonneys in his presence; that he and Kiser signed as witnesses in their presence; that Bonney explained to him what \u201cit was all about\u201d and was satisfied, and that he appeared to be normal and joked at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">Bonney stated that when he signed the release, neither he nor Fry knew that he was injured. On the other hand, plaintiff said her husband was \u201cnearly crazy and was having pain\u201d. Both plaintiff and Bonney testified they did not read the instrument before signing it and that it was not discussed as a release. When Bonney was asked what was said with regard to plaintiff\u2019s releasing any claim for her injury, he replied: \u201cHe, [Fry] said that this was in order to get her out of the hospital in Charlotte, and to get my car, and that that was all I was supposed to be signing for.\u201d When asked if there was any particular reason why he did not read the release before executing it, he said: \u201cWell, I was so excited and so upset on account of my wife\u2019s injury, and I thought that Mr. Fry was being fair with me, so I just signed it thinking that he was being fair in telling me that I was only signing for my car and for my wife up until that point. So, therefore, I signed it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">Plaintiff stated Fry was \u201cso nice about everything\u201d; that at the garage he said \u201cthat I could now be turned over to my husband, that I was O.K. to go back\u201d; that the car was ready, and that the signing of the form \u201cwas just a formality that was routine, that had to be done on every occasion.\u201d Plaintiff testified that she did not read the release because \u201cI thought that he [Fry] was telling the truth,\u201d and that had she known the extent of her injuries and that the instrument was a release, she would not have signed it. She further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-7\">\u201cQ. After you signed it did Mr. Fry ever say anything to you about getting further medical treatment in Norfolk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-8\">\u201cA. When I went over and got in my car and we were getting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>ready to leave the garage \u2014 and, in fact, leave the City of Charlotte\u2014 he came over and I rolled down the window, and he said that he hoped I would be getting along all right, and to go ahead and have whatever medical attention I needed, and to do that until I got well, and that he hoped I would be feeling good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-5\">######*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-6\">\u201cQ. When you were examined by Dr. Boyd in Charlotte, Mrs. Bonney, did he indicate to you that you might have need for further treatment in Norfolk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-7\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-8\">\u201cQ. You knew that at the time you signed that paper, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-9\">\u201cA. I knew that I would have to have something more done, because I was just in so much pain. I could not walk alone. I had to have the help of my husband. I knew that something was wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">After signing the release, the Bonneys returned to Norfolk where Mrs. Bonney received a number of treatments for her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">Fry, not having draft authority, forwarded the release to defendant\u2019s insurance carrier, who in turn mailed three drafts totalling the sum of $197.96, payable to the Bonneys and others. But before Fry received the drafts, he was advised by letter that Robert Cohen of the law firm of Amato, Babalas, Breit and Cohen, of Norfolk, was representing the Bonneys for injuries and damages sustained in the accident. Whereupon, on August 15, 1959, Fry mailed the drafts to Cohen, who returned them to Fry on September 1, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\"> We shall consider first whether the trial court erred in refusing to strike plaintiff\u2019s evidence with regard to fraud because of her failure to prove fraud in the procurement of the release. Since the instrument was executed in North Carolina, the law of that State governs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-13\"><em>Harrison </em>v. <em>R. R., </em>229 N. C. 92, 47 S. E. 2d 698, involved the validity of a release for injuries plaintiff sustained in an accident during the course of his employment by defendant. Plaintiff was 32 years of age, literate and had business experience. He claimed that he signed the instrument without reading it in reliance upon the statement of defendant\u2019s agent that it was for the purpose of admitting him to the hospital, when in fact it was a release from liability in consideration of defendant\u2019s agreement to pay all medical and hospital bills with regard to his injuries. In holding that the evidence showed that plaintiff had knowledge of the nature of the instrument and that the evidence was not sufficient to show fraud in the procurement of the release, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>\u201cIt is established by the decisions on the subject that one who signs a written instrument, without being induced thereto through fraud or deception, cannot avoid its effect on the ground that at the time he signed the paper he did not read it or know its contents, but relied upon what another said about it. <em>School Com. </em>v. <em>Kesler, 67 </em>N. C., [443], 448; 45 Am. Jur., 683; Anno. 55 Am. St. Rep., 509. It is the duty of one signing a written instrument to inform himself of its contents before executing it, if he have the ability and opportunity to do so, and in the absence of fraud or overreaching he will not be allowed to impeach the effect of the instrument by showing that he was ignorant of its contents or failed to read it. 96 A. L. R., 995. He cannot invoke his own heedlessness to discredit his solemn release, and then call that heedlessness someone else\u2019s fraud. <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Cowden, </em>88 Md., 394, 41 Atl., 786.\u201d 229 N. C. 92, at page 95, 47 S. E. 2d 698, at page 700.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">See <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Grier, </em>224 N. C. 339, 343, 30 S. E. 2d 223; <em>Aderholt </em>v. <em>R. R., </em>152 N. C. 411, 67 S. E. 978; <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>Dumouchelle, </em>185 Va. 724, 733,40 S. E. 2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">In 45 Am. Jur., Release, \u00a7 18, pp. 683, 684, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1102-7\">\u201cIn the absence of fraud or a relation of trust and confidence between the parties, a releasor can ordinarily not avoid the effect of a release upon the ground that at the time he signed the paper he did not read it or know its contents, but relied on what another said about it. * * *\u201d See 76 C. J. S., Release, \u00a7 25 b, pp. 647, 648.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">Plaintiff argues \u201cthe testimony shows that the adjuster here befriended the claimants and ingratiated himself with them in order to eventually more easily mislead them with regard to the release agreement.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was that Fry told her that when there was an accident, the car was of less concern and the injured had to be cared for first; that plaintiff was his responsibility, and that he wanted her to be seen by a doctor, which was done. She said that he had the car taken to the repair shop; that he offered the Bonneys the use of his car; that he offered to take them to breakfast; that he drove them to the garage to get their automobile, and that he \u201cwas just so nice about everything.\u201d We find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-9\">Bonney was 29 years old and Mrs. Bonney was age 24 at the time of the accident. Both could read and write. He was employed as cashier and credit manager for Miller Motor Express, and was familiar with bills of lading and other similar documents. At the top of the release in large type are these words: \u201cGENERAL RELEASE, HUSBAND AND WIFE\u201d, and at the bottom, immediately above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>the space reserved for claimants\u2019 signatures, is \u201cCAUTION: READ BEFORE SIGNING.\u201d Bonney stated they signed the release without reading it because Fry said it was to get plaintiff out of the hospital and to get his car. It is difficult to believe that the Bonneys could have relied upon such a statement. In the first place, plaintiff was not in the hospital, and in the second place, the car could have been secured by the payment of $20 without signing anything. The statement attributed to Fry by plaintiff that the instrument \u201cwas just a formality that was routine, that had to be done on every occasion\u201d, can hardly be considered as fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact. It is common knowledge that when a settlement has been agreed upon, a release is usually executed by the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Here the plaintiff had the ability and the opportunity to read the release, and it was her duty to do so before signing it. No valid excuse has been shown for not reading the instrument. She cannot invoke her own heedlessness to discredit her solemn release, and call such heedlessness another person\u2019s fraud. It is a cardinal rule that fraud must be proved by clear, cogent and convincing evidence. On the record before us the evidence does not measure up to that degree of proof, and we find, as a matter of law, that there was no fraud in the procurement of plaintiff\u2019s signature to the release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">We shall now consider whether the trial court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to strike plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to mutual mistake on the ground that a mutual mistake of fact as to plaintiff\u2019s injuries had not been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">In 45 Am. Jur., Release, \u00a7 20, pp. 685, 686, it is stated: \u201c# * * While a mistake as to the extent of the injury, due to unknown conditions, is material, it would seem that unknown and unexpected consequences of a known injury will not bring a case within the rule permitting avoidance of a release on the ground of mutual mistake. In order to avoid a release on the ground of mutual mistake as to the nature or extent of the injuries, there must be more than a mere mistake as to the time which will probably be required for recovery from a known injury, since a statement by the releasee\u2019s physician in this regard may be considered ordinarily as a mere expression of opinion. * * *\u201d See Annotation 48 A. L. R. p. 1464, <em>et seq., </em>76 C. J. S., Release, \u00a7 25a, pp. 645, 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">The evidence shows that plaintiff knew at the time she executed the release that further treatment of her injuries would be required. Fry was also aware of that fact. A sum, though small, was included in the release for additional medical treatment, if necessary. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>was no evidence adduced at the trial on the release that she had any injury other than that which she was diagnosed as having by Dr. Boyd. The fact that the treatment of plaintiff\u2019s known injuries has been prolonged does not bring her case within the rule permitting avoidance of the release on the ground of mutual mistake. As was said in <em>Fix </em>v. <em>Craighill, </em>160 Va. 742, 755, 169 S. E. 598, \u201cMistakes as to matters which the contracting parties had in mind as possibilities and as to the existence of which they took the risk are not such mistakes of fact as to entitle either party to relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\"><em>Ice Company </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>199 Va. 243, 99 S. E. 2d 721, cited by plaintiff, is factually different from the present case and is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">We hold, as a matter of law, that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that there was a mutual mistake of fact with regard to plaintiff\u2019s (Mrs. Bonney\u2019s) injuries, and that the trial court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to strike her evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">For the reasons stated the verdict and judgment awarding plaintiff $5,000 are set aside; the verdict and judgment in favor of plaintiff, Shirley Ann Bonney, on the trial of the special plea are set aside, and final judgment is here entered for defendant on the special plea of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1099-6\"> \u201cGENERAL RELEASE, HUSBAND AND WIFE KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">That we, Maurice W.
