Phillips and Charles R. Campbell were separately indicted under \u00a7 18-98, Code 1950, for the crime of sodomy, each being charged with having committed the offense upon the other. They pleaded not guilty and consented to be tried together. A verdict of guilty was returned by the jury against each accused and punishment fixed at two years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary. Each moved the court to set aside the verdict as contrary to the law and evidence and without evidence to support it. Their motions were overruled and from judgments confirming the verdicts, they appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The dominant and decisive assignment of .error taken by each accused is that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Summarized, the evidence relied upon by the Commonwealth to sustain the convictions follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">The testimony of Captain Newton J. Roark and police officer Norman Smith shows that on the morning of August 6, 1959, Phillips came to the police station in Bristol, Virginia, and reported that on August 4, 1959, he let a boy who said his name was Chuck Davis use his car to go home, that Davis still had possession of the automobile, and did not want to give it back. Roark informed Phillips that the police would look for the car but Phillips said that he did not want Davis prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The next day, August 7, Phillips returned to the police station and told Roark and officer Norman Smith that he wanted to make another statement different from the one he had previously made; \u201cthat he wanted to tell the truth about it.\u201d After being advised that he did not have to make any statement, that if he did, it could be used against him, and that he was entitled to consult with an attorney if he desired, Phillips voluntarily made a confession that was reduced to writing, read by him, and signed. In the confession Phillips said that about 10:45 p.m. August 4, 1959, he was seated in his car at the F &amp; M Cafe when a boy walked up and engaged him in conversation. The boy, who was a stranger to Phillips, said that he had to go to the Virginia Drive-In some miles distant to see his brother, and Phillips volunteered to drive him there. When they reached the drive-in each drank a cup of coffee, and the boy said that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>forgotten that \u201chis brother did not go to work until 3 o\u2019clock.\u201d Phillips, accompanied by the boy, then began driving toward Bristol, and on the way turned off the highway to allow the boy to relieve his bladder. After each had thus relieved himself, they re-entered the car and Phillips drove to an area called Briarwood Addition where he parked, and there the boy suggested that they commit the crime. The confession then recites their commission of the crime of sodomy and its sordid and disgusting details. When they left Briarwood, at the boy\u2019s request, Phillips allowed him to drive, and on the way to Bristol he asked Phillips to let him keep the car until tomorrow. Phillips was reluctant to grant that request, but when the boy threatened to \u201crun the car into some house or over some cliff\u201d, Phillips became scared, and on the boy\u2019s promise to bring the car back the next day, he agreed to let him keep it. The confession then states that at the boy\u2019s insistence Phillips loaned him $7.00, and after driving around for a while longer, they stopped on the highway. When a police car stopped and the officer accosted them, the boy stated to the officer that Phillips was his boss and they were talking over what they were \u201cgoing to do tomorrow.\u201d About one o\u2019clock a.m. Phillips was let out of the car near where he and his wife were living.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The only evidence that tends to corrobate any part of Phillips\u2019 written statement is the testimony of Deputy Sheriff Clendenen, who said that when he arrested Campbell on August 7 in nearby Washington county on a charge against him in Bristol for the unauthorized use of an automobile, he was in possession of Phillips\u2019 car. Shortly after Phillips made and signed the confession a warrant charging him with sodomy was issued, and he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Campbell was also arrested by Deputy Sheriff Clendenen sometime later on August 7 on a warrant charging him with sodomy. Clendenen testified that when arrested and questioned about that offense, Campbell admitted that he had been with Phillips in the latter\u2019s automobile during the evening of August 4, having gotten in the car at the F &amp; M Cafe in the city of Bristol. He also admitted that he had gone in Phillips\u2019 car to the Virginia Drive-In several miles east of Bristol and had driven from there to Briarwood Addition in Washington county where they stopped. He further said that while at the Briarwood Addition, Phillips made advances toward him by laying his hand on Campbell\u2019s leg, but when that occurred, he told Phillips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u201cto get his hand off him or he would break his neck.\u201d Campbell had never seen Phillips before that evening, and he said that this incident was his first knowledge that Phillips was \u201cqueer.\u201d He also said that when he and Phillips left Briarwood, he drove the car and took Phillips to the latter\u2019s home where he let him out.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">After Campbell\u2019s arrest he was also interviewed by Captain Roark and made an oral statement to him practically identical with the one made to Clendenen, though he did tell Roark that when he let Phillips out of the car, Phillips told him to use the automobile but to bring it back the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Neither accused testified. Phillips\u2019 confession was not made in Campbell\u2019s presence, nor were the oral statements of Campbell to Clendenen and Roark made in Phillips\u2019 presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">When Phillips\u2019 written confession and Campbell\u2019s statements to Clendenen and Roark, all made after the commission of the alleged offense, were offered in evidence by the Commonwealth, the court rightly ruled that Phillips\u2019 confession was not admissible <em>against </em>Campbell nor were Campbell\u2019s statements admissible <em>against </em>Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">This principle is hoary with age. As early as 1663, in <em>Tong\u2019s </em>Case, Kelyng 17, 18, 84 Eng. Rep. 1061, 1062 (K.B.), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">\u201c[S]uch confession [before a justice or a privy councillor on examination] so proved is only evidence against the party himself who made the confession, but cannot be made use of as evidence against any others whom on his examination he confessed to be in the treason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Virginia decisions and other authorities that firmly established the principle are <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>7 Gratt. (48 Va.) 641; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>31 Gratt. (72 Va.) 836, 850; <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>77 Va. 590, <em>Garnett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>117 Va. 902, 83 S. E. 1083; Nash, <em>The Law of Evidence, </em>\u00a7 179, p. 321; 20 Am. Jur., Evidence, \u00a7 493. Thus the only evidence to sustain Phillips\u2019 conviction is his confession and the fact that on August 7 Campbell was in possession of Phillips\u2019 car; the only evidence to sustain Campbell\u2019s conviction are his statements to Clendenen and Roark.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">We first address ourselves to the decisive question of whether or not the <em>corpus delicti </em>\u2014 the body or substance of the crime \u2014 was established as required by law against Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">In 7 M. J., Evidence, \u00a7 240, p. 616, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-13\">\u201cExtrajudicial confessions of the accused are competent evidence tending to prove the corpus delicti. But the corpus delicti cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>established by such a confession uncorroborated by other evidence. In other words, a conviction in a criminal case is not warranted by the extrajudicial confession of the accused alone. The confession must be corroborated in a material and substantial manner by evidence aliunde of the corpus delicti. The corroborating evidence, however, need not of itself be conclusive; it is sufficient if when taken in connection with the confession, the crime is established beyond reasonable doubt. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Of like import is 5 M. J., Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 54, pp. 400 and 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u201cEven a confession by the accused, which is extra-judicial, that he committed the offense with which he is charged, is not alone and uncorroborated, adequate proof to establish the <em>corpus </em>delicti.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>132 Va. 741, 745, 111 S. E. 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">\u201cIt has long been settled in this State that the <em>corpus delicti </em>cannot be established by the extra judicial confession of an accused uncorroborated by other evidence. See <em>Cleek </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 697, 698, 181 S. E. 359, 360, and cases there cited'. Yet a confession is competent evidence tending to prove the <em>corpus delicti, </em>and all that is required of the Commonwealth in such cases is that there be such substantial corroborative circumstances as will, when taken in connection with the confession, establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>beyond reasonable doubt. * <em>* </em>*\u201d <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 192 </em>Va. 665, 669, 66 S. E. 2d 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Adhering to the principle that the <em>corpus delicti </em>may not be proved by extra-judicial confession alone are <em>Collins </em>v. Commonwealth, 123 Va. 815, 96 S. E. 826; <em>Pepoon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 804, 66 S. E. 2d 854; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>194 Va. 825, 75 S. E. 2d 468; <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>201 Va. 599, 112 S. E. 2d 915; 2 Wharton, <em>Criminal Evidence </em>(12th ed.), \u00a7 393, p. 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The Attorney General insists that the fact that Campbell was in possession of Phillips\u2019 car shortly after the alleged offense sufficiently corroborates Phillips\u2019 confession to establish the <em>corpus delicti.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Though it be conceded that Campbell\u2019s possession of Phillips\u2019 car corroborates Phillips\u2019 statement that he and Campbell were in each other\u2019s presence at the time stated by Phillips in his confession, yet it furnishes no corroboration that the actual crime of sodomy for which Phillips was convicted was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">\u201c \u2018The rule in criminal cases is that the coincidence of circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>tending to indicate guilt, however strong and numerous they may be, avails nothing unless the <em>corpus delicti, </em>the fact that the crime has been actually perpetrated, be first established. * # *\u2019 1 Starkie on Ev., 510.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>103 Va. 1012, 1019, 49 S. E. 663. <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>163 Va. 1089, 177 S. E. 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Campbell\u2019s possession of the car does not indicate commission of the crime nor can it be said to substantiate the truth of the confession that the criminal act was committed. His possession of the car is just as consistent with non-commission of the offense as it is with its commission. In short, there is no evidence that fortifies the truth of the confession as to the <em>corpus delicti </em>\u2014 the fact that the crime was actually committed. The only evidence to prove the <em>corpus delicti </em>is the extra-judicial confession, and it has been held time and again to be insufficient, standing alone, to establish that fact. It follows that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict and judgment against Phillips, and we so decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The statements made by Campbell to Clendenen and Roark are not confessions of guilt on his part. On the contrary, they are denials of guilt insofar as he is concerned. There being no other testimony that tends to establish Campbell\u2019s guilt or participation in the offense for which he was convicted, it is abundantly clear that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict and judgment against Campbell, and we so decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The judgments will be reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the cases remanded for new trials if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
