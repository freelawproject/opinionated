The University contends that the trial court erred in rendering summary judgment because the evidence submitted to the trial court did not support summary judgment, that the rendering of summary judgment under these circumstances deprived the University of its property without due process of law, in violation of both the Ohio and United States constitutions, and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the University\u2019s motion for continuance for additional discovery, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">{\u00b6 2} We agree with the University that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the University\u2019s motion for a continuance to take Morgan\u2019s deposition. Based upon that conclusion, we find the University\u2019s other assignments of error to be moot. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">{\u00b6 3} Austin J. Cohen, the plaintiffs decedent, was a student at the University, living in University-owned housing. In December 2000, he was killed as a result of a fire that occurred while he was asleep in his University-owned residence. Fire investigators determined that the origin of the fire was in a stairwell, where Morgan, who was apparently intoxicated at the time, about 4:30 a.m., had ignited some paper towels. Morgan was convicted of arson and involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">{\u00b6 4} Kim Cohen, Austin Cohen\u2019s father, brought this action against the University, alleging that its negligence was a proximate cause of his son\u2019s death. Cohen had previously settled a lawsuit against Morgan for $191,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">{\u00b6 5} The University brought in Morgan as a third-party defendant, seeking contribution from Morgan. Morgan\u2019s defense was that he had entered into a settlement with Cohen in good faith, and he moved for summary judgment, relying upon R.C. 2307.32. The University moved for a continuance, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F), for time to conduct discovery. The trial court granted the motion in part, allowing the University 60 days to take Cohen\u2019s deposition, only; the trial court specifically denied the University\u2019s request to take Morgan\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">{\u00b6 6} In due course, after the parties had submitted their evidentiary materials pursuant to Civ.R. 56, the trial court rendered summary judgment against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>University upon its claim against Morgan for contribution, finding that Morgan had entered into a settlement agreement with Cohen in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">{\u00b6 7} From the summary judgment rendered against it, the University appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">{\u00b6 8} The University\u2019s Third Assignment of Error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for continuance pursuant to Civil Rule 56(F).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">{\u00b6 10} In defense of the University\u2019s claim against him for contribution, Morgan relied upon R.C. 2307.32(F), which at that time<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cWhen a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to one of two or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or loss to person or property or the same wrongful death, the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(1) The release or covenant does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury, loss, or wrongful death unless its terms otherwise provide, but it reduces the claim against the other tortfeasors to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant, or in the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever is greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(2) The release or covenant discharges the tortfeasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tortfeasor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">{\u00b6 14} Although the University appeared unwilling to concede, in the trial court, that the liability that Morgan settled with Cohen was a tort liability, that appears to be beyond dispute, given the essential, undisputed facts of this case. Therefore, the issue involved in Morgan\u2019s defense to the University\u2019s claim for contribution is whether the release he received in his settlement with Cohen was given in good faith. If so, the University\u2019s claim for contribution is barred; if not, the University may proceed with its claim for contribution against Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">{\u00b6 15} After Morgan moved for summary judgment, the University moved for a continuance, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F), to permit it to conduct discovery necessary to respond to Morgan\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In support of its motion for a continuance, the University included the following argument:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201cSpecifically, the University needs discovery regarding the proportionality of Mr. Morgan\u2019s settlement with the Plaintiff. * * * In this action, Plaintiff has demanded at least a seven figure damage award. Yet, Plaintiff settled with Mr. Morgan, who started the fire, for $191,800. * * * Even assuming Plaintiffs demand was for only one million dollars, Mr. Morgan\u2019s settlement comprises only 19% of the damage claim. Certainly, because Mr. Morgan is responsible for starting the fire that resulted in Austin J. Cohen\u2019s death, there is an issue of fact as to whether Mr. Morgan\u2019s settlement is in proportion to his amount of liability. If it is not, there is an issue as to whether the Release was given in good faith. As a result, discovery is needed to determine the amount of damages claimed by Plaintiff and whether Mr. Morgan\u2019s settlement is in proportion to his amount of liability. * * * Discovery is also needed to determine if there was any fraud, collusion or other wrongful conduct on the part of Plaintiff or Mr. Morgan with regard to the execution of the Release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court granted the University\u2019s motion for a continuance, but only \u201cfor the limited purpose of taking the Plaintiffs\u2019 [sic] deposition on the issue of the \u2018good faith\u2019 settlement with the third-party Defendant, Morgan.\u201d The University moved for reconsideration, arguing that it needed to take Morgan\u2019s deposition, as well as Cohen\u2019s deposition. This motion was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">{\u00b6 18} The decision whether to grant a request for a continuance, pursuant to Civ.R. 56(F), to the party opposing a motion for summary judgment is confided to the discretion of the trial court, but that discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Fiske v. Rooney </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 649, 655, 711 N.E.2d 239. On the other hand, the public policy in favor of encouraging out-of-court settlements militates in favor of limiting the scope and extent of discovery in connection with the good-faith defense to contribution, because without substantial limitation of the scope and extent of discovery, one of multiple, alleged joint tortfeasors will have less incentive to settle; even if he settles his liability to the plaintiff, he may find himself in protracted litigation with an alleged joint tortfeasor over the issue of contribution. This animated the decision in <em>Mahathiraj v. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1992), 84 Ohio App.3d 554, 617 N.E.2d 737, cited by Morgan and Cohen, in which the court opined: \u201cA court may determine the good faith of a settlement based solely upon the arguments of counsel, based upon affidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials of record, or after conducting an evidentiary hearing. The standard of review from such decisions is one of abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. at 562, 617 N.E.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">{\u00b6 19} We decline to go so far as to remove cases involving good-faith-settlement defenses to contribution claims from the operation of Civ.R. 56, particularly the limitations imposed therein upon the kind of evidence that may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>be considered in connection with a motion for summary judgment. \u201cNo evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule.\u201d Civ.R. 56(C). We note that the quality of the evidence does not seem to have been raised as an issue in the appeal in <em>Mahathiraj, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">{\u00b6 20} We do note with approval the following passage in <em>Mahathiraj </em>:</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cIn the final analysis, a totality of the circumstances standard enables the trial court to consider the potential proportionate liability of the parties in cases where such determinations are appropriate, but does not require the court to consider it in every case or in cases where such calculations would be of little value in good faith determinations. As a result, parties have a greater incentive to settle than they would under a standard which forces them to defend their settlements whenever the mere allegation of a disproportionate settlement is made. At the same time, courts are free to police collusive settlements that unfairly saddle one tortfeasor with a disproportionate share of liability.\u201d Id. at 561, 617 N.E.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">{\u00b6 22} Cohen and Morgan argue that if the University is permitted to take Morgan\u2019s deposition, the result will be mini-trials on the liability of the various alleged tortfeasors, with the result that one of the principal advantages of settlement \u2014 the avoidance of expensive and protracted litigation \u2014 would become unavailable. The University argues that because it is required to demonstrate that their settlement was not made in good faith, it ought to be able to take the depositions of the two parties to that settlement \u2014 Cohen and Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">{\u00b6 23} We agree with Cohen and Morgan that a trial court must be accorded substantial discretion to limit the scope of discovery in cases involving good-faith-settlement defenses to contribution, lest they become mini-trials on the individual liability of alleged joint tortfeasors. In this case, that substantial discretion could have been exercised both to limit the University\u2019s remaining discovery to the taking of Morgan\u2019s deposition, a limitation to which the University agreed it would accept in its motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s original order, and to limit the extent of that deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">{\u00b6 24} In this case, it had already become evident that Morgan was, by far, the most culpable of the joint tortfeasors, having been the person who directly caused the fire that claimed Austin Cohen\u2019s life. Because the total claim against the University evidently exceeded $1,000,000, the $191,800 settlement with Morgan was already shown to have been disproportionate in a pure comparative-fault sense. If that settlement was going to be shown to have been in good faith, presumably it was going to be shown to have been the limit, or near the limit, of the resources available to pay a judgment against Morgan. That would involve an analysis of available insurance coverage and other assets of Morgan\u2019s upon which Cohen could levy to pay a judgment. In this connection, we would reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>any argument that Cohen must, in the exercise of good faith, await patiently some future day when Morgan may enjoy a greater net worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">{\u00b6 25} Thus, the likely appropriate scope of Morgan\u2019s deposition would be limited to an analysis of his available resources, including insurance coverage, and the circumstances surrounding the negotiation of the settlement agreement, to the extent that those circumstances might involve fraud or collusion. Surely this could have been accomplished in a few hours of deposition. And if the University should seek to extend the scope of Morgan\u2019s deposition beyond reasonable limits, the trial court is available for consideration of a protective order curtailing the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">{\u00b6 26} Although we acknowledge that the trial court is invested with substantial discretion in determining the scope and extent of discovery it will permit in connection with a summary judgment motion in a case involving a good-faith-settlement defense to a contribution claim, we conclude that the trial court in this case acted unreasonably, and therefore abused its discretion, when it refused to permit the University to take a deposition of Morgan, one of the two parties to the settlement agreement with Cohen. The University\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">{\u00b6 27} The University\u2019s first and second assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cBy granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court deprived appellant of its property interest in its cause of action without due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and without due course of law under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">{\u00b6 30} In these assignments of error, the University appears to be arguing that even considering the state of the evidence without including any evidence that it might have obtained as the result of the discovery it was prevented from conducting, the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment. In general, where a judgment of a trial court is reversed because of a prejudicial error in the course of the proceedings, the appropriate remedy is to reverse the judgment and remand the proceedings to be resumed at the point where the error occurred. <em>Rickman Bros. v. Amalgamated Workers </em>(1956), 101 Ohio App. 459, 465, 1 O.O.2d 385, 132 N.E.2d 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">{\u00b6 31} In sustaining the University\u2019s third assignment of error, we have concluded that the trial court erred, to the University\u2019s prejudice, when it entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>an order precluding the University from taking Morgan\u2019s deposition for purposes of responding to Morgan\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In applying the general rule concerning the proper remedy where a judgment of a trial court is reversed because of a procedural error, we conclude that the University\u2019s first and second assignments of error are moot. Upon remand, the trial court will permit Morgan\u2019s deposition to be taken, while perhaps limiting the scope and extent of that deposition. The parties may then have additional evidence to submit to the trial court in support of, and in opposition to, Morgan\u2019s motion for summary judgment, thereby mooting the first and second assignments of error, which depend upon the state of the evidence currently in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">{\u00b6 32} The University\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">{\u00b6 33} The University\u2019s third assignment of error having been sustained, and its first and second assignments of error having been overruled as moot, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b76-9\">Brogan, P. J., and Wolff, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-15\">. R.C. 2307.32 has since been repealed. R.C. 2307.28, enacted when R.C. 2307.32 was repealed, contains similar language, which would appear to have the same impact upon the issue of the University\u2019s contribution claim against Morgan. In any event, the parties in this case malte their arguments based upon R.C. 2307.32.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
