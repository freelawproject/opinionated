She also contends that the trial court improperly failed to maintain jurisdiction over the matter and that the trial court erred by giving full faith and credit to a prior Indiana guardianship judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">{\u00b6 3} For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the trial court did not improperly terminate the Ohio guardianship, given that a prior guardianship proceeding was ongoing in Indiana. We further conclude that the trial court did not give preclusive effect to the Indiana judgment, but merely found that the matter could be more effectively disposed of by the Indiana court. We conclude that the trial court did not determine that it lacked jurisdiction over Elizabeth Replogle, but merely determined that the better forum for the guardianship proceeding was in the Indiana court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">{\u00b6 4} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">{\u00b6 5} The record in this case is sparse. The relevant facts are gleaned from the pleadings. Elizabeth Replogle is a 41-year-old mentally retarded adult who was born in Indiana and has resided there for most of her life. Beginning in 1982, an Indiana court appointed a guardian for Replogle. In 1990, the Indiana court appointed Replogle\u2019s mother, Jeanenne Zierer, as guardian. In January 2004, Elizabeth\u2019s sister, Nancy Smith, filed a petition in the Indiana court seeking to have Zierer removed as the guardian. The petition contained allegations of abuse perpetrated by Zierer against Replogle. Within two weeks of the filing of the removal petition, Replogle was moved to a nursing home facility in Darke County, Ohio. The move was made without notice to, or approval of, the Indiana court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Following Replogle\u2019s removal to Ohio, proceedings were initiated in Indiana, seeking her return to that state. A hearing was held, and on May 25, 2004, the Indiana court entered an order requiring Zierer to return Replogle to Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">{\u00b6 7} Immediately thereafter, Jennie Lee Clark filed the guardianship action with which this appeal is concerned in the Darke County Court of Common Pleas, Probate Division.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Clark asked the court to appoint her as Replogle\u2019s guardian. An ex parte judgment entry was entered, appointing Clark as the emergency guardian of Replogle for a limited time. Smith then filed a motion with the Ohio court, seeking to have the court give full faith and credit to the Indiana guardianship and seeking termination of the Ohio guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court entered an order terminating the guardianship action filed by Clark. The trial court stated that it felt there was something \u201cfishy\u201d about Clark\u2019s action and further stated that Zierer should obey the mandate of the Indiana court requiring Replogle\u2019s return to Indiana. However, the court stayed its order pending a determination by the Indiana court as to where Replogle should be located. The trial court stated that it would accept jurisdiction of this matter only if the Indiana court determined that Replogle should remain in Darke County.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">{\u00b6 9} From this order, Clark appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">{\u00b6 10} Clark\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting appellee Nancy Smith\u2019s motion to terminate the guardianship filed by appellant Jennie Lee Clark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">{\u00b6 12} Clark\u2019s argument in this assignment of error focuses solely on her claim that the trial court incorrectly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to appoint a guardian for Replogle. In support, Clark argues that Replogle was a resident of Darke County at the time of the appointment. Thus, she argues that the trial court had jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to R.C. 2111.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 2111.02(A) provides, \u201cWhen found necessary, the probate court * * * on application by any interested party shall appoint * * * a guardian of the person, the estate, or both, of a minor or incompetent, provided the person for whom the guardian is to be appointed is a resident of the county or has a legal settlement in the county * * The statute, thus, prevents a court from providing a guardian for a ward who does not reside or have a legal settlement in the county. For purposes of the guardianship statute, \u201c[rjesidence requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>actual physical presence at some abode coupled with an intent to remain at that place for some period of time.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of Fisher </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 212, 215, 632 N.E.2d 533. \u201c \u2018[Ljegal settlement\u2019 connotes living in an area with some degree of permanency greater than a visit lasting a few days or weeks.\u201d Id. at 216, 632 N.E.2d 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">{\u00b6 14} Clark\u2019s argument misconstrues the judgment of the trial court. While the trial court noted that the issue of Replogle\u2019s residency was difficult to determine under the facts of this case, in no way did the trial court determine that it lacked jurisdiction over this matter. The court merely decided that given the state of the proceedings in Indiana, the issue of Replogle\u2019s best interest could more appropriately be determined by the Indiana courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">{\u00b6 15} We also note that, under the facts of this record, Clark has failed to establish clearly that Replogle resides or has a legal settlement in Darke County. While there is evidence that Replogle has been in a care facility located in Darke County for approximately five months, the record also indicates the possibility that Zierer moved Replogle to Ohio solely for the purpose of avoiding the termination of her status as guardian in Indiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">{\u00b6 16} Given the state of the record in this case, and given that the trial court did not, as Clark contends, decide that it lacks jurisdiction over this matter, we find this assignment of error without merit. The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">{\u00b6 17} Clark\u2019s fourth assignment of error provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe trial court erred by giving full faith and credit to an Indiana order which was never properly authenticated as part of the court record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">{\u00b6 19} Clark contends that the trial court erred because it gave full faith and credit to the Indiana guardianship order, despite the fact that the Indiana record was not properly certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">{\u00b6 20} Ohio\u2019s foreign judgment enforcement provision is set forth in R.C. 2329.022. That statute provides, \u201cA copy of any foreign judgment authenticated in accordance with section 1738 of Title 28 of the United States Code, 62 Stat. 947 (1948), may be filed with the clerk of any court of common pleas. The clerk shall treat the foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment of a court of common pleas. A foreign judgment filed pursuant to this section has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a judgment of a court of common pleas and may be enforced or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of a court of common pleas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Section 1738, Title 28, U.S.Code provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe records and judicial proceedings of any court of any such State, Territory or Possession, or copies thereof, shall be proved or admitted in other courts within the United States and its Territories and Possessions by the attestation of the clerk and seal of the court annexed, if a seal exists, together with a certificate of a judge of the court that the said attestation is in proper form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">{\u00b6 23} In this case, it appears that the judgment of the Indiana court was not properly authenticated because Smith failed to attach a judge\u2019s certification in accord with the statutory requirements. However, Clark failed to raise any objections to the foreign judgment at the trial-court level. A failure to preserve error regarding the proper authentication of a foreign judgment waives the matter for purposes of appeal. See <em>Rose v. U.S. Vend </em>(Jan. 14, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 61626, 1993 WL 7931. Therefore, we need not consider this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">{\u00b6 24} Smith argues that the trial court was required to give preclusive effect to the Indiana judgment under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Section 1, Article IV of the United States Constitution. But the forum state is not required by this clause to give a foreign judgment more preclusive effect than it would have in the rendering state. <em>Kovacs v. Brewer </em>(1958), 356 U.S. 604, 607, 78 S.Ct. 963, 2 L.Ed.2d 1008. Because a guardianship order is obviously modifiable in the rendering state, it is necessarily modifiable in the forum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">{\u00b6 25} In any event, as pointed out in Part IV below, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order does not give preclusive effect to the Indiana order, but merely defers to the Indiana court as being a better forum in which to determine Replogle\u2019s best interest. Thus, we conclude that this assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">{\u00b6 26} The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">{\u00b6 27} Clark\u2019s second and third assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">{\u00b628} \u201cThe trial court erred by giving full faith and credit to the Indiana order.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe trial court erred by failing to maintain jurisdiction over the ward, notwithstanding the fact that the Indiana guardianship proceedings were pending at the time of the filing of the Ohio application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">{\u00b6 30} Clark argues that because the Ohio court had jurisdiction over the guardianship filed in Darke County, it acted erroneously by rejecting that jurisdiction and by accepting the Indiana judgment. In support, she claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>once Replogle had become a resident of Ohio, the Darke County court acquired jurisdiction over her. She also cites <em>In re Meucci </em>(Dec. 26, 2000), Butler App. No. CA2000-08-046, 2000 WL 1875787, for the proposition that the Darke County court may appropriately exercise jurisdiction despite the fact that \u201cprior proceedings had been filed in a sister state at the time of the application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">{\u00b6 31} We begin by noting that <em>Meucci </em>is not dispositive. In that case, the ward, Elizabeth Meucci, had lived most of her life in Pennsylvania. However, after the death of her husband, she moved to California to reside with her daughter Barbara. Elizabeth then moved to New Jersey and lived with her other daughter, Donna. Subsequently, Barbara and Elizabeth moved to Butler County, Ohio, where they resided together.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">{\u00b6 32} Donna filed a guardianship application in Pennsylvania, seeking an appointment as guardian for her mother. However, the Pennsylvania court was unable to obtain jurisdiction, and the action was not pursued. <em>Meucci, </em>supra. Subsequently, Barbara filed a guardianship action in Ohio and was appointed guardian. Donna then filed a motion to set aside the guardianship upon the grounds that Elizabeth was not a resident of Ohio and that a prior action had been filed in Pennsylvania. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">{\u00b6 33} On appeal, the Butler County Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by appointing a guardian because the record demonstrated that Elizabeth intended to reside in Butler County and because Donna failed to provide authority for her contention that the prior action barred the Ohio action. <em>Meucci, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">{\u00b6 34} In this case, there is no dispute that the Indiana court had jurisdiction over the matter at the time the guardianship was filed there. Furthermore, the record does not positively establish that Replogle intended to reside in Darke County. Upon this record, it is possible to find that Replogle was moved to Darke County in order to avoid the Indiana court\u2019s rulings. Additionally, we conclude that upon this record, one could infer that Clark\u2019s guardianship action was filed in order to mount a collateral attack upon the Indiana judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">{\u00b6 35} We cannot say that the trial court inappropriately declined to exercise jurisdiction over this matter. The trial court was within its discretion in finding that Indiana, where Replogle\u2019s guardianship had been pending for years, was a more convenient forum than Ohio, to which Replogle had been recently removed in what appeared to be an attempt to circumvent proceedings in the Indiana court relating to an effort to remove the guardian upon allegations of abuse. See <em>Chambers v. Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 123, 519 N.E.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">{\u00b6 36} The second and third assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">{\u00b6 37} All of Clark\u2019s assignments of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b101-6\">Brogan, P.J., and Young, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b101-7\">Frederick N.
