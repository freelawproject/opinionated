(\u201cDominion\u201d) and Dominion Home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Financial Services, Inc. (\u201cDHFS\u201d). For the following reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">{\u00b6 2} During the summer of 2000, the Walkers were searching for a site on which to build a new house, a builder to construct the house, and financing to purchase the site and pay for the construction. In the midst of this search, the Walkers were attracted to advertisements for Dominion that publicized the \u201c2-1 buydown\u201d loan program, whereby a qualified individual could receive a 30-year mortgage loan from a conventional lender at low interest rates. Under this program, the interest rate for the first year\u2019s payments would be 5.125 percent, the rate for the second year\u2019s payments 6.125 percent, and the rate for the third through 13th years\u2019 payments 7.125 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 3} In August 2000, the Walkers met with Denise Buede, a salesperson for Dominion, to discuss building a home in the Highland Lakes subdivision in Westerville, Ohio. The Walkers told Buede that they were interested in the 2-1 buydown program. After discussing the details of the program with the Walkers, Buede stated that she believed the Walkers would qualify for conventional financing under the program and that she would \u201clook in on\u201d the 5.125 percent starting interest rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 4} On August 13, 2000, Lisa Walker completed the \u201cMortgage Application Summary/Pre-Qualification Worksheet,\u201d the initial step required to apply for financing through DHFS. In this document, Lisa Walker disclosed her yearly income and authorized DHFS to obtain her credit reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 5} The next day, Deena Crawford, then a loan counselor with DHFS, received and reviewed a MCS credit services credit report for the Walkers. The credit report disclosed that both Walkers had low credit scores due to high credit balances, delinquency on their credit accounts, the referral of some of their credit accounts to collections, and other credit problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 6} Based upon her review of the credit report, Crawford drafted a confidential opinion letter in which she provided an opinion as to the Walkers\u2019 ability to qualify for a mortgage loan. Crawford indicated that the Walkers fell into the \u201cpossibly approved\u201d category of home buyers, meaning that \u201c[i]ssues with credit, income, or assets need[ed] [to be] resolved for [final loan] approval.\u201d Further, Crawford wrote \u201cFHA\u201d next to \u201csuggested programs\u201d and stated that the Walkers could not \u201cgo conforming conventional\u201d because their \u201cscores [were] too low.\u201d In an affidavit, Crawford explained that by these comments, she meant that \u201cthe Walkers might be able to be approved under FHA or a non-conforming loan program but not under the [2-1 buy-down] program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Crawford faxed the confidential opinion letter to Buede on August 14, 2000. Neither Buede nor Crawford disclosed to the Walkers the information contained in the confidential opinion letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">{\u00b6 8} On August 20, 2000, the Walkers met with Buede to sign the home purchase agreement. In that agreement, Dominion agreed to pay the loan-commitment fee charged by the lender if a certain section of the agreement, which was originally left blank, was completed. In the Walkers\u2019 home-purchase agreement, the relevant section was completed with the information that DHFS was the proposed first-mortgage lender and the 2-1 buydown program was the proposed loan program.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 9} The home-purchase agreement required Dominion to give written consent before the lender could lock in an interest rate. Thus, on the same day that the Walkers signed the home-purchase agreement, they also signed a document entitled \u201cSeller\u2019s Consent to Lock Rate,\u201d in which they requested, and Dominion consented to, a 90-day rate lock for a conventional loan under the 2-1 buydown program at the 5.125 percent, 6.125 percent, and 7.125 percent interest rates. The Walkers also completed a loan-registration form, which DHFS required before it would guarantee an interest rate. Like the seller\u2019s-consent-to-lock-rate form, the loan-registration form referred to the 2-1 buydown program.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">(\u00b6 10} The Walkers maintain that they believed that they would qualify for the 2-1 buydown program based upon their discussion with Buede regarding the program, the seller\u2019s consent-to-lock-rate form, and the loan-registration form. If the Walkers had known they would not likely qualify for the 2-1 buy-down program, they would have refused to contract with Dominion. Moreover, Lisa Walker testified in her affidavit that the 2-1 buy-down program was the primary influence on the Walkers\u2019 decision to select Dominion instead of another builder.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 11} After the Walkers signed the home-purchase agreement, they met with Crawford to begin the processing of their application for the 2-1 buydown program. Lisa Walker testified in her affidavit that she questioned Crawford regarding whether the Walkers would have difficulty qualifying for the 2-1 buy-down program. Crawford responded that approval turned upon whether DHFS would be able to verify the Walkers\u2019 income and whether the Walkers were to pay certain tax liens and provide an explanation regarding a delinquent payment on one of their credit accounts. The Walkers then paid the tax liens and provided the explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 12} According to Lisa Walker, DHFS did not inform the Walkers that they did not qualify for the 2-1 buydown program until October 10, 2000 \u2014 about ten days before the scheduled closing. Upon discovering that they did not qualify, the Walkers asked various Dominion representatives whether Dominion would release them from the home-purchase agreement. Dominion refused and threat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>ened the Walkers with the loss of their deposit ($2,700) if they did not close within a short time.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">{\u00b6 13} DHFS did offer the Walkers another loan, but at a higher rate and contingent upon the Walkers\u2019 making a 20 percent down payment. The Walkers declined this offer, and instead obtained from another lender a 30-year fixed mortgage loan with an interest rate of 8.375 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 14} On September 10, 2002, the Walkers filed suit against Dominion and DHFS, alleging violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cCSPA\u201d), breach of contract, and promissory estoppel. The Walkers alleged that defendants deceived them regarding financing, provided them with a defective home, and failed to reimburse them for damages incurred because of the defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 15} On June 19, 2003, defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment in which they sought judgment in their favor with respect to the CSPA, breach-of-contract, and promissory-estoppel claims pertaining to the financing of the Walkers\u2019 home. On February 3, 2004, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion so that the only claims that remained to be resolved at trial were the CSPA, breach-of-contract, and promissory-estoppel claims pertaining to defects in the Walkers\u2019 home, and property damage. The Walkers voluntarily dismissed these remaining claims, however, thus converting the trial court\u2019s February 3, 2004 decision into a final appealable order. The Walkers now appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 16} On appeal, the Walkers assign the following errors:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">1. The trial court erred in concluding that defendants did not violate the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cCSPA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">2. The trial court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that no implied duty of good faith existed on the part of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">{\u00b6 17} Appellate review of summary judgment motions is de novo. <em>Helton v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 158, 162, 703 N.E.2d 841. \u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, the court of appeals conducts an independent review of the record and stands in the shoes of the trial court.\u201d <em>Mergenthal v. Star Banc Corp. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 100, 103, 701 N.E.2d 383. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that summary judgment may be granted when the moving party demonstrates that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">{\u00b6 18} When seeking summary judgment' on the ground that the nonmoving party cannot prove its case, the moving party bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on an essential element of the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. The moving party does not discharge this initial burden under Civ.R. 56 by simply making a conclusory allegation that the nonmoving party has no evidence to prove its case. Id.; <em>Vahila v. Hall </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 429, 674 N.E.2d 1164. Rather, the moving party must affirmatively demonstrate by affidavit or other evidence allowed by Civ.R. 56(C) that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party\u2019s claims. <em>Dresher, </em>supra, at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. If the moving party meets this initial burden, then the nonmoving party has a reciprocal burden outlined in Civ.R. 56(E) to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial and, if the nonmovant does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the nonmoving party. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 19} By their first assignment of error, the Walkers argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the Walkers\u2019 claim that defendants violated the CSPA. The Walkers maintain that they produced sufficient evidence to create questions of fact regarding whether defendants committed unfair, deceptive, and/or unconscionable acts in connection with the sale of the Walkers\u2019 new home.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 20} The CSPA prohibits \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d and \u201cunconscionable\u201d acts or practices by suppliers in consumer transactions. <em>Einhorn v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 27, 29, 548 N.E.2d 933. Designed to compensate for traditional consumer remedies, the CSPA gives protection to consumers from \u201cunscrupulous suppliers\u201d in a more expedient and affordable manner than a tort or contract action under the common law. Id.; <em>Roelle v. Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc. </em>(Nov. 7, 2000), Franklin App. No. 00AP-14, 2000 WL 1664865. Given its remedial purposes to protect the consumer and promote fairness, the CSPA must be liberally construed in favor of consumers. <em>Einhorn </em>at 29, 548 N.E.2d 933; <em>Lee v. C.D.E. Home Inspection Co., Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 00AP-516, 2002-Ohio-4316, 2002 WL 1938248, at \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 21} Pursuant to R.C. 1345.02(A), \u201c[n]o supplier shall commit an unfair or deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction. Such an unfair or deceptive act or practice by a supplier violates this section whether it occurs before, during, or after the transaction.\u201d Although R.C. 1345.02(B) lists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>specific deceptive acts and practices, that list does not limit the broad prohibition contained in R.C. 1345.02(A). Indeed, the list in R.C. 1345.02(B) is augmented by rules adopted by the Ohio Attorney General. R.C. 1345.05(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 22} In the case at bar, the Walkers argue that defendants\u2019 actions were unfair or deceptive in four different ways. First, the Walkers argue that defendants\u2019 actions were deceptive pursuant to R.C. 1345.02(B)(1) and (5), which state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">[T]he act or practice of a supplier in representing any of the following is deceptive:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">(1) That the subject of a consumer transaction has * * * benefits that it does not have;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">(5) That the subject of a consumer transaction has been supplied in accordance with a previous representation, if it has not[.] * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">We disagree. Defendants never guaranteed to the Walkers that they would qualify for the 2-1 buydown program. Many of the documents the Walkers signed, including the \u201cMortgage Application Summary/Pre-Qualification Worksheet,\u201d explicitly stated that DHFS had not approved the financing the Walkers sought. Accordingly, defendants never represented or promised that the 2-1 buydown program was a benefit included within the home-purchase agreement. Likewise, there was no \u201cprevious representation\u201d made before the home was \u201csupplied\u201d at the closing that the Walkers would receive a loan under the 2-1 buydown terms. Therefore, defendants\u2019 actions did not constitute the type of deception described in R.C. 1345.02(B)(1) or (B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">{\u00b6 23} Second, the Walkers argue that defendants\u2019 actions were deceptive pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-10(A), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-12\">It shall be a deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction for a supplier to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\">(A) Make any representations, claims, or assertions of fact, whether orally or in writing, which would cause a reasonable consumer to believe such statements are true, unless, at the time such representations, claims, or assertions are made, the supplier possess or relies upon a reasonable basis in fact such as factual, objective, quantifiable, clinical or scientific data or other competent and rehable evidence which substantiates such representations, claims, or assertions of fact[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">Again, we disagree. Defendants allegedly made only one representation, claim, or assertion of fact: that the 2-1 buydown program was available to qualified individuals. Not only was this representation true at the time it was made, but it continued to be true throughout the Walkers\u2019 dealings with defendants. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>fore, defendants\u2019 actions did not constitute the type of deception described in Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-10(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 24} Third, the Walkers argue that defendants\u2019 actions were deceptive pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 109:4 \u2014 3\u201403(B)(1), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">It shall be a deceptive and unfair act or practice for a supplier to make an offer of sale of any goods or services when such offer is not a bona fide effort to sell such goods or services. An offer is not bona fide if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">(1) A supplier uses a statement * * * or makes a representation in any advertisement which would create in the mind of reasonable consumer, a false impression as to * * * [a] material aspect of the offered goods or services in such a manner that, upon subsequent disclosure or discovery of the facts, the consumer may be induced to purchase goods or services other than those offered[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Again, we disagree. The advertisement of the 2-1 buydown program did not constitute an offer. Rather, the advertisement merely informed potential purchasers of available loan terms and invited them to apply for the program. See <em>Ehrlich v. Willis Music Co. </em>(1952), 93 Ohio App. 246, 247, 51 O.O. 8, 113 N.E.2d 252. After application and approval, DHFS offered loans under the terms of the 2-1 buydown program to qualified purchasers \u2014 a group that did not include the Walkers. As no offer was ever made to the Walkers, defendants\u2019 actions did not constitute the type of deception described in Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-03(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 25} Finally, the Walkers argue that defendants\u2019 actions were unfair or deceptive pursuant to the broad prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts and practices contained in R.C. 1345.02. Generally, an act or practice is deceptive if it \u201c \u2018has the likelihood of inducing in the mind of the consumer a belief which is not in accord with the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee, </em>supra, 2002-Ohio-4316, 2002 WL 1938248, at \u00b6 30, quoting <em>Funk v. Montgomery AMC/Jeep Renault </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 815, 823, 586 N.E.2d 1113. An act or practice is unfair if it is marked by injustice, partiality, or deception, or it results in inequitable business dealings. <em>Saraf v. Maronda Homes, Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-461, 2002-Ohio-6741, 2002 WL 31750249, at \u00b6 58. In determining whether an act or practice is either unfair or deceptive, a court must focus upon how the consumer views the act or practice, and not whether the supplier intended to be unfair or deceptive. <em>Lee, </em>at \u00b6 30; <em>Smaldino v. Larsick </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 691, 697, 630 N.E.2d 408; <em>Frey v. Vin Devers, Inc. </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 1, 6, 608 N.E.2d 796; <em>Funk, </em>supra, at 823, 586 N.E.2d 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">{\u00b626} Here, construing the facts in the Walkers\u2019 favor, we find that a reasonable person could conclude that defendants unfairly led the Walkers to believe that they might qualify for the 2-1 buydown program, when, in fact, they could not qualify. Dominion\u2019s first representation regarding the 2-1 buydown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>program \u2014 that the Walkers \u201cprobably\u201d would qualify \u2014 was arguably truthful when Buede made it. However, only days after Buede made that representation, Crawford drafted the confidential opinion letter, which the Walkers interpret as DHFS\u2019s refusal to approve them for any conventional loan, including a loan under the 2-1 buydown program, because their credit scores were too low. The Walkers\u2019 interpretation of the confidential opinion letter is supported by the letter itself, which states without qualification that the Walkers could not \u201cgo conforming conventional.\u201d Additionally, the Walkers\u2019 interpretation is supported by Crawford\u2019s explanation that the letter meant that \u201cthe Walkers would not be able to be qualified under DHFS\u2019s conforming, conventional loan programs\u201d and that \u201cthe Walkers might be able to be approved under FHA or a non-conforming loan program but not under the [2-1 buy-down] program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 27} If on August 14, 2000, HFS foreclosed the possibility that the Walkers might qualify for the 2-1 buydown program, then defendants misled the Walkers with their subsequent actions. First, Buede misled the Walkers when she gave them the seller\u2019s-consent-to-lock-rate form and loan-registration form to sign on August 20, 2000, the same day the Walkers executed the home-purchase agreement. Both forms related to the \u201c2-1 buydown\u201d program, and by asking the Walkers to sign them, Dominion tacitly represented to the Walkers that they might qualify for the program, even though DHFS had already determined that they could not. Second, Crawford misled the Walkers when she told them during the application process that the only impediments to the Walkers\u2019 receiving a loan under the 2-1 buydown program was the verification of their income, the payment of tax liens, and an explanation of a delinquent credit account.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 28} Defendants, however, argue that they did not mislead the Walkers because DHFS did not definitively deny the Walkers\u2019 application for the 2-1 buydown program until late October 2000. Defendants assert that the confidential opinion letter merely reflected DHFS\u2019 preliminary review of the Walkers\u2019 creditworthiness, and it was not a final determination that the Walkers could not qualify for the 2-1 buydown program. Because it only stated DHFS\u2019s initial opinion, defendants interpret the letter to leave open the possibility that the Walkers could qualify if they provided an explanation of certain credit lapses and information showing that they had sufficient income and assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 29} Thus, whether or not defendants committed unfair or deceptive acts turns upon the meaning of the confidential opinion letter. If the letter communicated that the Walkers could not qualify for the 2-1 buydown program, then defendants\u2019 subsequent actions could be viewed as unfair or deceptive. If, however, the letter only communicated that it was unlikely that the Walkers could qualify for the 2-1 buydown program, then defendants were merely encouraging the Walkers to apply for the most advantageous financing they could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>possibly obtain. Given the parties\u2019 differing interpretations of the confidential opinion letter, we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether defendants\u2019 actions were unfair or deceptive under R.C. 1345.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">{\u00b6 30} In addition to asserting that defendants\u2019 actions were unfair or deceptive, the Walkers also assert that defendants\u2019 actions were unconscionable. Pursuant to R.C. 1345.03(A), \u201c[n]o supplier shall commit an unconscionable act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction.\u201d In determining whether an act is unconscionable, a court must consider a variety of circumstances, including \u201c[wjhether the supplier knew at the time the consumer transaction was entered into of the inability of the consumer to receive a substantial benefit from the subject of the consumer transaction.\u201d R.C. 1345.03(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 31} Here, based upon the evidence described above, a reasonable person could find that defendants knew at the time the parties executed the home-purchase agreement that the Walkers would be unable to receive financing under the 2-1 buydown program. Because the evidence establishes that the program was the primary reason the Walkers chose to contract with Dominion and the Walkers would not have contracted with Dominion had they known they would not qualify for the program, a reasonable person could find that the 2-1 buydown program was a substantial benefit to the Walkers in the purchase of their home. Therefore, genuine issues of material fact exist that also prevent summary judgment on the Walkers\u2019 claim that defendants violated R.C. 1345.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, we note that defendants argue that they did not violate any provision of the CSPA because they did not have a \u201cduty to disclose\u201d any information regarding financing to the Walkers. We find this argument unavailing. The duty at issue here is the duty to refrain from unfair, deceptive, or unconscionable acts. R.C. 1345.02 and 1345.03. The trier of fact can certainly consider the failure to disclose information in determining whether the defendant committed an unfair, deceptive, or unconscionable act. The Walkers were not required to establish that defendants owed them an independent \u201cduty to disclose.\u201d Moreover, in the case at bar, the Walkers\u2019 CSPA claims are based, at least in part, on what defendants represented to them regarding their ability to obtain 2-1 buydown program financing for the purchase of their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 33} Because we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor on the Walkers\u2019 CSPA claim, we sustain the Walkers\u2019 first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 34} By their second assignment of error, the Walkers argue that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the breach-of-contract claim. The Walkers assert that the home-purchase agreement contained an implied duty of good faith that defendants breached when they did not inform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the Walkers that they would not receive financing through the 2-1 buydown program before they entered into the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 35} Even if we were to impose an implied-in-law duty of good faith in these circumstances, the Walkers present no evidence that defendants breached this duty. A duty of good faith originates from a contractual relationship. See <em>Ed Schory &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Soc. Natl. Bank </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 433, 444, 662 N.E.2d 1074. Thus, logically, such a duty cannot exist until the underlying contract is formed. Here, the Walkers claim that defendants \u201cbreached\u201d the duty of good faith during the formation of the home-purchase agreement, <em>before </em>any contract, or corresponding duty of good faith, existed. Because defendants cannot breach a not-yet existing duty, the trial court properly granted defendants summary judgment on the Walkers\u2019 breach-of-contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 36} Accordingly, we overrule the Walkers\u2019 second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 37} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain the Walkers\u2019 first assignment of error and overrule their second assignment of error. With respect to the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the breach-of-contract claim, we affirm the February 3, 2004 judgment. However, with respect to the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the CSPA claim, we reverse the February 3, 2004 judgment and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with law and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-9\">Brown, P.J., and Bryant, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-13\">. Notably, in this appeal, the Walkers do not challenge, and we do not review, the judgment in defendants' favor on the promissory-estoppel claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
