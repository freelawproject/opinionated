Siler\u2019s appeal from his conviction and sentence for murder in the Court of Common Pleas, Ashland County, Ohio. The appellee is the state of Ohio. The relevant procedural facts leading to this appeal are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">{\u00b6 2} In the early afternoon of Thursday, September 20, 2001, the body of Barbara Siler, the estranged wife of appellant, was discovered hanging by a rope from an overhead door track in her garage in Ashland, Ohio. Nathan Siler, the three-year-old son of appellant and Barbara, was found sleeping in another room. On December 12, 2001, the Ashland County Grand Jury handed down a seven-count indictment against appellant, including aggravated murder and child endangering. Following a five-day trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. Following a mitigation hearing on June 11, 2002, the jury recommended a sentence of death. Nonetheless, the trial court sentenced appellant to life in prison without parole. On July 29,2002, appellant filed a notice of appeal, raising 13 assignments of error. On October 24, 2003, this court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding inter alia that the trial court did not commit reversible error in allowing Ashland County Sheriffs Detective Larry Martin\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>concerning Nathan Siler\u2019s statements made to him on September 20, 2001, as excited utterances under Evid.R. 803(2). See <em>State v. Siler, </em>Ashland App. No. 02COA028, 2003-Ohio-5749, 2003 WL 22429053 <em>(\u201cSiler I </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 3} The Ohio Supreme Court thereafter declined to accept review of appellant\u2019s case. See <em>State v. Siler, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1489, 2004-Ohio-1293, 805 N.E.2d 539. The court thereafter also denied reconsideration of that decision. See <em>State v. Siler, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 1462, 2004-Ohio-2569, 809 N.E.2d 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 4} Appellant then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. On December 6, 2004, the United States Supreme Court ordered that the judgment be vacated and that the cause be remanded to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354,158 L.Ed.2d 177. See <em>Siler v. Ohio </em>(2004), 543 U.S. 1019, 125 S.Ct. 671, 160 L.Ed.2d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">{\u00b6 5} Accordingly, appellant herein sets forth the following sole assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cI. The trial court erred in permitting Nathan Siler\u2019s hearsay statements to Detective Martin to be admitted as excited utterances, thereby depriving Mr. Siler of his right to confront witnesses, as guaranteed by the 6th and 14th Amendments, U.S. Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">{\u00b6 7} In his sole assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court allowance of police testimony concerning out-of-court statements made by the child of the victim and appellant deprived appellant of his constitutional right to confront witnesses guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In light of <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that testimonial statements of a witness who does not appear at trial may not be admitted or used against a criminal defendant unless the declarant is unavailable to testify and the defendant has had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. The remand in the case sub judice from the United States Supreme Court solely directs us to reconsider our prior decision \u201cin light of <em>Crawford.\u201d </em>See <em>Siler v. Ohio </em>(2004), 543 U.S. 1019, 125 S.Ct. 671, 160 L.Ed.2d 494. Thus, the pressing question before us is whether the child\u2019s statements to Detective Martin were \u201ctestimonial.\u201d If we should answer that question in the affirmative, we would then proceed to consider whether the child was unavailable and whether defense counsel had been given a prior opportunity to cross-examine him. We would also proceed to a consideration of whether the allowance of the statements constituted mere harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>error. If, on the other hand, we were to conclude that the child\u2019s statements are nontestimonial, we would be compelled to affirm appellant\u2019s conviction, because we have previously determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing them into evidence as \u201cexcited utterances\u201d under Evid.R. 803(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">{\u00b6 9} <em>Crawford </em>does not provide a precise definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d evidence. On the one hand, the Supreme Court recited one definition as \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d Id., 541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, citing Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 3. Since in the case sub judice we are dealing with a young child witness, we are confronted with the question of whether any three-year-old child witness would ever have the intellectual maturity to understand that his statements to an officer were going to be used in a later trial, as would an objective adult. Indeed, \u201c[cjourts around the nation have struggled with the application of <em>Crawford </em>to child witnesses, particularly how courts should apply the [aforesaid] concept * * * or whether the proper test should be objective or subjective in nature.\u201d <em>Lagunas v. State </em>(Aug. 26, 2005), Tex.App.-Austin No. 03-03-00566-CR, 2005 WL 2043678,-S.W.3d -. Ohio appellate courts have recognized that younger children have lesser reflective capabilities. See, e.g., <em>State v. Wagner </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 261, 30 OBR 458, 508 N.E.2d 164. In a related vein, it is generally recognized that admissions and confessions of juveniles require special attention. See <em>In re Harris </em>(June 7, 2000), Tuscarawas App. No.1999AP030013, 2000 WL 748087, citing <em>Haley v. Ohio </em>(1948), 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224. Obviously, the Confrontation Clause on its face makes no distinction as to the age of the witness. However, the Supreme Court, in addressing \u201chearsay exception\u201d statements by young children, has also indicated (although before Crawford) that \u201c[t]o exclude such probative statements under the strictures of the Confrontation Clause would be the height of wrongheadedness, given that the Confrontation Clause has as a basic purpose the promotion of the \u2018integrity of the factfinding process.\u2019 \u201d <em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, 356, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, quoting <em>Coy v. Iowa </em>(1988), 487 U.S. 1012, 1020, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 101 L.Ed.2d 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">{\u00b6 10} On the other hand, the vexing questions of the present case cannot escape the plain fact that the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford </em>did set forth several concrete examples of \u201ctestimonial\u201d evidence: \u201cWhatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. \u201cThe Court noted these practices bore the closest kinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directed, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>wit ex parte examinations of witnesses by justices of the peace.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20368, 2005-Ohio-213, 2005 WL 120054, \u00b6 19. This becomes our main subquestion; in other words, did Detective Martin\u2019s interview of the child constitute an \u201cinterrogation\u201d of a witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">{\u00b6 11} We first observe that the Supreme Court used the term \u201cinterrogation\u201d in its \u201ccolloquial, rather than any technical legal, sense.\u201d See <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, at fn. 4. We also note that the court consistently utilized the term \u201cinterrogation\u201d in the opinion rather than \u201cinterview\u201d or \u201cquestioning.\u201d At first blush, one might easily conceive of \u201cinterrogation\u201d as police questioning involving an actual suspect, which was clearly not the case in the present appeal. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary has defined the term as a \u201cprocess of questions propounded by police to person arrested or suspected to seek solution of crime.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 734. However, the <em>Crawford </em>court, in its analysis of the roots of the Confrontation Clause and the dangers it was designed to prevent, noted that the courts of England at certain times in history adopted elements of the continental civil-law practice, and therefore \u201cjustices of the peace or other officials examined suspects <em>and </em>witnesses before trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 43, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Furthermore, \u201c[t]here is no requirement that a peace officer take someone into custody as a prerequisite to interrogating him.\u201d <em>State v. Martin </em>(2003), 151 Ohio App.3d 605, 619, 784 N.E.2d 1237. Hence, we conclude that \u201cinterrogation\u201d as defined in <em>Crawford </em>applies to questioning of both suspects and witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">{\u00b6 12} The <em>Crawford </em>court further observed that \u201c[j]ust as various definitions of \u2018testimonial\u2019 exist, one can imagine various definitions of \u2018interrogation\u2019 * * *.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, fn. 4. The court therein declined to further select a definition, because under the facts of that case, the recorded statement made to police by Michael Crawford\u2019s wife, Sylvia, \u201cknowingly given in response to <em>structured police questioning, </em>qualifies under any conceivable definition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">{\u00b6 13} In the case sub judice, Detective Martin came upon the scene at about 2:00 p.m. on September 20, 2001, and commenced his interview with Nathan about 20 minutes later. He testified at trial that he had received training in interviewing young children. The state\u2019s presentation at trial of Martin\u2019s interviewing procedure is set forth as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cQ. Are there things you do, Detective, to attempt to facilitate a conversation with a child to make it easier for the child?</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201cQ. Tell the jury some of the things you do to make it easier for the child?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cA. Well, basically I try to like find out their likes, dislikes. Get a basic knowledge of the child. Try to listen intensely as the child is speaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cI\u2019ve never spoken to a lot of these kids I have spoken to before. Get an understanding how well they receive information. How well they are able to relate that information back to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cA lot of times I\u2019ll go one-on-one conversation, which means I use anywhere from baby dolls to teddy bears, things of that nature, to have the child actually talk to a teddy bear or something of that nature instead of talking to an adult. Have him concentrate just looking at the teddy bear like it was the teddy bear he was talking to and not I as a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cI also try to get down to their level, which means if somebody is sitting in a chair, I\u2019ll get lower than they are so the child is not looking up at me. They\u2019re looking down at me. If they are on the ground, I\u2019ll get on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ. In this case when you initially approached Nathan, he was on his grandpa\u2019s lap, sitting on the ground, correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. How did you talk to him physically? How were you positioned?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. I laid down on my stomach and was talking to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Was Nathan eventually able to tell you his name?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. And his age?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-16\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. Yes.'</p>\n<p id=\"b725-17\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ. What he liked to do?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-19\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ. What type of questions do you attempt to ask when you\u2019re interviewing a child?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-20\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. Attempt to locate \u2014 or attempt to identify what information the child might have as to what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-21\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cQ. Did you ask Nathan anything about the evening before?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-22\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA. I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-23\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cQ. What did you ask Nathan?</p>\n<p id=\"b725-24\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cA. Basically what he had did the night before, where he had went.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-25\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cQ. Did he tell you what he had done the night before?</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>{\u00b6 38} \u201cA. He did.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cQ. What did he tell you he had done the night before?</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cA. Went to the fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cQ. And who did he say he had gone to the fair with did he tell you?</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cA. Mommy and Terrie.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cQ. Did you ask him anything more about the evening before?</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cQ. Tell the jury what you talked about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">{\u00b6 46} Martin continued asking Nathan some questions about the trip to the county fair the night before, then asked him if anything had scared him that night after returning home. Nathan told him, \u201cDaddy did.\u201d Martin then asked him how appellant had scared him, to which the child replied, \u201cKnocking loudly.\u201d When Martin asked him what he meant, Nathan jumped off his grandfather\u2019s lap, where he had been sitting, and ran to the front door to demonstrate. Martin then asked Nathan if anything else had scared him. Nathan replied, \u201cDaddy, mommy fighting.\u201d When asked where this had occurred, Nathan said it had taken place in the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">{\u00b6 47} Martin initially spoke with the child for about 30 to 45 minutes. At that point, Nathan indicated that he was hungry, and Martin also noted that Nathan was behaving as though he wanted to go back into the house to find Barbara. Martin therefore agreed to let Terrie, Barbara\u2019s friend, take the child away from the area to get something to eat. Martin directed Terrie to forbid anyone to question the child during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-14\">{\u00b6 48} When Nathan was brought back to the yard after his meal, Martin, joined by Jenny Taylor, a children\u2019s services investigator, asked Nathan if \u201canyone was hurting mommy\u201d during the prior night\u2019s incident. Nathan stated, \u201cDaddy did.\u201d Martin then asked Nathan some questions, using Taylor as a mock victim. Martin held Taylor in certain fighting positions, finally standing to the back of Taylor and putting his arm around her in a hold position. Martin then asked Nathan, \u201cLike that?\u201d Nathan replied, \u201cUp.\u201d Martin then moved'his arm up towards Taylor\u2019s neck or throat area. At that point, Nathan said, \u201cYes,\u201d and he started crying. Martin finally asked Nathan, in reference to the hanging rope, if he knew who had put the \u201cyellow thing\u201d around Nathan\u2019s mother. Nathan answered that \u201cdaddy\u201d had done it.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">{\u00b6 49} In light of the above testimony, we conclude that Detective Martin\u2019s questioning of Nathan, although resulting in allowable \u201cexcited utterances\u201d under the Ohio Rules of Evidence, was nonetheless a structured police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>interrogation as envisioned in <em>Crawford </em>and therefore constituted testimonial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because there is presently no cognizable dispute concerning whether the child was unavailable for the <em>pre-Crawford </em>trial and whether defense counsel was given a prior opportunity to cross-examine him, and having concluded that Nathan Siler\u2019s statements were testimonial evidence under <em>Crawford, </em>we must now determine whether the Confrontation Clause error was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Flores v. Nevada </em>(Nev.2005), 120 P.3d 1170, 1180, citing <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967), 386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705. In order to make this determination, we must inquire \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 388, 721 N.E.2d 52, citing <em>Chapman, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">{\u00b6 50} Having again reviewed the record, we conclude that the admission of Nathan\u2019s statements was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Certainly, as we noted in <em>Siler I, </em>in the months preceding Barbara\u2019s death, she and appellant had experienced significant marital problems, and appellant had been upset about a terminated affair Barbara had carried on with one of her co-workers. In late July 2001, just two months prior to her death, Barbara obtained a temporary protection order. At that point, appellant moved into the home of his brother, Kevin Siler, and Kevin\u2019s wife. On the evening of September 19, 2001, appellant did some basement remodeling work with Kevin and then watched TV with his brother. Kevin\u2019s wife went to bed at about 4:00 a.m. on September 20, 2001. About 15 minutes later, she awoke to sounds of banging and \u201cclunking\u201d from appellant\u2019s room. When she got up later, appellant and Kevin were gone from the house. Barbara\u2019s body was discovered by a sheriff deputy at about 1:45 p.m. that day, after Barbara\u2019s father had gone to her residence to check on her. The coroner later estimated her time of death as between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. that morning. The outside door into the garage was ajar, as was the door from the garage to the house. Sheriff deputies, interviewing appellant that same day, observed that appellant\u2019s hands had red marks near each thumb and some of his fingers. Appellant also had scratch marks on top of some of his knuckles and on his chest, near his neck. The yellow rope around Barbara\u2019s neck contained traces of DNA, from which appellant could not be excluded as a source. No similar rope was found in the house. Thus, there was a body of circumstantial evidence pointing to appellant, but we find that this remaining evidence, absent Nathan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>statements, does not provide overwhelming proof of appellant\u2019s guilt for purposes of a \u201charmless error\u201d analysis by this court. Cf. <em>State v. Goff, </em>Summit App. No. 21320, 2005-Ohio-339, 2005 WL 236377, \u00b6 12, 13. Even if we were to take into consideration, as the state suggests, Nathan\u2019s statement to Martin that he had seen \u201cmommy, daddy fighting,\u201d an utterance the child made in the early phase of the interview, we would remain unconvinced that the introduction of the remaining statements was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">{\u00b6 51} Therefore, upon further consideration as directed by the United States Supreme Court, we are persuaded that appellant is entitled to a new trial pursuant to <em>Crawford, </em>although we reiterate for purposes of our remand that the Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.\u201d <em>State v. Marbury, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19226, 2004-Ohio-1817, 2004 WL 758404, \u00b6 38, citing <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, fn. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 52} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">{\u00b6 53} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Ashland County, Ohio, is hereby reversed, and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b728-9\">Boggins, P.J., and Gwin, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-5\">. Appellant also argues that a testimonial statement and an excited utterance are mutually exclusive. However, the Indiana appellate case cited by appellant in support, <em>Fowler v. State </em>(Ind.Ct.App.2004), 809 N.E.2d 960, has since been abrogated by the Indiana Supreme Court, which has held that a statement that qualifies as an excited utterance is not necessarily nontestimonial under the Confrontation Clause. See <em>Hammon v. State </em>(Ind.2005), 829 N.E.2d 444.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
