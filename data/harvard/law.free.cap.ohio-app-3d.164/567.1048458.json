Nalls contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his application. He further contends that the trial court erred by ruling on the application without first permitting him to file a reply to the state\u2019s memorandum, in which the state opposed his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the trial court did err by cutting off Nails\u2019s right, under the trial court\u2019s local rules of procedure, to file a responsive pleading in opposition to the state\u2019s claim that he is not entitled to testing. Thus, we find that we need not address the claim that the trial court erred by denying the claim, because that issue is not yet ripe for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">{\u00b6 3} The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">{\u00b6 4} In 1989, Larry Nalls was convicted of two counts of compelling a woman to engage in sexual conduct with him. This court affirmed the convictions as being supported by the evidence. <em>State v. Nalls </em>(Nov. 9, 1990), Montgomery App. No. 11940, 1990 WL 174154. However, we remanded the matter for resentencing because that Nalls was not provided an opportunity to make a statement prior to the imposition of sentence. Id. On remand, Nalls was sentenced to prison terms \u201cof from six to twenty-five years on each conviction, the terms to run consecutively.\u201d <em>State v. Nalls </em>(Nov. 7, 1991), Montgomery App. No. 12624, 1991 WL 249530. This court affirmed the decision of the trial court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">{\u00b6 5} In 1999, Nalls filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. The order denying his motion for a new trial was affirmed on appeal. <em>State v. Nalls, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19065, 2002-Ohio-2701, 2002 WL 1150832.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">{\u00b6 6} On September 20, 2004, Nalls filed an application for DNA testing. The state filed a memorandum in opposition on November 22, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>2004, the trial court entered an order denying the application. Nalls now appeals from the order denying his application for DNA testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">{\u00b6 7} Nails\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court has committed reversible error, and has violated the appellant\u2019s rights as secured him by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments when it entered its final judgment prior to the expiration of the time for the appellant to submit a reply to the state\u2019s response pursuant to the local rules of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">{\u00b6 9} Nalls contends that the trial court erred by denying his application for DNA testing without first permitting him to file a reply to the state\u2019s response in opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 2958.72(C)(1) allows an inmate to request DNA testing under certain situations. The prosecuting attorney is permitted, but not required, to file a response to the application. R.C. 2953.73(C). There is no dispute that Nalls is eligible to request DNA testing. Once an eligible inmate submits an application for DNA testing, R.C. 2953.73 provides the trial court with jurisdiction to accept or reject the application pursuant to the grounds set forth in R.C. 2953.74.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">{\u00b6 11} Nalls contends that the trial court should not have decided the merits of his application until either he had filed a reply to the state\u2019s response or his time for filing a reply had expired pursuant to Montgomery County C.P.R. 2.05(II)(A)(4). The state contends that the DNA testing statutes do not provide for the filing of a reply and that, therefore, Nalls was not entitled to submit a reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">{\u00b6 12} We agree with Nalls. Specifically, we note that Nalls correctly claims that the local rules permit the filing of a reply to a memorandum opposing a motion. We further note that the Montgomery County rules do not conflict with the provisions of the DNA testing statutes. The trial court\u2019s entry of a judgment prior to the expiration of the time for the filing of the reply effectively cut off Nails\u2019s right to present an argument in opposition of the state\u2019s arguments \u2014 a right afforded him by the trial court\u2019s local rules of procedure. Since the trial court has discretion to accept or deny applications for DNA testing, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s error, in violation of its own local rules of procedure, was harmless. Perhaps Nalls could have persuaded the trial court to exercise in his favor the discretion with which it is invested by the statute.
