On June 8, 1999, appellant was injured while working as a nursing assistant at Toledo Hospital. The next day, appellant was examined and evaluated at OccuHealth, a facility operated by Toledo Hospital, by James Jagger, M.D. The nurse\u2019s note from June 9,1999, states that appellant complained of \u201csevere pain in lower back going into buttocks.\u201d After examining appellant, Jagger prescribed medication and physical therapy and ordered an x-ray of appellant\u2019s lower spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">{\u00b6 27} Later that day, appellant contacted Judy Delores (\u201cDee\u201d) Marino, a worker\u2019s compensation specialist at Toledo Hospital, who offered appellant the option of chiropractic treatment instead of physical therapy. With appellant\u2019s permission, Marino scheduled an appointment for appellant to see Walter P. Grady, D.C., on June 10, 1999. Treatment on that date consisted of manipulation of appellant\u2019s spine and surrounding muscles. Grady did not order additional x-rays of appellant\u2019s spine and did not review the report interpreting results of the x-rays ordered by Jagger.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">{\u00b6 28} On June 16, 1999, appellant returned to OccuHealth, where she was again examined by Jagger. At some time during the visit, appellant told Jagger she was receiving chiropractic treatment from Grady in lieu of physical therapy. Jagger told appellant she could not be treated by two physicians at the same time. Later that afternoon, appellant returned to Grady\u2019s office where Grady performed manipulations of her spine and deep massage of the muscles of her lower back and right hip with a vibrating machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">{\u00b6 29} Grady\u2019s medical notes from June 16, 1999, show he released appellant to resume work on June 18, without restrictions. However, on June 17, 1999, appellant told Marino she would not return to Grady\u2019s office and demanded to be transferred back to Jagger\u2019s care. Appellant was given an appointment at OccuHealth on June 21, 1999; however, since Jagger was on vacation, appellant was examined by Elizabeth Huntoon, M.D. Appellant told Huntoon that she began experiencing excruciating pain in her right hip after her last visit to Grady on June 16, 1999. Huntoon ordered an MRI and x-rays, and prescribed physical therapy and pain medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">{\u00b6 30} On June 23, 1999, appellant was examined by Jagger, who referred her to Michael Diment, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon. On July 12, 1999, Diment injected appellant\u2019s hip with a corticosteroid medication; however, the injection provided only temporary pain relief. Diment diagnosed appellant\u2019s condition as inflammation of the greater trochanteric bursa of the right hip, and, on Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ber 9, 1999, Diment performed surgery to remove the bursa. After surgery, appellant continued to experience severe, radiating pain and swelling of the right hip and leg. Appellant consulted with several pain-management specialists and received more injections. She was eventually diagnosed with complex regional-pain syndrome, also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (\u201cRSD\u201d), a condition of unknown origin typified by chronic, intractable pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">{\u00b6 31} On June 7, 2000, appellant filed a complaint against Marino and Toledo Hospital and its parent company, Promedica, along with Huntoon, OccuHealth and Grady (case No. 2000-CI-2892). The complaint was dismissed without prejudice in March 2002 and refiled on January 28, 2003. Counts one, two, three, four, seven, eight, and nine collectively alleged that appellees were negligent in sending appellant to Grady for treatment, in violation of Jagger\u2019s orders. Counts five and six contained allegations that Grady was negligent in his treatment of appellant\u2019s injury. Count ten stated that, by referring injured workers to Grady, appellees were engaged in a pattern of \u201cracketeering activity in violation of RICO statutes.\u201d Answers were filed by appellees and Grady on February 25, 2003, and April 1, 2003, respectively. On April 7, 2003, all discovery from case No. 2000-CI-2892 was ordered transferred into and made a part of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">{\u00b6 32} On December 18, 2003, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment and a memorandum in support thereof, in which they asked the trial court to dismiss counts one, two, three, nine, and ten. Attached to appellees\u2019 memorandum were copies of answers given during discovery and the deposition testimony of appellant, Grady, and Marino, along with Marino\u2019s sworn affidavit. OccuHealth and Huntoon also joined in the motion for summary judgment. However, on February 26, 2004, and March 25, 2004, respectively, appellant voluntarily dismissed the claims against OccuHealth and Huntoon raised in counts seven and eight of the refiled complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">{\u00b6 33} In answers to interrogatories, appellees stated that Marino was a salaried employee of Toledo Hospital. Appellees further stated that Grady did not receive compensation directly from Marino for treating injured workers, and Grady did not compensate Marino for referring injured workers. Marino\u2019s job description, which was attached to appellees\u2019 answers, stated that her duties included \u201c[assisting] associates in filing workers\u2019 compensation claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">{\u00b6 34} Grady stated in his deposition that appellant initially complained of pain in her lower back and right hip on June 10, 1999. Grady stated that he did not order x-rays, but relied on his examination in determining that appellant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>sacroiliac, i.e., lower-back pain and some loss of muscle strength. Grady further stated that on June 14, 1999, appellant told him she was walking and sleeping better. Grady stated that Marino has recommended his services to between one and ten patients, he is an independent, licensed chiropractor, not an employee of Toledo Hospital, and he first learned that appellant was unhappy on June 22, 1999, when Marino told Grady that appellant had accused Grady of hurting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">{\u00b6 35} Appellant stated in her deposition that she had a prior workers\u2019 compensation claim against Toledo Hospital, following a back injury in January 1999, after which Marino assigned her \u201clight duty work\u201d at OccuHealth for several months. As to her present injury, appellant stated that she telephoned Marino on June 9, 1999, to set up an appointment for physical therapy and arrange for light duty after her current injury. However, Marino said, \u201cI\u2019m not going through this shit again. * * * I want you to go ahead and see a chiropractor that I will call and make the appointment for.\u201d Appellant said she did not question Marino\u2019s recommendation, because Marino is the person who sees \u201cthat the employees are taken care of as far as an injury goes * *</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant stated that she had pain in her lower back on June 9, 1999, and it was Grady\u2019s \u201crubbing\u201d of her hip muscle, not the vibrating massage therapy, that caused her pain on June 16, 1999. Appellant stated that she would not have had surgery or developed RSD if Grady had not injured her hip during treatment. She admitted that Marino never touched her in order to provide medical care or physical therapy, and she could not state a basis for the RICO claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">{\u00b6 37} In her deposition, Marino testified that her goal as a workers\u2019 compensation specialist is to return injured employees to work as soon as possible and that she receives no extra compensation for recommending any type of treatment, including chiropractic. Marino further stated that she reviews medical notes submitted for payment by providers to determine if services were medically necessary; however, she has no control over how much Grady or any medical provider is actually paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">{\u00b6 38} In her affidavit, Marino stated that her job consists of assisting injured workers with their workers\u2019 compensation claims by helping them obtain \u201caccess to health care providers and services.\u201d Marino further stated that she never held herself out to be a medical practitioner and never \u201cprescribed, advised, recommended, administered, or dispensed * * * a drug or medicine, appliance, mold or cast, application, operation, treatment for the cure or relief of a wound, fracture, or bodily injury, infirmity, or disease.\u201d In fact, she did not recommend or provide a particular treatment for appellant, other than informing appellant that she could choose between physical therapy and chiropractic treatment for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>work-related injury and commenting that \u201csome of our people have had good results with Dr. Grady.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">{\u00b6 39} On December 29, 2003, Grady filed a motion for partial summary judgment and a memorandum in support, in which he asked the trial court to dismiss appellant\u2019s federal and state RICO claims. In support, Grady relied on appellant\u2019s answers to interrogatories and her deposition testimony, in which she failed to state a legal basis for her RICO claim. Appellant responded to Grady\u2019s motion by arguing that a proper response was impossible \u201cdue to the lack of discovery and the [court\u2019s] refusal to order discovery.\u201d Appellant did not refer to portions of the record in support of her argument, and no additional evidence was attached to her response.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">{\u00b6 40} On July 1, 2004, appellant filed a response in opposition to appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In support, appellant relied on her own deposition testimony, in which she stated that Marino told her to \u201cgo ahead and see a chiropractor\u201d and to \u201cforget PT and go see Dr. Grady.\u201d Appellant also stated that Dr. Jagger \u201cblew his lid\u201d and blamed Marino for sending appellant to a chiropractor. Finally, appellant relied on Marino\u2019s affidavit, in which Marino admitted recommending several injured workers to Grady for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">{\u00b6 41} On August 4, 2004, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of appellant\u2019s remaining claims against appellees. On August 19, 2004, the trial court granted Grady\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed appellant\u2019s RICO claim against Grady, as set forth in count ten of the refiled complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The remaining issue of Grady\u2019s negligence proceeded to a jury trial, which commenced on August 30, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">{\u00b6 42} On the first day of trial, Grady filed a motion to exclude Diment\u2019s testimony as to the chiropractic standard of care, pursuant to Evid.R. 702(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Arguments were presented by both parties as to Diment\u2019s expert qualifications. The trial court found that Diment\u2019s \u201csole basis for knowing the standard [for chiropractic care] is his observation of watching a chiropractor at a football game\u201d and concluded that Diment had \u201cneither specialized knowledge, experience, or education in the chiropractic field to render such an opinion.\u201d Grady\u2019s motion to prohibit Diment from testifying against Grady as an expert on the standard of chiropractic care was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>{\u00b6 43} At trial, testimony was presented by appellant and Grady, along with edited portions of Diment\u2019s deposition testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On September 2, 2004, the jury found that Grady was not liable for appellant\u2019s injuries. A timely notice of appeal was filed on September 20, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 44} In her second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by excluding Diment\u2019s testimony as to the chiropractic standard of care at Grady\u2019s jury trial. As set forth above, the jury found that Grady was not negligent. Since appellant\u2019s claims against appellees depend on the jury\u2019s finding, we will address this assignment of error first.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">{\u00b6 45} Appellant argues that because the trial court found Diment to be competent as an expert medical witness in case No. 2000-CI-2892, Grady was precluded by res judicata from challenging Diment\u2019s testimony in this case. In support, appellant cites portions of the record in case No. 2000-CI-2892, in which the trial court found that an affidavit containing Diment\u2019s expert medical opinion was sufficient to withstand Grady\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">{\u00b6 46} It is well settled that a plaintiffs voluntary dismissal of an action without prejudice puts the parties in the same position as if the case had never been filed. <em>Lovins v. Kroger Co., </em>150 Ohio App.3d 656, 2002-Ohio-6526, 782 N.E.2d 1171, \u00b6 6. Accordingly, any judicial rulings made prior to the dismissal cannot be used to bar a later action on the grounds of res judicata, collateral estoppel, or law of the case. Id. at fn. 3, citing <em>Giambrone v. Spalding &amp; Evenflo Co., Inc. </em>(Apr. 18, 1997), Miami App. No. 96CA08,1997 WL 189465.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">{\u00b6 47} As set forth above, case No. 2000-CI-2892 was dismissed without prejudice by appellant in March 2002. Appellant\u2019s first argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">{\u00b6 48} Appellant next argues that the trial court should have found that Diment was qualified to give his expert opinion as to the chiropractic standard of care at Grady\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">{\u00b6 49} We note at the outset that it is the trial court that determines whether an individual qualifies as an expert. That determination will not be overturned, absent a finding of abuse of discretion. <em>Porter v. Sidor, </em>8th Dist. No. 84756, 2005-Ohio-776, 2005 WL 433520, at \u00b6 6, citing <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 58, 4 OBR 144, 446 N.E.2d 444. An abuse of discretion connotes more than a mere error of law or judgment, instead requiring a finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">{\u00b6 50} Pursuant to Evid.R. 702(B), a witness who is otherwise qualified may testify as an expert if he or she possesses \u201cspecialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony.\u201d Formal certification or specialized training is not required, and \u201c \u2018the witness need not be the best witness on the subject.\u2019 \u201d <em>Porter, </em>supra, at \u00b6 7, quoting <em>Alexander v. Mt. Carmel Med. Ctr. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 155, 159, 10 O.O.3d 332, 383 N.E.2d 564. In cases in which the fields of medicine overlap and more than one type of specialist can perform the treatment in question, a witness may be qualified to testify as an expert, even if he or she does not practice in the same medical specialty. Id., citing <em>Alexander, </em>supra, at 158, 10 O.O.3d 332, 383 N.E.2d 564. However, the witness must possess knowledge that \u201cwill aid the trier of fact in performing its fact-finding function.\u201d Id., citing <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">{\u00b6 51} Diment admitted in deposition that he is an orthopedist, not a licensed chiropractor, has not studied chiropractic techniques, does not practice applied kinesiology or employ spinal manipulation or other chiropractic modalities, and is not a member of any chiropractic organizations or associations. Diment further stated that chiropractic care has a role in treating patients; however, he could not define the term \u201cchiropractic medicine.\u201d Diment also stated that his knowledge of chiropractic methodology was obtained through observation of a chiropractor who, along with Diment, cared for athletic teams at a local high school from 1992 to 2000. Diment said that, although the standard of care is the same in some areas of medicine, \u201cit\u2019s probably hard to make such a blanket statement that all medical care providers should, should [sic] follow some sort of standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">{\u00b6 52} As set forth above, after reviewing Diment\u2019s deposition and hearing counsel\u2019s arguments, the trial court concluded that Diment was not qualified to testify as to the standard of chiropractic care, because he had \u201cneither specialized knowledge, experience, or education in the chiropractic field.\u201d On consideration, we find that the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion. Appellant\u2019s .second argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">{\u00b6 53} Finally, appellant argues that the trial court erred by not allowing the jury to hear those portions of Diment\u2019s testimony relating to the general standard of medical care. A review of the record shows otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">{\u00b6 54} Before Diment\u2019s video deposition was played for the jury, the trial court gave the jury a limiting instruction, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">Dr. Diment\u2019s opinions are presented in this case regarding causation and standard of care applicable to medical care providers, but you may not consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>any opinion he renders regarding the standard of care of chiropractors or Dr. Grady\u2019s compliance with the standard of care for chiropractors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">{\u00b6 55} Diment\u2019s edited video deposition was played for the jury. In it, Diment testified that all health care providers should listen to the patient\u2019s complaint and then perform an examination to \u201cnarrow down\u201d the cause of the problem. He also stated that an x-ray should be taken if the patient\u2019s physical examination does not yield a definitive diagnosis. Diment further stated that all health care practitioners should \u201cknow their limitations\u201d in treating patients. Diment testified that appellant\u2019s bursitis was caused by Grady\u2019s treatment; however, her postsurgical pain was due to the development of RSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">{\u00b6 56} On cross-examination, Diment stated that Grady should have known that hip massage was not an appropriate treatment for appellant\u2019s medical condition. He further stated that there was a \u201cloose body\u201d in appellant\u2019s hip that contributed to the development of bursitis; however, he could not'determine if Grady\u2019s treatment caused the \u201cloose body\u201d to develop. On redirect, Diment testified, \u201c[T]here is a direct relationship between [appellant\u2019s] work related injury, her subsequent chiropractic treatment, and her subsequent surgical treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">{\u00b6 57} The record clearly shows that the jury heard Diment\u2019s opinions as to both the general medical standard of care and the effect that Grady\u2019s treatment had on appellant\u2019s back and hip, and rejected them. Appellant\u2019s third argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">{\u00b6 58} On consideration of the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Diment\u2019s expert opinion as to the standard of chiropractic care and did not improperly limit Diment\u2019s testimony as to the general medical standard of care. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">{\u00b6 59} In her first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to appellees and dismissing counts one, two, three, four, and ten of the complaint. In support, appellant argues that the record contains sufficient evidence to demonstrate issues of fact as to (1) whether Marino practiced medicine without a license, (2) whether Marino breached a duty of care to appellant, (3) whether Toledo Hospital is immune from liability for Marino\u2019s negligence under the \u201cdual-capacity doctrine,\u201d (4) whether appellant\u2019s consent to Grady\u2019s treatment negates appellees\u2019 liability, (5) whether Grady\u2019s \u201cincompetence\u201d negates appellees\u2019 duty to appellant, (6) whether the jury\u2019s finding that Grady was not negligent precludes appellees\u2019 defense that Grady was the \u201cefficient, independent and self-producing cause\u201d of appellant\u2019s injuries, and (7) whether appellees and Grady were engaged in a pattern of corrupt activity in violation of R.C. 2923.31 and 2923.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>{\u00b6 60} We note at the outset that an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard used by the trial court. <em>Lorain Natl. Bank v. Saratoga Apts. </em>(1989), 61 Ohio App.3d 127, 129, 572 N.E.2d 198; <em>Grafton v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 671 N.E.2d 241. Summary judgment will be granted when there remains no genuine issue of material fact and when after construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can conclude only that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Civ.R. 56(C). Only those factual disputes that have the potential to affect the outcome of a lawsuit are material. <em>Spence v. Oberlin Laundry &amp; Dry Cleaners, Inc. </em>(Oct. 7, 1998), 9th Dist. No. 97CA006913, 1998 WL 696849, citing <em>Orndorff v. ALDI, Inc. </em>(1996), 115 Ohio App.3d 632, 635, 685 N.E.2d 1298.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">{\u00b6 61} As to appellant\u2019s first argument, the practicing of medicine or surgery by any person who does so \u201cwithout the appropriate certificate from the state medical board to engage in the practice\u201d is prohibited in Ohio. R.C. 4731.41. People are considered to be engaging in the practice of medicine if they (1) use the words \u201cDr.\u201d or \u201cDoctor,\u201d or any other title intended to represent that the person is practicing medicine, (2) examine and/or diagnose illness or injury for compensation of any kind, or (3) prescribe, advise, recommend, administer, or dispense \u201cfor compensation of any kind, direct or indirect, a drug or medicine, appliance, mold or cast, application, operation, or treatment, of whatever nature, for the cure or relief of a wound, fracture or bodily injury, infirmity, or disease.\u201d R.C. 4731.34; <em>State v. Crock </em>(June 28, 2000), 7th Dist. No. 273, 2000 WL 875363.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">{\u00b6 62} Appellant asserts that Marino\u2019s conduct violates R.C. 4731.41 because it amounts to \u201cprescribing, advising and/or recommending treatment for [appellant\u2019s] bodily injury different than that prescribed by Dr. Jagger.\u201d This claim is erroneous for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">{\u00b6 63} The record shows that Marino mentioned Grady\u2019s treatment to appellant as an alternative to physical therapy, and appellant testified that she followed Marino\u2019s suggestion. At that point, similarity between the circumstances of this case and the scenarios described by R.C. 4731.34 ends. No evidence was presented that Marino was ever charged with, let alone convicted of, a violation of R.C. 4731.41. In fact, such a criminal charge, if made, would be completely unwarranted because (1) Marino never used the words \u201cDr.\u201d or \u201cDoctor\u201d or any other designation calculated to represent that she is engaged in the practice of medicine, (2) no evidence was presented that Marino examined appellant, diagnosed her injury, or knew in advance what chiropractic modality Grady would use in treating appellant, and (3) Marino gave unrebutted testimony that she received no extra compensation from her employer or Grady for giving Grady\u2019s name to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>appellant and she did not know whether Grady\u2019s treatment was more or less expensive than physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">{\u00b6 64} In addition, at the hearing on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the trial court inquired of appellant\u2019s counsel as to whether the act of referring an acquaintance or co-worker to a medical practitioner constitutes a violation of R.C. 4731.41. The relevant portions of that inquiry are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">{\u00b6 65} \u201cThe Court: [Counsel] [h]ave you ever recommended a friend or colleague * * * to see a doctor, podiatrist, orthopedic, anybody that you have seen?</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">{\u00b6 66} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">{\u00b6 67} \u201c[Counsel]: Oh, sure, I recommend my doctors to people.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cThe Court: Is that treatment?</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">{\u00b6 69} \u201c[Counsel]: Absolutely not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-12\">{\u00b6 70} After engaging in the above discussion and considering the evidence presented, the trial court concluded that Marino\u2019s suggestion that appellant see Grady for treatment did not amount to \u201cadvising, prescribing or recommending\u201d a specific medical treatment by an unlicensed individual in violation of R.C. 4731.41. On consideration, we agree. Appellant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">{\u00b6 71} Appellant next argues that an issue of fact remains as to whether Marino violated hospital policy, and therefore breached a duty to appellant, by \u201coverriding\u201d Jagger\u2019s order for physical therapy and directing appellant to see Grady.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">{\u00b6 72} It is well settled that before a plaintiff can prevail in a negligence action, it must be shown \u201cthat the defendant breached a duty it owed to [the plaintiff] and that the breach was the proximate cause of [plaintiffs] injuries.\u201d <em>Orndorff, </em>supra, 115 Ohio App.3d at 635, 685 N.E.2d 1298. There is no one formula for determining whether a duty exists. Rather, \u201cit is the court\u2019s \u2018expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mussivand v. David </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 314, 318, 544 N.E.2d 265, quoting Prosser, Law of Torts (4th Ed.1971) 325-326.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">{\u00b6 73} The record contains the deposition testimony of Kenneth Trachel, legal counsel for Toledo Hospital,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in which Trachel was asked by appellant\u2019s counsel whether Marino violated hospital policy by \u201cignoring\u201d Jagger\u2019s orders. Trachel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>replied: \u201cI don\u2019t believe we ignored physician orders in this instance. I believe if Dr. Jagger wrote an order for Sandra Wilson to have physical therapy and she went to a chiropractor instead, she ignored the doctor\u2019s orders.\u201d When asked whether Marino \u201capproved\u201d appellant\u2019s deviation from Jagger\u2019s orders, Trachel responded: \u201cI don\u2019t \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as Dee Marino approved Sandra Wilson ignoring Dr. Jagger\u2019s orders. She explained to her what her options were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">{\u00b6 74} In addition to Trachel\u2019s testimony, as set forth above, Jagger prescribed physical therapy for appellant\u2019s prior back injury in January 1999. After receiving therapy, appellant was successfully treated and returned to work. When appellant reinjured her back in June 1999, she went first to Jagger, and then to Grady, for treatment. It is undisputed that appellant was treated by both Jagger and Grady until June 16, 1999, when Jagger told appellant she could not be treated by two physicians at the same time. Later that same day, appellant chose to return to Grady for treatment. Appellant testified that severe pain did not develop in her hip until Grady treated her on June 16,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">{\u00b6 75} On consideration, we find that the record contains no evidence that Marino violated hospital policy by suggesting that appellant seek chiropractic treatment for her work-related injury. The record does, however, contain evidence that appellant voluntarily returned to Grady for treatment on June 16, 1999, <em>after </em>Jagger told appellant that she could be treated by only one physician at a time. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">{\u00b6 76} Appellant next argues that Toledo Hospital and Promedica are hable for Marino\u2019s alleged negligence under the dual-capacity doctrine. Appellant\u2019s argument fails for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">{\u00b6 77} Generally, an employer who possesses a certificate of workers\u2019 compensation insurance enjoys statutory immunity \u201cfrom non-intentional personal injury and wrongful death tort claims as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Walter v. AlliedSignal, Inc. </em>(1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 253, 722 N.E.2d 164, citing <em>Bridges v. Natl. Eng. &amp; Contracting Co. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 108, 551 N.E.2d 163; R.C. 4123.35. However, an exception is created by the dual-capacity doctrine, which holds an employer liable if there is a showing that, at the time of the worker\u2019s injury, the employer had \u201cassumed a role other than that of employer.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 260, 722 N.E.2d 164, quoting <em>McGee v. Goodyear Atomic Corp. </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 236, 247, 659 N.E.2d 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">{\u00b6 78} Appellant urges this court to conclude that Toledo Hospital and Promedica are not immune from tort liability, because Marino\u2019s suggestion that she seek chiropractic treatment \u201cwas not part-and-parcel of [appellant\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>appellees\u2019] employer-employee relationship.\u201d The facts contained in the record do not support appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">{\u00b6 79} It is undisputed that Toledo Hospital and Promedica were in full compliance with the requirements of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act at all times relevant to appellant\u2019s lawsuit; appellant was injured during the course of her employment; and she initially sought treatment at OecuHealth, which is operated by appellees to treat injured workers.' It is further undisputed that Grady is an independent practitioner and not an employee of OecuHealth, Toledo Hospital, or Promedica. In addition, evidence was presented that Marino, an employee of Toledo Hospital, was acting within the scope of her job duties as a workers\u2019 compensation specialist when she gave appellant Grady\u2019s name. As previously determined, Marino\u2019s actions did not violate Ohio law or established hospital policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">{\u00b6 80} On consideration of the foregoing, we find that the only relationship between appellees and appellant was that of employer-employee. Accordingly, the dual-capacity doctrine does not apply, and appellant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">{\u00b6 81} In her next three arguments, appellant essentially asserts that, as a result of Marino\u2019s suggestion that appellant seek treatment from Grady, appellees are liable for Grady\u2019s negligence. We disagree for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">{\u00b6 82} First, appellees have no direct liability for appellant\u2019s alleged injury. As set forth above, Marino\u2019s suggestion that appellant seek treatment from Grady did not constitute practicing medicine without a license, violated no established hospital policy or other legal duty to appellant, and did not expose Toledo Hospital and Promedica to tort liability under the dual-capacity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">{\u00b6 83} Second, as set forth above, the record shows that a jury trial was held, after which Grady was found not negligent and therefore not liable for appellant\u2019s alleged injuries. No appeal was taken from the jury\u2019s verdict based on the actual evidence presented at trial. As stated in our determination of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, the trial court did not err by refusing to allow Diment, an orthopedist, to give his opinion as an expert on the chiropractic standard of care. Accordingly, appellees have no liability for appellant\u2019s alleged injury based on Grady\u2019s negligence, and the remaining issues of whether Marino knew Grady was \u201cincompetent\u201d and whether Grady\u2019s alleged negligence constitutes an \u201cintervening cause\u201d of injury that absolves appellees of liability are irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">{\u00b6 84} Appellant last argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellees because an issue of fact exists as to whether appellees and Grady were engaged in a pattern of corrupt activity in violation of R.C. 2923.31 and 2923.32. In support, appellant argues that a jury \u201ccould have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>concluded\u201d that appellees and Grady \u201cwere an enterprise involved in coercing and misleading injured employees of [Toledo] Hospital to accept chiropractic treatment from Defendant Grady instead of physical therapy ordered by their treating physicians.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">{\u00b6 85} Pursuant to R.C. 2923.32(A)(1), the Ohio civil RICO statute, \u201cNo person employed by, or associated with any <em>enterprise </em>shall conduct or participate in, directly or indirectly, the affairs of the enterprise through a <em>pattern of corrupt activity </em>or the collection of an unlawful debt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The term \u201centerprise\u201d is statutorily defined as \u201cany individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited partnership, corporation, trust, union, government agency, or other legal entity, or any organization, association, or group of persons associated in fact although not a legal entity.\u201d R.C. 2923.31(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">{\u00b6 86} A \u201cpattern of corrupt activity\u201d consists of \u201ctwo or more incidents of corrupt activity, whether or not there has been a prior conviction, that are related to the affairs of the same enterprise, are not isolated, and are not so closely related to each other and connected in time and place that they constitute a single event.\u201d R.C. 2923.31(E). The term \u201ccorrupt activity\u201d is statutorily defined as \u201cracketeering activity\u201d under the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 941, Section 1961(A)(B), (1)(C), (1)(D), and (1)(E), as amended, Title 18, U.S.Code. It also includes \u201cconduct\u201d that constitutes violations of specifically enumerated crimes. R.C. 2923.31(I)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">{\u00b6 87} Ohio courts have held that in order to establish liability under R.C. 2923.32, a plaintiff must show \u201c(1) that conduct of the defendant involves the commission of two or more specifically prohibited state or federal criminal offenses; (2) that the prohibited criminal conduct of the defendant constitutes a pattern; and (3) that the defendant has participated in the affairs of an enterprise or has acquired and maintained an interest in or control of an enterprise.\u201d <em>Patton v. Wilson, </em>8th Dist. No. 82079, 2003-Ohio-3379, at \u00b6 12, citing <em>Kondrat v. Morris </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 198, 209, 692 N.E.2d 246. The elements must be pleaded with specificity, and sufficient evidence must be presented to overcome a motion for summary judgment. Id. at 209, 692 N.E.2d 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">{\u00b6 88} The unauthorized practice of medicine in violation of R.C. 4731.41 is not one of the listed specifically enumerated offenses set out in R.C. 2923.31(I)(2). In any event, as we previously determined, Marino\u2019s acts did not constitute the criminal act of practicing medicine without a license. However, appellant further asserts that an issue of fact remains as to whether Marino\u2019s conduct amounts to theft by deception or threat, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(3) and (4), which is an enumerated offense under R.C. 2923.31(I)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>{\u00b6 89} R.C. 2913.02 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b6 90} \u201c(A) No person, with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, shall knowingly obtain or exert control over either the property or services in any of the following ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">{\u00b6 91} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">{\u00b6 92} \u201c(3) By deception;</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">{\u00b6 93} \u201c(4) By threat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">{\u00b6 94} In support of her argument, appellant cites those portions of the record that show that Jagger prescribed physical therapy; Marino told appellant she could seek treatment from Grady; Marino recommended Grady to several injured workers in the past; and Marino used the telephone to inform appellant of her appointment with Grady. Appellant argues that, based on these facts, a jury could conclude that appellees demonstrated an attempt \u201cto exert control over and defraud [appellant] of physical therapy services to which [she] was entitled, * * * pursuant to a pattern of such conduct and using the telephone (wire fraud) to do so * * *.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">{\u00b6 95} A review of the record shows that none of the appellees, including Marino, were ever charged with, or convicted of, the crime of theft by threat or deception based on the facts presented in this case. At best, the evidence establishes that appellant, an injured worker, left Jagger\u2019s care at OccuHealth after Marino, a workers\u2019 compensation specialist for appellant\u2019s employer, Toledo Hospital, told appellant that she could receive chiropractic treatment from Grady. Even though appellant claims that she continues to experience pain after taking Marino\u2019s suggestion, she has not established that appellees engaged in a pattern of corrupt activity by threatening or deceiving her into receiving chiropractic treatment instead of physical therapy. Finally, the record is unclear as to what services, if any, were actually \u201cstolen\u201d from appellant. No evidence was presented as to the type of physical therapy Jagger prescribed, or how it would have differed from Grady\u2019s treatment. Appellant\u2019s final argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">{\u00b6 96} On consideration of the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not err when it granted summary judgment to appellees and dismissed counts one, two, three, four, and ten of the complaint. We further hold that there remains no other genuine issue of material fact and, after considering the evidence presented most strongly in favor of appellant, appellees are entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">{\u00b6 97} The judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal is awarded to Lucas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b720-6\">Handwork and Skow, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b705-18\">.

Because those claims were ultimately dismissed, the issues raised in appellees' motion for summary judgment as to counts seven and eight, along with any evidence in support of those issues, need not be addressed by this court on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\">. Count ten also contained a RICO claim against appellees, the disposition of which is fully discussed later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\">. Grady also claimed that Diment was not qualified as an expert medical witness under Evid.R. 601; however, that claim was later withdrawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b711-11\">. Other witnesses testified at Grady's trial; however, as set forth above, only those portions of the record that are directly relevant to the issues raised on appeal are referred to in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b715-17\">. Trachel\u2019s deposition was entered into the record as an attachment to appellees\u2019 memorandum in opposition to appellant's motion for sanctions pursuant to Civ.R. 37(D). The trial court's ultimate resolution of that motion is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
