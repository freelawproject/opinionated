Because we conclude that the common pleas court properly determined that appellee was entitled to medicaid benefits, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-17\">{\u00b6 2} In 2002, when appellee Austin Hummel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was two, he was diagnosed with autism. Autism is a medical disorder characterized by an inability to interact socially, repetitive behavior, and language dysfunction. Austin, at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>diagnosis, avoided adult interaction, used no words, and required adult prompting and assistance to follow one-step instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">{\u00b6 3} At the direction of his treating physician, Austin received early intervention Applied Behavior Analysis (\u201cABA\u201d) therapy. Studies have shown ABA therapy to be an effective treatment for autism among some children. ABA literature presented in these proceedings suggests that early intensive treatment allows some children to achieve normal intellectual functioning by training the brain\u2019s circuitry while it is still developing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">{\u00b6 4} After 90 days initial ABA therapy, Austin was able to interact with adults for as much as 20 minutes at a time, construct simple sentences, and follow several one-step instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">{\u00b6 5} It is not wholly clear from the record, but it appears that the early-intervention program that funded Austin\u2019s initial ABA therapy was available only until his third birthday. Austin, however, remains eligible to receive benefits through the Healthy Start Medicaid Program administered by appellant, Ohio Department of Job &amp; Family Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">{\u00b6 6} Shortly after Austin\u2019s third birthday, his treating physician directed that he continue ABA therapy. When Austin\u2019s family requested the services through appellant\u2019s local health-care provider, however, the local provider rejected the claim, concluding that ABA therapy was neither medically necessary nor a medical service.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">{\u00b6 7} Following this rejection, Austin\u2019s family requested a state hearing, after which a state hearing officer found that although Austin was likely to benefit from ABA therapy, the therapy was not a medical service and was not medically necessary, and there was insufficient evidence that the ABA program would be the lowest-cost alternative to treat the medical problem. On these findings, the hearing officer overruled appellees\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">{\u00b6 8} When appellees\u2019 further administrative appeal was denied, they instituted the present appeal to the common pleas court, pursuant to R.C. 5101.35 and 119.12. The common pleas court reversed the administrative decision, finding it \u201cunsupported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">{\u00b6 9} From this judgment, appellant now brings this appeal, setting forth the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b818-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cFirst Assignment of Error: The common pleas court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal below, and so its Opinion and Judgment Entry must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201cSecond Assignment of Error: The common pleas court erred by failing to address one of ODJFS\u2019s dispositive arguments, although it had been raised at every level of the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThird Assignment of Error: The common pleas court incorrectly interpreted Ohio Admin. Code 5101:3-1-01 when it reversed ODJFS\u2019s decisions and ordered ODJFS to pay for ABA services for Austin Hummel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">I. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">{\u00b6 13} In its first assignment of error, appellant suggests that the judgment appealed from is void because the common pleas court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Appellant insists that R.C. 119.12 requires that a notice of appeal from an administrative adjudicatory order identify the order and state the grounds for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">{\u00b6 14} Appellees\u2019 notice of appeal states only that it is a \u201cNotice of Appeal of the Administrative Appeals Decision * * * denying [appellee\u2019s] claim for coverage of a medical service * * This notice, appellant argues, lacks the specificity necessary to comply with the statutory antecedents needed to confer subject-matter jurisdiction on the common pleas court. This assertion is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">{\u00b6 15} R.C. 119.12 is the appeals portion of the Ohio Administrative Procedure Act and is generally applicable to appeals from administrative adjudications from state agencies. A special provision, however, governs appeals from decisions of the Director of Job and Family Services. R.C. 5101.35 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(E) An appellant who disagrees with an administrative appeal decision of the director of job and family services * * * may appeal from the decision to the court of common pleas pursuant to section 119.12 of the Revised Code. The appeal shall be governed by section 119.12 of the Revised Code except that:</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(3) The appellant shall mail the notice of appeal to the department of job and family services and file notice of appeal with the court within thirty days after the department mails the administrative appeal decision to the appellant. * * * Filing notice of appeal with the court shall be the only act necessary to vest jurisdiction in the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">{\u00b6 19} In the event that a special provision is irreconcilable with a general provision, the special provision prevails unless the general provision is later adopted and it is the manifest intent of the legislature that the later provision control. R.C. 1.51. Here, the legislature clearly states that in an administrative appeal from a decision of the Director of Job and Family Services, filing the notice of appeal is the only act necessary to vest jurisdiction in the common pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>court. The R.C. 119.12 general requirement that a notice of an administrative appeal state the grounds of the appeal is consequently superceded by the special provision. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">II. Medical Services</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">{\u00b6 20} A party adversely affected by an order of an administrative agency in an adjudicatory proceeding may appeal that order to an appropriate common pleas court. R.C. 119.12. If, on consideration of the evidence of the entire administrative record and such additional evidence as may be admitted, the court finds that the administrative order is supported by \u201creliable, probative and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law,\u201d the court must affirm the order. Id.; <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748; <em>Holman v. Ohio Dept. of Human Serv. </em>(2001), 143 Ohio App.3d 44, 48, 757 N.E.2d 382. Absent such findings, however, the common pleas court may \u201creverse, vacate, or modify the order or make such other ruling as is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law.\u201d R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">{\u00b6 21} An administrative review is a hybrid: neither strictly of law nor of law and fact. While not a trial de novo, the common pleas court must nonetheless \u201cread and consider all the evidence offered by both sides and must appraise all of the evidence as to the credibility of the witnesses, the probative character of the evidence, and the weight thereof.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 275, 280, 58 O.O. 51, 131 N.E.2d 390. Even so, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency, but must defer to administrative resolution of evidentiary conflicts. <em>Univ. of Cincinnati v. Conrad </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 108, 111, 17 O.O.3d 65, 407 N.E.2d 1265.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">{\u00b6 22} Appellate review of the common pleas court decision on issues of law is plenary. <em>Holman, </em>143 Ohio App.3d at 49, 757 N.E.2d 382, citing <em>Univ. Hosp. Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 587 N.E.2d 835. On questions of fact, however, an appellate court\u2019s review is far more circumscribed. The common pleas court must be affirmed unless its decision is the result of an abuse of discretion. Id., citing <em>Lorain City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 261, 533 N.E.2d 264. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment. The term connotes that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 168-169, 559 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">{\u00b6 23} In this matter, the question to the common pleas court was whether appellant properly denied ABA therapy to Austin. Appellant has no duty to provide such therapy unless it is a \u201cmedical necessity.\u201d The common pleas court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>then began with the Ohio Administrative Code provision that defines \u201cmedical necessity\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(A) \u2018Medical necessity\u2019 is a fundamental concept underlying the medicaid program. Physicians, dentists, and limited practitioners render, authorize, or prescribe medical services within the scope of their licensure and based on their professional judgment regarding services needed by an individual. * * * [\u2018M]edically necessary services\u2019 are defined as services which are necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of disease, illness, or injury and without which the patient can be expected to suffer prolonged, increased or new morbidity, impairment of function, dysfunction of a body organ or part, or significant pain and discomfort. A medically necessary service must:</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(1) Meet generally accepted standards of medical practice;</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(2) Be appropriate to the illness or injury for which it is performed as to type of service and expected outcome;</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c(3) Be appropriate to the intensity of service and level of setting;</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c(5) Be the lowest cost alternative that effectively addresses and treats the medical problem;</p>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c(6) Meet general principles regarding reimbursement for medicaid covered services found in rule 5101:3-1-02 of the Administrative Code.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-1-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">{\u00b6 31} At the outset of its analysis, the common pleas court properly noted that the medical opinion and diagnosis of a patient\u2019s treating physician are entitled to substantial deference in deciding whether to grant medical benefits. <em>Holman, </em>143 Ohio App.3d at 52-53, 757 N.E.2d 382. In evidence in appellant\u2019s hearing file is a communication from Austin\u2019s treating physician, an expert on autism. The physician states:</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cAustin is a young man I follow for management of Autism Spectrum Disorder. This condition requires specialized interventions designed to help develop functional life and learning skills. Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) is a medically necessary recommendation to address these needs. A, great deal of current literature is available supporting this recommendation. The National Academy of Sciences endorses the need for early, intensive, one on one intervention as soon as the diagnosis of autism is suspected.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-13\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cTo summarize, the techniques of ABA have been shown to be effective in altering the developmental outcome of some young children with autism. Research suggests that early intensive treatment using ABA methods enable some children to enter the educational mainstream and achieve normal intellectu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>al functioning. A number of studies support that early intensive behavioral intervention for some children with autism can result in beneficial outcomes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">{\u00b6 34} We note that the communication from Austin\u2019s treating physician unambiguously classifies ABA therapy as medically necessary. Moreover, that communication combined with other reports and articles submitted in evidence suggests that ABA therapy is generally accepted among physicians treating autism and is appropriate for treating autism, appropriate in intensity of service and level of setting for autism, and, implicitly, the lowest-cost alternative to effectively treat Austin\u2019s autism.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">{\u00b6 35} The only opposition to this evidence is a notation in a telephone log, which says that \u201cDr. White\u201d suggests that \u201cthis is not a medical service, not medically necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">{\u00b6 36} On this evidence, the common pleas court concluded that the reliability of the evidence disfavoring ABA therapy was insufficient to override the presumption created by the report of Austin\u2019s treating physician that such therapy was medically necessary. The common pleas court found that the administrative order that ABA therapy for Austin was not medically necessary was unsupported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">{\u00b6 37} On appeal, appellant seems to cede this point. This is proper because, given our standard of review, we could not say that this determination is arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. Nevertheless, appellant insists that the common pleas court order must be reversed, or at least vacated, because the rules require that for a service to be compensable, it must be not only medically necessary, but also a \u201cmedical service.\u201d ABA therapy is not a \u201cmedical service,\u201d according to appellant, but is \u2014 as determined by the administrative proceedings \u2014 an educational program or, at best, a behavior modification technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">{\u00b6 38} Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-1-01(A) refers to \u201cmedical services\u201d in its preface. Moreover, Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-1-02, which is incorporated into the \u201cmedical necessity\u201d standard by Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-1-01(A)(6), also uses the phrase \u201cmedical service.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, appellant argues, reimbursable procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>must not only be \u201cmedically necessary,\u201d but also \u201cmedical services.\u201d Absent this extra element, appellant insists, a driver for an epileptic who cannot drive would be compensable. So, too, would be the service of somebody who brings a glass of water to one who is dehydrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">{\u00b6 39} Appellees respond that appellant has cited no authority that a \u201cmedical service\u201d is a separate and distinct requirement from a \u201cmedically necessary service\u201d for medicaid reimbursement. Moreover, even if there is a separate \u201cmedical services\u201d element, it is a component of a \u201cmedical necessity.\u201d Consequently, the common pleas court\u2019s failure to address this element is harmless, because it properly found ABA therapy \u201cmedically necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant would make the term \u201cmedical service\u201d as used in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-1-01 and 5101:3-1-02 a term of art. Unlike the term \u201cmedical necessity\u201d or \u201cmedically necessary service,\u201d however, \u201cmedical services\u201d is neither delineated nor defined in the statutes or the Administrative Code. While it appears that the term seems to have obtained some administrative cachet, appellant has failed to direct our attention to a special administrative or statutory definition or other authority for the use it advances for the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">{\u00b6 41} Appellees\u2019 analysis is attractive: \u201cmedical service\u201d is simply a synonym for \u201cmedically necessary services.\u201d If that is the case, then the common pleas court\u2019s determination must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">{\u00b6 42} Alternatively, if \u201cmedical service\u201d is a separate element, we must define what it means. Since appellant has directed our attention to no statutory or administrative code definition or other authority, we must ascertain the meaning obtained in ordinary usage. R.C. 1.42. \u201cMedical\u201d is ordinarily defined as \u201cto remedy, heal; akin to * * * healer * * * 1: of, relating to, or concerned with physicians or the practice of medicine 2: requiring or devoted to medical treatment.\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed.2003) 771. \u201cService\u201d has multiple definitions. Perhaps most relevant here is \u201ccontribution to the welfare of others\u201d or \u201ca helpful act.\u201d Id. at 1137. A \u201cmedical service\u201d would be an act helpful to healing or treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>{\u00b6 43} Given this definition, it would seem that a \u201cmedically necessary service\u201d would encompass a \u201cmedical service.\u201d As a result, we cannot say that the common pleas court erred either in its factual determination or as a matter of law in concluding that ABA therapy qualified for reimbursement under Ohio Adm. Code 5101:3-1-01 et seq. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">{\u00b6 44} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b824-6\">Pietrykowski and Skow, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b817-18\">.
