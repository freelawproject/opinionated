Plaster, appeals his conviction and sentence entered by the Richland County Court of Common Pleas, on one count of illegal conveyance of a prohibited item into a detention facility, in violation of R.C. 2921.36(C), following a jury trial. Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b791-16\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On May 6, 2004, the Richland County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one count of illegal conveyance of a prohibited item into a detention facility, in violation of R.C. 2921.36(C), a felony of the third degree, and one count of bribery, in violation of R.C. 2921.02(B), a felony of the third degree. The indictment set forth the date of the offenses as \u201con or about the 22nd day of March, 2004.\u201d Appellant filed a written \u2018Waiver of Presence of Defendant at Arraignment\u201d on May 27, 2004, and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">{\u00b6 3} The matter proceeded through the discovery process. After several continuances, the trial court scheduled a jury trial for February 10, 2005. Three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>days before trial, the state filed a motion to amend the indictment, requesting that the indictment dates be amended from \u201con or about the 22nd day of March, 2004,\u201d to \u201cbetween February 1, 2004 and March 31, 2004.\u201d The state asserted that the amendment did not change the name or the identity of the crimes charged, but simply enlarged the date surrounding each offense. The state provided appellant with a bill of particulars on the same day it filed its motion to amend. Appellant filed a brief in opposition to the motion to amend the indictment, asserting that the state was required to resubmit the matter to the grand jury. The trial court allowed the state to amend the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">{\u00b6 4} At trial, Alicia Spencer testified that in February 2004, Mark Mack, an inmate at the Mansfield Correctional Institution whom Spencer visited, along with Michael Blackburn, another inmate, convinced her to smuggle drugs into the prison. After Spencer twice brought in small quantities of marijuana, Blackburn plotted a scheme in order to get larger quantities of marijuana into the prison. Blackburn arranged for Spencer to obtain marijuana from an individual by the name of Dale, and, subsequently, to give the drugs to appellant, an employee of the institution, who would bring the drugs to Blackburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">{\u00b6 5} Spencer stated that on February 25, 2004, she met appellant in the parking lot of the Mansfield Restaurant. The parking lot was crowded, and appellant suggested that they drive to a nearby Dairymart. Spencer followed appellant in her vehicle. Once at the Dairymart, Spencer entered appellant\u2019s truck and gave him the marijuana. During the meeting, appellant discussed having future meetings at an abandoned food store.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">{\u00b6 6} Blackburn telephoned Spencer later that day and advised her that he had received \u201cthe legal work,\u201d which Spencer explained was the code for marijuana. Thereafter, Blackburn arranged for Spencer to go to Elyria and obtain another ounce of marijuana from the individual she knew as Dale. Spencer left the drugs in the glove compartment of her car, and appellant was to retrieve the package during the day while she was at work. Spencer noted that the package was gone when she returned to her vehicle at the end of her shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">{\u00b6 7} In mid-March 2004, Blackburn instructed Spencer to pick up a third package of marijuana and to meet the mother of another inmate at a parking garage at the Cleveland airport to pick up $700. Spencer recalled that the meeting took place on a Friday, which was either March 18 or 19, 2004. Spencer spent the weekend in Portsmouth visiting her children and returned to Mansfield on March 21, 2004. The following day, March 22, 2004, Blackburn advised Spencer that appellant would be calling her between 2:00 and 2:15 p.m. Blackburn also instructed Spencer to give appellant $50 from the $700 she had received.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Shortly after Spencer concluded the conversation with Blackburn, the State Highway Patrol arrived at her apartment with a search warrant. The officers informed Spencer that they knew she was expecting a call between 2:00 and 2:15 p.m. to arrange a handoff of marijuana. Spencer gave the officers the marijuana and agreed to cooperate with them. While the officers were at her apartment, Spencer received a phone call from appellant, arranging a meeting in the Wal-Mart parking lot later that afternoon. Spencer proceeded to the State Highway Patrol post, where she'was fitted with a vest and a body recording wire. The officers provided Spencer with $50 and the marijuana that she was to deliver to appellant. The police proceeded to the Wal-Mart parking lot, followed by Spencer in her own vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 9} Spencer parked her vehicle, and appellant drove up next to her. She got out of her ear and approached the driver\u2019s side of appellant\u2019s truck. Appellant gave her a letter from Blackburn. As the two were talking, Spencer\u2019s cell phone rang, and she inadvertently said the signal word, resulting in the police coming in at the wrong time. Spencer had not given appellant the money or the marijuana at that point. Spencer was subsequently prosecuted for illegal conveyance of drugs into a detention facility, to which she pleaded guilty. She was placed on four years\u2019 community control.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 10} Officer David Blake, an institutional investigator at the Mansfield Correctional Institution, testified that in February 2004, he received information that two inmates, Mark Mack and Michael Blackburn, were conveying drugs into the institution with the help of a staff member. Immediately upon learning this information, Blake started listening to telephone calls on the inmate phone system. Officer Blake and his team searched the system for phone calls made from Blackburn and Mack and listened to the recorded conversations. The officer stated that it was quite obvious when they started listening to the calls that there was some type of transaction going on that involved a member of the institution staff. On or about March 22, 2004, in conjunction with the State Highway Patrol, Officer Blake and his team executed a search warrant on the residence of Alicia Spencer. Once Spencer\u2019s apartment was secure, Officer Blake and Trooper Smith spoke with Spencer, who agreed to cooperate with authorities. Officer Blake thereafter detailed the events leading up to appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 11} After hearing all the evidence and deliberations, the jury found appellant guilty of one count of illegal conveyance of drugs into a detention facility. The jury was unable to reach a decision on the bribery charge. The trial court declared a mistrial on that charge and dismissed the count without prejudice. The trial court sentenced appellant to a five-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 12} It is from this conviction and sentence that appellant appeals, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201cI. Defendant was denied due process of law when the [sic] permitted an amendment to the indictment without re-submission of the cause to [the] grand jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cII. Defendant was denied due process of law when the prosecutor, under a ruse of amending the indictment, was allowed to circumvent the Ohio speedy trial statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIII. Defendant was denied due process of law and his right to prepare a defense when the court denied a continuance after it allowed an amendment to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cIV. Defendant was denied a fair trial and impartial jury when the court refused to dismiss a prospective juror for cause and dismissed another juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cV. Defendant was denied due process of law and his right to present a defense when the court commented extensively concerning the fact that duress was not a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cVI. Defendant was denied due process of law when the court prevented defendant from presenting a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cVII.

Defendant was denied due process of law when a witness was allowed to testify to the credibility of another witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cX. Defendant was denied due process of law and a fair trial when the court gave no instruction concerning the testimony if [sic] co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cXI. Defendant was denied due process of law when the court allowed evidence of co-conspirators\u2019 pleas of guilty without a limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cXII. Defendant was denied due process of law when the court allowed the transcripts of recorded conversation without any limiting instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cXIII. Defendant was denied due process of law when his motions for judgment of acquittal were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-17\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cXIV. Defendant was denied due process of law when the [sic] was sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment for a felony of the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-18\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cXV. Defendant was denied his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments when he was sentenced based on factors not alleged in the indictment nor found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>{\u00b6 28} \u201cXVI. Defendant was denied due process of law when the court did not impose any post-release control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">I, III</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 29} Because appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error are interrelated and dispositive of this case, we shall address those assignments together. In his first assignment of error, appellant maintains that he was denied due process when the trial court permitted the state to amend the indictment without resubmitting the matter to the grand jury. In his third assignment of error, appellant contends that he was denied due process and his right to prepare a defense when the trial court denied his request for a continuance after the state was permitted to amend the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 30} Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution states: \u201c[N]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\u201d This constitutional provision \u201cguarantees the accused that the essential facts constituting the offense for which he is tried will be found in the indictment of the grand jury. Where one of the vital elements identifying the crime is omitted from the indictment, it is defective and cannot be cured by the court as such a procedure would permit the court to convict the accused on a charge essentially different from that found by the grand jury.\u201d <em>State v. Headley </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 475, 478-479, 6 OBR 526, 453 N.E.2d 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">{\u00b6 31} Crim.R. 7(D) supplements this constitutional right by specifying when a court may permit an amendment to an indictment: \u201cThe court may at any time before, during, or after a trial amend the indictment, information, complaint, or bill of particulars, in respect to any defect, imperfection, or omission in form or substance, or of any variance with the evidence, provided no change is made in the name or identity of the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">{\u00b6 32} Although the rule permits most amendments, it flatly prohibits amendments that change the name or identity of the crime charged. See <em>State v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St.3d 122, 126, 30 OBR 436, 508 N.E.2d 144. A trial court commits reversible error when it permits an amendment that changes the name or identity of the offense charged, regardless of whether the defendant suffered prejudice. <em>State v. Smith, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-1157, 2004-Ohio-4786, 2004 WL 2008465, at \u00b6 10. See, also, <em>State v. Headley, </em>6 Ohio St.3d 475, 6 OBR 526, 453 N.E.2d 716. \u201cWhether an amendment changes the name or identity of the crime charged is a matter of law.\u201d <em>State v. Cooper </em>(June 25,1998), Ross App. No. 97CA2326,1998 WL 340700, citing <em>State v. Jackson </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 479, 605 N.E.2d 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The state argues that the amendment did not change the name or identity of the crime charged; therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision was proper. Appellant counters that notwithstanding the fact that the amendment did not change the name or identity of the offense, the expanding of the dates created a risk that he would be convicted on evidence that was not presented to the grand jury. In support of his position, appellant relies upon <em>State v. Vitale </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 695, 645 N.E.2d 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">{\u00b6 34} In <em>Vitale, </em>the defendant was indicted for a theft alleged to have occurred on or about June 14,1991. At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecutor moved to amend the indictment to show that the theft offense was committed from \u201cJune 14, 1991 through June 21, 1991 inclusive.\u201d Id. at 700, 645 N.E.2d 1277. Over objection, at the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial court allowed the amendment. The trial court acquitted the defendant of any offense that had occurred on or about June 14, 1991, but convicted him of a theft that it found had occurred on June 21, 1991. On appeal, the Eighth District Court of Appeals found that the trial court erred in permitting the amendment, concluding, \u201c[t]he risk then is squarely presented that defendant was convicted of an offense on evidence that was never presented to the grand jury.\u201d Id. at 700, 645 N.E.2d 1277. The <em>Vitale </em>court vacated the defendant\u2019s conviction and reversed, explaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cThe issue is not, as the state argues, and the trial court found, that defendant was not surprised or prejudiced by the belated amendment \u2014 the issue is whether he was convicted on the same evidence on which he was indicted. See <em>State v. Barnecut </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 149, 542 N.E.2d 353. In that case, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c \u2018Appellant\u2019s due process rights to a fair trial were violated when the trial court allowed the indictment to be amended with regard to the first two counts after the state\u2019s case-in-chief was completed. If no evidence is presented that the alleged offenses occurred within the bracketed time frames specified in the indictment, the counts in the indictment relating to those offenses should be dismissed. Any variance of proof outside the parameters of time established by the indictment may constitute a separate offense. This analysis suggests a bright-line test, <em>i.e., </em>that an accused be tried for the crimes alleged in the indictment, and that any evidence outside the time period established in the indictment may constitute a separate offense requiring separate process * * Id. at 153, 542 N.E.2d at 356-357.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cSince the state, by amendment to the indictment herein, changed the identity of the crime, the trial court erred in permitting the amendment. We cannot allow a procedure which would \u2018permit the court to convict the accused on a charge essentially different than that found by the grand jury.\u2019 <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number><em>Headley, supra. </em>See, also, <em>Russell v. United States </em>(1962), 369 U.S. 749, 770, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 1050, 8 L.Ed.2d 240, 254-255, which summarizes the point as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c \u2018To allow the prosecutor, or the court, to make a subsequent guess as to what was in the minds of the grand jury at the time they returned the indictment would deprive the defendant.of a basic protection which the guaranty of the intervention of a grand jury was designed to secure. For a defendant could then be convicted on the basis of facts not found by, and perhaps not even presented to, the grand jury which indicted him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vitale, </em>96 Ohio App.3d at 701-702, 645 N.E.2d 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">{\u00b6 39} The state submits that <em>Vitale </em>is distinguishable because appellant herein \u201cwas charged with a pattern of conduct which occurred on or about the 22nd day of March, 2004.\u201d The state adds that \u201cthus, amendment of the indictment to include incidents between February 20, 2004 and March 22, 2004 does not change the fact that he was charged with a pattern of conduct.\u201d According to the state, the <em>Vitale </em>amendment, in contrast, added separate crimes to the indictment for which the defendant had not been charged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">{\u00b6 40} The original indictment read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c[0]n or about the 22nd day of March, 2004, at the County of Richland, [appellant] did knowingly deliver, or attempt to deliver, to a person who is confined in a detention facility, a drug of abuse, as defined in section 3719.011 of the Revised Code, the offender being an officer or employee of the facility or institution, in violation of section 2921.36(C) of the Ohio Revised Code, a felony of the third degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">{\u00b6 42} The amended indictment reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c[B]etween February 1, 2004 and March 31, 2004, at the County of Richland, [appellant] did knowingly deliver, or attempt to deliver, to a person who is confined in a detention facility, a drug of abuse, as defined in section 3719.011 of the Ohio Revised Code, the offender being an officer or employee of the facility or institution, in violation of section 2921.36(C) of the Ohio Revised Code, a felony of the third degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">{\u00b6 44} The original indictment did not allege a pattern of conduct. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the grand jury intended to indict appellant for a continuous course of conduct. The indictment identified the date of March 22, 2004. That date corresponds to the incident in which Spencer had been fitted with a recording device but the drug/money exchange was inadvertently aborted. The indictment, as amended, effectively added two additional offenses: the February 25, 2004 drug exchange at Dairymart and the drug transfer later that day while Spencer\u2019s car was at work. Though these two instances would result in the same \u201cname\u201d of crime charged in the indictment (illegal conveyance of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>prohibited item into a detention facility), the fact that they are separate crimes from that charged in the original indictment changes the identity of the crime charged in the indictment. The jury thus heard evidence of three separate incidents, on any one of which it could have convicted. Because appellant could have independently been convicted on the evidence of either of these other two incidents and not on the indicted March 22 incident, we find that the trial court erred in allowing the state to amend the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">{\u00b6 45} Appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">II, IV-XVI</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">{\u00b6 46} In light of our disposition of appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error, we overrule appellant\u2019s remaining assignments of error as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">{\u00b6 47} The judgment of the Richland County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b798-9\">Boggins, P.J., and Edwards, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
