Fortuna, appeals from a judgment of the Court of Claims of Ohio, finding Dr. Larry C. Martin to be entitled to civil immunity pursuant to R.C. 9.86 and 2743.02(F). For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Claims and remand this matter to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>On June 12, 2001, plaintiff filed, in the Court of Claims of Ohio, a medical malpractice action against the Ohio State University Hospitals (\u201cOSUH\u201d). An amended complaint was filed on July 5, 2001. Plaintiff filed a companion case in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas against multiple defendants, including Larry Martin, M.D. Following a status conference, the Court of Claims filed an entry on August 24, 2001, stating, \u201cNo immunity issues exist at this time.\u201d In that entry, the Court of Claims stayed the action, pending the final disposition of the connected action. As indicated by subsequent entries filed by the Court of Claims, additional status conferences were held in the Court of Claims to discuss the status of the connected action. In those entries, there is no mention of the issue of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">{\u00b6 3} On October 3, 2003, Dr. Martin moved the Court of Claims to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether he is entitled to immunity pursuant to R.C. 9.86 and 2743.02(F). The record does not reveal any objection to this motion. On October 28, 2003, the Court of Claims granted Dr. Martin\u2019s motion and scheduled an immunity-determination hearing. Additionally, the October 28, 2003 entry states, \u201cDr. Martin may participate in the <em>January 15, 2004, </em>evidentiary hearing either with counsel or pro se, if he so desires.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On January 15 and February 4, 2004, the Court of Claims held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Dr. Martin is entitled to immunity pursuant to R.C. 9.86 and 2743.02(F). Dr. Martin\u2019s counsel participated in the proceedings. That participation included conducting a direct examination of Dr. Martin and making closing arguments at the hearing, as well as filing a brief in support of a finding of immunity. On March 10, 2004, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued its decision in <em>Johns v. Univ. of Cincinnati Med. Assoc., Inc., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 234, 2004-Ohio-824, 804 N.E.2d 19. In <em>Johns, </em>the court stated that a state employee has no right to participate in the immunity-determination proceedings before the Court of Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">{\u00b6 5} On March 24, 2004, plaintiff moved the Court of Claims for a determination that Dr. Martin is not entitled to immunity based on <em>Johns. </em>In plaintiffs motion, she argued that the issue of immunity had already been considered by the court, that the court lacked authority to hold an immunity hearing at Dr. Martin\u2019s request, and that Dr. Martin had not timely raised the immunity issue. Plaintiff also argued, at least implicitly, that the Court of Claims had erroneously permitted Dr. Martin to participate in the immunity-determination hearing, in violation of <em>Johns. </em>On June 18, 2004, the Court of Claims denied plaintiffs March 24, 2004 motion. On June 23, 2004, plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s denial of her March 24, 2004 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 6} On July 16, 2004, the Court of Claims rendered a decision and judgment entry. The Court of Claims found that Dr. Martin had acted within the scope of his employment with defendant at all times relevant to the action and that he had not acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner toward Mr. Fortuna. The Court of Claims stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">The court is persuaded for the following reasons that Dr. Martin was acting within the scope of his university employment when rendering the care and treatment in question. Dr. Martin first met Fortuna in the SICU while on rotation. Dr. Martin\u2019s rounds in the SICU involved supervising and teaching medical residents. Even though a private practice group billed plaintiff for Dr. Martin\u2019s treatment, the court finds that Fortuna was not specifically referred to him for care in the SICU; hence, Fortuna was not a private patient of Dr. Martin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">{\u00b6 7} The court accordingly determined that Dr. Martin is entitled to civil immunity pursuant to R.C. 9.86 and 2743.02(F). The court noted that the courts of common pleas do not have jurisdiction over civil actions against Dr. Martin based upon the allegations in this case. In the July 16, 2004 decision, the court denied plaintiffs June 23, 2004 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">{\u00b6 8} Plaintiff appeals to this court from this judgment and has asserted the following six assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">By its Entries dated October 28, 2003 and June 18, 2004, the Court of Claims acted outside of its limited jurisdiction and authority in granting Dr. Martin\u2019s motion of October 3, 2003, to intervene and for an immunity hearing under R.C. 2743.02(F).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">Assignment of Error No. 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">By its Decision dated July 16, 2004, the Court of Claims acted outside of its limited jurisdiction and authority by granting Dr. Martin immunity in a proceeding in which he participated contrary to <em>Johns v. Univ. of Cincinnati Med. Assoc., Inc., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 234 [2004-Ohio-824, 804 N.E.2d 19].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">Assignment of Error No. 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">The Decision of the Court of Claims, dated July 16, 2004, is in error as a matter of law under <em>Nease v. Med. College Hosp. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 396 [596 N.E.2d 432], because (1) it is based on a liability-nullifying standard rejected in <em>Lownsbury v. Van Buren </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 231 [762 N.E.2d 354], (2) it incorrectly applied the facts to the law on immunity, and (3) its finding as to \u201cnon-referral\u201d is unsupported by credible evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AME\">Assignment of Error No. 4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">During the immunity-determination proceeding on January 15, 2004, the Court of Claims committed prejudicial error (Hearing, Tr. 94) by not allowing Plaintiff-Appellant to ask Dr. Martin about differences between his care of the patient in the <em>Verhoff </em>case [125 Ohio Misc.2d 30, 2003-Ohio-4795, 797 N.E.2d 592] and the case at bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\">Assignment of Error No. 5</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">The Decision of the Court of Claims dated July 16, 2004, granting Dr. Martin immunity is in error, as a matter of law, because it [is] contrary to, and because the Court ignored the Bylaws and Medical Staff Rules of the Ohio State University (OSU) Hospitals, the physician\u2019s employment contracts, and the OSU Practice Plan mandated by the Board of Trustees and approved by the Attorney General in OAG Opinion 86-046.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-14\">Assignment of Error No. 6</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-15\">During the proceeding on January 15, 2004, the Court of Claims committed prejudicial error (Hearing, Tr. 99; Offer of proof, Tr. 144) in not allowing Plaintiff-Appellant to question Dr. Martin about the patient\u2019s critical condition, denying Plaintiff-Appellant an opportunity to demonstrate \u201creckless\u201d conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>and absence of immunity based on <em>Newton v. Ohio Univ. School of Osteopathic Medicine </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 703, 633 N.E.2d 593.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">{\u00b6 9} Preliminarily, we note that although plaintiff sets forth six assignments of error, her discussion proceeds under five propositions of law. These propositions of law correspond to particular assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">{\u00b6 10} In her first assignment of error, plaintiff argues that the Court of Claims erred in granting Dr. Martin\u2019s motion to intervene and for an immunity hearing. Under this assignment of error, plaintiff argues that the Court of Claims erroneously revisited the immunity issue after jurisdiction had been determined. In support of her argument, plaintiff cites R.C. 2743.02(A)(1) and 2743.02(F). R.C. 2743.02(F) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">A civil action against an officer or employee * * * shall first be filed against the state in the court of claims, which has exclusive, original jurisdiction to determine, initially, whether the officer or employee is entitled to personal immunity under section 9.86 of the Revised Code and whether the courts of common pleas have jurisdiction over the civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 11} Under R.C. 2743.02(A)(1), the filing of a civil action in the Court of Claims results in a waiver of any cause of action based on the same act or omission that the party has against any officer or employee. The waiver is void if the Court of Claims determines that the act or omission was manifestly outside the scope of the officer or employee\u2019s office or employment or that the officer or employee acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner. R.C. 2743.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">{\u00b6 12} Plaintiff argues that pursuant to R.C. 2743.02(A)(1) and 2743.02(F), once the Court of Claims makes an initial determination regarding immunity, then jurisdiction vests in the common pleas court. (Plaintiffs initial brief, at 14, citing <em>Tschantz v. Ferguson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 131, 133, 566 N.E.2d 655.) Plaintiff further argues that once jurisdiction vests in the common pleas court, then the Court of Claims lacks jurisdiction to hold a hearing on the issue of immunity. Applying this reasoning to this case, plaintiff contends, at least implicitly, that the Court of Claims\u2019 August 24, 2001 entry, which stated that \u201c[n]o immunity issues exist at this time,\u201d constituted the court\u2019s initial determination as to immunity, and, therefore, the Court of Claims lacked jurisdiction to later hold a hearing on the issue of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">{\u00b6 13} Plaintiff is correct to the extent that she argues that the Court of Claims\u2019 determination regarding immunity is relevant to both R.C. 2743.02(A)(1) and (F). However, plaintiffs argument to the contrary, the Court of Claims\u2019 statement that no immunity issues existed at the time of the August 24, 2001 entry was not an initial determination of whether Dr. Martin is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>immunity. The Court of Claims did not determine the immunity issue until July 16, 2004. By its July 16, 2004 decision, the Court of Claims determined Dr. Martin to be immune from liability and also determined that the courts of common pleas do not have jurisdiction over the matter. Furthermore, the delay in the raising of the immunity issue did not somehow divest the Court of Claims of jurisdiction to determine whether Dr. Martin is entitled to immunity. Additionally, although it was error for the Court of Claims to grant Dr. Martin\u2019s motion for an immunity hearing, the court was not precluded from, sua sponte, holding such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">{\u00b6 14} For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">{\u00b6 15} By her second assignment of error, plaintiff argues that the Court of Claims erred in granting Dr. Martin immunity in a proceeding in which he participated. The Supreme Court of Ohio, in <em>Theobald v. Univ. of Cincinnati, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 370, 2004-Ohio-1527, 805 N.E.2d 1084, at \u00b6 6, stated, \u201cPursuant to our holding in <em>Johns v. Univ. of Cincinnati Med. Assoc., Inc., </em>supra, a state employee has no right to participate in the immunity determination proceedings before the Court of Claims or to appeal that determination.\u201d In <em>Johns, </em>the court noted that \u201cthe appellate court had no authority to hold that state employees may participate in the Court of Claims immunity-determination proceedings.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 33. The <em>Johns </em>court held that \u201cexcluding a state employee from participating in the immunity-determination proceedings does not violate his or her due process rights or deny him or her access to Ohio\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Gerschutz v. Med. College of Ohio Hosp., </em>Franklin App. No. (MAP-794, 2005-Ohio-1158, 2005 WL 615653, this court stated that it is error for the Court of Claims to permit participation of state employees, as if they are parties, in immunity-determination proceedings. In <em>Gerschutz, </em>the doctors\u2019 counsel \u201cpresented evidence through direct and cross-examination of witnesses, introduced exhibits into evidence, and submitted briefs.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 7. This court found the allowance of this participation to be erroneous under <em>Johns </em>and <em>Theobald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">{\u00b6 17} The <em>Johns </em>court, in a footnote, suggested that the General Assembly consider amending R.C. 2743.02 to permit state employees to participate in the immunity-determination proceedings. <em>Johns, </em>at \u00b6 39, fn. 4. The court stated that \u201cemployee participation would help ensure the integrity of the immunity determination.\u201d Id. The court further noted in footnote 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">Without participation of the employee in the hearing, it would be easier for the plaintiff to argue that an employee acted beyond the scope of his or her employment' so as to shift liability to the employee personally in order to reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Ms or her personal insurance coverage or to permit the plaintiff to present the case to a jury, as opposed to a judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">{\u00b6 18} Effective November 3, 2005, R.C. 2743.02(F) will be amended to permit an officer or employee to participate in an immunity-determination proceeding concerning that officer or employee. See Sub.H.B. No. 25 (amending R.C. 2743.02(F) to state, \u201cThe officer or employee may participate in the immunity determination proceeding before the court of claims to determine whether the officer or employee is entitled to personal immunity under section 9.86 of the Revised Code\u201d). We note that the amendment lacks language expressing an intent that the statute be retroactive. Under <em>Johns </em>and <em>Theobald, </em>the version of R.C. 2743.02 in effect when plaintiff filed his actions does not permit state employee participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 19} At the immunity-determination hearing in this case, Dr. Martin\u2019s counsel presented evidence through his direct examination of Dr. Martin, introduced exhibits into evidence, and argued for Dr. Martin\u2019s immunity. Dr. Martin\u2019s counsel also submitted a brief in support of immunity. In consideration of the facts in this case and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Gerschutz, </em>we conclude that Dr. Martin\u2019s involvement in the proceedings constituted \u201cparticipation\u201d under <em>Johns </em>and <em>Theobald. </em>Thus, the Court of Claims erred in permitting Dr. Martin to participate, as if he were a party, in the immunity-determination proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 20} OSUH argues that \u201c[n]o purpose would be served at this point to remand the case for a hearing in which Dr. Martin could not participate as he did in this hearing. The evidence would be substantially the same, and presumably the result would be identical.\u201d Essentially, OSUH argues that if there was error, then it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 21} Pursuant to Civ.R. 61, this court must disregard any error that does not affect a substantial right of the complaining party. Civ.R. 61 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">{\u00b6 22} In order to determine whether an error affected a substantial right of a party, the reviewing court must weigh the prejudicial effect of the error and decide whether the fact finder would probably have reached the same decision but for the error taking place. <em>Hallworth v. Republic Steel Corp. </em>(1950), 153 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Ohio St. 349, 41 O.O. 341, 91 N.E.2d 690, paragraph three of the syllabus. Therefore, in the case at bar, we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s error in permitting Dr. Martin to participate in the immunity-determination process was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">{\u00b6 23} Considering the ultimate factual issue in dispute at the hearing, we find that Dr. Martin\u2019s counsel was permitted to present substantively significant evidence at the immunity-determination hearing. For example, as stated above, at the immunity-determination hearing, Dr. Martin\u2019s counsel was permitted to present evidence through the direct examination of Dr. Martin. In that examination, Dr. Martin\u2019s counsel asked him questions regarding his involvement with Mr. Fortuna\u2019s care and his role as an attending physician supervising and teaching residents. Dr. Martin\u2019s responses provided support for the factual determination that he was acting within the scope of his employment with the state. Moreover, Dr. Martin\u2019s counsel also advocated a finding of immunity by filing briefs with the court and presenting closing arguments at the hearing. We conclude that Dr. Martin\u2019s participation, as if he were a party, was not harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 24} Based on the foregoing, we sustain plaintiffs second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 25} Plaintiffs third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error are rendered moot by our resolution of plaintiffs second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 26} Based on the foregoing, we overrule plaintiffs first assignment of error and sustain her second assignment of error. Our resolution of plaintiffs second assignment of error moots her third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Claims of Ohio is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-9\">French and McGrath.
