Corrigan, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">{\u00b6 1} In November 2004, the people of Ohio resoundingly approved the Ohio constitutional amendment known as Issue 1. Issue 1 amends the Ohio Constitution by defining marriage as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b781-16\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cOnly a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this state and its political subdivisions. This state and its political subdivisions shall not create or recognize a legal status for relationships <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage.\u201d Section 11, Article XV, Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">{\u00b6 3} Approximately three and one-half months after Issue 1 went into effect, the trial court analyzed Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute, R.C. 2919.25, in light of Issue 1 when appellee, Frederick Burk, was indicted on one count of domestic violence for causing or attempting to cause harm to Barbara Sanders, \u201ca family or household member.\u201d R.C. 2919.25(A). Burk moved the trial court to dismiss the charge, alleging that R.C. 2919.25 is unconstitutional in light of Issue 1. Despite the state\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the trial court granted in part Burk\u2019s motion to dismiss, reasoning that because Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute protects or \u201crecognizes\u201d unmarried people who live as spouses, it is incompatible with Issue 1 and, thus, unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed Burk\u2019s domestic-violence charge and amended the indictment to the lesser included charge of assault. The state now appeals as of right. See R.C. 2945.67(A); <em>State v. Hayes </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 173, 175, 25 OBR 214, 495 N.E.2d 578 (allowing \u201cthe state a direct appeal whenever the trial court grants a motion to dismiss all, or any part of, an indictment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">{\u00b6 4} The state asserts three assignments of error, yet the gravamen of the appeal is that the trial court erred in finding Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute unconstitutional. In particular, the state argues that the trial court failed to give constitutional deference to Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute, that the trial court misapplied Issue 1 to Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute, and that the trial court erred in finding that Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute recognizes for unmarried people a legal status that intends to approximate the design, quality, significance, or effect of marriage. We hold that Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute is neither incompatible with, nor unconstitutional in light of, Issue 1. For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">I. Ohio\u2019s Domestic Violence Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2919.25 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(A) No person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(F) As used in this section and sections 2919.251 [2919.25.1] and 2919.26 of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(1) \u2018Family or household member\u2019 means any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(a) Any of the following who is residing or has resided with the offender:</p>\n<p id=\"b783-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201c(i) A spouse, a person living as a spouse, or a former spouse of the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(ii) A parent or a child of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to the offender;</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(iii) A parent or a child of a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(b) The natural parent of any child of whom the offender is the other natural parent or is the putative other natural parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(2) \u2018Person living as a spouse\u2019 means a person who is living or has lived with the offender in a common law marital relationship, who otherwise is cohabiting with the offender, or who otherwise has cohabited with the offender within five years prior to the date of the alleged commission of the act in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">II. Presumption of Constitutionality</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">{\u00b6 16} It is well settled that \u201can enactment of the General Assembly is presumed to be constitutional, and before a court may declare it unconstitutional it must appear beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provisions are clearly incompatible.\u201d <em>Johns v. Univ. of Cincinnati Med. Assoc., Inc., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 234, 2004-Ohio-824, 804 N.E.2d 19, \u00b6 34. This presumption of constitutionality attaches regardless of whether the newly enacted statute challenges an existing provision of the Ohio Constitution or whether the existing statute is alleged to be in conflict with the new constitutional amendment. Here, the trial court ignored the time-honored constitutional analysis that is required and found that Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute was not entitled to a presumption of constitutionality because it was not the statute that \u201ccreate[d] the alleged conflict, but rather the subsequent and superceding constitutional provision.\u201d This holding was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court was required to give a reasonable construction to Issue 1, the subsequent constitutional amendment, and Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute \u201cso that both may stand.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Smead v. Union Twp. </em>(1858), 8 Ohio St. 394, 399. The trial court found that the only reasonable construction is that Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute recognizes violence between unmarried people who live together as spouses, a relationship that \u201capproximates the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage.\u201d Although the trial court stated that it was \u201cfully aware that judicial restraint compels it to avoid deciding constitutional issues \u2018unless absolutely necessary,\u2019 \u201d it disregarded that restraint by singlehandedly concluding that Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute and Issue 1 \u201ccannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>rendered compatible without distorting the plain meaning and clear intent of one or the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">III. Both Issue 1 and R.C. 2919.25 May Stand</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">{\u00b6 18} Here, reasonable interpretation \u201cso that both may stand\u201d exists. The first sentence of Issue 1 clearly defines marriage in Ohio as a union between one man and one woman. A man will not be considered legally married in Ohio if he is \u201cmarried\u201d to a man or to more than one woman. The second sentence of Issue 1 specifically prohibits Ohio and its political subdivisions from creating or recognizing any \u201clegal status\u201d that \u201cintends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage.\u201d Given its plain meaning, the second sentence is more than just a reiteration of the first\u2014 indeed, it is a guarantee that the state will not create or recognize the <em>legal status </em>of civil unions, domestic partnerships, or other relationships that mimic marriage. See <em>State v. Newell, </em>Stark App. No. 2004CA00264, 2005-Ohio-2848, 2005 WL 1364937, \u00b6 43 (agreeing with the state\u2019s argument that the intent of Issue 1 \u201cwas to prohibit same sex marriage\u201d and \u201cwas specifically adopted in response to the decision of the Massachusetts[ ] Supreme Court in <em>Goodridge v. Department of Public Health </em>(2003), 440 Mass. 309, 798 N.E.2d 941 that the Massachusetts[ ] law limiting the protections, benefits and obligations of civil marriage to individuals of opposite sexes lacked a rational basis and violated state constitutional equal protection principles\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">{\u00b6 19} Erroneously, the trial court concluded that Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute confers upon cohabiting, unmarried individuals that approximates \u201cthe design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage\u201d simply because the phrase \u201cfamily or household member\u201d as defined in that statute includes \u201ca person living as a spouse.\u201d Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute, however, does not guarantee the right to be free from family violence that stems only from the legal status of marriage, nor is domestic violence a crime that is born out of marriage alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">{\u00b6 20} As explained by the Cleveland Municipal Court in <em>Cleveland v. Knipp </em>(Mar. 10, 2005), Cuyahoga Cty. M.C. No. 2004 CRB 039103, 2005 WL 1017620, the legislature, in creating the definition \u201cliving as a spouse,\u201d did not intend \u201cto bestow upon unmarried individuals, or to recognize in them, a legal status that approximates the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage.\u201d In <em>Knipp, </em>the court denied the motion to dismiss the charge of domestic violence, holding that the legislature\u2019s \u201cprimary intent in crafting the state\u2019s domestic violence statutes was to provide protection to <em>all </em>persons who cohabit, regardless of their marital status.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">{\u00b6 21} <em>Knipp </em>further reasoned that the legislature \u201cmerely acknowledged the reality that, with or without official approval, human beings in Ohio, as elsewhere, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>will come together in a variety of loving relationships that will sometimes turn violent. Ohio\u2019s domestic violence laws assure that all of its citizens who require the special protections that the circumstances of domestic violence create will have access to the resources of their government to enhance their safety. This assurance can be, and has been, made, even to unmarried couples, without the extension of the status or benefits of marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">{\u00b6 22} In fact, Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute broadly encompasses many individuals, including the parent or child of the offender or another person related by blood to the offender, and the parent or child of a spouse, a person living as a spouse, or another person related by blood or affinity to a spouse or person living as a spouse. R.C. 2919.25(F)(l)(a)(ii) and (iii). Likewise, Ohio courts have consistently applied the domestic-violence statute to same-sex couples, reasoning that it is not the sexual relationship of the parties that determines whether their factual situation falls within the definitions covered by Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute. See <em>State v. Hadinger </em>(1991), 61 Ohio App.3d 820, 823, 573 N.E.2d 1191. Although sexual intercourse is a \u201cpersuasive indicium\u201d of cohabitation, it is not conclusive. Instead, the factual determination for domestic-violence purposes has always been whether the parties have cohabited. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">{\u00b6 23} As the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas stated in <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>131 Ohio Misc.2d 1, 2005-Ohio-1730, 827 N.E.2d 872 \u00b6 14:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c[W]hile \u2018cohabitation\u2019 defines a relationship between people, that status is factual not legal. \u2018Cohabitant\u2019 is therefore not a legal status, let alone a legal status that \u2018intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance or effect of marriage\u2019 within the meaning of [Issue 1].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">{\u00b6 25} <em>Knipp </em>further explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThese definitions are not terms of art. They are descriptions designed to assist fact-finders in discovering whether the unique circumstances surrounding individual relationships can be categorized in such a way as to establish the existence of domestic violence. The courts are of accord that there need not be an actual assertion of marriage, for instance, and that cohabitation can be based entirely on acts of living together without sexual relations.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Cuyahoga Cty. M.C. No. 2004 CRB 039103.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">{\u00b6 27} In considering what constitutes cohabitation, the Ohio Supreme Court held in <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 459, 465, 683 N.E.2d 1126:</p>\n<p id=\"A8j\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c[T]he essential elements of \u2018cohabitation\u2019 are (1) sharing of familial or financial responsibilities and (2) consortium. * * * Possible factors establishing shared familial or financial responsibilities might include provisions for shelter, food, clothing, utilities, and/or commingled assets. Factors that might establish consortium include mutual respect, fidelity, affection, society, cooperation, solace, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>comfort, aid of each other, friendship, and conjugal relations. These factors are unique to each case and how much weight, if any, to give to each of these factors must be decided on a case-by-case basis by the trier of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">{\u00b6 29} For instance, in <em>Williams, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 459, 683 N.E.2d 1126, the court noted that because the defendant and the victim fought over money problems, the two spent most of their nights together at defendant\u2019s residence, and at one time the victim thought she might be pregnant with defendant\u2019s child, they were cohabitants and, thus, \u201cfamily or household members\u201d as defined by Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute. Id. The determination of whether the two are \u201cfamily or household members\u201d turns on the particular facts of the couple\u2019s relationship, not on their legal status.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">{\u00b6 30} For instance, even though Ohio law abolished common-law marriage on October 10, 1991, de facto evidence of common-law marriage does not preclude a domestic-violence charge should violence occur between the two individuals. See R.C. 3105.12(B)(1). Simply because the two cohabit and hold themselves out as married does not confer the legal status of marriage upon the individuals. See R.C. 3105.12(A). Instead, it is the factual relationship of a common-law marriage that renders each party a \u201cfamily or household member\u201d for the purposes of Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">{\u00b6 31} Thus, for the purposes of this appeal, the threshold determination of whether any individuals fall within the definition of \u201cfamily or household member\u201d is whether they reside with or have resided with the offender. R.C. 2919.25(F)(1)(a). For example, if a man and a woman who are legally married have never resided with each other in any fashion, they do not fall within the definition of \u201cfamily or household member\u201d and, thus, any violence between them may be assault, but it certainly is not considered domestic violence under Ohio law. Because Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute is predicated upon the factual determination of cohabitation \u2014 and not the legal determination of marriage\u2014 both Issue 1 and Ohio\u2019s domestic violence statute \u201cmay stand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">{\u00b6 32} We hold that Ohio\u2019s domestic-violence statute, insofar as it defines \u201cfamily or household member\u201d to include unmarried individuals who live as spouses, is constitutional and coexists in harmony with Issue 1. As a result, the trial court\u2019s decision granting in part Burk\u2019s motion to dismiss is reversed, Burk\u2019s original indictment for domestic violence is reinstated, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b786-9\">Blackmon, A.J., and Calabrese, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
