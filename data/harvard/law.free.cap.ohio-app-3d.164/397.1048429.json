This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b440-19\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Appellant filed suit below seeking to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund as the widow of Richard Chambers. Richard Chambers worked for appellee Montrose Ford up until the time of his death. On October 30, 1998, Chambers, while at work, was engaged in an argument with a co-worker, his cousin, John Harris. Tragically, during the argument, Harris went to his vehicle, retrieved a shotgun, returned, and fatally wounded Chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The workers\u2019 compensation claim was tried to a jury, and the jury found against appellant. The jury concluded that Chambers had acted as an instigator during the assault and thus was precluded from participating in the fund. Appellant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied, and appellant timely appealed the jury\u2019s verdict, raising four assignments of error for review. To facilitate our analysis, we have rearranged appellant\u2019s assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">The trial court erred in providing jury instructions which incorrectly defined the term \u201cinstigator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 4} In her second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court improperly defined \u201cinstigator\u201d in the jury charge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">{\u00b6 5} A trial court must charge a jury with instructions that are a correct and complete statement of the law. <em>Marshall v. Gibson </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 10, 12, 19 OBR 8, 482 N.E.2d 583. However, the precise language of a jury instruction is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Callahan v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., </em>9th Dist. No. 22387, 2005-Ohio-5103, 2005 WL 2373916; <em>Youssef v. Parr, Inc. </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 679, 690, 591 N.E.2d 762. In reviewing jury instructions on appeal, this court has previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">[A]n appellate court reviews the instructions as a whole. If, taken in their entirety, the instructions fairly and correctly state the law applicable to the evidence presented at trial, reversible error will not be found merely on the possibility that the jury may have been misled. Moreover, misstatements and ambiguity in a portion of the instructions will not constitute reversible error unless the instructions are so misleading that they prejudicially affect a substantial right of the complaining party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">(Citations omitted.) <em>Wozniak v. Wozniak </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 400, 410, 629 N.E.2d 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">{\u00b6 6} Additionally, a trial court has no obligation to give jury instructions in the language proposed by the parties, even if the proposed instruction is an accurate statement of the law. <em>Henderson v. Spring Run Allotment </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 633, 638, 651 N.E.2d 489. \u201cInstead, the court has the discretion to use its own language to communicate the same legal principles.\u201d Id. Thus, absent an abuse of discretion, this court must affirm the trial court\u2019s language of the jury instructions. The phrase \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of judgment; rather, it implies that the trial court\u2019s attitude was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court provided the following jury instruction regarding the term \u201cinstigator:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">Montrose Ford claims Richard Chambers was the instigator of the conflict. The term \u201cinstigated\u201d does not mean merely whether Richard Chambers started the quarrel that led to the assault. In order to find that Richard Chambers instigated the assault, you must determine that Richard Chambers used words or actions that would have a tendency to provoke or incite the shooting. An instigator goads or urges on another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Appellant asserts that the final sentence in this instruction \u201cdestroys the legal accuracy of the instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant urges that the holding in <em>Indus. Comm. v. Pora </em>(1919), 100 Ohio St. 218, 125 N.E. 662, compels a finding that the trial court\u2019s instruction was erroneous. Specifically, appellant relies upon the court\u2019s reasoning, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">It is not claimed that Pora used any force or violence or made any threats of violence, nor did he use language which would have a tendency to provoke an assault, and we are therefore bound to conclude that nothing was said or done by Pora to incite any assault, much less the deadly one that ensued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Id. at 220, 125 N.E. 662. <em>Pora </em>is the seminal case in Ohio regarding compensation for workplace assaults. Based upon the rationale utilized by <em>Pora, </em>however, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in defining \u201cinstigate\u201d as noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">{\u00b6 9} Ohio Jury Instructions does not provide a definition of \u201cinstigate\u201d or \u201cinstigator.\u201d Further, our review of Ohio case law does not reveal any court that has provided a comprehensive definition of \u201cinstigate.\u201d Accordingly, we turn to R.C. 1.42, which provides, \u2018Words and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cInstigate\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]o goad or incite (someone) to take some action or course.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 800. <em>Pora, </em>cited as authority by appellant, used the terminology \u201clanguage which would have a tendency to provoke an assault.\u201d <em>Pora, </em>100 Ohio St. at 220, 125 N.E. 662. Provoke is defined as \u201cto incite to anger.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (1980) 921. Similarly, \u201curge\u201d is defined as to \u201cstimulate\u201d or \u201cprovoke.\u201d Id. at 1278. Finally, \u201cgoad\u201d is defined as \u201cto incite or rouse[.]\u201d Id. at 488. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by substituting synonyms for the word \u201cprovoke.\u201d As noted above, the trial court has broad discretion in choosing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the language of its charge to the jury. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s choice of using terminology that has substantially the same meaning as the definition approved in <em>Pora </em>cannot be said to be an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">{\u00b6 11} Appellant has urged that this court must liberally construe <em>Pora </em>to include a test for reasonableness. Appellant asserts that even if Chambers\u2019s conduct falls within the broad definition of <em>Pora, </em>Harris\u2019s response was so unreasonable that the injury must be found compensable. Appellant argues that a holding to the contrary fails to fulfill the purpose and spirit of workers\u2019 compensation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 12} <em>Pora </em>does not speak in terms of reasonableness or justification. While it has not been revisited or refined in nearly a century, the language of <em>Pora </em>is clear and unambiguous. Inserting appellant\u2019s \u201creasonableness\u201d standard would abrogate much of the holding in <em>Pora, </em>i.e., an unreasonable response is inherent in a workplace assault that results in a criminal conviction. As such, under appellant\u2019s proposed standard, nearly every injury arising from a workplace assault would be compensable. Such a result is not supported by <em>Pora.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 13} <em>Pora </em>speaks only of language that would tend to provoke <em>\u201can </em>assault.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Pora, </em>100 Ohio St. at 220, 125 N.E. 662. There is no authority for this court to graft a reasonableness standard onto the test set forth in <em>Pora. </em>Accordingly, the jury was properly instructed on \u201cinstigation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\n<em>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">The trial court erred when it instructed the jury to determine whether Richard Chambers was the \u201cinstigator\u201d of the assault which resulted in his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 14} In her first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred when it permitted the jury to determine whether or not Chambers had instigated the assault. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">{\u00b6 15} In reviewing whether sufficient evidence was presented to warrant submitting an issue to a jury, this court must determine whether the record contains evidence from which reasonable minds could reach the conclusion sought by the instruction. <em>Murphy v. Carrollton Mfg. Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 585, 591, 575 N.E.2d 828.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">[I]t is uncontestably the duty of a trial court to submit an essential issue to the jury when there is sufficient evidence, if believed, relating to that issue to permit reasonable minds to reach different conclusions on that issue. Conversely, it is also the duty of a trial court to withhold an essential issue from the jury when there <em>is not </em>sufficient evidence relating to that issue to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>reasonable minds to reach different conclusions on that issue. In other words, if all the evidence relating to an essential issue is sufficient to permit only a conclusion by reasonable minds against a party, after construing the evidence most favorably to that party, it is the duty of the trial court to instruct a finding or direct a verdict on that issue against that party. Naturally, if the finding on that one issue disposes of the whole case, a duty arises to grant judgment upon the whole case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">(Citations omitted and emphasis added.) <em>O\u2019Day v. Webb </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 215, 220, 58 O.O.2d 424, 280 N.E.2d 896. In the instant matter, appellees sought and received the jury instruction, supra, regarding whether Chambers was an instigator. Accordingly, we proceed to review whether reasonable minds could have come to different conclusions on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 16} The evidence presented included the following. Chambers and Harris were cousins and worked together at Montrose Ford. Chambers was a superior of Harris\u2019s in the detail and ear-wash department at Montrose. In fact, Chambers was central in Montrose\u2019s decision to hire Harris.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 17} Harris testified, via videotaped deposition, however, that he had felt that Chambers constantly belittled him about how he handled his job duties. Harris continued his testimony as follows. On the day of the incident, October 30, 1998, Harris overheard a conversation between Chambers and another employee and believed that Chambers was mocking him. Harris believed that Chambers had made the noise of a cuckoo clock in his direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 18} Harris then left the work area, went to his vehicle, and retrieved a shotgun. Harris returned with the weapon and confronted Chambers. The argument resumed and Chambers stated something substantially similar to \u201cIf you are going to shoot me, go ahead and shoot me. It must be my time to go.\u201d At that time, Butch McMillan, the head of the detail department, intervened and escorted Harris outside the building. McMillan felt then that he had calmed Harris and that the danger had subsided. However, at that time, Chambers stated loudly enough for Harris to hear, \u201cHe ain\u2019t f**king coming back in here,\u201d to which Harris responded, \u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Harris then reentered the garage and shot and killed Chambers. With regard to those final statements, the following questioning took place during Harris\u2019s deposition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">Q. Now, if [Richard] hadn\u2019t made those comments to you, did you intend to leave the premises and not have anything else happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Harris\u2019s statements are supported by Chris Alberson, a co-worker, who testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Q. Had \u2014 did you believe that Mr. \u2014 at the time you were there, did you believe at that time that Mr. McMillan had basically defused the situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">A. Yes, I do. Because \u2014 because it \u2014 he was outside and they were \u2014 and they were half way to his car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 19} There is no question that the events of October 30,1998, were tragic and that appellant has suffered a tremendous loss. Based upon the evidence presented, however, this court finds that a reasonable jury could reach different conclusions on the issue of whether Chambers instigated the assault. Accordingly, the trial court properly submitted the matter to the jury. <em>Murphy, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 591, 575 N.E.2d 828. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">\n<em>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">The trial court erred [ ] in providing imprecise jury instructions and interrogatories that directed the jury to [ ] findings that were inconsistent and devoid of evidentiary support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 20} In her third assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred when it permitted the jury to answer interrogatories in an inconsistent fashion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">{\u00b6 21} The trial court has the discretion and a duty under Civ.R. 49(B) to review the jury interrogatories to determine whether they were inconsistent with the jury\u2019s general verdict. <em>Bicudo v. Lexford Properties Inc., </em>157 Ohio App.3d 509, 2004-Ohio-3202, 812 N.E.2d 315, at \u00b6 51. Accordingly, this court will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision regarding whether to set aside the verdict absent an abuse of discretion. Id. The phrase \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of judgment; rather, it implies that the trial court\u2019s attitude was arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore, </em>5 Ohio St.3d at 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. Further, \u201c[i]f it is reasonably possible so to do, special findings of a jury must be harmonized with its general verdict.\u201d <em>Klever v. Reid Bros. Express, Inc. </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 467, 474, 39 O.O. 280, 86 N.E.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">{\u00b6 22} The following interrogatories and answers resulted from the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">1. Was there a causal connection between the shooting and the work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-13\">2. When John Harris left the car wash with Darryl \u201cButch\u201d McMillan, did this break the causal relation between the employment and the injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-14\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-15\">3. Were the events after they left a continuation of the work related conflict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>4. Were the events after the two men left the car wash, a separate work related conflict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">5. If the answer of six or more juror to Interrogatory No. 3 or No. 4 is \u2018Yes,\u201d was Richard Chambers the instigator of this conflict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Appellant asserts that the jury\u2019s answers to these interrogatories are inconsistent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 23} Based upon the above answers, the jury found that on the day of the assault, only one continuing conflict occurred. The jury therefore must have concluded that McMillan\u2019s efforts to remove Harris from the garage had not defused the situation in its entirety. Such a finding is supported by the evidence, which demonstrated that Chambers\u2019s comments were made in close temporal proximity to McMillan\u2019s intervention \u2014 i.e., Chambers\u2019s comments were made within minutes of McMillan\u2019s removing Harris from the garage and served to continue the argument between Chambers and Harris. Based upon the events of the entire argument on October 30, 1998, the jury found that Chambers had instigated the assault. As a result, a verdict was returned that found that appellant was not entitled to participate in the fund. As the jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatories coincide with its general verdict, no inconsistencies exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 24} Within this assignment of error, appellant maintains that the jury\u2019s response to interrogatory number five was against the manifest weight of the evidence. However, as noted above, the evidence at trial was uncontested. Appellant\u2019s challenge is identical to the challenge raised in her first assignment of error \u2014 i.e., a legal challenge to the trial court\u2019s determination to allow the matter to proceed to the jury on the issue of \u201cinstigation.\u201d Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">\n<em>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR TV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">The trial court erred in denying [appellant\u2019s] motion for directed verdict and subsequently [appellant\u2019s] motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">{\u00b6 25} In her final assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it failed to grant her motion for directed verdict and her later motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Civ.R. 50(A) authorizes the trial court to grant a directed verdict when \u201cafter construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion is directed, [it] finds that upon any determinative issue reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion upon the evidence submitted and that conclusion is adverse to such party, the court shall sustain the motion and direct a verdict for the moving party as to that issue.\u201d Civ.R. 50(A)(4). An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a directed verdict de novo, as it presents an appellate court with a question of law. <em>Schafer v. RMS Realty </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 244, 257, 741 N.E.2d 155. This court applies the same standard when evaluating a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>Rondy, Inc. v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>9th Dist. No. 21608, 2004-Ohio-835, 2004 WL 344157, at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">{\u00b6 27} In her final assignment of error, appellant has made no arguments other than those addressed by this court in her first and second assignments of error. As we held above, reasonable minds could differ regarding whether Chambers had instigated the assault that led to his death. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s final assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 28} Appellant\u2019s four assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-8\">Slaby, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b447-9\">Carr, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-13\">. While appellant's assignment of error discusses a motion for a new trial, she has made no argument regarding the trial court's denial of that motion. See App.R. 16(A)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b447-10\">Carr, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">{\u00b6 29} I respectfully dissent. There is truly only one issue in this case. Was Richard Chambers in the course and scope of his employment when he was shot and killed on October 30, 1998, at Montrose Ford? Since I believe he was, I must dissent. A workplace assault is evaluated no differently from any other type of workplace injury. Consequently, if Chambers\u2019s death was \u201cin the course of, and arising out of\u2019 his employment, it is compensable. R.C. 4123.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">{\u00b6 30} There is no dispute here that the assault was work-related. The question here is whether Chambers, by his own actions, removed himself from the course and scope of his employment. In making this determination, both sides rely on <em>Indus. Comm. v. Pora </em>(1919), 100 Ohio St. 218, 125 N.E. 662, and look at whether Chambers was the instigator of the assault. In determining whether Pora was outside the course and scope of his employment, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Court looked at whether Pora used force or violence or any threats of violence, or said or did anything to incite an assault. This examination is again no different from the context of any other work-related injury. Ohio courts have consistently held that an employee\u2019s injuries are \u201coutside the course and scope of his employment\u201d when they are of his own making or due to his own misconduct. See <em>Highway Oil Co. v. State ex. rel. Bricker </em>(1935), 130 Ohio St. 175, 181, 4 O.O. 101, 198 N.E. 276 (employee accidentally shot himself with his own gun that he had brought to work) and <em>Carrick v. Riser Foods, Inc. </em>(1996) 115 Ohio App.3d 573, 577, 685 N.E.2d 1261 (employee injured when he shook soft-drink machine).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">{\u00b6 31} There is no evidence here that Chambers\u2019s death was of \u201chis own making or misconduct.\u201d Harris brought a shotgun to work with the intention of shooting Chambers, and he did. The only argument presented that Chambers \u201cinstigated\u201d this deadly assault was his comments at one point early on to Harris to \u201cjust shoot\u201d him and then later by saying \u201cHe ain\u2019t f**king coming back in here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 32} In order to find that an employee was not \u201cin the course and scope of his employment\u201d when fatally assaulted at work, there must be evidence that the deceased employee used force or \u201clanguage which would have a tendency to provoke [a deadly assault].\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C); <em>Pora, </em>100 Ohio St. at 220, 125 N.E. 662. Chambers\u2019s statements here would not have the tendency to provoke a deadly assault. Harris was the one who brought a deadly weapon into the workplace with the intention of shooting Chambers. Chambers\u2019s words did not remove him from the course and scope of employment. Appellant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. I would sustain appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error and remand for a directed verdict to be issued in appellant\u2019s favor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
