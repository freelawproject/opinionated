Appellee and cross-appellant, Worthington City School District Board of Education, cross-appeals and moves to dismiss the instant appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. For the reasons that follow, we deny appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal, and we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">{\u00b6 2} This matter arises from appellee\u2019s purported violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), Section 1400 et seq., Title 20, U.S.Code. In <em>Austintown Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Mahoning Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 355, 613 N.E.2d 167, the Supreme Court of Ohio described the IDEA as follows: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), Section 1400 <em>et seq., </em>Title 20, U.S.Code, provides federal funding to assist state and local educational agencies in educating children with disabilities. The purpose of IDEA is \u201cto assure that all children with disabilities have available to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>* * * a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs, to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Id. at 360, 613 N.E.2d 167, quoting former Section 1400(c), Title 20, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cTo qualify for federal assistance, states must enact policies and procedures which are consistent with IDEA requirements. * * * Ohio has done so through R.C. Chapter 3323. In addition, the State Board of Education has promulgated rules for the education of handicapped children under authority granted in R.C. 3323.03 and 3323.04.\u201d Id. (Footnote omitted.) See, generally, Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 3301-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cIncorporated in R.C. Chapter 3323 is the purpose of IDEA: to provide handicapped children a free, appropriate public education tailored to the unique needs of each child by developing an IEP [individualized education program] which places the child in the least restrictive environment.\u201d Id. at 360, 613 N.E.2d 167, citing R.C. 3323.01(D) and (E), 3323.02, 3323.08(C); former Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-02(E)(l)(d)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 5} According to the evidence, the Stancourts\u2019 minor son received special education' services through the Worthington City School District. During the 2001-2002 academic year, when the Stancourts\u2019 son was in sixth grade, a dispute arose between the Stancourts and the school district concerning their son\u2019s individualized education program (\u201cIEP\u201d). Specifically, the Stancourts claim that the board of education violated the IDEA when it allegedly unilaterally changed their son\u2019s IEP, when it failed to comply with the IDEA\u2019S procedural safeguards, and when it allegedly misled the Stancourts concerning its intention to implement proposed changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 6} In January 2002, an IEP was created to address the educational needs of the Stancourts\u2019 son. Both the Stancourts and the school district agreed to the program contained in this IEP. Thereafter, three addenda, dated February 8, March 12,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and April 10, 2002, were added to the IEP of January 2002. The Stancourts claim that they never agreed to the addendum of April 10, 2002, when they met with school officials on April 10, 2002.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Stancourts further claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>that after the meeting of April 10, 2002, the school district failed to provide them with timely notice that changes in their son\u2019s IEP, which were based upon the addendum of April 10, 2002, had been implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 7} On May 28, 2002, the Stancourts and representatives from the school district met to discuss an IEP program for the Stancourts\u2019 son for the next academic year. Three days later, the Stancourts filed for a due-process hearing; however, they later withdrew this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 8} On June 7, 2002, without the Stancourts in attendance, representatives from the school district met to discuss the Stancourts\u2019 son\u2019s IEP for the upcoming academic year. Following this meeting, the school district notified the Stancourts about the proposed IEP of June 7, 2002; however, the Stancourts did not consent to that IEP, and ultimately it was not implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 9} On August 26, 2002, the Stancourts again requested a due-process hearing, claiming that the basis for this request was identical to the issues raised in their previous due-process-hearing request of May 31, 2002. In the May 31, 2002 request, the Stancourts stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">The reasons are the addendum, dated April 10, which Worthington Schools implemented without our consent or participation and the new IEP which has been drafted and which eliminates all reference to social skills needs. Also, the lack of a social skills goal and objectives in the current IEP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 10} Pursuant to R.C. 3323.05(E), the Stancourts\u2019 complaint was referred to an impartial hearing examiner (\u201cIHO\u201d). The IHO concluded that the IEP of January 2002, with the addenda dated February 8, March 12, and April 10, 2002, constituted the Stancourts\u2019 son\u2019s IEP. During the proceedings before the IHO, an issue arose concerning the Stancourts\u2019 refusal to consent to release of their son\u2019s medical and mental-health-treatment records to the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">{\u00b6 11} After the Stancourts failed to comply with the IHO\u2019s order to grant release of their son\u2019s records, the school district moved the IHO to dismiss the matter with prejudice. In response, the Stancourts informed the IHO that they intended to grant the school district access to the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">{\u00b6 12} In January 2003, after the Stancourts had failed to comply with the IHO\u2019s order to grant the school district access to the requested records, the school district again sought dismissal with prejudice of the Stancourts\u2019 action. Later, after the Stancourts retained legal counsel, the IHO granted a request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>additional time to reply to the school district\u2019s request for dismissal. After receiving no response from the Stancourts or their legal counsel, the IHO dismissed the Stancourts\u2019 appeal with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">{\u00b6 13} Thereafter, the Stancourts appealed from the IHO\u2019s decision to the state board of education, which appointed a state-level reviewing officer (\u201cSLRO\u201d) to consider their appeal. Finding that the IHO erred in dismissing the action with prejudice, the SLRO amended the IHO\u2019s order to a dismissal without prejudice, subject to reopening after the Stancourts complied with the order to grant the school district access to their son\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 14} The Stancourts then appealed from the SLRO\u2019s order to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. In common pleas case No. 03CVF-06-6746, the common pleas court dismissed the Stancourts\u2019 appeal because their notice of appeal failed to comply with mandatory requirements of R.C. 119.12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in its decision filed October 31, 2003, the common pleas court also concluded that because the state board of education failed to fully comply with the procedural requirements of R.C. 119.09, the appeal period had not commenced and, as a consequence, appellants were not barred from filing a timely, proper notice of appeal. Appellee did not appeal from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 15} On November 14, 2003, in case No. 03CFV-11-12578, the Stancourts again appealed from the SLRO\u2019s decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. In a judgment entry filed July 27, 2004, the common pleas court reversed decisions of the IHO and SLRO and remanded the matter with instructions to set a new hearing date. The common pleas court further found that the school district was entitled to the records that the Stancourts intended to offer at the hearings and to foundational materials relied upon by any expert that the Stancourts intended to call at the hearings. The common pleas court further found that a \u201cstay-put\u201d issue was not moot. The common pleas court also determined that the decision of the IHO to allow implementation of the April 2002 addendum was correct and that this addendum properly should be considered part of the Stancourts\u2019 son\u2019s IEP.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>{\u00b6 16} From the common pleas court\u2019s judgment of July 27, 2004, appellants appeal and appellee cross-appeals. Appellee also moves this court to dismiss the instant appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">{\u00b6 17} In its motion to dismiss, appellee asserts that the common pleas court erroneously applied the procedural requirements set forth in R.C. 119.09 and, construing R.C. 3323.05, further asserts that appellants\u2019 appeal is untimely. Appellee therefore reasons that the common pleas court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and, consequently, this court also lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cSubject-matter jurisdiction is a court\u2019s power over a type of case. It is determined as a matter of law and, once conferred, it remains.\u201d <em>Pratts v. Hurley, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, at \u00b6 34; see, also, <em>Morrison v. Steiner </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 86, 61 O.O.2d 335, 290 N.E.2d 841, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cSubject-matter jurisdiction of a court connotes the power to hear and decide a case upon its merits\u201d). Jurisdiction is a condition precedent to a court\u2019s ability to hear a case. <em>State ex rel. Tubbs Jones v. Suster </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 70, 75, 701 N.E.2d 1002. \u201cIf a court acts without jurisdiction, then any proclamation by that court is void.\u201d Id., citing <em>Patton v. Diemer </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 68, 518 N.E.2d 941. A jurisdictional defect cannot be waived, and it may be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State ex rel. Tubbs Jones </em>at 75, 701 N.E.2d 1002; <em>Jenkins v. Keller </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 122, 35 O.O.2d 147, 216 N.E.2d 379, paragraph five of the syllabus. \u201c[W]hen an appellate court determines that the trial court was without jurisdiction, it is not proper for the reviewing court to decide the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Eagle Fireworks, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>Washington App. No. 03CA28, 2004-Ohio-509, 2004 WL 232869, at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 19} Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the instant appeal challenges the propriety of the common pleas court\u2019s rulings in case No. 03CVF-06-6746. However, the judgment in case No. 03CVF-11-12578, not No. 03CVF-06-6746, is the proper subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 20} In its motion to dismiss the instant appeal, appellee asserts that on May 12, 2003, the SLRO issued a decision and, on June 18, 2003, appellants appealed from the SLRO\u2019s decision to the common pleas court. That appeal was the subject of case No. 03CVF-06-6746. R.C. 3323.05(F) provides that any party aggrieved by the final order of the reviewing officer who was appointed by the state board of education \u201cmay appeal the final order within forty-five days of notification of the order to the court of common pleas of the county in which the child\u2019s school district of residence is located, under Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.\u201d Because appellants\u2019 appeal to the common pleas court was within 45 days of the SLRO\u2019s order, they complied with the timing requirements of R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>3323.05(F). See, generally, <em>Painesville v. Lake Cty. Budget Comm. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 282, 285, 10 O.O.3d 411, 383 N.E.2d 896, quoting <em>Queen City Valves, Inc. v.

Glander </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St. 147, 150, 34 O.O. 8, 70 N.E.2d 93, (\u201cIt is established law in Ohio that \u2018 \u201cwhere a statute confers the right of appeal, adherence to the conditions thereby imposed is essential to the enjoyment of the right conferred\u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"> {\u00b6 21} The term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d \u201cencompasses jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the person.\u201d <em>Pratts, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 81, 2004-Ohio-1980, 806 N.E.2d 992, \u00b6 11, citing <em>State v. Parker, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 524, 2002-Ohio-2833, 769 N.E.2d 846, \u00b6 22 (Cook, J., dissenting). \u201c \u2018Once a tribunal has jurisdiction over both the subject matter of an action and the parties to it, \u201c * * * the right to hear and determine is perfect; and the decision of every question thereafter arising is but the exercise of the jurisdiction thus conferred * * *.\u201d <em>\u2019 \u201d Pratts </em>at \u00b6 12, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pizza v. Rayford </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 382, 384, 582 N.E.2d 992, quoting <em>Sheldon\u2019s Lessee v. Newton </em>(1854), 3 Ohio St. 494, 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">{\u00b6 22} In case No. 03CVF-06-6746, the common pleas court determined that (1) R.C. 119.09 applied to appellants\u2019 appeal under R.C. 3323.05, (2) the state board of education had not complied with requirements in R.C. 119.09, (3) the period within which appellants were required to appeal had not commenced, and (4) appellants were not barred from filing a timely, proper notice of appeal. Appellee did not appeal from the judgment in case No. 03CVF-06-6746. Absent an appeal by appellee, the common pleas court\u2019s rulings in case No. 03CVF-06-6746 implicate the doctrine of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cCollateral estoppel \u2018precludes the relitigation of an issue that has been \u201cactually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Fort Frye Teachers Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 283, 2004-Ohio-2947, 809 N.E.2d 1130, at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Krahn v. Kinney </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 103, 107, 538 N.E.2d 1058, quoting <em>Goodson v. McDonough Power Equip., Inc. </em>(1983), 2 Ohio St.3d 193, 195, 2 OBR 732, 443 N.E.2d 978. \u201cCollateral estoppel applies when the fact or issue (1) was actually and directly litigated in the prior action, (2) was passed upon and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and (3) where the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party in privity with a party to the prior action.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Wing </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 176, 183, 637 N.E.2d 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Scholler v. Scholler </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 98, 10 OBR 426, 462 N.E.2d 158, the Supreme Court of Ohio held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">A point of law or a fact which was actually and directly in issue in the former action, and was there passed upon and determined by a court of competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>jurisdiction, may not be drawn in question in a subsequent action between the same parties or their privities. The prior judgment estops a party, or a person in privity with him, from subsequently relitigating the identical issue raised in the prior action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">{\u00b6 25} Here, whether the procedural requirements of R.C. Chapter 119 applied to appellants\u2019 appeal under R.C. 3323.05 was a point of law that was actually and directly in issue before the common pleas court in case No. 03CVF-06-6746. Having failed to appeal from the common pleas court\u2019s judgment in case No. 03CVF-06-6746 that R.C. Chapter 119 applied to appellants\u2019 appeal, appellee is now precluded from challenging this point of law in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">{\u00b6 26} Furthermore, having failed to appeal from the common pleas court\u2019s judgment in case No. 03CVF-06-6746 that appellants were permitted to file another appeal from the SLRO\u2019s decision, appellee also is precluded from challenging that determination in this appeal. See <em>State ex rel. Pendell v. Adams Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 58, 60, 531 N.E.2d 713 (\u201cWhere a notice of appeal is not filed within the time prescribed by law, the reviewing court is without jurisdiction to consider issues that should have been raised in the appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">{\u00b6 27} In the instant appeal, in response to the common pleas court\u2019s unchallenged determination in case No. 03CVF-06-6746 that appellants were not barred from filing another appeal from the SLRO\u2019s decision of May 12, 2003, appellants appealed from the SLRO\u2019s decision on November 14, 2003. On July 27, 2004, the common pleas court rendered judgment concerning their appeal of November 14, 2003. From this judgment, appellants appealed to this court on August 26, 2004. See, generally, App.R. 4(A), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">A party shall file the notice of appeal required by App.R. 3 within thirty days of the later of entry of the judgment or order appealed or, in a civil case, service of the notice of judgment and its entry if service is not made on the party within the three day period in Rule 58(B) of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Cf. R.C. 119.12 (providing that an appeal from the common pleas court\u2019s judgment under R.C. Chapter 119 \u201cmay be taken either by the party or the agency, shall proceed as in the case of appeals in civil actions, and shall be pursuant to the Rules of Appellate Procedure and, to the extent not in conflict with those rules, Chapter 2505. of the Revised Code\u201d); R.C. 2505.07 (\u201cAfter the entry of a final order of an administrative officer, agency, board, department, tribunal, commission, or other instrumentality, the period of time within which the appeal shall be perfected, unless otherwise provided by law, is thirty days\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Because the filing of appellants\u2019 present appeal complies with the time requirements of App.R. 4(A), R.C. 2505.07, and 119.12, we conclude that appellants timely perfected the present appeal. We further conclude that subject-matter jurisdiction properly lies and, therefore, appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the instant appeal for lack of jurisdiction is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">{\u00b6 29} In their appeal, appellants assert a sole assignment of error for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">The trial court committed reversible error in finding that the April 10 IEP addendum was part of [appellants\u2019 son\u2019s] stay put IEP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">{\u00b6 30} Appellants do not challenge the common pleas court\u2019s ruling concerning the school district\u2019s entitlement to records and foundational materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">{\u00b6 31} In its cross-appeal, appellee asserts the following cross-assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">The common pleas court erred in finding that the state level review officer lacked authority to dismiss the special education due process request based on appellants\u2019 repeated failures to comply with the impartial hearing officer\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">{\u00b6 32} Before addressing the merits of the appeal and cross-appeal, we consider the appropriate standard of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">{\u00b6 33} In <em>Tanya v. Cincinnati Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 100 Ohio App.3d 52, 651 N.E.2d 1373, the First District Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">Parents who are dissatisfied with their child\u2019s IEP are entitled to an impartial due process hearing and to further appeal to a state educational agency. Either the parents or the school district may appeal the decision of the state agency to a state court or a federal district court. Sections 1415(b)(2), (c) and (e)(2), Title 20, U.S.Code.

Appellee further claims that under federal law, written parental consent is only required for implementation of an initial IEP. Moreover, because appellants did not challenge the April 10, 2002 addendum until August 2002, appellee argues that appellants\u2019 dilatory conduct caused the current dispute about the \u201cstay put\u201d issue. Appellants dispute appellee\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 65} According to appellants, on April 17, 2002, in a letter dated April 13, 2002, which was sent by certified mail on April 15, 2002, appellants received notice that the April 10, 2002 addendum to their son\u2019s IEP would be implemented effective April 15, 2002. Based upon our review of the record, we find evidentiary support for appellants\u2019 claim that they did not receive notice until April 17, 2002, that the I\u00c9P addendum of April 10, 2002, would become effective April 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 66} However, despite evidentiary support for appellants\u2019 claim that they did not receive timely notice, the common pleas court made no determination concerning whether the notice comports with requirements under the IDEA or, if the notice does not comport with requirements under the IDEA, whether this deviation resulted in substantive harm. See <em>McLaughlin v. Holt Pub. Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(C.A.6, 2003), 320 F.3d 663, 668-669 (stating that in actions filed pursuant to the IDEA a court must determine (1) whether the state has complied with procedural requirements of the Act and (2) whether the IEP developed through the Act\u2019s procedures is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits); <em>Bd. of Edn. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 176, 206-207, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690; see, also, <em>Enable, </em>supra, 238 F.3d at 764 (stating that only if a court finds that a procedural violation has resulted in substantive harm, thereby constituting a denial of a free appropriate education, may relief be granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 67} Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, we find that the common pleas court erred, as a matter of law, when it concluded that the decision of the IHO to allow implementation of the April 10, 2002 addendum was correct and should be considered part of the Stancourts\u2019 son\u2019s IEP. Therefore, as a matter of law, we sustain appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">{\u00b6 68} Having sustained appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error, we also find that this matter should be remanded to the common pleas court so that it can make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the requisite finding whether the change reflected in the addendum of April 10, 2002, implicated a detrimental change in the elements of the Stancourts\u2019 son\u2019s IEP, or whether the change reflected in the addendum of April 10, 2002, fundamentally changed or eliminated a basic element of the Stancourts\u2019 son\u2019s IEP, thereby implicating the \u201cstay put\u201d provision of Section 1415(j), Title 20, U.S.Code. Furthermore, because the evidence suggests that the Stancourts received notice of the implementation of the April 10, 2002 addendum two days after this addendum was implemented, upon remand, as part of its inquiry, the common pleas court should also consider whether the school district complied with procedural requirements under the IDEA and, if not, whether such a deviation resulted in substantive harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">{\u00b6 69} In its cross-appeal, appellee asserts that because appellants repeatedly failed to comply with the IHO\u2019s orders, the common pleas court erred in finding that the SLRO lacked authority to dismiss appellants\u2019 due-process-hearing request.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 70} Generally speaking, \u201c[a] hearing officer has broad discretion in accepting and rejecting evidence and in conducting the hearing in general.\u201d <em>Crisp v.

Here, however, neither an evidentiary determination nor a ruling about a procedural matter in a hearing is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 71} In <em>Dressler Coal Co. v. Div. of Reclamation, Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 131, 23 OBR 287, 491 N.E.2d 1133, the appellant, Dressier Coal Company, argued that a board\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of a second appeal, without a hearing, was an unconstitutional deprivation of due process. Id. at 136, 23 OBR 287, 491 N.E.2d 1133. Finding that the doctrine of res judicata dispensed with the requirement of a de novo hearing, the Supreme Court of Ohio did not rule upon appellant\u2019s due-process argument. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 72} In <em>Fields v. Summit Cty. Executive Branch </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 68, 613 N.E.2d 1093, a custodial worker was terminated from his job without a hearing. The custodial worker appealed to the State Personnel Board of Review. The board adopted an administrative-law judge\u2019s report, wherein the administrative-law judge concluded that the board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, and the board dismissed the appeal. The matter was appealed to a common pleas court, which affirmed the decision of the board. The Ninth District Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>{\u00b6 73} Thus, <em>Dressier </em>and <em>Fields </em>support the proposition that dismissals of an administrative action without a hearing based upon res judicata and lack of jurisdiction are permissible under Ohio law. In the present case, however, the dismissals by the IHO and SLRO were not premised upon res judicata or lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">{\u00b6 74} Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-08(F), effective July 1, 2002, outlines the responsibilities of a hearing officer and Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-08(H)(3), effective July 1, 2002, outlines the duties of an SLRO. Cf. former Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-02(0(10) and 3301-51-02(G)(13)(c), effective February 28,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 75} Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-08(F)(3)(d) provides that an impartial hearing officer has the responsibility of \u201c[r]uling on procedural issues presented at the hearing.\u201d Paragraph (3)(e) of Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-08(F) provides that an impartial hearing officer also has the responsibility of \u201c[arriving at a written decision based solely on the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing and mailing such decision, by certified mail, to the parties involved and the office for exceptional children.\u201d Under Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-08(H)(3), an SLRO shall examine the entire hearing record, ensure that the procedures at the hearing were consistent with the requirements of law, and, if necessary, seek additional evidence following the procedures outlined in Ohio AdmuCode 3301-51-08(F)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 76} Neither Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-08(F) nor Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-08(H) expressly authorizes a hearing officer to dismiss an action. Cf. R.C. 119.09 (providing that a referee or examiner appointed by a state agency \u201cshall have the same powers and authority in conducting the hearing as is granted to the agency\u201d). See, also, <em>Vought Industries, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 261, 265, 648 N.E.2d 1364, quoting <em>State ex rel. Foster v.

See Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-08(F) (requiring that a hearing officer in an impartial due-process hearing inform the parties of the date, time, and location of the hearing; of a right to present evidence and cross examine; and of a right to compel the attendance of witnesses); see, also, <em>State ex rel. Fern v. Cincinnati, </em>161 Ohio App.3d 804, 2005-Ohio-3168, 832 N.E.2d 106, at \u00b6 51 (\u201cThe earmarks of a quasi-judicial proceeding include requirements of notice, a hearing, and an opportunity to introduce evidence\u201d [footnote omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>{\u00b6 78} As the First District Court of Appeals held in <em>State ex rel. Methodist Book Concern v. Guckenberger </em>(1937), 57 Ohio App. 13, 16-17, 9 O.O. 30, 11 N.E.2d 277, affirmed, 133 Ohio St. 27, 9 O.O. 432, 10 N.E.2d 1001:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">Judicial power consists in interpreting and applying the law by a duly authorized court to the facts involved in a contention between parties respecting their rights. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">So it is only when there is conferred upon administrative officers the power to hear and determine controversies between the public and individuals which require a hearing resembling a judicial trial that it can be said that quasi judicial power has been conferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">{\u00b6 79} Because a due-process hearing is quasi-judicial in nature and consists of a hearing resembling a judicial trial, we conclude that a hearing officer in such a proceeding is vested with implied powers similar to those of a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 80} The United States Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">It has long been understood that \u201c[cjertain implied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution,\u201d powers \u201cwhich cannot be dispensed within a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others.\u201d <em>United States v.

These powers are \u201cgoverned not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\u201d <em>Link v. Wabash R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 630-631, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1388-1389, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\"><em>Chambers v.

Thus, we conclude that the common pleas court erred, as a matter of law, when it concluded that a hearing officer lacked authority to dismiss appellants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">{\u00b6 82} Under Ohio law, a court possesses discretionary power to dismiss actions as a sanction for disregarding orders or failing to prosecute.

It affects not only the suit dismissed but, because it acts as a decision on the merits, also controls questions of fact in other related cases.\u201d <em>Schreiner v. Karson </em>(1977), 52 Ohio App.2d 219, 222-223, 6 O.O.3d 237, 369 N.E.2d 800. Cf. <em>Christian v. McFarland </em>(June 20, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 15984, 1997 WL 337654 (concluding that a trial court\u2019s dismissal of an action without prejudice is not a final, appealable order).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 84} A consideration militating against dismissal with prejudice is the tenet that disposition of a case on its merits is favored in the law. <em>Jones, 78 </em>Ohio St.3d at 371, 678 N.E.2d 530; see, also, <em>Dornbirer v. Paul </em>(Aug. 19, 1997), Franklin App. No. 96APE11-1560, 1997 WL 476704 (\u201cThis court recognizes that disposition of cases on their merits is favored and a dismissal with prejudice is a very harsh sanction\u201d); <em>Jones </em>at 372, 678 N.E.2d 530 (\u201calthough reviewing courts espouse an ordinary \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 standard of review for dismissals with prejudice, that standard is actually heightened when reviewing decisions that forever deny a plaintiff a review of a claim\u2019s merits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 85} In <em>Schreiner, </em>the court explained that \u201c[t]he law favors deciding cases on their merits unless the conduct of a party is so negligent, irresponsible, contumacious or dilatory as to provide substantial grounds for a- dismissal with prejudice for a failure to prosecute or obey a court order.\u201d Id., 52 Ohio App.2d at 223, 6 O.O.3d 237, 369 N.E.2d 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 86} Because the law favors deciding cases on their merits, <em>Jones, 78 </em>Ohio St.3d at 371, 678 N.E.2d 530, and lesser sanctions than dismissal with prejudice should be applied when possible, <em>Schreiner </em>at 223, 6 O.O.3d 237, 369 N.E.2d 800, we believe a hearing officer in a quasi-judicial proceeding under R.C. 3323.05 and Ohio Adm.Code 3301-51-08 should employ the sanction of dismissal with prejudice only with great circumspection and when the conduct of a party is so negligent, irresponsible, contumacious, or dilatory as to provide substantial grounds for a dismissal with prejudice. See, also, <em>Jones, 78 </em>Ohio St.3d at 372, 678 N.E.2d 530 (providing proper factors for consideration in a Civ.R. 41(B)(1) dismissal with prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 87} Here, the common pleas court found that \u201cthe decision to dismiss, especially with prejudice, for failure to provide discovery of the child\u2019s medical and psychological records, is unduly draconian. This is even more true in light of the nature of the administrative proceedings, which should be directed to whether a child is receiving the appropriate instructional components and settings.\u201d Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that the common pleas court\u2019s finding constitutes an abuse of discretion. Neither can we conclude that the common pleas court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous. Furthermore, we cannot conclude that the common pleas court\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>about the hearing officers\u2019 decisions to dismiss is inconsistent with the statutory-purpose of the IDEA and R.C.
