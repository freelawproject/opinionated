Hurte appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment in this contested divorce action. Initially, she complains about the trial court\u2019s treatment of various retirement benefits. She contends that the court should have considered Social Security benefits when it divided their marital property. She also contends that the court compounded this error by completely exempting Anthony Hurte\u2019s Social Security from the marital estate without giving her an \u201coffset\u201d for that portion of her pension that acts as a Social Security replacement. Retirement benefits and pensions, including Social Security, that are acquired during the marriage must be considered when making an equitable division of the marital estate. This is true even though a Social Security benefit is not divisible per se. Thus, the court erred in failing to consider Social Security benefits. However, there is no requirement to give appellant a \u201csocial security offset\u201d when valuing her School Employees Retirement System (\u201cSERS\u201d) pension because Anthony\u2019s Social Security will be considered when the court divides the marital assets on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">{\u00b6 2} Alice also argues that the trial court erred by failing to award her a share of the equity in Anthony\u2019s automobile. Anthony testified,. <em>\u201cWe </em>asked him if he would give <em>us </em>the money to \u2014 for a down payment, to lessen the car payment, so <em>we </em>could pay for it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the money was a gift of separate property to Anthony, it should have awarded Alice some equity in the vehicle, rather than concluding it was Anthony\u2019s separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">{\u00b6 3} Next, Alice asserts that the trial court erred by deviating from the child-support guidelines without entering appropriate statutory findings. Because the entry granting the deviation does not contain a finding that the worksheet-calculated amount would be unjust or inappropriate and not in the child\u2019s best interests, we agree with Alice\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">{\u00b6 4} Next, Alice complains that the trial court erred by awarding Anthony the federal and state tax exemption for the parties\u2019 minor child. The trial court found that awarding Anthony the dependency exemption would produce a net tax savings to him, i.e., be \u201cof greater economic benefit.\u201d The only evidence that relates to this conclusion is the parties\u2019 disparate incomes. However, gross income is only one of several factors that the Supreme Court has indicated must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>be analyzed. In the absence of such evidence, the presumption that the custodial parent gets the exemption controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 5} Finally, Alice contends that the trial court erred by failing to award her spousal support. Because we have reversed on several issues that have a bearing on spousal support, the court should also revisit this question on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 6} After a 20-year marriage, the parties sought and received a divorce. The court ordered appellee to pay $145.64 as monthly child support, based upon the \u201c50/50 shared parenting plan and the child support calculation worksheet attached to [appellee]\u2019s proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\u201d In its property division, the trial court found that awarding appellee the federal and state tax exemption for their dependent child \u201cis of greater economic benefit.\u201d The court did not order any spousal support, \u201cgiven the amount of indebtedness [the parties] are going to be assuming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 7} The parties\u2019 marital property included several pension plans. The court valued Alice\u2019s SERS plan at $28,010.18, and Anthony\u2019s private pension at $22,858.73. The court ordered Alice to make an equalization payment of $2,575.72 upon these valuations. Although the parties presented evidence concerning potential Social Security benefits, the court did not address the issue when dividing the marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 8} The court awarded both parties their respective vehicles. But the court determined that no equity remained in Anthony\u2019s 2003 Honda Accord, which it valued at $18,900. The court\u2019s conclusion was based upon a $14,307.21 lien, and the down payment of $4,500, which it decided was a gift of separate property to Anthony from his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment and raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">\n<em>First Assignment of Error:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">The court below erred in valuing appellant\u2019s School Employees Retirement System with no consideration or offset for that plan\u2019s feature which provides a social security benefit replacement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">\n<em>Second Assignment of Error:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">The trial court erred in not considering the parties\u2019 future social security benefits in relation to all marital assets when it ordered a division of the marital property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-14\">\n<em>Third Assignment of Error:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-15\">The trial court erred in failing to award appellant her share of the equity value of the parties\u2019 2003 Honda Accord.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-16\">\n<em>Fourth Assignment of Error:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The trial court committed reversible error when it deviated from the child support calculated pursuant to statute without finding such amount unjust or inappropriate to the child or either parent and not in the best interests of child because of the extraordinary circumstances of the parent of because of [sic] factors or criteria set forth in Revised Code Section 3119.23.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">\n<em>Fifth Assignment of Error:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">The trial court erred in awarding appellee-husband the Federal and State tax exemption for the parties\u2019 minor child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>Sixth Assignment of Error:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">The trial court erred in failing to award spousal support to appellant-wife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">{\u00b6 10} Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error both address the trial court\u2019s decision regarding the parties\u2019 retirement benefits. Therefore, we consider them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">{\u00b6 11} In her first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by valuing her SERS pension without considering a hypothetical Social Security offset. She asserts: \u201cThe court below employed nothing to correct the injustice to Appellant and its conclusion that the marital value of Appellant\u2019s benefit from the School Employees Retirement Fund subject to distribution is $28,010.18 is against the manifest weight of the law and constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d In her second assignment of error, appellant argues that the court erred by ignoring the parties\u2019 Social Security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">{\u00b6 12} Taken together, we read appellant\u2019s two assignments of error to assert that the trial court erred by determining her entire SERS account, without an offset for Social Security replacement, is a marital asset when the court completely exempted appellee\u2019s interest in Social Security from the marital estate. In other words, she contends that because the court did not consider Anthony\u2019s Social Security benefits to be divisible, that portion of her SERS pension that acts as a replacement for Social Security should have been treated likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cSince a trial court has broad discretion in the allocation of marital assets, its judgment will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Neville v. Neville, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 275, 2003-Ohio-3624, 791 N.E.2d 434 at \u00b6 5. An abuse of discretion is more than an error in judgment or law; it implies an attitude on the part of the trial court that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. When applying this standard of review, we may not freely substitute our judgment for that of the trial court. <em>In re Jane Doe I </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 135, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>137-138, 566 N.E.2d 1181; <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 169, 559 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">{\u00b6 14} Retirement benefits and pensions earned during the course of the marriage are marital assets to be considered in dividing marital property. See R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a)(ii). While federal law prohibits a domestic-relations court from dividing Social Security benefits, state courts may consider the effect of such a benefit when fashioning a property division. <em>Neville, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 275, 2003-Ohio-3624, 791 N.E.2d 434, syllabus (\u201c[i]n making an equitable distribution of marital property in a divorce proceeding, a trial court may consider the parties\u2019 future Social Security benefits in relation to all marital assets\u201d); <em>Holcomb v. Holcomb </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 128, 132, 541 N.E.2d 597. \u201c[V]irtually every appellate court has determined that although a party\u2019s interest in future Social Security benefits cannot be directly divided as a marital asset, that interest must be evaluated and considered by the court in effecting an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 marital assets. More specifically, the interest in Social Security benefits must be evaluated and considered by the court in order to effect an equitable division of the parties\u2019 pension and retirement funds.\u201d <em>Neel v. Neel </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 24, 29-30, 680 N.E.2d 207 (citations omitted); see, also, <em>Hoyt v. Hoyt </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 177, 180, 559 N.E.2d 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 15} Before <em>Neville, </em>when courts did not consider Social Security benefits belonging to one spouse but did consider the other party\u2019s state employee' pension, they recognized the resulting inequity and devised the \u201chypothetical social security offset.\u201d See, generally, <em>Walker v. Walker </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 90, 677 N.E.2d 1252 (\u201cPublic employees who do not participate in the Social Security system may be penalized because the portions of their pension equivalent to Social Security contributions are marital property subject to division, while their spouse\u2019s contributions to Social Security cannot be considered marital property under federal statute\u201d). This was discussed in <em>Cornbleth v. Cornbleth </em>(1990), 397 Pa.Super. 421, 427, 580 A.2d 369, quoted in <em>Neel, </em>113 Ohio App.3d at 30, 680 N.E.2d 207:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">To facilitate a process of equating [public pension participants] and Social Security participants we believe it will be necessary to compute the present value of a Social Security benefit had the [public plan] participant been participating in the Social Security system. This present value should then be deducted from the present value of the [public pension] at which time a figure for the marital portion of the pension could be derived and included in the marital estate for distribution purposes. This process should result in equating, as near as possible, the two classes of individuals for equitable distribution purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>See, also, <em>Rinehart v. Rinehart </em>(Dec. 1, 1999), Athens App. No. 98CA24, 1999 WL 1240851.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">{\u00b6 16} Here, the trial court erred by choosing to totally ignore the Social Security benefits. Based upon <em>Neville, </em>we have previously held that the court must consider these benefits when evaluating the marital estate and must enter specific findings. See <em>Risner v. Risner </em>(Dec. 28, 1995), Jackson App. No. 94CA757, 1995 WL 767360. When all of the parties\u2019 retirement assets are thrown into the marital pool, no inequity results to the party with the public pension plan. The concern expressed in the <em>pre-Neville </em>cases no longer is an issue when the court considers both parties\u2019 pension plans and Social Security benefits in reaching an equitable distribution of marital assets. Therefore, a \u201csocial security offset\u201d is no longer necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 17} In this case, the trial court must consider all of the parties\u2019 retirement benefits before it can equitably divide the marital estate. Because it did not do so, or at least the record does not indicate that the court considered the Social Security benefits, we sustain Alice\u2019s first and second assignments of error. On remand, the court must consider the Social Security benefits and enter appropriate factual findings in making its division of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 18} In her third assignment of error, Alice argues that the trial court erred by failing to award her a share of the equity in the parties\u2019 2003 Honda Accord. She contends that the court\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]here is no equity in the Honda due to the gift Husband received of $4,500 from his father\u201d is against the manifest weight of the evidence and an abuse of discretion. She asserts that the gift was made during their marriage, and there is no evidence that the money was intended to be a separate gift to Anthony.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 19} Trial courts are required to divide marital and separate property equitably between the spouses. R.C. 3105.171(B). This requires, in most cases, that marital property be divided equally. R.C. 3105.171(C)(1). However, if an equal division would produce an inequitable result, the trial court is only required to divide the property equitably. Id. Separate property is to be distributed to the spouse who brought that property into the marriage, except as further indicated in the statute. See R.C. 3105.171(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 20} Because the trial court possesses a great deal of discretion in attaining an equitable distribution, we will not reverse that decision absent an abuse of discretion. See <em>Holcomb v. Holcomb </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 128, 131, 541 N.E.2d 597. Having previously defined this standard of review, we do not repeat it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>{\u00b6 21} Marital property includes all real and personal property acquired during the marriage by either spouse. R.C. 3105.171(A)(3)(a)(i). Property acquired during the marriage is presumed to be marital in nature unless it is shown to be separate. <em>Measor v. Measor, </em>160 Ohio App.3d 60, 2005-Ohio-1417, 825 N.E.2d 1169, at \u00b6 10. Separate property generally includes any property acquired by one spouse prior to the date of the marriage. R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(ii). The party seeking to establish an asset or a portion of it as their own separate property has the burden of proof, ordinarily by a preponderance of the evidence, to trace the asset to the separate property source. See <em>Eddy v. Eddy, </em>Washington App. No. 01CA20, 2002-Ohio-4345, 2002 WL 1943569; <em>Knight v. Knight </em>(June 11, 2001), Washington App. No. 00CA38, 2001 WL 688537. However, when the separate property is claimed to be a gift, then the burden of proof is clear and convincing. See R.C. 3105.171(A)(6)(a)(vii). We will uphold a trial court\u2019s decision concerning whether property is such a gift, like any other factual determination, as long as some competent and credible evidence supports it. <em>Jacobs v. Jacobs, </em>Scioto App. No. 02CA2846, 2003-Ohio-3466, 2003 WL 21500026, at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, the evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that Anthony\u2019s father made a gift of $4,500 solely to his son. First, Anthony clearly testified that he planned to pay the money back to his father. Thus, the money is a loan rather than a gift. Furthermore, Anthony did not meet his burden of showing that his father gave him the loan as separate property. He believes that his father made the check out to him, but he later stated that he was not sure whether his father wrote a check or transferred money from his account to his son\u2019s account. After the hearing, Anthony submitted a document purporting to show a transfer from his father\u2019s account to his account. Anthony offered no evidence that the account housed his separate property. More importantly, Anthony also testified: <em>\u201cWe </em>asked him if he would give <em>us </em>the money to \u2014 for a down payment, to lessen the car payment, so <em>we </em>could pay for it.\u201d (Emphasis added). Anthony\u2019s comments show that the parties treated the father\u2019s money as a joint loan, i.e., not separate property. Because the $4,500 was not Anthony\u2019s separate property, the trial court erred by concluding that any equity remaining in the Honda constituted Anthony\u2019s separate property. Consequently, we sustain Alice\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 23} In her fourth assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by deviating from the child-support guidelines without entering appropriate factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>{\u00b6 24} A trial court possesses discretion when determining whether to deviate from the worksheet-calculated amount. See <em>Pauly v. Pauly </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 386, 390, 686 N.E.2d 1108; <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d 1028; <em>Jones v. Jones </em>(Dec. 17, 1999), Highland App. No. 99CA9, 1999 WL 1254809. Thus, we will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a deviation absent an abuse of discretion. See, generally, <em>Rock v. Cabral </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 108, 112, 616 N.E.2d 218; <em>Peters v. Peters, </em>Lorain App. Nos. 03CA008306 &amp; 03CA008307, 2004-Ohio-2517, 2004 WL 1104003; <em>Rex v. Rex, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82864, 2004-Ohio-997, 2004 WL 396369.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 25} When calculating child support, a court must use the worksheet set forth in R.C. 3119.022 combined with the basic schedule set forth in R.C. 3119.021. The initial calculation is rebuttably presumed to be the proper amount of child support. R.C. 3119.03; <em>Marker v. Grimm </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 139, 141, 601 N.E.2d 496. Under shared parenting, R.C. 3119.24(A)(1) allows a court to deviate from the rebuttably presumed amount \u201cif that amount would be unjust or inappropriate to the children or either parent and would not be in the best interest of the child because of the extraordinary circumstances of the parents or because of any other factors or criteria set forth in section 3119.23 of the Revised Code.\u201d Extraordinary circumstances of the parent include (1) the amount of time the children spend with each parent; (2) the ability of each parent to maintain adequate housing for the children; (3) each parent\u2019s expenses, including childcare expenses, school tuition, medical expenses, dental expenses, and any other expenses the court considers relevant; (4) any other circumstances that the court considers relevant. R.C. 3119.24(B)(1) through (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 26} If the court deviates, it must enter three items in the journal: (1) the worksheet-calculated child support amount; (2) its determination that the presumed amount would be unjust or inappropriate and would not be in the best interests of the child; and (3) findings of fact supporting that determination. R.C. 3119.24(A)(2); see, also, <em>DePalmo v. DePalmo </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 535, 538, 679 N.E.2d 266; <em>Marker, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 143, 601 N.E.2d 496. These requirements are mandatory, and the trial court must follow them literally and technically in all material respects. See <em>Marker, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 141-142, 601 N.E.2d 496; see, e.g., <em>Johnson v. Johnson, </em>Ross App. No. 04CA2770, 2004-Ohio-5749, 2004 WL 2426252; <em>Lute v. McCastle, </em>Scioto App. No. 02CA2834, 2003-Ohio-3753, 2003 WL 21652171.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cWe have previously noted that \u2018under a shared parenting plan, a trial court does not abuse its discretion by deviating from the guidelines when it calculates child support by equitably giving parents credit for the time they have physical custody of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mahlerwein v. Mahlerwein, </em>160 Ohio App.3d 564, 2005-Ohio-1835, 828 N.E.2d 153, at \u00b6 43, quoting <em>Copas v.

Here, the trial court apparently deviated from the worksheet-calculated amount based upon the shared parenting plan, which allocated equal time. But it did not determine that the worksheet-calculated amount would be unjust or inappropriate or not in the child\u2019s best interests. Nor did it make any findings that support such a conclusion. Because the statute requires strict compliance, we must sustain appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error and remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 28} In her fifth assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by awarding appellee the federal and state tax exemption for the parties\u2019 minor child.

Jewell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 330, 332, 528 N.E.2d 180. \u201cSuch savings would occur through allocation to the non[-residential] parent only if the non[-residential] parent\u2019s taxable income falls into a higher tax bracket than the tax bracket of the custodial parent.\u201d <em>Singer, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 415-16, 588 N.E.2d 806. \u201cIn determining whether taxes would be saved by allocating the federal tax dependency exemption to the noncustodial parent, a court should review all pertinent factors, including the parents\u2019 gross incomes, the exemptions and deductions to which the parents are otherwise entitled, and the relevant federal, state, and local income tax rates.\u201d Id. at 416, 588 N.E.2d 806. In <em>Singer, </em>the Supreme Court pointedly remarked that the trial court \u201cdid not consider any of these facts.\u201d Id. at 416, 588 N.E.2d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">{\u00b6 32} Anthony testified that he would like the tax exemption. However, neither party presented any evidence regarding \u201cthe exemptions and deductions to which the parents are otherwise entitled, and the relevant federal, state, and local income tax rates.\u201d The court had only the parties\u2019 disparate incomes to use in making its decision. Based on <em>Singer, </em>we do not believe that this information was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 33} We are not convinced that the trial court should have sua sponte directed the parties to present evidence concerning the tax exemption. Rather, in a case like this, when the parties fail to present evidence, the presumption controls. See <em>Singer; </em>R.C. 3119.82 (both presuming that the residential parent should receive the dependency exemption and prohibiting the court from awarding the exemption to the nonresidential parent unless the enumerated factors justify it). In the absence of evidence showing that the nonresidential parent would receive a net tax savings from the dependency exemption, the court must employ the presumption that the dependency exemption belongs to the residential parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 34} Consequently, we sustain Alice\u2019s fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 35} In her sixth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to award spousal support. Because we have reversed and remanded on the issues of dividing the marital estate, child support, and tax exemptions, all of which could have an impact on spousal support, see R.C. 3105.18(C)(1), the trial court should also revisit that issue on remand. Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error is sustained to this limited extend.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b497-11\">Ajbele, P.J., and McFarland, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
