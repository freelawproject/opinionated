He had a dog that was kept by S. R. Hazen at Hartford, Vermont. Defendant admitted the killing of the dog on November 7, 1910, on her farm in Norwich, Vermont. It appeared that the dog was numbered, described, and licensed in the office of the clerk of said town of Hartford for one year from April 1, 1910; and that the \u201cdog license\u201d duly issued by that clerk showed the register number to be 41, and certified \u201cthat C. H. Demick, the owner or keeper of a dog in this town and described as follows:\u201d etc., had paid the required fee \u201cand caused said dog to be registered, numbered, and described as above, and the same is hereby licensed for one year from April 1, 1910.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-12\">The collar that plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show was worn by the dog when it was killed was marked \u201cS. R. Hazen, No. 41,\u201d and was received in evidence subject to defendant\u2019s exception and against her objection, \u201cthat inasmuch as the record at the town clerk\u2019s office was: \u2018C. H. Demick as owner or keeper, No. 41,\u2019 it was not in compliance with the law to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>have the dog wear a collar marked S. R. Hazen, No. 41,\u201d insisting that the collar \u201cmust bear the same name as the registry.\u201d And the same question was reserved by an exception to the overruling of defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, based on the objection above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-5\"><em>Davis &amp; Davis </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-6\"><em>Raymond Trainor </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b71-7\">Watson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALP\">By Y. S. 4821, \u201cthe owner or keeper of a dog more than eight weeks old shall, annually, on or before the first day of April, cause it to be registered, numbered, described, and licensed for one year from such first day of April, in the office of the town clerk wherein such dog is kept, and shall cause it to wear a collar, distinctly marked with the owner\u2019s name and its registered number,\u201d etc. Under the provisions of this statute it mattered not whether the dog was caused to be registered and licensed by the owner or by the keeper, it must wear a collar marked with the owner\u2019s name and its registered number. The law of this section was amended by No. 97, Acts of 1900, to read as appears in P. S. 5623. The only change made in the part quoted above was to provide that the licensed dog shall wear a collar marked with the name of \u201cthe owner or keeper, and its registered number.\u201d After the amendment, the same as before, the collar could lawfully be marked with the name of the owner, regardless of whether the dog was registered and licensed in the name of the owner or in that of the keeper. In the provision of the Act of amendment, that the collar shall be marked with the name of the \u201cowner or beeper,\u201d the word \u201cor\u201d is a coordinating particle, giving the alternative to mark the collar with the name of either, according to choice; and each of the coordinated terms is, in force, the equivalent of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The dog billed was registered and licensed in the name of the owner. When killed it was wearing a collar distinctly marked with the name of the keeper, and its registered number, \u2014all in compliance with the statute. It follows that each of the exceptions saved is without force.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
