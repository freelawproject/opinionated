Benoit (hereinafter called the insured) had left on deposit with T*he Prudential Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Company of America (hereinafter called the company), one of the defendants. The other defendant is Rose Benoit, the insured\u2019s widow, who is sued both individually and as administratrix of his estate. The plaintiff is a\" brother of the insured. There being no controversy as to the amount that the company<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was obligated to pay, it paid the money into court and a decree was entered which absolved it from further liability. The trial judge made findings of fact and an order for decree. Thereafter a decree was entered dismissing the bill and ordering the fund paid to the defendant Rose Benoit in her individual capacity. The plaintiff\u2019s appeal brings the case here. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The findings of the trial judge, which were based almost wholly on undisputed documentary evidence, were amply warranted, if not required. The plaintiff does not contend otherwise; rather it is the legal result reached by the judge that is challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The facts are as follows: The insured had been in the employ of the defendant company for many years and had an intimate knowledge of the life insurance business as conducted by it. At some time prior to July 17, 1937, he had become totally disabled and had retired from business. By reason of his disability, the insured, who was the owner of four policies of insurance (issued by the company) on his life, became entitled under the policies to certain sums payable in monthly instalments. Instead of receiving these payments as they became due, the insured elected to leave them with the company. On July 17, 1937, to carry out this purpose, the insured executed and delivered to the company four separate instruments (one for each policy) in which he requested the company to hold each instalment, as it became due, at such interest as the company might declare on such funds, but not less than three and one half per cent per annum. The insured reserved the right to withdraw the total amount so held at any time, but if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>was not so withdrawn the fund was to be payable on due proof of the insured\u2019s death \u201cto the person or persons who at the time of . . . [his] death . . . [should] be named as beneficiary or beneficiaries under said Policy, and in the manner therein provided.\u201d The company retained the instalments, as they became due, in accordance with these requests. At the time these instruments were delivered the defendant Rose Benoit was the beneficiary named under each of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">On November 6, 1941, the company received from the insured the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">Worcester, Mass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">Nov. 4th, 1941</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">Claim Dept.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">Change of Beneficiary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\">Policies 84792-3-4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">\u201c G 1690-C 7492A B</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-12\">Mr. E.

Benoit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-19\">104 Coolidge Rd.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Attached to this letter was the copy of the \u201cplan\u201d referred to therein, the wording of which is set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">On November 14, 1941, the company wrote to the insured as follows: \u201cNo communication other than your letter of November 4,1941 has been received by this Department. However, please feel assured that if such a communication of which you inform us, is received, your interests will be protected and we shall immediately write you.\u201d After receiving this letter nothing further was done by the insured with respect to the policies or their proceeds. The insured died on February 19, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The decree of the court below was right. The plaintiff rightly does not argue that he was named as a beneficiary under the policies. The plaintiff\u2019s position is that the funds which the company paid into court were not \u201cinsurance funds,\u201d but were money left with the company similar to a bank deposit which the insured could order paid to anyone he saw fit, and that by an order given to the company he made a valid gift of it to the plaintiff to the extent of $50 a month during his life or until the fund was exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">A complete answer to this contention is that no such order was ever given to the company or to anyone else. The letter and enclosure of November 4, 1941, were not such. The insured merely called the company\u2019s attention to the fact that in May or June he had written out a plan of his intention to change the beneficiary but that it had \u201cbeen lost or misslaid or taken by some dne from . . . [his] desk.\u201d He then went on to say that he was enclosing a copy of the plan as he remembered it and requested the company to let him know whether it had been received; that he desired the company\u2019s \u201cassurance of protection against such, as it may be possible the party who has same may make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>change in original letter.\u201d This fell far short of anything that could be deemed a gift of the fund or an order to pay it to the plaintiff. No other document purporting to be such an order was ever executed and delivered by the insured. We do not intimate that, if the insured had ever sent to the company a document similar to that enclosed in the letter of November 4, it would have constituted a valid gift of part of the fund to the plaintiff. See Williston on Contracts (Rev. ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 438B, 440; Am. Law Inst. Restatement: Contracts, \u00a7 158; <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Burrows, </em>240 Mass. 485, 488; <em>Millett </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>280 Mass. 543, 549, 550; <em>Reardon </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>306 Mass. 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Since the plaintiff never acquired any interest in the fund, the defendant Rose Benoit, who was the beneficiary under the policies at the death of the insured, was entitled to it in accordance with the terms of the contracts with the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\"> The company filed what is called an \u201canswer in the nature of inter-pleader\u201d as a result of which the Roman Catholic Bishop of Springfield, a corporation sole, was summoned in as a party defendant. The decree in the court below was not in its favor and it did not appeal. See <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>313 Mass. 232, 234.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\"> \u201cIn re Change of Beneficiary Copy Pay to my wife in event of a claim one hundred fifty dollars per month during her life time, fifty dollars per month to Frank Benoit during his life time at his demise all unpaid installments are to become the property'at our Company with one exception.
