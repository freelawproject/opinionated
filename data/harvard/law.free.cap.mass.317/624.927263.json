The only question worthy of serious consideration is whether there was any evidence for the jury of the defendant\u2019s negligence. After a verdict for the plaintiff, the judge entered a verdict for the defendant on leave reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">The substance of the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff was this: The plaintiff' entered the well lighted store shortly after one o\u2019clock in the afternoon. It was raining very hard and had been raining all day. When the plaintiff got half way through the store, her feet slipped out from under her. When she was able to stand again, she saw a spot with \u201can oily surface\u201d wet with \u201coil\u201d and rain. There were marks in it where her heels had skidded from under her. She did not see the spot until after the accident. The floor was \u201cthick with oil and water,\u201d particularly where she fell. The water had brought the \u201coil\u201d to the surface. \u201cIt was a thick, greenish material, or color. \u201d It was \u201cgreenish black.\u201d \u201cThe spot or patch was about two feet big.\u201d There were water and \u201coil\u201d there. The entire floor had been \u201coiled.\u201d \u201cIt was a dark, oiled floor.\u201d A witness who had been in the store in the week before the accident could see that the entire floor had been \u201coiled.\u201d The witness had observed that there was \u201coil\u201d on the floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>in September. There was \u201coil\u201d on a white glove which she had dropped there. On the day of the accident there were patches of water where people\u2019s umbrellas had-dripped. Water was seen to drop from umbrellas and rubbers. That the floor was \u201coiled\u201d was obvious to anyone looking at it. There was no sawdust \u201cor other covering on the floor,\u201d and there were no warning signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\">The defendant\u2019s \u201cmeat manager\u201d testified that the floor had not been oiled for ten years, \u201cwith the.exception of a compound that was used\u201d; that \u201cactual oil\u201d had not been put on it for at least ten years; and that there was no oil on the \u2022 floor on the day of the accident. When asked whether it was not a fact that there was oil along the edge of the floor \u201cat the present time\u201d he answered that he could not say. He testified that when it rained they put sawdust on the floor; and that on any rainy day people come in with dripping clothes and umbrellas.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">From this evidence the jury could find that at least for over a month the entire floor had been treated with some substance which the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses persisted in describing as oil, and that this had been done by the defendant or with its full knowledge. They could find that this substance, whether or not it was \u201cactual oil,\u201d had been applied recently enough and, at least at the spot where the plaintiff fell, in such quantity, that water brought it to the surface as a \u201cthick, greenish material.\u201d They could find that a substance which could produce that effect was likely to make the floor slippery at particular places where water accumulated upon it. They could reasonably infer that the defendant was familiar with the properties of this substance; that the defendant knew that on rainy -days water would be brought in by customers and might make the floor especially slippery in patches where it accumulated; and that on such days the defendant habitually recognized this condition and guarded against it by applications of sawdust, but that it did not do so at the time and place of the accident. The jury could further find that the effect of water upon such a substance would not be fully apparent to a customer from such examination of the floor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>as he would be likely to make while intent upon the business that brought him to the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-3\">We think that this case differs on the one hand from cases where the condition complained of is nothing more than the smoothness of a floor which is finished in some well known manner with varnish or wax properly applied, as in <em>Kitchen </em>v. <em>Women\u2019s City Club of Boston, </em>267 Mass. 229, <em>Crone </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co. </em>269 Mass. 289, <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Empire Clothing Co. </em>293 Mass. 447<em>, McGuire </em>v. <em>Valley Arena Inc. </em>299 Mass. 351, and <em>Kay </em>v. <em>Audet, </em>306 Mass. 337 (but compare <em>Ventromile </em>v. <em>Malden Electric Co., ante, </em>132, 135-136, where there was evidence that wax had been improperly applied), and on the other hand from cases where the condition complained of consisted of nothing more than wet spots with which everyone is familiar and which ordinary care could not have prevented in places of public resort on rainy days, as in <em>Tariff </em>v. <em>S. S. Kresge Co. </em>299 Mass. 129, and <em>Moors </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>305 Mass. 81. The case seems to us to fall within the authority of <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. </em>266 Mass. 12, where \u201ca considerable surface\u201d of the floor had \u201cbecome saturated with oil through the application of a thick floor oil during many months of the year\u201d and moisture had been brought in by customers on a rainy day, and where this court said, at page 13, \u201cThe judge could not decide, as matter of law, that the condition was momentary, or inevitable, or so small in extent as easily to escape notice, or that a reasonably prudent man, knowing the condition of the wood and the usual result of inclement weather in causing moisture to be brought into the store, would not be negligent in failing to guard customers from slipping.\u201d In <em>Trottier </em>v. <em>Neisner Brothers, Inc. </em>284 Mass. 336, the plaintiff was allowed to recover for an injury received from a fall on a floor which was slippery from oil in certain places, but not obviously so, and in <em>Correira </em>v. <em>Atlantic Amusement Co. Inc. </em>302 Mass. 81, the plaintiff recovered for an injury received from falling upon a floor of hard rubber tiling which was slippery because water had been allowed to collect upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>The defendant relies strongly upon the recent decision of <em>Wetmore </em>v. <em>McLellan Stores Co. </em>315 Mass. 443. But the ground of that decision was that \"what . . . [the plaintiff] described as oil at the point where she fell\u201d was \"not a description of anything disclosed by the testimony to have been put on to the floor by the defendant\u201d (page 445), and there was no evidence as to how long the condition had existed. Moreover, in that case there was no evidence that any accumulation of water had combined with whatever was on the floor to produce a condition of slipperiness at the particular spot where the plaintiff fell comparable to that which could have been found in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The governing principles are clear, even if their application to particular cases may involve delicate distinctions. We think that this was a jury case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are sustained. The verdict for the defendant- entered by the judge on leave reserved is set aside, and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff on the verdict returned by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
