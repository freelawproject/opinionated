The judge\u2019s decision imports a finding of every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>fact supported by evidence and essential to his conclusion, and such findings, where based on oral testimony, are not to be set aside unless plainly wrong. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Kyes, </em>304 Mass. 56, 57-58. <em>Buckingham </em>v. <em>Alden, </em>315 Mass. 383, 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The petitioner obtained a divorce from the respondent by a decree of the Probate Court, dated December 9, 1938, whereby custody of the children was awarded to the petitioner. By decree of November 20, 1939, the earlier decree was modified by awarding custody to the respondent. The latter proceeding was apparently uncontested. At the time of the hearing in the present case Marcia and Deborah were respectively eight and seven years of age, and since October, 1943, had resided in Springfield with the respondent and his wife, Marion Smith Short, whom he married September 18, 1943. The children had resided in Springfield since June, 1938, for the first year and a half with the respondent\u2019s parents, and thereafter until October, 1943, with the respondent and his parents.. The petitioner and the respondent, when husband and wife, resided principally in Weymouth and Quincy. They ceased living under the same roof in June, 1938, when the petitioner wrote the respondent\u2019s mother in Springfield: \u201cPhilip and I have decided, after a month\u2019s trial, that it is impossible for us to make a go of our marriage so we have agreed to separate. We both understand that you will be more than willing to take Marcia and Deborah. If you will let me know when you can come for them I will have them ready for you.\u201d Since that time the' petitioner has continued to reside in Weymouth, and has seen the children not more than twice a year.and always at Springfield, to which it was for several years a financial burden for her to go. The children did not discover that she was their mother until April, 1943. In September, 1939, she married her present husband and has the custody of a daughter, eleven years of age at the time of the hearing, by a marriage previous to that with the respondent. The petitioner and her husband are financially able to support the children, and there is nothing to indicate that the home would be other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>it should be. On the other hand, the judge could find that the children had a good home with the respondent and his wife, and that they were well taken care of. The judge could also find from the testimony, including that of the children, that they preferred to continue to live with the respondent and with his wife, whom they often referred to as \u201cMother.\u201d See <em>Dumain </em>v. <em>Gwynne, </em>10 Allen, 270, 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The petitioner relies in some measure on the conduct of the respondent\u2019s mother, who was described in the petitioner\u2019s testimony as \u201cvery domineering.\u201d The petitioner charges her with dictating the conditions under which the petitioner might see the children, with preventing the petitioner from seeing them alone, and with telling them that their mother was dead. The petitioner testified that the respondent apparently \u201ccondoned\u201d his mother\u2019s conduct. It is argued that the respondent left the children to the care of his mother, and thus subjected the children to \u201cinfluences hostile to their mother by a person of very violent prejudices.\u201d The respondent\u2019s mother at the time of the hearing was not in favor with the respondent\u2019s wife, and apparently no longer visited at her house. The respondent\u2019s mother could have been found to have ceased to be a factor in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In the summer of 1943 the respondent sent his daughters to spend eight weeks at a children\u2019s camp in Vermont, the junior department of which was in the charge of the respondent\u2019s wife whom he was then planning to marry. She did not inform the petitioner that the children were going to Vermont. The petitioner argues from this that the respondent did not notify the Probate Court or the petitioner. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 208, \u00a7 30. Assuming this to be true, a decree for the petitioner is not thereby required as matter of law. See <em>Hersey </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>271 Mass. 545, 549, 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">At the time of the hearing the respondent had a draft status of 1-A. The respondent\u2019s wife had stated that if he should be drafted, she might take the children to Virginia or Vermont, but testified that she had said this without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>knowing that the children could not be taken out of the Commonwealth, that there was no possibility of their going to either State, and that her present plan would be to remain in the same house in Springfield. The judge could accept this testimony of the respondent\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The wisdom of changing the order for custody was one peculiarly within the province of the judge, who observed the witnesses, among whom were both parents. See <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>151 Mass. 349, 350. He was not plainly wrong in failing to find the respondent \"unfit\u201d (see G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 201, \u00a7 5) or in not finding that there had been \"misconduct\u201d on his'part (see G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 208, \u00a7 31). <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>304 Mass. 248, 250. <em>Cassen </em>v. <em>Cassen, </em>315 Mass. 35, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The petitioner contends that the decree gives priority over the mother to the stepmother. The paramount issue in the present case is the welfare of the children. In our opinion the evidence does not support the contention of the petitioner that the conduct of the respondent has been such that their welfare requires that he not be allowed to retain their custody. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 31. See <em>Purinton </em>v. <em>Jamrock, </em>195 Mass. 187, 200; <em>Hersey </em>v. <em>Hersey, </em>271 Mass. 545, 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The oral statements of the judge made at the conclusion of the hearing were not findings of fact, and the\" petitioner\u2019s argument based thereon cannot be considered. <em>Rappel </em>v. <em>Italian Catholic Cemetery Association, </em>259 Mass. 550, 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The respondent was asked on cross-examination, \u201cThere was a time when you changed the, locks on the doors, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d He answered, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d and was then asked, \"When was that?\u201d The judge inquired of the petitioner\u2019s counsel if he were trying to show that this was done to keep the petitioner out, and counsel answered in the negative, saying that he was attempting to show bad feeling between the respondent\u2019s wife and his mother after his remarriage. The \u00bfquestion was excluded subject to the exception of the petitioner, who voluntarily made an offer of proof, which was unnecessary <em>(McGeorge </em>v. <em>Grand Realty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>Trust, Inc. </em>316 Mass. 373, 377) and irresponsive, to the effect that \u201cthat was done at = the instigation of . . . [the respondent\u2019s wife] to keep his mother out.\u201d The petitioner now argues that the question was admissible to show \u201cthe domestic atmosphere to which the children were exposed in the respondent\u2019s custody.\u201d We think that there was no error, and that the cross-examination in this respect was within the discretion of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\">We take no cognizance of further proceedings that were said to have been entered in the Probate Court after the entry of the appeal now before us, which apparently are still pending in that court. <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>264 Mass. 40, 41-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
