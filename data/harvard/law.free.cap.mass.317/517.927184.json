See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 113, and c. 214, \u00a7 3 (10). There were decrees dismissing the bills of complaint, and the plaintiffs appealed. There were no statements of findings of fact, voluntary or otherwise. The cases are here with a report of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">It is our duty to examine the evidence and reach our own conclusions. We accept findings of the trial judge where credibility of oral testimony is involved unless the findings are plainly wrong, but where there is an ultimate finding resting upon facts admitted or found, we draw our own inferences whatever may have been those of the trial judge. <em>Lowell Bar Association </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 176, 178. <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>315 Mass. 484, 490. <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corporations &amp; Taxation, </em>315 Mass. 639, 643-644.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The facts seem not to have been in dispute. On March 29, 1941, Bernardi asked Valianti if he could borrow the latter\u2019s automobile on the following morning, which was a Sunday, in order to go to Lowell to seek employment. Valianti told him that he might, provided he took good care of the automobile and brought it back by 3 p.m. The men were friends, and Valianti had allowed Bernardi to take the automobile on previous occasions. Early on Sunday morning Bernardi drove the automobile from East Boston to Lowell and returned at once without seeing the person he wanted to see. In Chelsea by appointment he met a Miss Rowe who was unknown to Valianti. She had no license to operate an automobile but had attended an \u201cauto school\u201d during the preceding two weeks with a view to taking an examination for an operator\u2019s license. After driving to the Suffolk Downs race track, Bernardi entrusted the operation of the automobile to Miss Rowe and sat on the front seat with her. Miss Rowe drove around the track two or three times \u201cto see how she could handle the car,\u201d and then drove to Revere for breakfast. Thereafter with Bernardi still on the front seat she drove for at least two hours to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where at 11:30 a.m., as a result of her negligent operation, the female plaintiff was injured and the male plaintiff\u2019s automobile was damaged. Had it not been for this mishap the automobile would have been returned to Valianti by 3 p.m. Bernardi\u2019s purpose throughout was to see whether Miss Rowe could drive well enough to take the examination for a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The policy of insurance, among other things, contained a promise to pay \u201con behalf of the insured\u201d sums he should become obliged to pay by reason of liability for bodily injuries to persons \u201coff the ways of the Commonwealth\u201d (\u201cCoverage B\u201d) and for property damage (\u201cCoverage C\u201d). The policy also provided, \u201cThe unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 wherever used in coverages B and C . . . includes not only the named insured but also any person while using the motor vehicle . . . provided . . . the actual use is with permission of the named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In his answers Valianti admitted allegations in the bills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>of complaint that the use of the automobile in Portsmouth was with his permission. The insurance company-in its answers denied these allegations. \u201cPleadings shall not be evidence on the trial, but the allegations therein shall bind the party making them.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 87. This section applies to equity cases. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 144. The admissions in Valianti\u2019s answers bind him. <em>Markus </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., ante, </em>1, 7, and cases cited. But they do not bind the insurance company. Compare <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>314 Mass. 67, 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"AVqC\">The decrees dismissing the bills of complaint were rightly entered on the evidence. Even if we assume in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor that the permission was for use of the automobile anywhere until 3 p.m. and was not merely for a trip to Lowell, such permission did not embrace an authorization to do what actually was done. A practice drive by an unlicensed novice as the operator, even though Bernardi- was present, was not a \u201cuse\u201d of the automobile by Bernard! \u201cwith permission of the named insured\u201d within the terms of the policy. <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>291 Mass. 432, 436. See <em>Woznicki </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>299 Mass. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">n - .., . <em>Decrees affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
