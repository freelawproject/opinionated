The declaration in this action of tort alleges negligence in construction and in permitting accumulation of \u201cwater and mud, and other debris.\u201d At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s opening the judge directed a verdict, for the defendant and reported the case to this court. We assume that the statements of fact, both specific and general, in the opening were true and would have been substantiated by testimony. <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>316 Mass. 556. <em>Waugh </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., ante, </em>230. On Saturday, December 13, 1941, about 5 p.m. the plaintiff approached the defendant\u2019s store at the corner of Washington and Avon streets, Boston. The \u201centrance is recessed in back and cuts across, cat-a-corner across that sidewalk . . . [and] sets back a little way, and there are either three or four- revolving doors back in that are at least partly covered overhead.\u201d It was raining. There had been \u201csome snow\u201d the day before, and on the morning of the day in question \u201cit had snowed and stopped, and then snowed a little more\u201d; at 3 p.m. it rained, and then stopped \u201cfor a very few minutes\u201d; about 3:45 p.m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>it \u201cstarted in again\u201d and \u201crained the rest of the day.\u201d As the plaintiff started into the entrance and \u201cwas about to take her hand\u201d to push the revolving door, \u201cboth feet slipped because of the mud on the entrance, they went out from under her at the same time,\u201d and she fell on her shoulders and the back of her neck and head. \u201cThe place where she fell was muddy and wet, there was a coating of yellow mud.\u201d After her fall the mud was \u201call over her hand,\u201d and her stockings and the back of her coat throughout its entire length were \u201ccovered with mud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The verdict for the defendant was rightly directed. There was nothing to show negligence in construction or in any other respect. There was no statement of expected testimony indicating the omission of any reasonable precaution or disclosing the presence of mud and water in larger quantity or for a greater length of time than was naturally to be expected in the circumstances. The case falls within the authority of numerous decisions. <em>Moors </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>305 Mass. 81, 83, and cases cited. <em>Battista </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co., ante, </em>179. To the extent that <em>MacLaren </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>197 Mass. 490, is in conflict with what is here decided, it is not followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
