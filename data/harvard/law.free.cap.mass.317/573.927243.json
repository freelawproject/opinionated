Edwards as executor of the will of Margaret Edwards against the same defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b628-9\">Qua, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae2F\">The first of these actions, in the order in which both parties have dealt with them, is to recover for injury to the plaintiff\u2019s automobile and for medical and hospital expenses incurred in behalf of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, all as the result of a collision between an automobile owned and driven by the plaintiff and an automobile driven by the defendant in Oxford on November 15, 1941. The second action is for the death of the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix, who was his mother, alleged to have resulted from the same accident. In each action there was a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">The accident happened on \u201cthe Worcester-Oxford highway,\u201d which was straight, level, and between thirty and forty feet in width. It was dark and \u201ckind of misty,\u201d and \u201cthe place of the accident was dark.\u201d The plaintiff was driving in a westerly direction toward Oxford. His wife and mother were riding with him. The defendant, who had been travelling in the same direction, had stopped to eat at a roadside restaurant located off the southerly side of the highway, and was returning to the way to resume his journey when the collision occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">The only issues argued by the defendant are whether, in the first action, the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, and whether, in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>action, there was any evidence that the death of the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix was caused by the accident. We confine ourselves to these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">1. The plaintiff testified that about fifty feet from the point of contact he had \u201cgone through a green light\u201d and had then increased his speed to about twenty-five miles an hour; that he first observed the defendant\u2019s automobile, which was \u201cdark in color\u201d and \u201cwas then travelling without lights,\u201d when his own headlights shone on the defendant\u2019s hood and fender; that the defendant\u2019s automobile was then between nine and ten feet away to the plaintiff\u2019s left; that it was \u201cmoving str\u00e1ight across the highway\u201d; that the plaintiff \u201chollered,\u201d applied his brakes, and turned to his right; that it was too late to do anything because the defendant was too close; that the right front of the defendant\u2019s automobile struck the left front of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile; that the defendant \u201ccame right across and kind of hit the plaintiff\u2019s car on the side,\u201d causing the latter to be pushed \u201csome distance\u201d; that when the plaintiff first saw the defendant\u2019s automobile, its rear end was \u201cin the middle of the road \u2014 across the road\u201d; and that \u201cthe defendant was at a right angle with the road.\u201d The defendant testified that before entering the highway he noticed that the traffic signal at his right was \u201cred for west bound traffic\u201d; that he observed the headlights of an automobile about two hundred fifty feet away at his right; that when he stopped at the restaurant his headlights had not been turned on because it was not then dark, but that they were on when he reentered the highway; and that by the time of the collision he had \u201cstraightened his car out so that he was nearly parallel with the center of the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">It seems plain that upon conflicting evidence the jury could find that the accident was caused solely by the defendant\u2019s driving his dark colored automobile in darkness and mist without fights from the restaurant across the road in front of and too near to the oncoming automobile of the plaintiff, the fights of which were in plain sight, and that the judge could not rule as matter of law that negligence of the plaintiff was a contributing cause. The failure of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>tiff to see the defendant\u2019s automobile sooner than he did could be referred to its position at one side and' at a right angle, as the plaintiff testified, to the plaintiff\u2019s course, to the lack of visibility, and to the defendant\u2019s headlights not being lighted. The plaintiff would not naturally expect an unlighted vehicle to come upon him from his side across the roadway so near to him as to interfere with his continued regular progress. The burden of proving the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was upon the defendant. The circumstances of the case are very different from those in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>257 Mass. 344, cited by the defendant, or in <em>Ouillette </em>v. <em>Sheerin, </em>297 Mass. 536. They bring the case within the class of such cases as <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Moniz, </em>288 Mass. 102, <em>Langill </em>v. <em>First National Stores Inc. </em>298 Mass. 559, <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Hemingway Brothers Interstate Trucking Co. </em>299 Mass. 76, <em>Price </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>301 Mass. 260, 263-264, <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Johansson, </em>306 Mass. 466, 469-470, <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Ratnowsky, </em>311 Mass. 254, 258, and <em>McGaffee </em>v. <em>P. B. Mutrie Motor Transportation, Inc. </em>311 Mass. 730, 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">2. The evidence tending to show that the death of Margaret Edwards resulted from the accident was in substance this: She suffered a fractured zygoma, and was discharged from the hospital \u201cimproved\u201d after three weeks. Before the accident she had been \u201csickly\u201d but able to care for herself, \u201cget around all right,\u201d and go to church. Before the accident she had lived alone. Her condition was \u201cpretty good.\u201d She used to go twelve miles every week to play \u201cbeano.\u201d After the accident her condition was bad. It seemed \u201cshe could not breathe right.\u201d She never went farther than her son\u2019s house next, door and then had to be carried. She had to be helped from, room to room. She could not take care of herself after the accident, and was cared for until her death. She never got better. There was other evidence, however, that before the accident she had been sick for two or three years, eleven months of that time in bed; that she suffered from \u201cgallbladder stones,\u201d and \u201ca cardiovascular condition,\u201d had a systolic murmur, with irregular heartbeat, and \u201chad congestion of both lungs\u201d; that she had an \u201carteriosclerotic heart condition\u201d for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>she had been treated about once a month since August, 1939; and that following the accident, she did not change very much, \u201cexcept changes of . a progressive nature.\u201d She died on September 11, 1942. The death certificate showed the cause of death as angina pectoris. That \u201cwould be the culmination of the arteriosclerosis.\u201d \u2022 A medical witness who had treated her before the accident and had seen her afterwards gave his opinion that her death was \u201chastened prematurely by the accident\u201d; that \u201cthe acceleration of the condition of the heart may come not as a direct .result of trauma, but as a fear, a reaction from the trauma\u201d; that trauma in any part of the body may cause an angina attack; that the reason he made the statement that the accident hastened death was \u201cbecause in these weakened heart conditions the fright itself works on the nervous system, which may directly affect the circulation of the heart; that fright produces chest pains which may continue and aggravate the previous condition\u201d; that he believed that the trauma and injury in this case hastened her death; and that having in mind that she was eighty-one years of age, her progressive arteriosclerotic condition, the treatment he gave her, an&lt;\u00bf that the accident was an accelerating cause, he could not tell to what extent the accident shortened her life. It seems unnecessary to state further details. There was much evidence tending to show that death was caused by a progressive heart condition and that the accident had nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The evidence was unsatisfactory, but in view of testimony of persons intimate with the deceased from which the jury could have found that there was a marked deterioration in her general health immediately following the accident from which she did not recover upon leaving the hospital and which continued until her death, and in view of the definite opinion of the medical witness to whom we have already referred (an opinion which appears to have been unqualified and founded upon his personal knowledge of the whole case, notwithstanding his repeated use' of the word may in explaining it, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russ, </em>232 Mass. 58, 73-74), we think that the jury could find that the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>dent had caused the death of the testatrix at an earlier date than that at which it would have come about from other causes. Such finding is not precluded by the fact that no witness attempted to testify by just how much death had been accelerated. Recovery may be had where there is substantial ground for a finding that negligence has caused death to occur when it did, even though it would have occurred at no very remote date from other causes. <em>Wiemert </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>216 Mass. 598. <em>Brightman\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 17, 20. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Gage, </em>223 Mass. 179, 181-182. <em>Little </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Northeastern Street Railway, </em>229 Mass. 244, 246. <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>230 Mass. 536, 540-541. <em>DeMarco </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>253 Mass. 499, 506. <em>Colantueno\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 1, 4. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Ludwig, </em>292 Mass. 251, 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
