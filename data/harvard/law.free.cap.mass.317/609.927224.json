See now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 66, as appearing in St. 1943, e. 529, \u00a7 9A. Contributory negligence was not a defence. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 66. After a verdict for the plaintiff the judge entered a verdict for the defendant on leave reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The following is a summary of the significant evidence: The plaintiff was employed to wash pots and trays in' the defendant\u2019s bakery. He had never done that work before. ' One Newcomb, the defendant\u2019s president, treasurer, and clerk, who acted for the defendant in hiring the plaintiff, \u201cdidn\u2019t have much to say.\u201d He \u201cjust showed\u201d the plaintiff what work to do and how to do it and how much soap to put into the tank. Two or three weeks later the plaintiff spoke to Newcomb about a rash on his hands, and Newcomb said that the soap powder was \u201cpretty strong,\u201d and that a previous employee had had trouble with it. After that Newcomb provided rubber gloves for the plaintiff. The plaintiff had never before had \u201cthe itch that he developed at the baking company.\u201d It \u201cwent right through . . . [his] system\u201d and obliged him to go to a hospital. The soap had a base of trisodium phosphate. There was testimony by a physician specializing in industrial medicine that there is \u201cquite a percentage of people\u201d who are \u201cso called hypersensitive individuals\u201d who \u201cmany times\u201d will develop an irritation from soap powder or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>irritant; that in industry \u201cwe have a large percentage of people that suffer from a dermatitis due to chemical irritation\u201d; that that \u201cis a common situation in a good class of people\u201d and \u201cis known to be common amongst the trade\u201d; that methods of protection by means of gloves and protective ointments \u201care common in the industry\u201d; that the use of trisodium phosphate by the plaintiff would be an adequate cause for the dermatitis that he developed; and that he was \u201cfirmly convinced that this . . . [was] a typical picture of dermatitis venenata, chemical in nature, due to an irritant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\">Plainly the jury could find that the plaintiff\u2019s condition was caused by the soap powder. The point need not be labored.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">It was the defendant\u2019s common law duty to furnish the plaintiff safe materials with which to work or to warn him of any dangers of which the defendant knew or ought to have known and which were not reasonably obvious to the plaintiff. <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>New Bedford Cordage Co. </em>102 Mass. 572. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Sinclair Refining Co. </em>237 Mass. 230, 234. <em>Engel </em>v. <em>Boston Ice Co. </em>295 Mass. 428, <em>432. Roberts </em>v. <em>Frank\u2019s Inc. </em>314 Mass. 42, 45. It could have|been|found that the defendant knew or ought to have known that this \u201cstrong\u201d soap powder which had caused trouble before might cause trouble again, and that it knew or ought to have known whatever is \u201cknown to be common amongst the trade,\u201d to wit, that the soap powder was a possible source of danger to a class of persons of whom the plaintiff might be one. It is not necessary that the majority of possible employees be susceptible. It is enough if a sufficient number are susceptible so that a jury could reasonably say that the defendant ought to have known and recognized the danger of injury and ought to have guarded against it. <em>Bianchi </em>v. <em>Denholm &amp; McKay Co. </em>302 Mass. 469, 473. Compare <em>Bradt </em>v. <em>Hollaway, </em>242 Mass. 446. See <em>Payne </em>v. <em>R. H. White Co. </em>314 Mass. 63. It could also be found that the plaintiff, inexperienced in such matters, did not know the strength of the soap powder or that danger of poisoning lurked in it, and that the defendant ought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>have realized that the plaintiff was not likely to know. All the conditions of the work were open and obvious, except the crucially important one that the soap used in the quantity used was dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\">It follows that the jury could find that the plaintiff did not contractually assume the risk, and that the defendant was negligent. <em>Dulligan </em>v. <em>Barber Asphalt Paving Co. </em>201 Mass. 227, 232. <em>Maddox </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>218 Mass. 55. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>United Laboratories Co. </em>221 Mass. 276. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Old Colony Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 333. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Sinclair Refining Co. </em>237 Mass. 230. <em>Cronan </em>v. <em>Armitage, </em>285 Mass. 520. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>290 Mass, 448. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Canadian Imperial Dry Inc. </em>296 Mass. 80. <em>Cotoia </em>v. <em>Seale, </em>306 Mass. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are sustained. The verdict for the defendant entered by the judge is set aside, and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff on the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
